The social card of residents of Ivanovo region is to be recognised as an electronic payment instrument.
These changes make allowances for the preservation of discounted travel on public transportation.
Starting on September 24, the organisation of discounted travel for citizens of Ivanovo region using the social card will change.
The press service for the Government of Russia for Ivanovo region reports that the changes make allowances for the preservation of discounted travel on public transportation and introduce a system of mutual settlements on the social card in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 "On the National Payment System".
Moreover, the social card of residents of Ivanovo region is to be recognised as an electronic payment instrument.
Accordingly, the conditions of its use will change.
For example, the loading limit is no longer set according to trips as before, but rather according to an amount of money; and the winter and summer periods will be maintained: in the winter, it will be no more than 400 roubles, and, in the summer, no more than 800 roubles for a given month.
Now, when they are issued a transit receipt, social card holders will need to keep track of the balance of funds on the card and not the number of remaining trips.
The cost of discounted travel for citizens will amount to 1/2 the fare of the applicable carrier.
The other half of the fare will be paid for from the regional budget.
The schedule for topping up the social card with funds will stay the same: during the period between the 24th of the previous month through to the 23rd of the current month.
The new procedure for travelling with a social card will have a number of advantages.
For example, it becomes possible to conduct detailed accounting of the expenditure of funds on the social card down to the last kopeck.
Moreover, it becomes possible to refund loaded but unspent funds.
It's also worth noting that the system of mutual settlements with carriers will become transparent, since a citizen now pays for half of the fare, and the carrier will be reimbursed in the exact same amount from the budget.
No commission fee will be charged for loading funds onto the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Public Roads and Transportation for Ivanovo region, reported that more than 33 million trips had been made using the social card in 2014, and, in 2015, almost 25 million trips.
More than 470 million roubles have been set aside in the regional budget for the discounted travel of citizens using the social card.
As of September 1, the total spent for this purpose amounted to more than 312 million roubles.
In 911 Call, Professor Admits to Shooting Girlfriend
In a 911 call, his voice only slightly shaky, college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house.
Lamb made a point to say his "sweet dog" was there alive and probably upset, and said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone.
Inside the home, officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a hand-written note scribbled on a white legal pad: "I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that.
By the end of the day, there would be one more death: Lamb took his own life as police closed in on him.
A day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb.
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
Students said they looked forward to his class.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the "wonderful people" he shared his academic life with.
Both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History, which lists 17 faculty members, and many students took courses from both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations of problems.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and jittery, "like there was something wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence, saying he had a health issue of some sort.
This year, he was only teaching two online classes.
Recent changes in the university's hiring policies meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."
Those are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing the campus, police later picked up Lamb's trail when he crossed back into Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be apprehended, Lamb killed himself with a single .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that home, though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
He received a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as smart, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar.
He was quite the heartthrob back then.
All the girls would melt when he was around," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In the 911 call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no record of them ever marrying.
They had a dog named Lightning that lived with them at the brick house that backs up to a bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was OK.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who's now 19.
"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
Later, they played together in the occasional gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss the night of Sept. 5, after Lamb had finished playing his guitar and harmonica for a sparse crowd.
There was no sign of anything amiss.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cutting up and throwing one-liners at each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of wit about them.
Schmidt, the slain professor, directed the first-year seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government.
On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students, and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Classes resume Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lamb made the 911 call after shooting Schmidt, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the 911 call, there is no indication the two ever married.
Toys R Us Plans to Hire Fewer Holiday Season Workers
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many holiday season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people to work at stores and distribution centers around the country, down from the 45,000 hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will start interviewing applicants this month, with staff levels rising from October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, holiday shopping season is drawing closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to help them staff stores and sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox Jokes About His 'Date' With Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
It was noteworthy because of personal reasons, too.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals to come in and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it dawns on me that Princess Diana is going to be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The movie starts and it occurs to me that I'm a fake yawn and an arm stretch away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis, and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It really is for me," said Spielberg, "inarguably the greatest time travel movie ever put on film."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select movie theaters Oct.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's stepped up military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people.
The U.N. chief again urged all parties, including the divided U.N. Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unsolvable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis.
8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real
Some have tried to label him a flip-flopper.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
And some are holding out for an implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from atop the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's lead at double digits, and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mogul's nomination chances.
Of course, it's still early in the election cycle.
None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Pundits point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead was giving way to a rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing Trump's staying power and beginning to unload their dollars to topple him.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn't just a passing phase:
Trump's favorability ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view.
And these numbers hold up in early states.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were the nominee.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same of Trump).
The next closest in enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the flip side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of leaned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll.
The same number holds in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and almost six in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their pundit hats, Republican voters think Trump is for real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll out last week.
That's a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time last cycle, four in 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry to win the nomination, vs. only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney.
Still, it shows that a plurality of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some pundits point out that the splintered field is likely contributing to Trump's lead, while anti-Trump support is be spread diffusely among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that, in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always garners majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and, finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead heat with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head.
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say they would never change their mind.
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech two months ago, immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation.
Some are worried that Trump's bombast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.
But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems Donald Trump will remain too.
Frustration with government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters, largely due to their outsider status.
Six in 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience.
And they are angry at Washington, too.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa from two weeks ago shows that three in four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "mad as hell."
The Government will decide the fate of pension indexing in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets stated that the government is now looking at approaches to implementing the law on indexing pensions in 2016 to the real rate of inflation, reports Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
She noted that a solution must be found by October 8: by the time the draft budget for next year is introduced in the government.
Furthermore, the Cabinet of Ministers is discussing the possibility of prolonging the decision to freeze the funded pensions of Russian citizens.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings equals 350 billion roubles.
The indexation of pensions in full for next year costs approximately the same amount.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is still no final decision on the matter of who ought to pay contributions for unemployed citizens.
Golodets believes that if a person is not working as a result of their own choice, and, at the same time, they do not belong to the socially vulnerable categories of citizens, then it is not entirely fair that society should pay for them.
Earlier, the media reported that the Cabinet of Ministers was considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why do eyelids often become irritated and red?
Ophthalmologist, Tatiana Levashova, answers:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
When forgetting to regularly clean our eyelids, often we ourselves contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The solution is simple:
do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, and carry a special moist cloth with you for your eyelids;
at least 1-2 times a day, clean the edges of the lid from the harmful substances that have accumulated on them over the course of the day.
It is useful to compliment these cleaning procedures with warm compresses that contain an infusion of medicinal herbs (sage, camomile), which thin out the thick secretions from the sebaceous glands, followed by a massage of the edges of the lids using the fingertips in circular movements;
when removing make-up, don't use products that contain alcohol.
They dry out and dehydrate the skin and contribute to the further thickening of secretions from the sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear experts have created an atomic warhead.
North Korean authorities have reported that the country's main nuclear reactor - the nuclear complex in Yongbyon - is running "at full capacity".
A statement about this appeared on the website of the country's Central News Agency.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any moment to respond to the "aggression and nuclear threat from the USA", and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "in terms of both quantity and quality".
North Korean authorities conducted their most recent nuclear weapons test in 2013.
Moreover, since that time, no plans to resume full operation of the reactor had been reported.
Pyongyang claims that it has managed to produce a nuclear warhead.
Furthermore, the DPRK has never conducted a test of mid or short-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demands that references to fraternal peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
LDPR leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, believes that references to the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He spoke about this during a session of the State Duma, reports the Russian News Service.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
"It's a very long anthem: the longest in the world. Even athletes can't get through it all", said Zhirinovsky.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all quatrains that contain this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky stated that the current anthem should be changed to "God Save the Tsar", and that the Russian tricolour be replaced by the Imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad has called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to address the problem of refugees, then they should stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The issue is not whether Europe accepts or doesn't accept refugees, but that it is necessary to address the root causes of this problem.
If Europeans are troubled by the fate of refugees, then they should stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the crux of the refugee problem", he said in an RT interview.
We must continue dialogue in the name of reaching a consensus.
However, if we want real success, then this is impossible while people are dying, while the bloodshed continues, and while people don't feel entirely safe.
"So, we can reach a consensus, but we cannot implement anything until we have defeated terrorism in Syria", emphasised Assad.
To recap, around 500 thousand migrants have arrived in the countries of the European Union this year, including those from Syria.
The European Commission stated that the current global migration crisis is the largest since the Second World War.
It cannot be ruled out that thousands of fighters from the extremist group, Islamic State, could be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of the terrorist organisation, which is banned in Russia, could take advantage of the situation in order to establish cells to conduct terrorist activities in the EU.
Residents of a German city organise a celebration for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has emerged as the leader for accepting refugees, although it recently strengthened border controls to curb the influx of them.
According to the authorities, around 800 thousand migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts cite significantly higher figures.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90 thousand refugees have already arrived in the country.
Jenny Hill, a BBC correspondent, visited the city of Darmstadt, where residents offered migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn to make debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been keenly awaited
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, taking on David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six allotted questions shortly after midday, with his performance likely to be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs.
He has called for "less theatre and more facts" at the weekly showpiece.
He has also said he could skip some sessions, leaving them to colleagues.
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and did recognise the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "irrespective" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences over the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are also "stacking up" within Labour following Mr Corbyn's appointment over its position on the European Union and the government's cap on benefits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Hours later Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the party was "very clear" that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the despatch box over the past decade since he became Tory leader.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has "crowd sourced" ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said PMQs is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both "repartee" and trading barbs, instead vowing to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will deputise for him at PMQs when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying he had approached the Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics often associated with PMQs but admitted some years later that he had failed.
Since it was first televised in 1990, PMQs has been seen as a key barometer of a leader's judgement, their command of the Commons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a caricature and is in need of far-reaching reforms.
'Shot in Joburg': Homeless youth trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to be homeless.
But one group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and make a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youngsters how to take photographs of their neighbourhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News went to meet one of the project's first graduates.

Pound rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The pound jumped following data showing a pick-up in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led higher by bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.9% compared with the same period last year.
The rate was the fastest since 2009, and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the stand-out stock on the market, jumping 20% after it received a bid approach from rival AB InBev.
A deal would combine the world's two largest brewers, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - had begun to grow again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5bn through a share placement as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
Shares in packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest fallers on the index, down 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the firm to "sell."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear firm reported an 83% jump in half-year pre-tax profits to £46.6m.
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports Executive Chairman Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But that spending power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labour costs at his firm, he says.
The costs could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer extra jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign to fight Aldi incursion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from an Aldi onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has kicked off a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering taste testing at IGA stores and store owners selling discounted South Australian football league tickets to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the food, liquor and hardware wholesaler hosts its annual investor strategy day.
There is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
South Australian and Western Australian shoppers are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will snare around 5 per cent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss of food and grocery sales and volumes on Metcash's high fixed-cost base could cost Metcash around $13 million in earnings before interest and tax, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, even though a recent Roy Morgan survey found IGA shoppers were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food and grocery sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "highly, probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash has declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is understood that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Metcash's food and grocery business, which supplies about 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting operating deleverage as sales and margins come under pressure.
However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million a year matching shelf prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers refurbish stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and rolling out a better range of private label groceries.
Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says the price matching and store refurbishment programs are gaining traction and is hoping the wholesaler will return to underlying profit growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves kudos rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves kudos rather than criticism for his own behaviour, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the "Special Ks," was dragged into an unwelcome spotlight by the infamous Kyrgios sledge of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the chair umpire, with Harrison declaring: "Wawrinka should've decked Kyrgios, and I should deck that kid."
While he was last seen smashing a racquet after cramp foiled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis has been defended staunchly by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the second singles berth behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"One thing I do feel quite keenly about is I think Thanasi's been dragged into the fray a little bit," Healy said.
He did break a racquet when he lost when he cramped in the US, but he's not the first player to break a racquet out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of that.
But, really, he's handled himself extremely well, in pretty provocative circumstances in the US with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's a great team around him, he's got a great family around him and I just think he's been a little hard done by.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in with the team and so on, he hasn't ever had an issue with the other players, he's well respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he's in great shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios for the important tie, starting on Friday, describing the "mutual decision" as the right thing for all, but backing the Canberran to return as a long-term fixture in the team.
"First of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick, he's risen very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he's growing up in the public eye and he's made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the limelight where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe migrant crisis: Hungary declares emergency, seals border, detains migrants
Declaring a state of emergency, Hungary sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those trying to enter illegally, aiming to shut down the flow of migrants pouring in.
Chaos ensued at the border, as hundreds of migrants piled up in a no man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
Stuck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries' checkpoints, those fleeing violence in their homelands pitched tents and settled in.
But frustrations were on the rise.
As a police helicopter hovered above, migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declared it was "unacceptable" that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
There will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
The ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overwhelmed Italy and Greece and spoke hopefully of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 120,000 more refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, was not pinning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a razor-wire fence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were enlisted in the race to finish the razor wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for migrants, many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life, not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU nations, including Germany.
The new laws that took effect at midnight in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) razor-wire fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of crisis," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, parliament must still approve the deployment of the military, expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, homeland security adviser to Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country.
They got across by damaging the fence, are now in police custody and are being charged with committing offenses under the new laws.
Authorities are quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deploying a train car covered with razor wire to close one of them.
Chaos enveloped the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crowds pressed to squeeze inside.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary, saying they were refusing food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders cut by half in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining on her.
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders comes in second, with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the primary contests, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News Poll, Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates, but those leads have narrowed.
Her support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders only trails her by 5 points.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now even.
However, Clinton still has a large lead with older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-digits among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point edge with this group.
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee.
Six percent would not support her.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her.
Views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically back Clinton, fewer Republican voters say that about their frontrunner, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her to be the nominee, the top answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by it's time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Agreement on the issues, and electability are also cited.
As the vice president weighs a potential run for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third don't think he should.
When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party's nomination, Biden is the top pick.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders widens, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month.
Biden is a distant second on this measure, but the percentage that sees him as the most electable has risen.
Still, when asked which is more important in a nominee, Democratic voters pick issues over electability.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters.
The Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, perform well on some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and as having strong leadership qualities.
Biden does the best of the three on honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion of him on this.
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as in line with their views ideologically.
On all of these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn't impacted their overall views of her.
But it's a different story among the American public overall.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while just about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on this were split back in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have become worse.
Even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think of her as honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks on leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush do the best on honesty.
More see Sanders as honest than not, but like Carson, many don't have an opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson draws close behind Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson is running close behind Donald Trump in the newest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll, leaving others scrounging for a foothold
Republican voters nationwide continue to back Trump in large numbers, climbing from 23% support in the last CBS poll, conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% in the poll out Tuesday.
But Carson rocketed in that same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found Carson doing well across demographic groups, edging out Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, has slipped behind with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker falling farthest from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio all tied for third place with 6%.
The margin of error for the 376-person sample of Republican voters in this newest poll is plus-or-minus 6%, and was conducted Sept.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, released last week, showed Carson rising in the polls -- landing at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson.
Facing a rising Carson last week, Trump took some potshots at the retired neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years after a college student died during a fraternity hazing ritual in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, murder charges have been filed against five people.
Members of New York City's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation rite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded, saddled with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that his head hurt then fell unconscious.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng passed out, and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital, police say.
They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president to seek advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, members began to hide paraphernalia and basically put the fraternity's well-being over that of Michael Deng's," Chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived and he died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head, torso, and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of fraternity hazing, with at least one student dying every year from hazing since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, an attorney representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is an important one.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault hazing and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only the individuals involved, but if there's an organization that sanctioned it, whether officially or unofficially, we're going to hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity revoked its affiliation with the local chapter.
Here's what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession.
This we know.
What we don't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last.
For the economy specifically, history offers little guide about timing.
A recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, a determinant in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That's why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to normalize.
There are, indeed, multiple variables at play.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the rate-hike fuss may have been overdone.
"The first hike from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of 'cheap money,' " Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
That's not to say there won't be effects, however.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the hike hits, though, the impact is not as dramatic.
"It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12-24 months after the first hike, which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes.
More specifically, the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent) then back to normal once 500 days have passed, with average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, posted on Barron's.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rate-hiking cycle and returns begin to diminish.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help them along.
In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could hasten a recession.
Most notably, gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice has nominal year over year GDP been below 4.5 percent.
Even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, few expect that to last, with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Hiking rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants have been bracing for a Fed hike all year, with all eyes turned toward this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a hike at this meeting, futures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all hiking cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP eclipsing prerecession peaks very quickly post the recovery commencing," the report said.
By contrast this has been a uniquely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and this is 74 months and counting.
Fixed income also has been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience.
The principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy.
For bonds, it does seem yields change direction immediately as the first hike/cut in the cycle arrives.
At the end of the hiking cycle bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between longer- and shorter-dated bonds to move closer together, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds often perform better in such a climate, though "we are still cautious about stretching for yield," Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly speaking, companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinationals with lots of debt will fare worse, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to outperform during the three months following an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outpaced weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994, 1999, and 2004 rate hikes, by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also outperformed their lower quality counterparts, by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become a big issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside pure stock plays, consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains as well through higher yields at the, though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised station for 'dumbing down'
Argues it's becoming increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rival
Also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying they just rip off the Brits
Colleague Damien Collins MP attacked The Voice, saying that too wasn't original
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, a leading MP has claimed, piling fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcasters do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be "dumbing down" and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "dumbing down" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Brits by another name.
So, if you're trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you're actually just mimicking what is already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
BBC director general denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else.
And it's commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none.
"And also, Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works I think is also really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past, because Britons are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC's output which came under fire for treading on the toes of commercial rivals, during the Culture, Media and Sport select committee hearing.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22million.
Can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a particularly BBC way."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from our own in-house stable" next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future, or spending licence fee payers' money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased at slowest ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame
First three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
Last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
Online sales bolstered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
Experts believe November's Black Friday could be holding back spending
For over a decade virtual shopping has been booming and turning many of Britain's high streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are leveling off, after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with just a five per cent rise on last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are leveling off, after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
'If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000, it was always going to rationalise over time,' Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now that is plateauing a bit, you might see (growth) fall away.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which has been imported from America, is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales.
Experts believe shoppers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November .
Last year five times the average number of shoppers flocked to their computers to snap up deals crashing a number of retailers websites.
Experts believe Black Friday, which saw shoppers fight over bargains, could be holding shoppers off from making purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found just over £1 in every £5 was being spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online, rather than using high street fashion chains.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane crash as Bin Laden family sanctioned
Bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first funerals take place in Mecca
Come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Health Ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed down
Carried aloft through the streets, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand mosque.
Dressed largely in white, mourners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad possession passed by the holy site, where just days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled onto worshipers.
The bodies were released for funeral as the Saudi King sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 of the worshipers killed when a crane crashed collapsed at Mecca's Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was father-of-four Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.
Mr Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already vowed that the hajj to Mecca will go ahead with thousands continuing to descend on the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane's arm up when it was not in use.
An Arabic version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The news agency's English service did not report that detail, but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to topple into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have converged ahead of the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not released any statements about the crane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment.
The royal decree also blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and failing to coordinate with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque, part of the massive construction effort headed by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and runs major building projects.
Al Qaida's late leader Osama bin Laden was a renegade son disowned by the family in the 1990s.
The crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.
Officials ordered one million riyals (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of those killed, and the same amount to those permanently injured.
Others injured will receive half that amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European tradesmen working cheap is behind trend
Britons are increasingly employing handymen says Veronique Laury
Number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe behind rise
Resulting in 200 more Screwfix stores, aimed at tradesmen, opening
At same time Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q outlets across the country
By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail
Britons are said to be putting down their hammers and paintbrushes in favour of employing skilled Eastern European tradesmen to carry out work in their home
If you are handy with a hammer or a whizz at painting walls, it seems you are in the minority these days.
Because Britons are increasingly employing handymen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the home improvement chain, said a big rise in the number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe offering services at rock-bottom prices is behind the trend.
As a result, Kingfisher is planning to open 200 more Screwfix stores, which are aimed at tradesmen, while closing 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wants more women to be employed in B&Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex.
Currently the majority of staff are men.
She said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "We still have a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to move more towards a balance.
Fundamentally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women.
Women play a big part in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain's FTSE100 index of leading firms, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors.
Kingfisher is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staffed by women, including its chief executive and finance director.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board.
Kingfisher posted a fall in both half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of shutting stores.
As a result of the trend Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores
Decision time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday, to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it, now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0-0.25 percent range.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has been performing relatively well, the recovery adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation.
However the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indications are they also believe the odds are against such a move.
The decision is due to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
The new Balkan route: refugees are coming into the EU through Croatia.
"Open up!" chant hundreds of refugees at the Horgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border to immigrants.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to test out other possible routes into the EU.
One of them is bypassing the closed border with Serbia through Romania.
Another is through Croatia and Slovenia into Austria.
According to some reports, the buses that transported refugees from Serbia into Hungary are now being sent to the town of Šid on the Croatian border.
The drivers have received orders from the authorities to carry on without stopping.
Serbian Minister of Internal Affairs Nebojša Stefanović pledged that his country was doing everything in its power to help the refugees, but that it had limited resources:
Our job entails protecting Serbia to the greatest extent possible.
On the other hand, we should also help these people, make sure that they are treated humanely.
But this has already become a Europe-wide problem.
It will not be easy to solve; no country in Europe can deal with it on its own, especially such a small country as Serbia.
Belgrade is asking Budapest to open its border to the refugees who don't want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is uncompromising:
If someone is claiming to be a refugee, they ought to fill-out the necessary documents for this in Serbia.
And if they don't do this, then they will not be permitted to enter our country, because it is completely safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometre fence along the border with Serbia.
But Orban is not content to stop there: he plans on erecting a similar fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already declared that this is incompatible with European principles.
Evangelos Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us".
For a number of years, Evangelos Meimarakis was part of the centre-right government, which, according to those on the left, led the country into a financial crisis.
Now, having become the interim leader of the New Democracy party, he is mounting a challenge to Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist from Euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Evangelos Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat, losing to the SYRIZA coalition, but now, judging from the polls, New Democracy has matched it in terms of popularity.
What has changed since that time?
Evangelos Meimarakis: Greece has changed and we have too.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January of last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
Now, the country once again has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
Investors have fled because Mr. Tsipras chased them away.
Over the past nine months, Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the state the country was in in January and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
Now, they can easily compare these promises to what has actually transpired.
Daily life has become noticeably worse compared to in January, when the situation was getting better; moreover, this concerned the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the election you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Evangelos Meimarakis: The fact is that Greece, as we have come to understand in recent years, cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all the other countries where rescue programmes were in effect or continue to operate, political forces and all the ruling parties got together in order to implement the programme that they had reached a consensus on, while, at the same time, never abandoning their political or ideological independence.
That's why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutes will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If, on Monday, you become the new Prime Minister, will you comply with this agreement, or will you change it, at least in part?
Evangelos Meimarakis: Actually, we voted for Greece to move along the European path, because we understand all too well the devastating consequences that would have followed the country's withdrawal from the EU.
Right now, Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products; we have cohesion funds, and a Juncker package, and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost if there was no agreement with Europe.
But the current austerity measures are the result of how Mr. Tsipras conducted negotiations.
I know that Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Therefore, if Europe sees that the new Greek government, over the course of their first year in power, wants to restore order, acts rationally, and makes it understood that the country has the strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am confident that all of the assumed commitments, which cannot be implemented due to the fact that they are leading to a recession, could once again become a subject of negotiations, but only after a certain amount of time has passed.
It would be a mistake to assume that we could already go back to the negotiating table with our creditors in the first year of the new agreement, since they expect a full implementation of the deal.
If we want to regain their trust, we need to continue with privatisation, reforms, and the structural changes that were agreed on, while continuing to benefit from EU funding and greater investment opportunities, which we need to go ahead with to ensure better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government didn't present any compelling arguments about many key political issues, which we found out about while discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example associated with farmers' incomes.
We explained to our European partners that we weren't talking about a fixed monthly income, and, as such, it couldn't be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that Tsipras' ministers never spoke about this.
That is to say, the Greek ministers were not prepared and were poorly informed, and, as a result, they conducted negotiations ineffectively and concluded a bad agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table as Mr. Juncker, Mr. Hollande, Ms. Merkel, and other European leaders.
Will what you say to them differ in any way from what your predecessor, Anthony Samaras, said to them?
Evangelos Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that, up until the end of 2014, we tried our best to fulfil the 2012 agreement, while avoiding the most contentious issues contained within it.
We pushed forward with reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we were operating under extraordinary circumstances.
The market crashed, and there were no prospective buyers in sight ready to pay the price the Greek government considered acceptable.
Back then, I was the parliamentary speaker and I succeeded in balancing the views of the three parliamentary groups, which, at that time, constituted a parliamentary majority.
In spite of their significant ideological disagreements on key bills, we had a working parliament, and this was in the midst of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations happening outside.
And we managed to guide the country to a state of normalcy, which would have continued to get better if the process had not been interrupted by early general elections that were the consequence of the December presidential election.
Euronews: Over the past weeks, a massive flow of refugees has been moving across Greek territory.
What do you think about this situation, and about the reaction of the European countries into which these people are seeking to enter?
Evangelos Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a ticking time bomb that we will be forced to deal with after our election victory.
The reason for this is that the SYRIZA government didn't deal with this situation in the way that it should have.
In such matters, it pays to be proactive, because if the problem catches up with you, then you are only left with emergency measures.
And we now find ourselves in this situation.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZA has done more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am confident that the actions of the interim government, which has been provided with valuable assistance from the President of the Republic, who has called for an EU summit to be held, will enable us to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees could leave the country, and take note: refugees, not illegal immigrants.
These are victims of the war in Syria: victims of certain extreme events that have happened to them.
This issue has a deeply humanitarian aspect to it, and we will support the position that European politicians should take in this new situation.
An appropriate decision should be made at the EU summit and it should also involve the United Nations.
We need to have better coordinated actions, more effective border controls, and refugee processing centres.
We also need to effectively use the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be in a position to deal with this urgent problem.
Euronews: Mister Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Evangelos Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful town of Druzhkovka in Donetsk region, over the course of 24 hours, members of the criminal investigation department of the Main Police Directorate for the region, in cooperation with the military intelligence service, ascertained the identity of and detained a suspect, who turned out to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian serviceman from the town of Krivoy Rog (Dnepropetrovsk region), who, on the previous evening, while consuming alcohol with the victim, and, in the process of the development of a conflict in the village of Verkhnetoretsky in the Yasinovatsky district of Donetsk, fired from an automatic weapon at his adversary.
News about the injured 22-year-old young man came from the hospital where he was admitted for gun shot wounds to his legs.
Artem Vasitsky, Deputy Chief of the Criminal Investigation Department for the central regional police, recounts how, during the course of the investigation, law enforcement officials established the involvement of the suspect in another serious indictable offence: the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
Investigators established that, on that very same day, a conflict occurred between the suspect and another local resident, which resulted in him firing a fatal gunshot to the man's head.
Criminal proceedings, under the articles "premeditated murder" and "intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm" of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, have been filed by the investigative department for Druzhkovka city district.
The detained man faces up to 15 years in prison.
The person of interest is in custody and is being held in a temporary detention centre, the Donetsk region police press service reported.
Two residents of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments, including two Vladimir Lenin monuments, in the colours of the Ukrainian flag, have been sentenced by a Russian court to prison terms.
Another two city residents were given supervised release sentences.
The residents of Novosibirsk that were given prison terms were sentenced to 2.5 and 2 years imprisonment.
The two other sentenced individuals received supervised releases of 14 and 18 months.
The Novosibirsk Leninsky Court found the four citizens guilty of vandalism in relation to the Lenin monuments, which were located on the territory of the regional committee of the CPRF and on Trikotazhnaia Street, as well as in relation to the Glory Monument memorial complex.
In the latter case, a "Katyusha" rocket launcher and T-34 tank were painted over.
To recap, on the night of December 12, in the Russian city of Novosibirsk, unknown individuals painted military equipment at the Glory Monument in the colours of the Ukrainian flag.
Irina Leonova, the common-law spouse of the popular Russian actor, Yevgeny Tsyganov, has given birth to a seventh child.
The girl was born in a Moscow clinic.
The newborn girl and her mother are feeling well.
To recap, Tsyganov and Leonova recently split up.
Yevgeny declined to comment.
Irina blames everything on her husband and his ambition.
Yevgeny Tsyganov is 36 years old.
He is an actor with Moscow's Peter Fomenko Workshop theatre.
He is known for the films "The Walk", "Space as Presentiment", "Brest Fortress", and for the television series "The Thaw" and "Fartsa".
On September 8, Yevgeny Tsyganov was recognised as "Actor of the Year" and "Person of the Year" by the Russian version of the popular magazine GQ.
Delta State University shooter left note of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished he "could take it back," authorities revealed Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Miss. said Lamb, a geography and social science education instructor at Delta State University, called 911 around 10 a.m.
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that police needed to send officers over to his home.
He said "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that is "not going to bother anyone" but is likely upset.
Police asked the caller his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb did not provide an explanation for the shooting.
When police got to the scene they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, that said: "I am so sorry I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, before eventually taking his own life late Monday as cops closed in.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."
Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" of a "love triangle."
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "devastated."
He said Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked an online job from her home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified as a close friend of Prentiss by the Sun Herald.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hound dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had phoned relatives at some point Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When cops caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled his car over, bailed out on foot, ran into the woods and shot and killed himself.
Lamb received a doctorate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to his resume posted on the university's website.
Stars who lost their mojo
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a stressful few years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, he lost long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor has also reportedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008, he was busted for drug possession.
All that stuff sure does take a toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw out for months with double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this left the full-back in tears and will rule him out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains hopeful Shaw could play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had burst into the PSV area.
He had nine minutes of treatment on the pitch and required oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It is awful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very difficult and then plays fantastically and then this happens.
When it was in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I am not a doctor but when you have a double fracture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spot-kick.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not penalise the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian official had erred.
You can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad tackle with two legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you everyone for your messages, words can't describe how gutted I am, my road to recovery starts now, I will come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffer Luke Shaw blow in defeat at PSV
The England defender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury."
If any player goes off with this kind of injury, everybody is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"He finds it very difficult because the intention was not to injure the opponent, and when you hear it is a very bad injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn't see the tackle on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I am so sorry.
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better than this?
It's one thing any parent soon learns: when your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless, it seems, you are David Cameron.
Asked by a provider of holiday childcare schemes to name his favourite kids' book, the prime minister opted for The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fable by Dr Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message published on the website of the SuperCamps company, continuing: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed."
All very well, except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a précis of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and detail to pad out the fairly brief original text.
"Set in the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," it reads, chronicling a love interest unknown to Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If that wasn't suspicious enough, Cameron's submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the Lorax film provided on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey."
Given he is an avowedly hands-on parent, it seems unlikely Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book's plot, in which a young unnamed boy hears how the local environment was devastated by the avaricious, tree-chopping, thneed-knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squat, moustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively lowly PR task would have been outsourced to an aide, seemingly one who has never read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was believed to have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron's staff, but had no further immediate comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of England omission but it's still tough
Taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough assignment but after seeing the squad England have selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me.
I wouldn't rule out an away win, either.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that batting lineup and the collective mindset is strong; they will not carry scars from 2012, only a youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, represents an attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on output.
There were no question marks over Joe Root, for example, leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selectors.
A couple of half-centuries and Lyth might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he punches out more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come along.
The England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me; he is a team man above all else.
The question of how long a Test batsman gets to make his mark is a tough one.
Lyth got seven caps - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance home and away.
The only gripe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean first - when Lyth was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now.
Alex Hales comes in and he is a batsman I rate highly.
He is an X-factor cricketer, which we at Yorkshire saw early this season when he made 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch that was doing a bit.
He must at least be afforded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make-up of the side in the UAE.
The idea of Moeen opening the batting alongside Cook, which would get the extra spinner in while keeping four quicks, has been floated and it is not something I am against.
I don't see why a strokemaker cannot bat there and this left-hander has already shown he is one hell of a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done the job for his county, Worcestershire, but he has been a No3 for them and there is not much difference.
My old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001.
He peeled off three centuries immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner and, in my limited dealings with him, he has struck me as very impressive young man.
People may look at his raw stats - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt but there are not a heap of spinners putting their hands up and selectors have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Away from the squad, England look to have made a couple of shrewd additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the game's loveliest blokes, who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless streak into the setup.
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket, be it playing or coaching, and like Mahela has nous that can be tapped.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before, can freshen up a side.
Colly's Durham team-mate Ben Stokes is rested for the one-dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this.
While not everyone will agree, the coaches and selectors do not set the schedule.
And you have to remember, like players, their jobs are dependent on results.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
Brexit camp might win the day if economy is in doldrums by 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes, even without the election of genial Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the Labour leadership, or the TUC cutting up rough over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages too.
A European diplomat chum explained the other day that, sunk in assorted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain's self-absorbed agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes which they mostly don't want.
In Brighton for its annual bean, the TUC decided it didn't want them either if they eroded social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
PM and chancellor rock up to summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local grandee, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European pal, who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously level-headed chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her, as it did for overstayers Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is a fading force too.
Poland may soon have a nationalistic government of the right, Spain one of the left.
It's hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Selfie Brits, whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately unhelpful remarks, SNP-style, during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the Brexit process, my pal suggests.
"The renegotiation was a fix" and "Britain got nothing of value out of the renegotiation."
The Europeans know to their cost how predatory Fleet Street can be and how EU-sceptic the oligarch press barons are, as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2:1.
They may dimly remember Boris Johnson, the arch Euro-opportunist, making his name as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
For all his foolishness Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
They included the medley of tax-shy rascals, phone-hacking foreigners and pseudo non-doms who own most of our great newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them, but realised that when you're in a cage with a randy gorilla you have to pass the bananas to distract it from having you for lunch and again for tea.
In fact Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposing Cameron's referendum wheeze, since Blair had conceded the principle over the EU's aborted constitution, sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get-out card.
The press never forgave him that either.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose BBC sofa he vacated on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I will kindly call evolving.
He says he'd like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukip's woad-wearing tendency and the wilder shores of Tory little Englanderism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and TV this week as the boy scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his old dad struggled on TV to be disloyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But fighting to stay in "in all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - was not what McDonnell was saying, nor what JC told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night, by all accounts.
Whatever the bottom-up, touchy-feely image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 TV and especially in the maelstrom that is social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It's fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support for granted in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic equivocation about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftwing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of doctrinal squabbles.
As with his equivocation over Nato - Tom Watson is adamant that JC won't campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be pointless?
The US is already pretty disappointed with the Brits" feeble military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Tory government in power, as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise Public Health England e-cigarettes review
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers have said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "landmark" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy foundation" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Writing in the BMJ, two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said the public would expect PHE's claims that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" would be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesise their opinions on the harms associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also endorsed BAT's public health credentials in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The rationale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided, but they include several known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PHE.
The research paper produced by the group "tellingly concedes" there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products on most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had been responded to before.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction.
All of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small by comparison, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people a year die of a smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £2bn a year.
By spelling out clearly the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national remit.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 chief
The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, saying its commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough slots against its rivals" biggest rating shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a tie-up with the BBC without success.
"I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcasts programmes that would clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords communication committee, as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you keep the licence fee, which I'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea, it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren't making and commissioning.
They broadcast The Voice in a prime slot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show that is a joke, it's ludicrous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidy.
The Voice is one, EastEnders is another, admittedly made in-house.
Frankly other channels would give their right arm for it.
I struggle to see how it's public service broadcasting.
I don't think that would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of people who work there, and because they believe that is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments about the BBC's most popular shows echo those of former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as EastEnders.
Johnson said the BBC's more niche public service programmes "go on to BBC4 where quite often you can't measure the audience but they fulfil their remit and they can argue when they go on their sanctimonious missions about justifying £4bn in licence fee income, "Well of course, we do all these obscure programmes that no one watched."
They put them on a slot where no one was ever going to watch them.
On the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the best value from it.
Of course you all think, we all think, £150 a year is great value, but for people for whom £150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they don't consume a lot of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said little of the BBC's output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV output and 0.1% on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broadcasters in Australia and Canada and change it to "inform, enlighten and entertain."
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said only a handful were shown on TV, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them all available to watch online.
'Sonogenetics' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses that are too high-pitched for humans to hear.
The pulses work by switching on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure, dubbed sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pulses into people's brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Nematode worms do not usually react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves which then pass inside the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels, found in the membranes of some of the worms" cells.
The sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the cells they are attached to, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To make ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applied ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves were amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted into the worms, where they switched on the modified motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over that technique.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down an optic fibre to the desired location inside the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered, and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull.
"We believe that, using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to make target human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The adverts shaming Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-arms fair video.
Horrific killer drones!
Ankle-shattering leg irons!
Cluster bombs!
And electric stun batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheery voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advert for the world's biggest arms fair is a sharp spoof, produced for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to flog weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International's jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also leading to many posters cropping up at bus stops and on tube trains that require a second glance.
"Important announcement, Travelling on the DLR from 15th to 18th September?" reads one, using London Underground fonts and branding with the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will be descending on the DLR ... Customers are requested to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute it around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 pack of Allen keys which it claims "gain access to around a third of bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the spoof ads produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more questioning and seeking to take political work to audiences outside galleries.
A lot of artists are moving to work with activists within protest movements, realising they have to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade posters greeting commuters on the tube.
The Amnesty video has been watched more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by ad agency VCCP working pro bono, with the graphic designer and voiceover artist also working for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the silence surrounding the advertising of the arms fair - with a blank space on ExCeL's calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."
They toyed with creating a more realistic dodgy corporate advert, but "by ramming it home with bright colours and animation, it was more arresting."
"They've done a fantastic job in helping us raise concerns about the selling of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies at Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors flog fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US army for "the shoulder-launched AT4CS RS."
This includes a "unique shaped-charge warhead that delivers outstanding behind-armour-effects inside the target."
Whatever that does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student halls
It's been 11 years since I moved into student halls as an oblivious 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now I recall the strained smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into halls can range from mildly nerve-racking to totally terrifying.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, whether and where you took a gap year, where you stand on Corbyn and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite because seriously guys it's just yeast extract HAHAHA I'll be in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others take one too - ask questions and show interest.
It steers the conversation and helps you to scout out the people you like versus those you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were dispensing extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often morph into drinks receptions, movie-night venues and communal hangout spots, but they're also where people get dressed and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting university in a relationship
Introverts get a raw deal at university.
Your room should be a retreat, yet many halls form an inter-room-strolling culture that's friendly, social and conducive to lifelong friendships.
That can be hell for someone who's trying to recharge.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I've expended on interacting with you."
Try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from socialising - and maybe text instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
One guy in my student halls had a policy that if a door wasn't locked he was invited in.
He saw some things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you're starting uni at the height of Bake-Off mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brownies seems marginally less weird, less 1950s "Welcome to the neighbourhood, I baked you something, now smile as I ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your housemates will feel obliged to chat, and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Obviously this is subject to you being a decent baker.
Poorly-fused lumps of flour, sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student halls.
Obviously nicking someones chicken is theft, but is taking a drop of milk for your tea stealing?
Double check with the milk owner.
Chances are they'll tell you to help yourself even if they're seething inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you have my sympathies - but try to deal with it more maturely than my hallmate, who tainted her milk with washing-up liquid to punish those who stole it.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying.
This isn't just to be a decent human, but because you are the proverbial people in glass houses.
A girl on my corridor asked her neighbour if they wouldn't mind turning down the drum and bass because it was 3am and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded by turning it up.
When they finally shut up at 5am, she kindly let them sleep for two hours before blasting her own music, locking her door as she left for her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same hall as you?
Conversely, wouldn't it be knuckle-bitingly awkward if you mistook a hallmate for your future spouse, hooked up, broke up and had to see them every day and possibly watch them get custody of all your mutual friends?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants - but if a hot hallmate is definitely not your future spouse, try to at least talk some sense into your groin.
In the exhilarating moment you realise someone's left their keys inside their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but takes moments to reverse.
Teach a valuable and amusing lesson about security by hiding something - but never trash someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't Blu-Tack their possessions to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: how to get new iPhone operating system, as Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by heading to the Settings app, tapping "General," and then selecting "Software Update."
If it's ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some have run into problems after that installation, being hit by an error message telling them that "Software update failed."
To get around that, users are recommended either to wait for the rush to die down, or to try and upgrade through iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
That might include deleting apps to make space - but Apple has made that less likely by slimming down the update, and also easier to do using a special tool that will suggest apps to delete and then re-install them once the process is over.
It's worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a charger while the update happens, so that it doesn't run out of battery.
If the charge is too low, Apple won't let the update go ahead, since the phone dying halfway through could lead to the update breaking.

You should also make sure that you've been through our checklist of all the things to do before you download, to try and stop things going wrong and protect against them if they do. iOS 9 brings new features including a much cleverer personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as tweaks that speed up and fix the operating system.
Washington responds to Russia's military activity with a phone call.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support that Moscow is providing to President Assad is only leading to an escalation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House isn't yet ready to talk about this with his Russian counterpart, writes PJ media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov in order to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
The publication PJ media reports on this.
"Secretary Kerry made it clear that continued support of President Assad by Russia creates a risk of exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, and also negatively impacts our common goal - combatting extremism - if we do not remain focused on finding ways to solve the Syrian conflict via a direct transfer of power", stated representatives of the US State Department.
They also noted that Kerry, once again, stressed the US's commitment to the fight against Islamic State within the framework of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of it.
Furthermore, the US "would welcome a constructive role for Russia in efforts to confront Islamic State".
Last Friday, White House officials stated that they weren't entirely sure what types of military actions Russian forces are undertaking in Syria; however, Washington intends to discuss this issue with Moscow.
Nevertheless, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet come: "When the President decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, that is when he will pick up the phone and try to make that call".
Barack Obama himself believes that Russia's decision the increase support for the Assad regime is "a losing bet".
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that it was a mistake, that continued support of Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he didn't heed my warnings, and the result is that the situation has gotten worse", the US President stated.
Imported yachts will be exempt from paying customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other watercraft for leisure or sport from paying customs duties or taxes.
The necessary changes to the list of goods eligible for temporary duty-free entry were prepared by the ministry under instructions from the government of the Russian Federation.
Yelena Lashkina, aide to the Minister of Economic Development, reported this to Izvestia.
In June 2015, as a result of a trip to Crimea, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev instructed a number of government agencies - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Customs Service, and the Federal Tourism Agency - to prepare proposals to create favourable conditions for yachting in the costal regions of the country.
In turn, experts point out that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storage, servicing, and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to store their vessels abroad: approximately €200 mln every year enters the coffers of European states for the maintenance, repair, and servicing of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft resolution of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On amendments to the List of Goods temporarily imported with full exemption from the payment of customs duties and taxes in relation to imported yachts and other watercraft used for leisure and sport".
According to the ministry, this would certainly support the creation of favourable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal regions of the country, Lashkina noted.
This matter was submitted for consideration by the sub-commission on customs tariffs, non-tariff regulation, and protective measures in foreign trade of the Governmental Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which held a meeting in September, and, following the discussion, it was also approved by the government agencies.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure for full conditional exemption at the time of importation is essentially a benefit.
Therefore, following approval of the meeting minutes of the sub-commission by the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will present the proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion by member states of the EEU, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods that are fully exempt from payment of customs duties and taxes includes goods that are necessary for facilitating foreign trade and international cooperation, for use in the fields of science, culture, film, sport, and tourism, for the provision of international aid, and others. These other goods include: office equipment (personal computers, typewriters), monitoring and measuring instruments, drilling equipment, stage costumes and sets, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, race cars, motorcycles, sport aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments, and items for religious ceremonies.
The press service for the Ministry of Transportation of the Russian Federation told Izvestia that they had prepared compulsory regulations for the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosiya, and Yevpatoriya, which provide for simplified procedures for registering the entry and departure of small-sized, sport sailboats, and recreational watercraft in the seaport.
The Ministry of Transportation has given orders to the captains of seaports in Crimea to ensure the administration of the simplified procedures for the entry of small-sized, sport sailboats, and recreational watercraft into the seaport and for the departure of the above-listed vessels from the seaport.
The Ministry of Transportation has also prepared draft decrees of the Government of the Russian Federation regarding confirmation of the water boundaries of the seaports of Crimea.
Decrees concerning Yalta and Feodosiya have already been enacted, while the others are still in the approval stage, noted the agency's press service.
It is the opinion of the Ministry of Transportation that state control, classification, inspection, and registration of small-sized vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be conducted by the Republic of Crimea and by Sevastopol.
The issue is that yachting is very difficult in Russia because of poorly developed infrastructure.
If one looks at the South of Italy or France, there is an entire and ever-growing industry, involving a large number of people.
In Russia, however, everything is at a virtual standstill.
Our coastline is not very interesting; the only part where it is possible to operate yachts year-round is in the Black Sea near Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, and Anapa.
But the big difficulty in this area is that the rules of the border service are very strict: in order to cruise in a yacht, it is necessary to register for a lot of permits.
Besides, within Russia, there isn't even anywhere to refuel.
A yacht could cruise on its fuel reserves for two days and then it will be faced with the problem of where to find more, said, Denis Novikov, Director of Sales for the company Nordmarine.
In terms of places to store yachts, there are now special docks in Moscow and Saint Petersburg that can accommodate yachts up to 30m. Yachts are also sent to Turkey, Finland, Sweden, and Germany to be stored.
Novikov noted that buyers of yachts are wealthy people, but that, since the beginning of the economic crisis, demand for yachts has declined.
The World Bank allocates a $500 mln loan to Ukraine.
The World Bank has confirmed a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 mln for development of the financial sector.
The international organisation's press service reported on this.
"The new funding will support a number priority measures for reforming the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine", the statement says.
Qimiao Fan, Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine, stated that reform of the banking sector will help to restore credit in the real economy and will stimulate a return to economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and that the World Bank has noticed the first signs of stabilisation.
However, given the seriousness of the problems, Fan urges the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish Government approved a loan of €100 mln to Ukraine, RIA Novosti reports.
Prisons are asked to create separate blocs for transgender people.
In October 2015, at the Public Council of the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for the protection of rights of convicted offenders, the possibility of creating separate blocs in penal colonies for transgender people and transvestites will be discussed among other issues.
A member of the council, Vladislav Grib, spoke to Izvestia about this.
According to him, depending on the number of prisoners in Russia who are questioning their gender identity, it may be possible to provide separate cells or blocs in domestic prisons, or even (if there are a lot of such criminals) the establishment of a special penal colony for transsexuals in the future.
However, Vladislav Grib stresses that assigning a citizen to serve out a sentence in such isolated areas would only be possible after the convicted person had gone through the necessary medical examination that proves that the criminal is actually a person who identifies themselves as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is sure that separating transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving out their sentences.
According to him, the proposed method is being successfully applied abroad: in a pre-trial detention facility (where the accused stay until the court's ruling), separate cells are made available for transgender people, and in correctional facilities there are special blocs.
Currently, this is the only way of dealing with these types of criminals.
Obviously, they need to be separated, as the presence of transvestites and transgender people in regular cells is dangerous for them: it causes suffering for their families and a sea of troubles for FSIN staff.
The humiliation of trans people by their cellmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
It's necessary to figure out where to place them, depending on how large of a city it is, and how many criminals there are that are questioning their gender identity.
Separate pre-trial detention facilities aren't necessary, just separate cells, and blocs in prisons.
Yes, a separate penal colony is a possibility if there turn out to be many transgendered people.
As Grib explains, a bloc could hold 50 or 100 people, and if one specialised building is established in Russia, then convicted transsexuals from any region could be sent there to serve out their sentences.
Citizens are held in pre-trial detention facilities according to the place where the crime was committed, and, as such, the arrival of transvestites or transgender people from different territorial subjects during the investigation and court proceedings is unrealistic; however, introducing this practice in a separate colony, for those who have already been convicted is definitely possible, Grib believes.
To recap, yesterday, law enforcement officers could not decide which pre-trial detention facility - male or female - to assign to 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis), detained for drug possession, and, as a result, the man with a girlish appearance was not arrested.
He was sent home on the written condition that he would not leave town.
This news was widely discussed on social networks and in the media, since, as of yet, there is no procedure in Russia for holding transgender people in pre-trial detention facilities and penal colonies.
Russian human rights advocate and activist in the LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender), Nikolai Alekseev, supports the idea of creating special places for transgender people to serve out their sentences, noting that, abroad, it is also possible to place people in penal colonies - male or female - depending on their own preferences.
Given the climate in Russian prisons, this is the correct recommendation.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but the problem is real, just as is the issue of ensuring the safety of homosexuals in prisons, says Alekseev.
Prisons should be safe; therefore, separate blocs could be established for this sake, as well as for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prisons than transgender people.
Moreover, Alekseev doubts that there will be a lot of citizens in Russia who will be ready to pass themselves off as transsexuals just to get into somewhere other than a regular penal colony.
Of course, a medical examination could be introduced before placing people into a penal colony for transgender people; however, things are not always so straightforward.
For example, in the US, one prisoner, Chelsea Manning, looked like a man, but once already in prison, announced that he wanted to change his sex, says Alekseev.
A person can feel like they are anyone at all.
However, as of yet, there are no separate facilities for transgender people to serve out their sentences, and I doubt that prison staff will think seriously about the safety of such people or fathom the complexities of their orientation or gender identification.
At the same time, international expert on issues of reproductive health in the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for assigning transsexual criminals to a penal colony could significantly delay the start of the convicts serving their sentences.
A committee is created: this is a question of sexology, with psychiatrists conducting long-term examinations - this is not just one test - on the basis of which a highly precise diagnosis is made.
Modern practices in psychiatry make this possible.
This is why, before a sex change, potential patients undergo such expert evaluation; they will definitively show whether or not a sex change requiring surgery is a necessary measure, says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to introduce this system in relation to convicted individuals; after all, on average, it takes an entire month to conduct such an examination.
The doctor, in spite of the fact that he supports the general idea of creating separate blocs for transsexuals, also doubts that it would be appropriate under current economic conditions to allocate funds towards the construction of new facilities and medical examinations: transgender people in Russia are few and far between.
It's difficult to come up with a number as there are no official statistics, but if one considers that homosexuals account for around 5%, then it is fair to say that there are even fewer transgender people, and that those that have such an inclination and also commit crimes comprise an entirely small number, said Lordkipanidze.
Currently, upon submitting a request to the administration of a penal colony, homosexuals and transgender people are already able to obtain separate conditions of confinement.
Mikhail Antipov wins the Junior World Chess Championship.
The world chess championship for youth under 20 has finished in Khanty-Mansiysk.
The end of the championship turned out to be more than a little intriguing.
The winner was only decided in the final round, and it was Russian Mikhail Antipov who managed to finally overtake the Pole, Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who looked set to claim the title.
Among the girls, victory was celebrated by Ukrainian chess player, Natalia Buksa.
By the middle of the world chess championship, which was held a the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, it looked as if there were almost no surprises left, since the Polish representative, Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who, having delivered a series of four wins (the tournament is held according to the Swiss system of 13 rounds), confidently took the lead.
Given that Duda was rated as a favourite to win the championship, and generally is considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he would throw away his lead seemed rather insignificant.
Even when Duda slowed down and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov to narrow the gap to just half a point, he still remained the favourite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipov absolutely had to win in the 13th round in order to surpass the leader.
But even that wouldn't help if Duda won his match.
Moreover, this obligation to win could of course have an impact on the Russian chess player's game and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently dealt with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for Duda, who was facing Benjamin Bok, to finish his match.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player ended the stand-off against the Dutchman in a draw.
In this way, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of a possible 13 - but Antipov had better additional criteria.
It is for this reason that the administration of Khanty-Mansi autonomous area, whose governor is Natalia Komarova, which traditionally pays a lot of attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded the grand prize to him.
On the other hand, there were no surprises at the end of the girls' competitions.
The tournament leader, Natalia Buksa (Ukraine), only needed to not lose in the final match to win the title, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of Russian Alina Bivol didn't enable her to surpass Buksa.
The Russian athlete placed second, just half a point behind the champion.
VimpelCom changes its regional structure.
The company is merging the Volga and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, and Siberia and the Far East into an Eastern region.
The project will be completed by November 1.
As Mikhail Slobodin, General Director for VimpelCom, notes, these changes are being made "to remain a strong player in the market", and develop the company "in new, and not always favourable, external conditions".
In an interview with Russia-24 television station, Mr. Slobodin confirmed that they intend to cut "tens of percents" of staff in Russia.
Rospotrebnadzor has inspected 78 Burger King eateries in Moscow and issued 367 compliance orders.
As a result, a restaurant on Volokolamsk Highway was fined 50 thousand roubles, while the establishment on Bolshaya Tulskaya Street was closed for 90 days, but has since resumed operations after addressing all of the violations.
43 eateries violated requirements for the organisation of their premises.
Among other things, violations included the unsatisfactory sanitary and hygienic conditions of the premises, failure to comply with requirements for ventilation, and, in some establishments, coliform bacteria were found.
Franchising for the Burger King brand belongs to Burger Rus LLC, owner of the Shokoladnitsa chain, Aleksandr Kolobov, with 293 eateries operating in Russia.
Igor Artemev, Head of the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), stated that the agency is against indexing freight tariffs at 10% and the provision of state subsidies, as requested by JSC Russian Railways.
At first they wanted a 17% indexing, and now they want 10%, in addition to multi-billion rouble subsidies from the budget, he said.
We are saying that this isn't right; it's too much: cut your costs, learn to economise, give up the extravagant private residences, football teams, and private TV stations, and stop spending money right, left, and centre.
He added that FAS has its own "much stricter" proposals, which are currently being discussed in government.
Polymetal is looking at the possibility of a net settlement with Sumeru Gold B.V. in place of a put-option on shares for a total amount of $300 mln, reported the gold producer.
In this case, Polymetal will need to pay Sumeru up to an additional $80 mln (the difference between the issue price of shares in Sumeru's favour and market quotes), which could be taken from available cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to exercise the option or demand additional payment.
Polymetal will not disclose the details of the negotiations.
The option was concluded as part of Polymetal's acquisition of the Kyzyl project in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of the Department of Housing Policy at the Ministry of Construction, reported that the ministry, in cooperation with the Central Bank, is developing procedures for the reorganisation of developers.
"We understand that there is no getting around this, and, as such, we are developing a relevant mechanism", the official stated.
Drafts of the script for the film "Citizen Kane" to be put up for auction.
Representatives of the auction house, Profiles in History, announced plans to put up for auction drafts of the film script for "Citizen Kane", which is considered one of the best works of director, screenwriter, and actor Orson Welles.
The auction will commence on September 29, in the city of Calabash, with three draft scripts, valued at $20-30 thousand a piece, being presented, AP reports.
The first of the drafts, written in the 1940s by Herman Mankiewicz, is the earliest draft of those held in private collections, and is entitled, "The American", which was the working title for the film.
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, while the third is the final draft of the film.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade: targeted food aid will not be similar to ration cards in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister for Industry and Trade of Russia, Viktor Yevtukhov, reported that the targeted food aid programme would not be similar to the card system of food distribution that existed in the USSR.
This issue concerns current targeted food assistance to the population and support of efficient domestic commodity producers.
I'm asking that people don't read too much into the phrase "food card".
I'd especially like to note that the proposed grocery cards shouldn't be confused with memories of widespread shortages from times past, or of a card system of distribution in which the quantity of goods is rationed.
So far, we have proposed an idea, and, if it is accepted, we will propose changes to the law", TASS quotes Mr. Yevtukhov as saying.
Earlier, Kommersant wrote that the programme to introduce food cards for low-income individuals had been submitted to the government.
For more details on the Ministry of Industry and Trade's initiative, read the Kommersant article "Igor Shuvalov orders the preparation of food cards".
The President of Rosgosstrakh wants to divorce his wife.
A source familiar with the situation told RAPSI that the president of the insurance company Rosgosstrakh, Danil Khachaturov, has filed for a divorce from designer Ulyana Sergeenko in a Moscow court.
Adjudication of the claim by judicial magisterial precinct No. 100 will begin on September 16.
Danil Khachaturov is requesting the dissolution of his marriage and the division of marital property.
The court confirmed the existence of the on-going divorce suit, while noting that the claim for the division of property has not been received and would be decided on in the district court.
Vice President of Russian Railways, Aleksander Bobreshov, is leaving his post.
Vice President of corporate security for JSC Russian Railways (RZD), Aleksander Bobreshov, is leaving the company, Interfax reports with reference to a source.
Deputy Prime Minister of Russia and Chairman of the Board of Directors for RZD, Arkady Dvorkovich, stated that the company's new head, Oleg Belozerov, initiated the matter of Aleksander Bobreshov's departure from RZD.
According to the deputy prime minister, personnel changes in RZD's management are not connected with the replacement of the company's head.
Earlier, Kommersant reported that, in place of Vladimir Yakunin, JSC RZD was now headed by the First Deputy Minister of Transport and Petersburger, Oleg Belozerov, who oversaw the financial bloc.
The company's new head was the first to announce reforms to the monopoly: over the course of a year and a half, a new system of freight tariffs will be created.
Read more about changes to the company in the Kommersant article: "RZD will revise prices".
This year, the Association of Russian Managers' study, "Top 1000 Russian Managers", will be published for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of top Russian managers, the study takes stock of the work of Russian executives for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of winners from last year's rating.
Winners from the previous year are asked to confirm their participation as a candidate in the current year's rating and to nominate members from their own management team.
Moreover, each of those included in the initial list of candidates are invited to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies whom it would be advisable to add the general pool of candidates.
It is possible to nominate the following heads of functional areas of a company: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, human resources director, IT director, director of public and corporate relations, director of government relations, and director of corporate governance.
Each of the managers proposed by the experts is sent an invitation to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate their management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The nomination of candidates by sector is based on the Association of Managers' industry classification: information technology, commercial banking, the forestry and wood processing industry, manufacturing, the media industry, the metal industry, multi-industry holdings, professional services, the communications and data industry, service and consumer goods production, insurance, construction, trade, transportation, the financial sector, pharmaceuticals, the chemical industry, and the energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is given a username and password to log into the site, www.top1000.amr.ru, where they can find information about the other participants and submit their assessments according to the proposed criteria for each functional area.
The methodology for the rating is based on the principle of "the best choosing the best": top managers rating top managers, and functional managers rating functional managers.
Such a principle makes it possible to obtain the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at meetings of the expert commission.
All interested candidates of the current year's rating and repeat candidates from previous years' ratings are invited to attend the in-person meetings of the expert commission.
The commission is organised along functional lines: a commission for approving top managers and eight commissions for approving heads of functional departments.
At meetings of the expert commissions, the presented lists are to be approved in alphabetical order (rankings are kept in strict accordance with the internet assessment and remain confidential until the publication of the rating), or updated changes are made to them in accordance with the enclosed list of reserve candidates.
Company names are presented in accordance with Russian language rules and Kommersant standards.
At the time of publication, changes to the status of managers and companies are possible.
10-13% is a comfortable rate for investment loans.
According to experts, the credit market for small and medium businesses shrunk by 40% between January and April of this year.
In your opinion, what is the situation like today?
After the panicked mood at the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015, the volume of lending to SMEs declined significantly.
The reason is obvious: a sharp rise in interest rates.
Financing at 25-30% per annum wasn't beneficial to anyone.
If previously, a bank could place all of its potential future problems, from arrears to defaults, at a higher rate, then now it is no longer possible to do this: the rates are already sky-high.
For the business community, the current level of interest rates for loans to SMEs isn't comfortable.
For a significant proportion of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their rate of return.
An interest rate level of between 10-13% would enable businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and make an attractive profit from them.
In your opinion, to what extent is the demand for credit by business owners being met?
The situation improved slightly after the Central Bank lowered the interest rate.
Credit resources became more readily available.
However, according to our observations, clients have started to apply for loans much more infrequently.
First of all, businesses can't discern the prospects for their development or future earnings.
Today, businesses have one option: they need to learn how to operate by focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It's necessary to more closely monitor current performance and control cash flow.
At the same time, when financial resources are available, it makes sense to use new technologies that allow for the modernisation of equipment and the reduction of production and energy costs.
All this, ultimately, enables companies to make their production more competitive and maintain their business even in an unstable economic situation.
Which main trends in the SME lending market will become more pronounced and will influence its development up until the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast regarding a reduction of the average rate will depend a lot on the policies of the Central Bank; currently, the regulator is demonstrating consistency when it comes to lowering the key rate.
However, there's no point in waiting for a drastic decline in the cost of credit for SMEs.
In the current situation, the problem, first and foremost, is inflation, which necessitates a higher interest rate to obtain real earnings.
Moreover, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even with a lowering of rates by the Central Bank.
If we're talking about the level of arrears, then traditionally, small and medium size businesses, limited by their ability to replenish funds, as well as by possibilities for adjusting economic behaviour, will, of course, present a big risk to lenders.
I wouldn't expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street style.
This is how the word Mazda is written in Japanese characters.
Beautiful, concise, and, at the same time, quite difficult for those who are used to the Cyrillic or Latin alphabets.
Likewise, the new CX-5 crossover, as with any other model by the brand, is attractive without being pretentious on the outside, and technically sound on the inside.
The Japanese, simply by virtue of their "Japaneseness", are capable of turning an attachment to products from the country of the rising sun into a state of total admiration.
You can make as many arguments as you like for cars from other countries, and the person may even agree with these arguments in principle, but the whole conversation will fall apart with the final phrase: "But it's a Japanese car!
There's no point in arguing about it!
Such people, undoubtedly, ought to love not only technology, but also everything else Japanese.
Quote Bashō off the top of their heads, add wasabi to their food, collect katanas, and dress their girlfriends, not in kimonos of course, but according to the edicts of Japanese street style: cute, creative, and totally unexpected.
Take the Japanese school uniform: the only uniform that girls are happy to wear even after graduating from school.
It possesses amazing qualities: at the same time both sensual and strict.
And the older a girl is, the shorter her skirt.
The major change in the look of the CX-5 is the front grill with its five horizontal lines.
But the new shape of the headlights and taillights significantly changes the look of the car, which makes the automobile immediately recognisable in the flow of traffic.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very enticing.
The silhouette is harmonious and the shapes are sensual, but, in spite of this, the appearance has a touch of severity.
There's no need to call the police.
Behind the wheel of the CX-5, which is one of the safest cars in the world, you can experience sheer stoic Japanese tranquillity.
The 2.2L diesel engine delivers high torque over a wide range of speeds.
Moreover, the fuel consumption of this 175 horsepower engine is only 5.9L, and it comes exclusively equipped with an automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.
Black boots, black coat, black bag...
To add a little black humour to this image, you can pick out some leggings with a police "Do Not Cross" design on them.
Incidentally, Mazda has made every effort to ensure that you don't end up in a car accident when behind the wheel of a CX-5.
To even further enhance comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension of the front and rear shock absorbers was redesigned, and the shape of the front lower control arm bushings was also improved.
The all-wheel drive system has been adapted to Russian conditions.
The road and engine noise levels at high speeds have been reduced by 13%.
A swimsuit in flowers or stripes is just as boring as a budget sedan.
It's another thing entirely when a girl flaunts about in a swimsuit with an original design.
For example, from a roller derby video game.
Then she'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has better designed front and rear seats, which provide optimal extra space for both broad shoulders and long legs - whoever has what.
Moreover, those with long legs will certainly appreciate the fact that the rests at the front part of the centre console are now soft and don't hit your ankles in the curves.
Mazda's most comprehensive package of active safety systems is offered specifically on the CX-5.
Radars, lasers, and cameras are used in order to identify potential threats.
It also includes adaptive lighting, lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring, and safety breaking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in its class.
Convenient and with minimal obstructions, it can accommodate a cargo volume of 561L. The back seats fold down in a 4:2:4 configuration, with each section having its own remote control lever, which increases the trunk space to 1560L.
In Japan, a cartoon character's costume is called a "kigurumi".
Kigurumi pyjamas look especially cheerful.
You can do anything in them!
Of course you can sleep.
But also, entertain little children.
Or simply stroll along the street as a little beast...
After all, it's wonderful when you have the ability to choose cool clothes, your manner of behaviour, or your car.

Kiev breaks up the atomic union.
Kiev has officially filed a renouncement of Ukraine's cooperation with Russia to complete the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovnaya Rada, during a second attempt, ultimately voted for the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements to complete the third and fourth blocks were signed back in 2010-2012, but the launch of the project never happened.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovnaya Rada of Ukraine adopted a law terminating the agreement concluded with the Russian Federation between 2010-2012 to construct the third and fourth blocks of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The country's government only succeeded in introducing the bill after the second vote; during the first round it was supported by 210, while a minimum of 226 were needed, but after the revote, 234 members of parliament voted for the draft.
According to the original plans, the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant, which was initiated during the Soviet period, was to consist of four 1 GW power units with pressurised water reactors, but only two were ever built.
Negotiations with Moscow on completing construction led to the signing of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010; while between 2011-2012, the Rada adopted the relevant legislation.
Since funds from Ukraine's budget weren't available, it was assumed that the block would be constructed using loans provided by the Russian side, but funds were never allocated.
After the revolution in Kiev in February 2014 and the resulting cooling of relations between the two countries, Kiev began to phase-out dealings with Moscow in the nuclear sector, announcing the refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant and on a project to construct a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations have been preserved is for the purchase of fuel from Russia for already-operating Ukrainian nuclear power plants (which provided approximately half of the country's power production), since Ukraine's National Atomic Energy Generating Company, Enorgatom, has nothing to replace Russian supplies with yet.
Plans to complete construction of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant in Ukraine with different contractors haven't been definitively scrapped yet: as early as in 2014, an announcement was made in Kiev about negotiations with the Czech company Skoda JS.
UN Secretary-General is against using military force to resolve the Syrian conflict.
During a press conference, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution", AP quotes him as replying to a question concerning military support of Syria by Russia.
Ban Ki-moon also stated that a meeting would be held with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council about the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the foreign ministries of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be about Syria", he announced.
Earlier today, the Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Nikolai Bogdanovsky, reported that the General Staff has not ruled out the possibility of establishing an air force base in Syria in the future.
Right now, there are no such plans.
"But anything could happen", said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Earlier Kommersant reported that the US doesn't trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to official Damascus is essential to the fight against the terrorist group, Islamic State, which is banned in the Russian Federation.
For more on US doubts concerning Russian assistance to Syria, read the Kommersant article: "Russian military presence in Syria worries Washington".
The possibility of a meeting between parliamentarians from Ukraine and Russia is reported at the OSCE PA.
Head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA), Artur Gerasimov, reported the possibility of a bilateral meeting with their Russian counterparts in parliament this year to discuss the situation in Southeast Ukraine.
"What I know is that a specific meeting is being planned this year, possibly between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations", TASS reports Mr. Gerasimov as saying.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreement and "a return to normal life in our countries".
On the issue of whether or not, in his opinion, a dialogue at the parliamentary level between Ukraine and Russia was possible at the present time, either in the "Normandy format" or in the format of a contact group under the auspices of the OSCE PA, Mr. Gerasimov remarked that a dialogue has been held: there is a Minsk agreement.
At the same time, according to the politician, there is support in Kiev for any form of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative for Ukraine at the negotiations, the country's former President, Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Lukhansk essentially have still not changed their positions on tripartite negotiations, but that the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
Mandates allotted to parties.
Yesterday, the Nizhny Novgorod electoral commission summed up the results of the city duma elections according to municipal district, which allocated 12 deputy seats awarded according to party lists.
As per usual, many complaints about violations during the elections were heard from representatives of the CPRF, who accused the electoral commission of "concealing fraud".
The opposition's objections were not accepted.
At the same time, the electoral commission denied the Communists of Russia party's attempt to organise a referendum concerning the elimination of fees for capital repairs to apartment blocks.
The city electoral commission has officially released the results of the elections to the Nizhny Novgorod City Duma according to municipal electoral district.
Altogether, 1.03 mln people were included on the voters list for Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand voting ballots were issued at precinct commissions, and 268 thousand voters cast their ballots in the elections.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were determined to be void, while 24 remain unaccounted for.
Yesterday, 12 seats were allocated among political parties according to the votes they received.
According to United Russia's lists, six deputy seats go to Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
Party leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, received the only seat for LDPR.
Two seats for the CPRF were allocated to Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma Deputy, Aleksandr Tarnaev.
Three seats for A Just Russia went to Aleksandr Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov, and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now, these candidates need to determine within five days whether or not they will work as deputies in the city duma: in the event of a refusal of a mandate, the seat will go to the next candidate on the party list.
Chairman for the city electoral commission, Aleksandr Makeev, informed members of the commission that he was establishing shifts to "dispatch telegrams to Zhirinovsky and the others" for the purpose of refusing their mandates.
Upon approval of the protocol on the results of the election, representatives from the CPRF filed complaints about multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, an advisory member of the city electoral commission from the CPRF, proposed rejecting the results of the vote in four districts, Nos. 21-24, recalling how, under an order from the head of the administration for Sormovsky district, the entrance to the administration building where the four district commissions were located was closed.
State Duma deputies, the candidates themselves, and observers weren't able to get inside for a long time, and the public outcry, which resulted in a storming of the doors to the district administration building, was shown on television.
All observers and advisory members of the commission were able to attend the meetings of the district committees.
The head of the administration only suspended their access when the voting had ended and the precinct commissions still had not arrived to hand over their ballots.
It was done to prevent various provocations.
"Then the head of the administration was corrected, and interested parties were permitted to attend all meetings", retorted Natalia Andryushina, member of the city electoral commission.
The communists objected that Lyudmila Aristova, a deputy in the regional legislative assembly, was illegally detained in the blockaded administration building for more than four hours, and a complaint regarding this has been sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also outraged that, on election day, several precinct electoral commissions started to seal ballot boxes at between 6 and 7 o'clock the morning, placing early voting ballots inside of them.
Moreover, no one notified the advisory members of the commission and observers, and, as such, they only arrived right at the start of the elections at 8 a.m.
The communists are confident that, in the morning before the opening of polling stations, ballots could have been stuffed into the ballot boxes without supervision.
However, according to Aleksandr Makeev, the city electoral commission, which has already investigated more than 124 various complaints, didn't find any violations involving the stuffing of ballot boxes with unaccounted for ballots.
Members of the commission also did not support the suggestion made by their colleague from A Just Russia, Maria Popova, via the regional electoral commission, to introduce amendments to regional legislation in order to clearly establish the time at which envelopes containing early voting ballots, which then end up in ballot boxes, are opened.
"As concerns this individual initiative: at least contact the Central Election Committee", Aleksandr Makeev advised Ms. Popova.
Towards the end of the meeting, Sergei Samokhin, a member of the CPRF, began to hurl loud accusations at the chairman, yelling that the electoral commission was ignoring dozens of complaints and concealing electoral fraud.
"You're not at a protest; be more careful with your claims!" replied the offended chairman of the electoral commission.
Ultimately, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
The electoral commission must confirm the overall results of the elections by September 27, after which, within a period of three weeks, the first meeting of the sixth convocation of the Nizhny Novgorod City Duma will be announced.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the city electoral commission denied the Communists of Russia political party's registration of an advocacy group to conduct a local referendum.
According to the documents, the party members were planning on bringing up two issues for discussion with residents of Nizhny Novgorod: do you agree that the collection of fees for capital repairs to apartment blocks should be "immediately cancelled", and should rates for housing and communal services "be frozen until 2020".
However, lawyer for the Duma, Irina Maslova, made it clear that the appeal by the Communists of Russia contravenes the law.
FedEx earnings mixed, lowers fiscal 2016 outlook
FedEx reported disappointing results for its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said that it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, down 20 cents from an earlier prediction.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite rate hikes averaging 4.9 percent, which will take effect Jan. 4, and higher surcharges for ground shipment of heavy or large packages, which begin in November.
The company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenue and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was "performing solidly given weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday-hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said that that it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, about the same that it hired last year.
In the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42, short of the $2.44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In the latest quarter, ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates, while income fell in the freight business on higher labor costs.
In premarket trading about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares were down $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week seated around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table deciding if it's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Looming over them at one end of the central bank's ornate, two-story boardroom will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests above all others.
The central bank has a dual charge from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there's an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And that third mandate could be the X-factor in a too-close-to-predict decision, to be announced Thursday, about whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being weaned from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place since late 2008.
Even though most data show the economy growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already-cautious Fed officials skittish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global marketplace is enough to provide them with justification to wait further," she said.
There's no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing financial market jitters.
About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week.
Financial markets, however, are expecting the Fed to hold off, with a key indicator showing only about a 30% chance of a boost.
That would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate, unless policymakers were to soften the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed hiked rates at this point in time," he said.
If Fed policymakers did, "they would have to go to great lengths in their policy statement to hold financial markets' hands so they don't panic."
Other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would validate the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.
And although inflation continued to run below the central bank's annual 2% target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world started convulsing late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16% below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month, with the Dow now down nearly 10% from the May high.
For Fed policymakers, the market turmoil adds to the complex calculus of when to raise the interest rate.
"Absent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks, they would be tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts on the U.S. economy are going to be, and they have almost no data to rely on that post-dates the developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy isn't one of the Fed's primary concerns, so technically it shouldn't be factored into its decision-making.
But, in effect, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "taper" its monetary expansion triggered market convulsions around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that seem unconnected to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase, cited decisions in 1998-99 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point over three meetings "despite limited identifiable implications for U.S. growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market meltdown, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.
The latest turmoil doesn't come close to that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think they should get ahead of the curve.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Frequently referred to as the Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a one-stop shop, offering an dizzying array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even an automotive section if you need to pick up some motor oil.
The store is massive, and it will take over an hour to comb through all the aisles.
If all that shopping makes you hungry, grab a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The store's indoor food stall (good, inexpensive) is near the registers, and has various takeout options.
What it stocks: Need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Items are reasonably priced, and a number of items are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes specialty Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet fish, and even fry it for you if you'd like.
A good portion of the store is given over to the massive freezer section, where you'll find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork casings, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially-prepared foods and more.
Who shops there: Restaurant owners and chefs, also single families and individuals.
The wide aisles accommodate both shopping carts and forklifts.
The find: Fresh monthong durian next to the checkout stand.
Where is it: The store is in an industrial part of Los Angeles hugging the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can get busy, parking is usually not hard to find.
Speaker of the State Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, suspects that the US intends to destabilise the situation in the Middle East so that Europe is flooded by waves of refugees.
Interfax reports that he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I'm not a proponent of conspiracy theories, but the question begs to be asked: Is Europe itself the ultimate goal of those who, with such maniacal perseverance over the past few years, have destabilised the situation in the countries of Northern Africa and the Middle East?" he questioned.
"After all, surely someone assumed and knew that the influx of refugees, these unfortunate and wretched people who are trying to escape death, would pour into the affluent countries of the EU", he added.
Naryshkin asked: "How many political leaders in Europe have honestly spoken about the causes of this crisis, about this wave of refugees, which is literally washing over their countries right now?"
"No, Old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to remain silent", he stated.
According to Naryshkin, NATO is trampling over many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe, unfortunately, has for a long time disinterestedly stared and continues to stare at how a military boot, stitched to NATO standards, has trampled on moral ideals and the fundamental principles and norms of international law", the speaker underscored.
Government forces and paramilitary units loyal to them are confronting insurgents primarily comprised of Islamists.
Later on, the terrorist group, Islamic State, which is banned in Russia, joined forced with opponents of the Syrian government.
The US is backing rebels who stand against both Assad and IS.
Official Damascus considers these rebels to be terrorists.
The President of Syria names the reason for the West's enmity towards Russia.
The West's grievances towards countries like Syria, Russia, and Iran, in fact stem from the fact that they are sovereign states.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad expressed this opinion in an interview with RT, First Channel, Russia-24, NTV, Rossiya Segodnya, TASS, Interfax, and Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
According to Assad, the West cannot accept partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, they would like to remove one person and replace them with another person who will act in the interests of Western countries and not in the interests of their homeland, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the abrupt shift in Western media since the beginning of the revolution in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "transformed from being a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator, who represses the Russian opposition, and who came to power through undemocratic means, in spite of the fact that he was chosen via democratic elections recognised in the West".
Putin urged the international community to join forces with Assad in the fight against Islamic State.
Commenting on frequent statements by the West that Assad must leave, he noted that a president comes to power with the consent of the people, via elections, and if he is to leave, then it is at the behest of the people, and not according to a decision by the US, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference, or a Geneva communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president will stay, and if the opposite is true, then he ought to leave immediately", he underscored.
Assad described Russia and Iran as friendly countries and recalled that they are cooperating with them.
Syria is also jointly fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
Speaking about military assistance from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, on the economy, and in the military sphere.
He denied allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is providing us with military equipment.
"Of course there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran; however, this exchange has always been in place", he explained.
As concerns other states, we are open to cooperation with any of them if they possess a serious willingness to combat terrorism.
"We do not see this in relation to the so-called antiterrorist and anti-ISIS coalition led by the US", Assad pointed out.
The death toll has surpassed 230 thousand people, and the number of refugees has reached 11.5 million.
A portion of territory has been seized by the terrorist group, Islamic State, which is banned in Russia.
The international coalition headed by the US is striking at IS positions from the air.
Flood kills 12 people in Utah.
In the US state of Utah, at least 12 people have died as a result of a flood.
Another person is identified as missing, reports Fox 13 Salt Lake City.
Water washed away several automobiles with people inside of them in Washington County.
One of them, a van containing a family, was stopped in the danger zone near the water, and the flow suddenly carried it away.
The youngest of the victims was four years old.
All of the victims were residents of Colorado City and Hildale districts, where the elements attacked.
There are also reports about three children who were successfully rescued.
650 teams were involved in the search and rescue efforts.

Lavrov and Kerry discuss the situation in Syria: Politics: World: Lenta.ru
The US Secretary of State had a telephone conversation with Russia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov.
Reuters reported this, citing John Kirby, spokesperson for the State Department.
It is noted that the topic of conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby didn't offer any additional details.
Moreover, he stated that the US has tools to "further isolate Russia" if the country continues to support the President of Syria Bashar al-Assad, RIA Novosti reports.
As reported by the Russian MFA, during his conversation with Kerry, Lavrov once again stressed the need to create a united front in the fight against terrorist groups active within the territory of that country.
Approaches to resolving the Ukrainian crisis and possible steps towards decreasing tensions on the Korean peninsula were also discussed.
Additionally, they touched on some issues of a bilateral nature.
Earlier, American officials stated that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern regarding Moscow's strengthening of support for Assad.
Washington stated that if Russia continues to provide support to Assad, then it would be increasingly isolated from the international community.
In response, the Russian President's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov stated that the country would not face international isolation.
Rebels advocate for the overthrow of Assad's regime.
A portion of territory has been seized by the terrorist group Islamic State.
The international coalition headed by the US is striking at IS positions from the air.
Borodai dubs the US newspaper's information as libel against Strelkov.
Former head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Aleksandr Borodai, has denied information that was published in the US newspaper, The Washington Post.
He spoke about this in a telephone interview with a correspondent from Lenta.ru.
The article in The Washington Post is wonderful in that everything is entirely misquoted.
Of course, no one tied up Igor Strelkov, the former Minister of Defence for the DPR, and he 'left' the territory of the Donbass Republic in entirely high spirits, without any ropes and without the three truckloads of money that are being ascribed to him by various people", he noted.
According to Borodai, there definitely was talk about Strelkov during the conversation with the reporter from the US newspaper.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov needed to be immediately removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic", said the former head of government for the DPR.
Borodai stressed that he didn't know why the reporter from the US publication decided to write that Strelkov was "tied up" while being removed to Russian territory.
I suspect that this is a provocation.
If it's not a provocation, then it's a surprising case of miscommunication, since I stressed that Strelkov left on his own", Borodai noted.
"It's libel against me and Strelkov", he concluded.
Earlier, an article appeared on the pages of The Washington Post, in which Borodai was quoted as saying that he forcibly removed Strelkov to Russian territory.
According to the publication, Borodai stated that he was forced to tie-up his associate.
Polish authorities initiate a search for a train containing Nazi gold.
Polish loggers have begun cutting down trees over an underground tunnel where, according to some reports, a train containing gold from the Third Reich is located.
Work commenced on Tuesday, September 15, Reuters reports.
According to military experts, the forest must be cleared in order to confirm the veracity of rumours about the train containing treasure.
There could be weapons and valuable minerals inside of the train.
On August 31, the Governor for Poland's Lower Silesia Province, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that new evidence about the existence of a train containing gold were no more convincing than previous claims.
Nevertheless, the authorities decided to cordon-off search areas.
Three days earlier, Poland's Deputy Minister of Culture, Piotr Zuchowski, stated that local treasure hunters, "with a 99 percent degree of certainty", had found the very same train containing gold from the Third Reich that is talked about in the legends.
Zuchowski noted that if the speculation turns out to be true and the treasure is found, it will become property of the state treasury, in which case, the treasure will not be handed over to Russia.
In the middle of August, two clients of a law firm notified the authorities of the Polish city of Wałbrzych that they had found a train in a walled-in tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
Chief narcologist for the Russian Federation proposes prohibiting the sale of tobacco to individuals under the age of 21.
Russia's chief narcologist has proposed prohibiting the sale of tobacco before the age of 21.
Evgeny Bryun noted that, before this age, "any psychotropic substance - tobacco, alcohol, narcotics - has a particularly harmful effect".
This is what he said in a live broadcast on Govorit Moskva radio station, while commenting on information that the Speaker of the Federation Council, Valentina Matviyenko, supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens younger than 21 years old.
The individual develops irregularly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18; an individual is physically prepared for this.
Mentally, they are prepared for a full-fledged life in society by the age of 21.
"It is well known from scientific evidence that the brain and its biochemistry are only fully developed by the age of 21", Bryun noted.
Earlier, member of the Public Chamber and Head of the Sober Russia project, Sultan Khamzaev, told Izvestia that Matviyenko supported an initiative to raise the age limit for the sale of alcohol and "jointly agreed with the Public Chamber to once again raise this issue in the upper house of parliament".
According to the activist, a working group under Matviyenko's leadership will soon be created in the Federation Council to draft a bill.
It has been requested that the Bible be checked for compliance with the law on the protection of children from information
A resident of Novosibirsk has filed a request with the regional prosecutor's office to check the Bible for compliance with the Federal Law "On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development"; a correspondent from Sib.fm examined the request filed on September 16.
The author of the request stated that, on August 26, 2015, they bought a bible, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society, from the Kitai-Gorod store on Krasny Prospect.
He found fragments in the text of the book that, in his opinion, violate the Federal Law "On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development".
The request was accepted for review by the prosecutor's office for the city of Novosibirsk on September 16.
A decision on the Novosibirsk resident's request will be issued within 30 days.
The point of this has nothing to do with banning the book.
It's much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, the applicant said in a comment to a correspondent from Sib.fm.
Besides, this is an entirely valid issue that will stir up society.
Those who have never done so before, will start rereading the Bible.
Brazil's Pediatric Society of Rio Grande Promotes Healthy Breastfeeding Diets
Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try and get women to understand the importance of good nutrition while breastfeeding, by featuring images of babies suckling from breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients they need to grow a strong immune system.
Due to excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new moms are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic expression of their babies and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diets were found to negatively affect the child's immune system.
Train rams into a school bus outside of Hamburg.
Near Hamburg, a train has crashed into a school bus that got stuck on the railroad tracks.
The 23-year-old female driver, realising that she wasn't able to move off the tracks, ordered the 60 schoolchildren to leave the vehicle.
One minute later, the collision happened right in front of their eyes.
It was filmed by one of the schoolchildren.
A state of panic arose among the schoolchildren as a result of the emergency situation.
Some children started to cry and run along the side of the road.
The route still remains blocked-off.
According to the police, it is a miracle that no one was hurt other than one train passenger who suffered minor injuries.
Damages from the accident are estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors call for a ban on boxing.
The Board of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries received during a fight with Filipino Carlo Magali.
According to the International Boxing Federation (IBF), the battle for one of the regional titles in the 57.15 kg weight category, which was held last Friday, ended in a knockout victory for the Filipino in the 12th round.
Brown, however, was sent to the hospital with a traumatic brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical and he was connected to life support.
In the professional boxing ring, Brown scored 22 victories, suffered only two losses, and had one fight that ended in a draw.
He leaves behind two children.
This is already the second fatal case amongst Australian boxers over the past six months.
In March, Braydon Smith, a 23-year-old student, died from injuries received in the ring.
Now the AMA is recommending against participating in this type of sport, or, even better from their point of view, banning it outright.
I understand that this happens unintentionally, said the organisation's Vice President Stephen Parnis.
However, in the form in which boxing currently exists, these situations, where an athlete suffers a haemorrhage or a brain injury that results in death or serious injury, will continue to happen.
It is for this reason that the AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional organisation that unites medical practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Naryshkin calls on the PA of the OSCE to cancel sanctions against parliamentarians of the Russian Federation.
Speaker of the State Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians unacceptable.
He spoke about this while addressing a session of the PA of the OSCE in Ulaanbaatar.
We judge these to be unacceptable actions, as an attack on the value of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this shouldn't happen again, because it is a manifestation of political insolence and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue", the politician said.
Moreover, Naryshkin called on members of the PA of the OSCE to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's return morality to politics.
Let's return dialogue and the law to the practice of international communication.
Let's return humanitarian ideals to the democratic world order.
"Hypocrisy has never ended well," he stated.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to create an interparliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I encourage members of the assembly to concentrate on the following concrete tasks to ensure security.
"First of all, a resolution of the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convocation of our interparliamentary group", stated Naryshkin.
He also noted that the OSCE needed to be commended.
"It is practically the only collective forum where we can still discuss how to normalise the situation in Ukraine", the politician underscored.
To recap, the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulaanbaatar and runs until September 18.
I only basked in my victory for two or three days.
World Champion in Track and Field, Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be called triumphant for the 24-year-old track and field athlete from Barnaul, Sergei Shubenkov.
He managed to win at the European Team Championships in his best event, the 110m hurdles, set several records, and, most importantly, become world champion, moreover, the first in our nation's history of sprint hurdles.
Furthermore, the athlete recently won the final stage of the Diamond League, taking third place in the overall rankings.
Novye Izvestia asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the past season.
Sergei, is the season not over for you yet?
That's right, I'm planning to compete at the Military World Games, which will be held this October in Korea, and then I will think about taking a rest.
Of course, right now, I will be training at home, in Barnaul, but being at home is still quite another situation.
Anything is easier than travelling around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is your favourite time of year.
The end of August and beginning of September is a wonderful time.
The passions from the start of the main season have simmered down, and the weight of responsibility isn't so heavy.
You can compete for enjoyment, in a "laid back" state.
Also, you know that your break is coming up soon...
And do you get fatigued?
After all, it's been an exceptional season, with a multitude of positive emotions...
Fatigue always starts to set in towards the end of the season.
And here, it's not important whether you won more or lost more.
Every competition is stressful.
Never-ending flights and travel: it all takes a toll on the body.
You get physically and emotionally fatigued.
But right now, of course, I'm in good spirits.
What am I saying - I couldn't be happier!
Do you often think about the moment you crossed the finish line at the World Championships in Beijing?
Sometimes.
Besides, you journalists won't let me forget about it either.
But, in general, I don't think it's good for an athlete to live for their old victories and run through their successful races over and over again.
I only basked in my victory for two or three days and then I had to start moving again.
Did your preparations for this remarkable season differ significantly from usual?
I can't say that there was anything particularly different.
We started to train back in December, but I skipped the winter competition season.
At first, I trained at home in Barnaul, then at training camps, and then again at home.
As per usual.
But my coach and I set a goal: to try and reach a new level where I had never been before.
I spent almost the entire winter laying down the foundations for this.
I ran lots of cross-country, did exercises for overall physical conditioning, which included lifting and squats, and we built up my back muscles.
Then we moved onto hurdles training, and worked a lot on technique.
Did you keep an eye on how your competitors were performing?
I always try and do this, and it's an advantage of the Internet age that there aren't any issues with this.
I watched the European Winter Championships, and the French swept the whole podium in sprint hurdles!
Then I thought: I need to do something to break up this group.
With each race this season, you kept on improving your results.
Did this give you confidence?
All of my previous seasons have unfolded in pretty much the same way.
There was never a time when I was first running 13.20 and then would run 13.50.
I always work out my form gradually.
The most important thing is that I wanted to run it in under 13 seconds.
Every effort was directed, first and foremost, on achieving this result.
But the paradox is that, even though you feel prepared for this feat, you aren't always able to show your readiness to do this at competitions.
Like how it was at the London Olympics for example?
To be honest, I tried to forget that semi-final race right away (Shubenkov wasn't able to make it to the finals - Ed.).
I was very well prepared, and could have run it in under 13 seconds.
And even if I had repeated my best result at that time, I would have been the bronze medallist at the Games.
But it just didn't work out.
Do you remember your first world championships?
What do you think?
It was in Daegu.
I really wanted to make it into the finals back then; that was kind of the ultimate goal.
But I got knocked out first thing in the morning, during the preliminary races.
That's when I understood that recklessly rushing headlong into it meant that I wasn't going to get anywhere.
Two years later at the World Championships in Moscow, I had already made it into the finals with a better time.
I remember well how I felt before the final race: I really wanted to win the gold even back then!
How do you manage to build-up a decent speed and still not lose your head or tune-out?
Well, this is the most difficult thing.
You need to be careful and focused on technique in order to not knock down the hurdles.
I've noticed that when you aren't fixated on the end result, but on the process, it's a lot easier.
But the greatest rush is when you realise that you're running and everything seems to be working out on its own!
Honestly, it's well worth it.
A lot of our athletes from the provinces aim to move closer to the capital after their first notable successes.
Have you ever had those thoughts?
Home is always better.
And I can't even imagine where I'd be without my coach; who needs me?
It might be nice to have slightly better conditions, but I try to be content with what I have.
Have you and Klevtsovy been together for a long time?
Since I was 12 years old, when I first started track and field.
Actually, I started training with his wife, who worked with the children, and then later she passed me on.
I started with sprinting, then long jump and triple jump.
There was a children's combined event: that's when they toss a ball and long jump from that spot...
At 14, I tried the hurdles and liked them.
With my very first race, I was able to qualify for the second adult category.
So I just stayed with it.
Have you ever been stricken with fear in front of the hurdles?
Somehow I was able to work things out with them right away.
But I've always had to put a lot of work into my technique.
I worked for so long on just one stride!
But there is no way around this routine.
Your technique needs to be constantly honed, so that you could wake me up in the middle of the night, and I would get up and run hurdles.
Everyone that saw your race in Beijing claims that it was a really beautiful race.
Thank you.
I quite enjoyed it myself.
Usually I don't re-watch my races, but with this one I couldn't hold myself back.
But you have to keep working on efficiency: there's always room for improvement.
Are you now afraid that a victory one year before the Olympic Games will weigh like a heavy burden on your shoulders?
As people say in situations like this: I will try to live up to expectations.
Since I've chosen to take this road, that means that I have to see it through to the end.
My coach loves to say: if you're not a weakling, you shouldn't feel any extra weight.
And I completely agree with him on this.
Otar Kushanashvili
Well I'm not so naïve as to have been stunned by the reaction to the interview that took place in Ukraine.
People are pissed-off, I get it; there's nothing they like better than giving the enemy the boot.
And even though I didn't wrap myself in the flag, I've said the same thing, the exact same thing a million times here: I never directly called anyone a bastard - something else bothered me.
All of my pseudo-friends, in an instant, in a second, vanished somewhere.
The pressure that I have been dealing with is so strong that even a person like me, who has been around the block more than a few times, thinks that people have gone crazy.
It's as if you're walking along by yourself and a mob just starts attacking you and, well, beating you with sticks.
But you have to know me, I'm no pushover, if they come at me with their fists, I will strike back with a howitzer; I'm a veteran, guys, be afraid.
The total lack of support is a whole other matter.
I didn't really have any illusions, but now...
My best quality has always been self-sufficiency, so just try me.
But only idiots could give passports to degenerates like Fred Durst or Monson.
It would have been better to give it to me, the best journalist, someone from an honourable profession.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili didn't mince words when describing events in Crimea:
What they did with the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
This is what they call an annexation.
I assume that the reference to how a tipsy Khrushchev attempted to sign something by no means fits into the overall picture of human society.
It's like visiting your neighbour and taking away his home...
The war started with the Kremlin, and it will only come to an end there.
I am almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, it started with a phone call from some bastard within the confines of the Kremlin.
I have a hunch who it might have been...
Kobzon doesn't have all that much longer to live.
I don't understand, he's a great artist, why does he need to lick Putin's boots.
Is he losing his apartment or something?
So, they took down his statue.
For sure, after all, people remember him as someone who insulted his small motherland.
But now, reconciliation depends entirely on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Seven's Sunrise dominates ratings, despite Nine's attempts to cover the leadership spill on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's dash to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal leadership spill has failed to generate much of a ratings boost for Today.
Nine's breakfast show screened from the national capital after Malcolm Turnbull's overthrow of Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international telecasts which also include Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
That tyranny of distance didn't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers with Sunrise averaging 397,000 viewers across the five capital cities to Today's 339,000.
Today scored a slight uptick compared to its ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but its figure was behind last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has been closing the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the start of the year the gap was running at between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers to Today's 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning folks!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to relocate to seaside New Zealand with his two children, averaged a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered whether Thomson could carry a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered that with a resounding "yes."
Seven's The X Factor stayed strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed fortunes on night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (5pm to 5.30pm) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (5.30pm to 6pm) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half-hour a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night ratings drop will have Nine quietly confident that Hot Seat will ultimately prevail at 5.30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute which failed to dent McGuire's show.

The final three agree Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman who Sam Wood ends up with on The Bachelor has been swathed in utmost secrecy.
And the three girls left standing certainly aren't letting slip whether they are the one who received his final rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three become two, they may have inadvertently given away a clue as to who the winner will be.
Sam Wood is keeping his lips firmly sealed until Thursday's finale
All three women waxed lyrical over why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons they would each love to be his partner.
However when asked the question, "If not you, who should get Wood's final rose?," their answers could have provided a spoiler as to who won the Bachelors heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as, apart from themselves, the best match for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared an easy rapport since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, reading (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really down to earth, she's so much fun to be around," added Markoski.
I've seen them together and they do have that chemistry there.
They do feel nice and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
For her part, Mackay said last week's home visit dates made her realise Wood could be "the one."
"Once I saw him with my friends and family I realised this obviously isn't just a game - I'm wholeheartedly invested in him now," she said.
And asked who Wood should choose if not her, she was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor airs Wednesday, 7.30pm on Ten.
Originally published as Sarah top choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options of where to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed plenty of interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams making inquiries after his impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it's looking like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have benched Hayne for the rest of the game for losing a fumble like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first punt return in Tuesday's 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed faith in his man, giving Hayne the next opportunity to return a punt and including him in the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true colours in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing out his rookies in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also backed Hayne publicly in his post-match press conference.
49ers beat reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received encouragement from special teams co-ordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about his dropped catch and worry about the next play.
Jarryd Hayne fumbles a punt that was recovered by the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was seen cursing as he made his way from the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 he couldn't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of those things, you just worry about the next play and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne likened the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in-goal led to a Queensland try.
Overall it was still an amazing experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it to his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's wealthiest man, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway.
Having openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, seized and his pro democracy efforts curtailed.
Clashes between migrants and the police occur on the Hungarian border.
Refugees staged a protest on the Serbian border close to the Hungarian settlement of Reske, which grew into clashes with law enforcement officers.
As a result, Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, Reuters reports.
Migrants are throwing stones at the police and trying to remove the fence that was placed at the border.
Reinforcements were sent to the scene of the clashes, and the police are taking measures to deal with the migrants' aggressive actions and their attempts to violate the border.
As Agence France-Presse reports, the refugees were able to break through the police cordon, after which dozens of migrants ran into Hungarian territory.
Some refugees are leaving for the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses heading towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, BBC reports.
The country's authorities have allowed migrants to enter Croatian territory and have provided them with transport from there to the desired country.
According to information from Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, Hungary's parliament strengthened the law on migration and border protection.
The amendments make provisions for the involvement of the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those illegally crossing the border, as well as an accelerated procedure for processing requests for asylum.
A Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, by virtue of which he will be deported and will not be allowed to return to Hungary for one year.
The Hungarian parliament also intends, in the near future, to consider the issue of handing over the responsibility for protecting the perimeter of the country's parliament to the Hungarian armed forces.
At the end of June, Hungarian authorities began construction of a 175 km-long barbed-wire fence on the border with Serbia to curb the influx of migrants and refugees into the country.
Russian citizen confesses to committing the largest cyber attack in US history.
Russian citizen, Vladimir Drinkman, accused of the largest cyber attack in US history, has confessed to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, Reuters reports.
During the federal court trial in the state of New Jersey, Drinkman confessed to conspiring to gain unauthorised access to computer systems in order to commit fraud.
During the hearing, the Russian citizen spoke about conspiring with three citizens of Russia and one citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyber attacks against 15 companies.
Total damages resulting from the accused individuals' actions are estimated at 300 million dollars.
"Defendants like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer systems, represent a threat to our economic well-being, our personal lives, and our national security", stated US State Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman is facing 30 years imprisonment as well as a fine in the amount of one million dollars.
During sentencing, the court will take the Russian citizen's confession into consideration and possibly shorten his sentence.
Drinkman's sentence will be announced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At that time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilyanets, was also taken into custody.
The latter denies involvement in the crimes of which he is accused.
Kerry warns Lavrov about the risk of Russia's support for the regime of Bashar al-Assad.
During a telephone conversation with the head of Russia's MFA, Sergei Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia's support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would exacerbate the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russia's support of President Assad risks exacerbating and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal in the fight against extremism if we don't also focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria with the help of an effective transfer of political power", reads a statement published on the US Department of State's website.
Kerry reaffirmed the United States' commitment to fighting the group, Islamic State (the activities of which were banned in Russia by the Supreme Court), in a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad "can never be a trusted member" of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved via a political transition away from Assad.
The White House has threatened Russia with isolation on account of supporting the Assad regime.
Yesterday, White House Press Secretary Joshua Earnest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
By way of an alternative, Earnest suggested joining the international coalition, which is conducting antiterrorist operations against Islamic State.
Lately, the media has frequently reported about the presence of Russian military personnel in Syria.
To which the head of Russia's MFA, Sergei Lavrov, stated that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years already and are assisting the Syrians to master equipment to use against the Islamists.
4 Killed After Police Fire Rubber Bullets at Protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief district officer, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less-lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death toll.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would dilute their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal from ethnic Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officials, have been killed in violent clashes since Aug.
10, when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers have been voting on clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said that the new charter could be enacted by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to establish a 900-job facility.
Sayansk is the youngest city in Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as a chemical industry centre and has well-developed infrastructure requiring systemic support.
A year ago, a new mayor, Oleg Borovsky, took over leadership of Sayansk.
He spoke with a correspondent from Oblastnaya about the results of the first year of work, new projects, and future possibilities.
Oleg Valeryevich, how did you begin your work as mayor?
First of all, I familiarised myself with the results of the audit of financial and economic activities, and I initiated an independent audit of municipal budget expenditures.
Next, a review of municipal assets was conducted.
One of the first practical steps was cutting the turnover time for documentation down to five days.
Previously, documents could take months to get through the proper channels.
Initiatives to increase the revenue base and optimise spending were developed.
Last year, in November, an on-site government meeting was held in Sayansk where issues concerning the socioeconomic development of the territory were discussed.
The city didn't have design and estimation documentation (DED) for even a single asset.
Without this, Sayansk couldn't participate in federal programmes.
We started with DEDs for the roads, childcare facilities, and the northern sewage and water line.
Right now, roadwork is already underway in two areas.
How is the RF Presidential Decree on the construction of childcare facilities being applied in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
The city hasn't seen positive demographic indicators like this for the past 27 years.
As such, ensuring spaces in childcare facilities is one of the most relevant issues.
Since September 1, childcare facility No. 10 has been closed for capital repairs designed to create 320 spaces.
The estimated cost of the renovation is 86 mln roubles.
Before now, the city had never received such funds.
Last year, following renovations, childcare facility No.23 was opened and is now attended by 200 children.
The renovation was carried out via co-financing from the regional and municipal budgets and cost more than 67 mln roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and assistance from the regional government, the money to purchase furniture and equipment was found, and the People's Initiative also helped out with this.
There are plans to start building a new childcare facility in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the waitlist for children from 18 months to three years.
We don't have waitlists for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors expressing interest in the area?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be carried out, first and foremost, by Sayansk businesses: we need to provide jobs specifically for them.
In October, a 60-apartment building will be opened for orphaned children in Leningradsky microdistrict.
As far as construction is concerned, I will add that Sayansk is one of four cities in Irkutsk region that has been included in a programme to build economy-class housing.
All the required documentation has been prepared.
Construction of a 90-block section will commence soon.
Altogether we have announced the construction of 10 thousand square metres of housing, and there are many wanting to participate in the programme.
One of the requirements is that the housing must not cost more than 30 thousand roubles per square metre, and that it should be a "turnkey" property at this price.
If we can handle the specified scope, then we will continue to participate in the programme.
As far as investors are concerned, we also have other interesting projects.
Back in the day, a pig farm was built in Sayansk that was sold, in 2004, for a pittance.
We are working with the prosecutor's office to protest this transaction.
Especially since the land underneath the facility is federal property.
We are working with Moscow to resolve the issue of a transfer of 88 hectares of property to the region, and the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor who is ready to put 1.5 bln roubles into the redevelopment and launch of the project.
We will gain 900 jobs with the launch of the pig farm, which will be a big help to the city.
Is the institute of social partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have concluded approximately 140 socio-economic partnership agreements.
The implementation of many projects was made possible thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Tangible support has been provided by enterprises such as: CJSC Vostok-Tsentr, Novo-Ziminskaya Thermal Power Plant, LLC Sayanski Broiler, and LLC PC MDF; the management of these enterprises responds to all of our requests.
Right before City Day, LLC Sayanski Broiler presented the city with a playground, and the company, Vostok-Tsentr, carried out a renovation of an equestrian yard, where specialists work with children using hippotherapy, spending more than 1 mln roubles on it.
Thanks to funds donated by sponsors, we managed to make improvements to the grounds of the city's civil registry office.
The sponsors helped us to vibrantly celebrate City Day.
As in the good old days, a parade, featuring the city's collectives and organisations, was held.
We released a city chronicle and a book of Sayansk's poets.
The first builders and people who have made a significant contribution to the development of Sayansk were awarded with commemorative medals.
Patrons also participate in the work of the city's charitable foundation.
The first step was the purchase of musical instruments for talented young musicians.
In nine months, more than 800 thousand roubles have been allocated to support these talented kids, to help children who require expensive treatments, and to support children from low-income families.
How are staffing issues in the social services sector dealt with in Sayansk?
The city doesn't have enough doctors or subject teachers.
Providing specialists with housing is critically important to solving the staffing issue.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments to doctors, and four teachers have received service housing.
We have a programme for the allocation of housing with the option to privatise it after five years.
There are plans to reconfigure a building, in which another eight apartments for teachers will be built.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the programme "Housing for Russian Families".
Over the longer term, we will construct housing for public sector employees.
Most importantly, our city has a hard-working team with which I am able to solve the most complex issues.
It's critical to draw the right conclusions from each crisis, and life goes on.
The potential of Sayansk and of our region is great.
A bill on the indexation of social pensions in relation to rising prices has been introduced in the Duma.
A bill has been introduced in the State Duma that makes provisions for the annual indexation of social pensions, in relation to rising prices, starting on February 1.
The document's author, a deputy from A Just Russia, Aleksandr Lomakin-Rumyantsev, also suggests carrying out an additional indexation on April 1, if the growth rate of the minimum living wage exceeds the rate of price increases on goods and services.
Under the current law, the indexation of social pensions takes place annually on April 1, in relation to the growth rate of the minimum living wage of pensioners in the Russian Federation over the previous year.
The draft law, introduced in the lower house, makes provisions for the introduction of indexing social pensions in relation to the growth of consumer prices.
In this case, the first indexation would be moved to February 1, while the second would be held on April 1.
Head of the OSCE PA advises Mogherini of the impermissibility of the introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs, Frederica Mogherini, OSCE PA Speaker, Ilkka Kanerva, advised of the impermissibility of sanctions against lawmakers involved in the activities of the Assembly.
A member of the Russian delegation to the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar, Nikolai Kovalev, told journalists about this.
TASS reports that the signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, and Greece, were collected in support of Kanerva's position.
"Sufficiently strong support has already materialised", Kovalev said.
Earlier, he announced that the head of the OSCE PA expressed his intent to collect the signatures of members who pointed to the impermissibility of the introduction of sanctions in relation to parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev noted that Kanerva promised to raise this issue at the level of the governing structures of the European Union and "send a corresponding petition".
NHC says 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google launches donation-matching campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a donation-matching campaign that aims to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations aiding the thousands of refugees that have overwhelmed European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google took an uncharacteristically personal approach in announcing the donation drive on its blog.
Rather than having an executive make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experience.
"Our journey involved many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The donations will go toward four nonprofit organizations that are providing aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will match the first $5.5 million worth of donations globally at google.com/refugeerelief until it raises $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely driven by the four-year-old civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
It's still to early to say whether mildly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments, however.
"The mortality data take a long time to show up," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, or bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies were done in people who are morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial comparing two kinds of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI among those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatments stayed about the same at 29.
Among those who had surgery, diabetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent.
In the medically-treated group, by comparison, diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "was generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained steady at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected by the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared average outcomes with the two types of surgery.
At the fifth year, compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), achieved larger drops in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and in hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent) and were more likely to have complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent vs 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Though the new study didn't show a benefit in survival among surgery patients, Blackstone said it's reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is where this paper is critical, because it says this surgery is safe in that lower BMI group," with no increased risk of death or renal disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient's BMI falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this," she said.
I think that once they've accumulated these genetic changes that hardwired their bodies into obesity and diabetes, reversing that is really hard.
Robbers steal fur coats and 9 mln roubles from a house in Mytishchi.
In Mytishchi, robbers attacked inhabitants of a Moscow region house and stole 9 mln roubles and three women's fur coats from them.
Interfax reported on this with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unidentified individuals entered through the open front door of the house, which is located on Gorky Street, tied up the 20-year-old son of the homeowner, and, while threatening both of them with a knife, stole 9 mln roubles and three fur coats.
According to preliminary data, damages amount to 9 mln 265 thousand roubles, and a criminal investigation, under the article of "armed robbery", has been launched.
Fans from Europe risk becoming homeless.
Only 23 hotels in Saint Petersburg have the right to house the tourists who will arrive in 2018 to watch the World Cup in football.
So far, the rest of the hotels haven't been rushing to get the necessary permit.
According to experts, this is a very worrisome sign.
In the lead up to the world championship, the authorities need to urgently figure out how to accommodate all the city's guests.
Rosbalt's informants believe that apartment rents will rise by 10-30% as a result of the tournament, and, even after the championship, it will be necessary to pay through the nose for rented accommodations.
The world championship in football has forced the authorities to take a look at the state of Russian hotels.
According to a law specifically written for the championship, every hotel in Saint Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that they meet their alleged star rating and level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will manage to do this: hoteliers are so apprehensive about the screening process that they frequently aren't even submitting request documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for Saint Petersburg.
Head of the Office of the Federal Antimonopoly Service, Vadim Vladimirov, says that the agency has investigated 138 hotels and now plans on initiating 34 cases against hotels, many of which have simply not responded to FAS staff.
There are signs that the management of thirty companies were deceiving city residents by alleging a certain number of stars in advertisements, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that now, ahead of 2018, literally not even one room from the overall total can be lost.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will occupy all of Saint Petersburg's hotels.
Currently, tourists can depend on 30,500 rooms in the city.
According to data from the Smolny Institute, there are 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two and three-star hotels, and 550 one-star hotels in Saint Petersburg.
According to First Deputy of the Committee for the Development of Tourism, Nana Gvichiya, at the present moment, only 23 hotels have undergone classification: this is the number of inspections that have been conducted by the companies accredited in Saint Petersburg.
However, the Smolny Institute, for a surprising set of circumstances, doesn't know whether or not some hotels could have ordered a similar procedure from regional businesses.
In other words, there may be more hotels that have undergone classification, but no one knows about it.
"Over the past six months, hotels have not been very interested in undergoing classification", admitted the Director of the Northwestern branch of the Russian Tourism Industry Union, Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is explained by it being peak season, the time when hoteliers make the most money and don't want to be dealing with other issues.
Another reason is their budgets, which didn't include expenses for inspections, especially since the procedure could cost a hotel, depending on its status, between 30 thousand to 100 thousand roubles or more.
However, more recently, hotel managers have woken up and started to apply for classification, assured Shadskaya.
Hotels must get this done by July 1, 2016; otherwise, they will not only have to pay a fine, but also will not receive the right to operate during the world championship.
It is already well known that, based on star ratings, a set rate per hotel room for the duration of the tournament will be developed.
The formulas, according to which prices will be set, will be published next year.
This is done to ensure that there isn't a 200-300% spike in prices, as happens, for example, during the Saint Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience and prevent a two-threefold price hike, while also enabling hotels to make money.
"I think there will be a 50% increase", explained President of the Russian Hotel Association, Gennady Lamshin.
Whereas Vadim Vladimirov isn't convinced that fixing prices corresponds with the notion of a free market economy.
I don't know how well it fits within the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better than rampant price increases", he noted.
It's not clear what will happen with popular inexpensive hostels.
State Duma deputies have introduced a bill that would prohibit hostels in residential buildings.
We really hope that this law is not adopted or that it won't apply to Saint Petersburg.
"We will defend our point of view, that hostels should be maintained", says Nana Gvachiya.
However, according to her, owners of mini-hotels, should, in any case, be ready for a tightening of the Housing Code.
If the State Duma ends up approving the bill, then approximately 80% of the hostels in Saint Petersburg will be closed, and currently, they account for 1,500 rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers for the Northwest, Leonid Garbar, there aren't enough two and three-star hotels in Saint Petersburg, which are exactly what football fans are looking for, whereas there is an overabundance of four and five-star hotels.
This state of affairs is equivalent to a situation where "you have 75 thousand VIPs in an 80-thousand-person stadium".
In fact, making use of mini-hotels can solve this issue.
The expert considers their possible ban to be "idiocy": "I find it strange that some people can live in apartments, but out-of-towners, for some reason, cannot".
If a hostel is being used like a dormitory, then I agree that this is not right.
But if it is being used like a hotel, where guests stay for a short period of time, then why not?
Mini-hotels also risk missing out during the world championship in football as a result of their own foot-dragging.
Hundreds of small hotels will simply not manage to undergo classification in time, what's more is that they are digging their own hole.
By the summer of 2016, all the city's hotels will be booking inspections.
"There aren't that many companies that are allowed to carry out this procedure, and, as such, they will turn down the less profitable orders from mini-hotels and will choose those that are more expensive", noted Gennady Lamshin, adding that, in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the figure for those that have already completed inspections is currently much higher than for those in Saint Petersburg.
The reason for Saint Petersburg's delay is related in part to constant changes in the government's tourism unit, which has not be conducive to coordinated efforts.
According to experts, if there aren't enough hotels in Saint Petersburg for everyone, then, most likely, attention will have to be shifted towards regional hotels and health resorts.
Just as during the celebration of Saint Petersburg's 300th anniversary, a river fleet could be mobilised, which would enable tournament guests to stay in ship cabins.
Besides, many fans have arranged to arrive in vans, in which they could spend the night.
"The main thing is to not build so many hotels, that they later end up sitting empty", assured Gennady Lamshin.
Rented accommodations will also be very popular during the football championship.
A pool of apartments available for rent in the city will most likely be created.
Rental rates will rise by 10-30%.
"Obviously, the first to go will be housing near the stadium", noted rent specialist for the Agency for the Development and Study of Real Estate, Larisa Bragina.
Moreover, rent prices might not return to previous levels after the championship, especially in commuter communities.
This will also contribute to the construction of new traffic interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she underscored.
One shouldn't forget about the human qualities of city residents.
For example, Leonid Garbar insists that Saint Petersburg has always been a welcoming city, where people not only provide you with directions, but might also take you on a mini-excursion.
There can also be complications.
Sometime around 1970, my father met a family from Murmansk in the courtyard: a father, mother, and two children.
It turned out they had nowhere to spend the night: getting a hotel was difficult back then and sleeping at the train station was tough.
"So my father let them into our communal apartment to sleep", our interviewee recalled.
Of course, he added that, nowadays, this type of trait no longer exists amongst the city's residents - inviting someone into your home is fraught with consequences and frightening.
But, perhaps, in 2018, after the ill-fated decisions of the State Duma, and the mistakes of hoteliers and the government, we might be required to recall the past?
Zhirinovsky "loses" Amur region.
Today, I watched the buffoonery of Zhirinovsky in the State Duma with admiration.
He was doing these things when our generation was still learning how to sell newspapers, and remains in excellent form to this very day.
The theme of the address was something along the lines of "LDPR's protest against the results of the elections in Amur region".
He can't wave around protocols that he doesn't have; by all accounts, LDPR doesn't have any other protocols than those signed by the electoral commissions.
Then he brings up the second place winner, Ivan Abramov, and yells something like: "Here's the winner of the election!"
And then, from no reason, he starts attacking Rodina, and then, after the ruckus with the chairperson this time, he leads the fraction out of the meeting hall, while literally crying out: "All of you and your fronts are crooks and thieves".
The press, of course, places the emphasis not on Abramov, but on the scandal and the fraction's walkout as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
In reality, Volfovich beautifully and elegantly lost Amur Region along with Abramov.
For the whole country, this was just another one of Zhirinovsky's escapades in the same vein as his "Scumbag!" tirade, and not at all a protest by a political party against the results of an actual election.
Yet the fraction has formally made a row of it, and the elections, if we are to believe the party's website and Ivan Abramov's Facebook account, have not been confirmed, but the leader has obviously backed away from the issue.
He lets the dead in Amur bury their own dead, but then he preaches against United Russia in general, and against Rodina, which is guilty of nothing at all.
An elegant solution to save face and, for the time being, avoid a loud scandal.
It's an entirely different matter that Abramov now finds himself in an odd position.
Other than an outcry from the leadership, he wasn't expecting anything: there are no alternative protocols available.
On the one hand, he isn't the focus of the public's attention, but on the other, for a small circle of people, he became the formal reason for both an insult against a respected champion, and, even more importantly, boorish attacks against United Russia and the All-Russia People's Front (APF).
And here, of course, it's necessary for him to think very seriously about what needs to be done.
Because he could turn from being the main beneficiary of the elections, the number 2 politician in the region, and the number 1 candidate in the only regional single-seat constituency, into a pariah who was successfully used by his own party's leadership and its provocateur-extraordinaire for the benefit of that same APF and someone else's party leadership.
Well, if Zhirinovsky didn't exist, then it definitely would be necessary to invent him and dutifully follow his every move.
Trump has a lot of work to do to catch up with him.
There is news that LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenary session.
That is to say: all that fuss for nothing.
Only, the Abramov issue has been buried under itself.
It's beautiful really.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not host all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees" home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He claimed that, under current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even continents.
He also stressed that, however admirable, the West-European countries" response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
"It it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"So taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the mean time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring genuine peace and genuine development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he emphasized.
Ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We have to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the US" violent response engendered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non-violence.
I know his motives were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in children ingesting hand sanitizer in last 4 years
Poison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400-percent uptick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowing highly-alcoholic hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, hand sanitizer ingestion cases in children under 12 that were reported to poison control centers went up from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Kids are getting into these products more frequently, and unfortunately, there's a percentage of them going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some kids are drinking sanitizer intentionally, while some do it to impress their friends or on a social-media dare.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking sanitizer for a cheap buzz.
Teens have reportedly mixed sanitizer with alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stiffer drink.
Younger children can be drawn to attractive sanitizer scents.
"A kid is not thinking this is bad for them," Lopez said.
A lot of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented.
There are strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand sanitizers that are very appealing to kids.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, especially, only a few squirts can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison control center at University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a shot of whiskey sitting around, but people will have these hand sanitizers out and if kids get into it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested as many as four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood-alcohol level was .179, twice the threshold considered legally drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah was slurring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been very lethal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or sanitizing wipes short of moving hand sanitizer out of a child's reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials surmised that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in upstate New York plotted to poison their "mean" teacher "by putting antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her room.
Police considered the foiled plan to be "idle chatter," referring discipline to the school district.
How the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
A sad cast iron owl sits on the back of a bench by the entrance to the N. K. Krupskaya Regional Children's Library.
The kids who come for books try to feed it candies.
Several generations already have been coming to this library over the past 95 years.
The first library patrons, from the twenties of the previous century, arranged loud readings, staged performances based on Mayakovsky's poems, held literary quizzes, and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted for four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalinist" wrote, in 1939, "the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and the friends of the children's library in the city of Barnaul" grew stronger each day.
One time, Nadezhda Konstantinovna even sent her faraway friends in Barnaul a childhood photograph of her.
And when the Barnaul residents asked if Nadezhda Konstantinovna would mind if the library was named after her, she wrote that, no, she didn't mind.
The letters have been collecting dust in the museum for a long time, and it's necessary to explain to the grandchildren and great grandchildren of the first patrons exactly whose stern profile decorates the bas-relief on the library building.
During the perestroika years, all sorts of people would often call, filled with indignation: why hasn't the children's library been renamed?
The library should be named after some nice children's writer, without political overtones!
The library staff sat down together, thought about it, and decided to leave things as they were.
"Krupskaya" is probably the most well-known and best-loved library in Barnaul, just like the Lenin Library in Moscow.
On the floor of the library's lobby there is a pathway made from yellow bricks.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is the favourite theme of artist Olya Moskovka.
Previously, Olya was a manager at a law firm; she came into work at eight and left at five, and only differed from the other managers in her love of drawing.
Then she found an online advertisement: "Book illustrator needed".
The book was written by a little American girl and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" ("My mama has cancer").
Olya did the illustrations and thought: life can end at any moment, and there won't be any miracles in it if you don't create them yourself.
Now she works at the library, illustrates the children's books of authors from around the world, and writes her own short stories.
Typically, it's believed that children are losing interest in books; that they are increasingly living in some kind of virtual universe...
But children who read visit us, and their parents understand the value of reading, the library's director, Tatiana Kushvid, tells Russian Planet.
In recent years, we've even felt a sense of confidence, that the children's library is needed, and that it will keep on going - the kids are coming here!
I think an interest in reading is making a comeback.
A large display window with a temporary photo exhibit hangs in the library's lobby.
Once every quarter, new photographs of library patrons that come to the library as a family - mom, dad, and kids - are hung up.
The library is thrilled that fathers have started to come more frequently to the library with their children.
If they were read all of Chukovsky when they were two years old, then when they are older, they need more challenging books.
But now, there is a law whereby we can't give an eight-year-old wunderkind books that are from the 12 and older category.
In order to get this book, the child must bring their parents with them; so they come, and come back again, and, slowly but surely, Krupskaya is becoming something like a family club for them.
The library contains treasures: a pre-revolutionary collection of folk tales with the old letter "yat" and hard signs, stories by Korolenko in a supplement to the magazine "Niva", and a bound file of "Murzilka" magazines for 1936.
After all, nowadays we're not just a conceptual space, a "temple of books", we're now open for movement, and we're trying to become a special place: not home, not work, not school, explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us so that everyone can read together, play together, and draw together.
We created a play area for young children: the child has only come to play, but their hand still reaches out for a book!
The parents of some of our patrons have to drag their children out, but they dig their heels in and don't want to leave.
Moms with their strollers often visit us, and we are really happy that the library comes first amongst all the other places they need to take their babies.
Tatiana Kushvid says: today's kids are the same as we used to be; they love classic children's literature:
"The publishing industry is growing right now, and a lot of attention is being paid to authors who are the link between generations".
If we're talking about little children, then it's important for them that there be some sort of a character that travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to say goodbye to their favourite characters.
The library is always publishing booklets for parents that talk about what's going on in the world of children's literature, which books are worth paying attention to, and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that the adults ask whether or not the library is in fact for them.
Adults aren't allowed to borrow books from the library.
Only children have this magical privilege.
...In the furthermost room of the library, there is a square hatch with an antique wooden staircase that leads to the basement, into the archive room.
The steps will creak with each step you take: it's a very old time machine.
You'll meet a book from your childhood as if it were an old comrade: hi, it's wonderful that we haven't changed a bit.
Ellie still happily walks along the road paved with yellow bricks; lazy Tolya Ryzhikov steals the magical matches; and Malchish Kibalchish still hasn't told the cursed bourgeouins the Military Secret, such is his solemn word.
These books are like passwords: you can use them to recognise your people anywhere.
There are also real literary rarities in the archive room: for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of folk tales with the old letter "yat" and hard signs.
Or stories by Korolenko in a well-known supplement to the magazine "Niva".
Or a bound file of "Murzilka" magazines for 1936.
Time has aged the pages, turning them a tea-like colour.
These publications aren't given out to library patrons anymore.
These are parts of our future collection; I'm always dreaming of retiring and working with rare children's books.
But children won't, so to speak, buy into this anymore: the colours in the old books aren't very bright, and the themes...you open the first page and there's Lenin, the Party, and the Komsomol.
Now, I think: why did we all subscribe to this "Pioneers Truth"?
But still, it was interesting, Galina Ilyasova, head of the archive room, tells Russian Planet.
The pages of "Murzilka" have darkened with age.
Galina Vasilevna has been in-charge of the archive room her entire life.
She knows what colour Buratino's cap is, in which school year Harry Potter became captain for Gryffindor at the Quidditch championships, in which situations Carlson uses his motor silencer, and what Alisa Selezneva's father does for a living.
A librarian receives little pay for their work, and those who can live without these rows of books quickly find themselves another profession.
Only the most dedicated remain: educators, teachers, and servants of the cult of the book.
You can even tell who they are by their smile: it's said that this is a professional trait of a children's librarian.
If they smile at you within the first minute of a conversation, then they are a professional.
I just love children's books: as a librarian, I like that they are here, that they are sitting nice and tidy on the shelves, and I also love to read them, says Galina Vasilevna.
I read everything: military and historical stories, fairy tales, fiction.
I read contemporary Russian authors, the latest translations...
Of course, I think that things were different in my childhood.
Back then, books were the most interesting and exciting thing that had ever happened to me.
And this is why I love them madly; I felt that the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work there, where everyone sits and reads.
I hope that books will always be around, in spite of readers.
And I'm delighted when our former library patrons bring in their children, and even their grandchildren...
Rumour Mill: No Celtic disharmony
Griffiths plays down talk of disharmony at Celtic as Deila admits Hoops are in a bad place but he'll turn it around.
Hearts to fight SFA over Neilson charge and Warburton wary of January signings disrupting squad unity
Dons stretch lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to open up a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down disharmony talk
It has sparked rumours of disharmony at Celtic, which was dismissed out of hand by Griffiths, who insisted he and his team-mates are not labouring under any sense of increased scrutiny as they prepare to face the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of Scots title race bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and ex-Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there's no title rivalry with Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland, they don't show highlights of the Celtic games any more and why?"
It is because Rangers aren't there.
People here don't only talk about Rangers coming back.
They talk about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what they are interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games and it is not just people in Scotland who want to see those games.
I'll turn things around, vows Deila
RONNY Deila has accepted Celtic are struggling, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
Defeat to Malmo and subsequent Champions League exit was swiftly followed by losing to 10-man Aberdeen, who now sit five points clear at the top of the table.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad periods before and we will come again."
Now we want to come out of it as quickly as possible.
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
That is the same as we are - but we have to go on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players much better.
To stay together now is so important.
Warburton wary of January transfers
Despite comments just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had identified some January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of a signing spree, insisting he doesn't want to disrupt the Ibrox squad's unity.
The ex-Brentford gaffer said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
In terms of players coming in the summer, you have that pre-season period to bed them in, which you've seen with our own group this season.
The squad is doing really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu in retirement hint
Swansea striker Michu, linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has dropped hints that he could retire when his contract with the Swans is up.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with a troublesome ankle for two years, and failed to find a move away from Wales in the summer.
Hearts set for SFA battle over Neilson comments
Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was dismissed and went on to lose 3-2, but the defender's red card was later overturned - the third Collum red card in eight months to be rescinded.
Neilson is sticking with what he said, insisting: "I didn't question any integrity, I didn't comment on a performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The diehard Hibee was carpeted after admitting singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident happened in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "Safe to say I won't be going back to Tynecastle unless it is playing for Celtic."
Tannadice board has faith in Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists Dundee United's board still has faith in the management team to turn things round - but concedes the on-field decline must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We'll get the boys ready to go again," said Donnelly.
McInnes glad to "win ugly" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side had to cling on desperately against Hamilton Accies to see out a seventh successive league win that moved them five points clear of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
McInnes said: "There's not a team out there who has won anything, whether it's cups or leagues, who haven't won games like that."
Scots unemployment remains unchanged as UK total rises
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 during the period May to July while the number out of work for the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the UK's rate of 5.5 per cent, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three month period, with the number of those in work now standing at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell over the quarter at 74.0 per cent - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The government's long term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
In those 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish Labour market with employment increasing and unemployment falling.
Why I'm A Witness At An Execution In Oklahoma
Later today, barring a late legal intervention, I will watch a man being put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it won't, I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary as Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made back in January, via his best friend, and though I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I've come to dread it.
So why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists are permitted to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is picked will watch it dispassionately.
I cannot do that.
I will be sitting alongside Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls, and one visit lasting two-and-a-half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I will just have to try to remember all the details.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the inmate's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have phrased it better," but still thinks I'm wrong to do what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip has taken issue with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I've told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he thinks the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be alongside me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.
I won't go over all the details again here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being an accessory after the fact.
But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And it's from this perspective that I will watch him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that.
What you will get from me is what it's like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death.
Man coaxed from Canning River after soggy police chase
The Canning Vale constable remained dry as he coaxed the man from the Canning River.
A Perth man's bid to lose a police tail came undone after he found himself in shallow, muddy water just metres from a police officer trying to "coax him gently back to shore."
Canning Vale police were called to a trespassing incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they spotted the suspect he tried to ditch them by heading into the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He was standing in the water saying 'I'm not getting out, 'come and get me'," Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he employed a safer tactic - "good police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try and escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins provides a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins ditched his car to avoid a booze bus and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but did inspire locals to begin planning a tongue-in-cheek Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody alleges stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moody has alleged Racing Victoria stewards attempted to plant a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit racing immediately.
He took aim at stewards and Racing Victoria's integrity department, alleging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment the final straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Lidari's positive swab to cobalt, which he can not explain.
He had bitten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn't want it "to look like sour grapes."
"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
When they start to think I'm not that's when I shouldn't be a trainer.
I would then have to consider what I do with my licence.
Earlier, Moody had dropped the bombshell in a racing.com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my stables to offer information on what I was doing within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
They obviously believe I'm a cheat.
If that's the case surely they should all hand in their briefs because they've been incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today.
Should that make me think it's becoming personal?
Has RVL got a grow a set of balls and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what it is going on the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I've got no doubt what I'm saying now might make them think about that.
But I've got to the point now where I don't care and that saddens me.
That really saddens me.
I will put the pressure on them and onus on them to make a decision.
I've got the support of my family and I can walk away.
The trainer's frustration levels have built with the long-running cobalt inquiry involving Lidari and the late scratching had him saying that he could "throw my licence across the table."
Moody, best known for preparing unbeaten champion Black Caviar, labelled the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a mud or clay poultice had been applied to the horses legs, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I've got to accept full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg.
It could have had it last night.
It could have had it yesterday, which it did have.
It had it on race day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for the race day treatment using the poultice, which stewards have opened an inquiry into.
It is a joke.
People making these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram hit-and-run driver arrested
Police have arrested a man over a hit-and-run collision with a cyclist in Cobram at the weekend.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being struck by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist drove away without stopping to help the injured rider.
On Monday a 50-year-old Nathalia man handed himself in to police at Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with failing to stop at an accident, failing to render assistance, and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old Cobram man, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his side's tackling as "agenda setting" by the NRL's two premiership favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to "wrestle" his side during the Storm's upset win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm after his side's qualifying final win over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called that game a "showcase" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland weren't "too big" into wrestling.
Bellamy defended his side's tackling and said they just focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added he took confidence from having two leading coaches criticise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Storm beating them.
"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson bring up wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee we haven't changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or techniques, it's just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tackles and that has been the turn around for us.
Trent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting football" reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting footy.
He made a point of comparing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't give a rat's arse.
But now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting footy, especially his young halves with their speed.
That's the footy you would want to play when you have those sort of players.
He made that point in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of footy - not every team has two halves like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
To me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking of us when they get to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out the Storm and Roosters game was a higher scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet but what was the score? 16-12?
Our game it was 20-18, there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting footy?
Or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is exciting?
To me it's agendas.
If they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there.
The Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday night's preliminary final at AAMI Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man gets $200k bail on drug charge
A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled into Queensland has been granted bail on a $200,000 surety.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 kilograms of the drug from the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked at Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting with his co-accused at the marina throughout the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the cafe for an innocent purpose.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned Maksimovic was a flight risk.
He has clear connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
On the crown case he lied to police about where he was staying.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a surety of $200,000 to secure his release.
"Having read the affidavits of both those persons, it is clear that the imposition of a surety of $200,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police on a daily basis and adheres to a 6pm-6am curfew.
Fotis Katsikaris: "I'm proud of the Greek team, which fought until the final seconds".
Head Coach for Team Greece, Fotis Katsikaris, commended his team following the EuroBasket 2015 quarterfinal match against Spain (71-73).
According to him, the fate of the game was decided by a few mistakes.
It was a big game, AFP quotes Katsikaris as saying.
We were preparing for a great game by the Spaniards.
We tried to outplay them on the defence, but mistakes in the defence determined the fate of this meeting.
It's sad, but I am proud of my boys.
They fought until the final second.
Joel Freeland: "I will assume Kaun's duties in CSKA".
CSKA newcomer, Joel Freeland, stated that he doesn't believe in the Red Army curse.
The Brit also expressed confidence that his new club will manage to overcome the negative streak and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke with coach Dimitris Itoudis several times this summer, and, of course, after I joined the team, R-Sport quotes Freeland. Essentially, I will assume the duties of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in terms of defensive formations and offensively in the key, and I think I can handle this.
Sure, I'll need some time to adjust to centre position, since in the NBA I played more as a forward.
Now I will have to stand up to a large centre rival, but I used to do this before, so I think I'll be able to handle it now.
The Red Army team last won the Euroleague in 2008.
Since then, they have made it to the "Final Four" six times, but each time they weren't able to play their best basketball.
There is a perception that someone has put a hex on the team.
But that's just the essence of the game: you can't win forever.
Of course it's difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team right now, and if we show the best we are capable of, then we have a good chance of winning the Euroleague; I really think so.
I've always wanted to win this title; the Muscovites have already won this tournament, and I think that this will be CSKA's year.
As far as the hex is concerned, I'm not a superstitious person and I don't believe in curses of any kind.
I believe in hard work and determination: if you combine these two things, then anything is possible.
I don't have any specific rituals before games; I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "The match against Roma will be special for me".
Barcelona's Head Coach, Luis Enrique, didn't try to hide that he returned to Rome for the 1st round match in the group stage of the Champions League tournament against Roma with special feelings.
According to the trainer, the face-to-face match between his previous and current teams will be far from ordinary.
To recall, Luis Enrique trained the "wolves" during the 2011-12 season, but wasn't able to put his best foot forward in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome after several years, during which I had gained concrete experience, the UEFA's official website quotes Luis Enrique as saying.
I have nothing but fond memories associated with Rome.
For me, it will be a special game, but that's not all that important.
The most important thing is to start the Champions League with a victory.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the team in the upcoming match.
I'm expecting the type of game from Roma that they played in the Serie A against Juventus.
It's a strong team that understands how to put the pressure on and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: "Krasnodar has various attack options".
Ahead of the 9th round match of the Premier League with Krasnodar, Acting Head Coach for Ural, Vadim Skipchenko, mentioned the opposing team's variety of offensive tactics.
According to the trainer, the "bulls" have a number of offensive game models in their arsenal.
The match will take place on September 21 and starts at 16:30 Moscow time.
We'll still have to see how we will play against Krasnodar, Ural's official website quotes Skripchenko as saying.
We have a whole week of training ahead of us.
That team has various attack options, and conducts its attacks in a multitude of ways, but, at the same time, we're not a slow team either, and that's why I believe that it will be a very interesting game.
In the lead up to this game, keeping in mind that Krasnodar is holding a Europa League match against Borussia Dortmund, we will try to prepare very well in order to secure the victory.
Roger Cañas: "At home, Astana can score points off of anyone at all".
Following a 1st round match against Benfica (0-2) in the group stage of the Champions League, Astana midfielder, Roger Cañas, expressed confidence that his team would continue to improve the quality of its game in the future.
According to the midfielder, Astana players are capable of scoring points off of any opponent on their home field.
In spite of the fact that the match turned out to be hard for us, I can say that we played well, the UEFA's official website quotes Cañas as saying. We lacked a bit of courage in the offense.
Benfica is in a higher class, but in a home game, I think we can count on scoring points off of them.
It's totally possible.
But first, we need to think about Galatasaray and Atletico.
At home games, we can score points off of anyone.
Rafael Benitez: "I'll repeat this as often as necessary: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world".
Head Coach for Real, Rafael Benitez, expressed his satisfaction with a huge win in a 1st round match in the group stage of the Champions League against Shakhtar (4-0).
The expert commended forward Cristiano Ronaldo who scored three goals.
The match wasn't easy, because Shakhtar knows how to use the ball, the UEFA's official website quotes Benitez as saying.
The opponents didn't have many chances, but their counterattacks always present a risk.
I won't say that Real played ideally, but we had plenty of goal-scoring opportunities.
I am satisfied that we didn't let in any goals and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo reaffirmed his level.
This is the best player in the world; I'll repeat this as often as necessary.
Jordi Alba: "Cristiano Ronaldo can't compare to Messi".
Barcelona defenceman, Jordi Alba, believes that no one can compare to his teammate, Lionel Messi.
According to the Spaniard, even Real forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, can't do this.
Messi is five goals above the rest, Le Figaro quotes Abla as saying. No one can do what Messi is capable of doing.
Even Cristiano Ronaldo.
Everything on the pitch changes with Leo; I can't compare him with anyone else.
Daniele De Rossi: Barcelona not only has a unique style, but also remarkable individuals.
On the day before a match against Barcelona in the group stage of the Champions League, Roma midfielder, Daniele De Rossi, noted the importance of staying compact and having each other's back in a game against such a strong opponent.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21:45 Moscow time.
As a reminder, Sport Express will broadcast the live match ticker.
Barcelona is a special opponent and a good team with excellent players, the UEFA's official website quotes De Rossi as saying.
It's difficult to play against the blue garnets; after all, they not only have a unique style, but also remarkable individuals.
In order to win against them, we will have to work hard throughout the entire match and watch out for each other.
Messi is almost always successful when he starts jockeying, so we will have to stay close together and organised.
Yezhov hopes to make it into SKA's starting line-up in the match against Slovan.
SKA goaltender, Ilya Yezhov, stressed that he hoped to make it into the Red Army team's starting line-up in the next match of the KHL Championship.
Yezhov replaced Mikko Koskinen on the ice at the 23-minute mark with a score of 0-3 and deflected every shot on his goal; SKA let in the fourth goal after the goalie was pulled for a sixth player.
The team's next match is on the road against Slovan.
I hope that in the next match I will be in the starting line-up, R-Sport quotes Yezhov as saying.
I'm not an expert on goalies: I'm a goalie myself; they don't show us the replays of conceded goals, and so it's difficult to keep track.
Dynamo played well and everyone has bad games.
The team still lost.
It would have been better if I had let in more goals, but the team had won.
Safarova ends up in the hospital with a viral infection.
Lucie Safarova has been hospitalised with a bacterial infection, AFP reports.
At the moment, the Czech tennis player is in a clinic in Brno.
It's not clear how long the 2015 Roland Garros finalist's recovery will be.
It also bears reminding that, on Monday, Safarova moved up one place in the WTA rankings and is now the world's fifth place female tennis player.
Stevan Hogg used girls phone to lure paedophiles to send images
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to solicit child abuse images.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone as she slept then logged into an online messaging service where he had a succession of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping Hogg's hand.
She looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately alerting her mother.
Police attended and saw the five pictures, then analysed computers found at the address and discovered "concerning" web searches using terms for finding indecent image of children.
Hogg then claimed to officers he had done it as it would "lead paedophiles" on the internet before "pretending he was a police officer to scare them."
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He accepted the searches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos.
He said he was doing it to lure them in.
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rape and murder images.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone she shouted her mother and was shaking and crying.
She saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked way younger than him.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making indecent images of children on June 14 last year, breaching bail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defence solicitor Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders register as it may be argued there was "no significant sexual element" to his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred sentence until October for social work background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was placed on the sex offenders register ahead of his sentencing date.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a podium.
He was unhurt, but video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mr Mugabe during his address.
Last month, they booed and heckled him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) chief whip Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Nr Mugabe's address.
"The message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it's titled 'death'," he told journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate.
The chief whip said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "worried" about the threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-saving efforts at it enterprise services business.
HP is splitting into two listed companies later this year, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $2.7bn, beginning in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, the HP chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business," said Whitman.
As a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have more than $50bn in annual revenue and "will be focused on delivering unrivaled integrated technology solutions" to companies, according to a company statement.
It breaks up a company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electric equipment, and whose Palo Alto garage has been dubbed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has been undergoing a massive reorganisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second-largest PC maker and one of the biggest US tech firms, is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tightly focused firms perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb tie
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, providing his rehabilitation goes to plan, there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas.
That best-case scenario already means that Wilshere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and, given his history, his involvement in next summer's European Championship is clearly uncertain.
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then looked back to his old sharpness during pre-season.
"This kind of injury is not career-threatening," said Wenger.
It is a bone that did not heal well.
It is nothing major.
This was just an accident.
It was not linked with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
That might be true from a purely medical perspective but, as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the related danger of further injuries whenever any player tries to return midseason.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern developing.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different Wilshere ailments since he made his debut six years ago.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games during the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-08, they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to lose most days through injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Arsenal believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you are coming back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to get over that.
I hope his body stabilises, I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves.
With Arsenal beginning their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger may also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little breather to players who need it," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe's most intimidating.
Dinamo are also unbeaten in 41 matches after producing their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earth tremor that measured 3.2 on the Richter.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learnt the lesson of last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup triumph.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never been done at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006 but, on the other hand, I am long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar portrayals in shows is glaring, particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desperate now than ever, with suicide rates amongst young males at 15 year high.
In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in males than females.
In a bid to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Male, aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high-school students displaying depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of "healthy mood" friends, their chances of recovering doubled.
Equally, for those not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the chances of mental challenges arising.
But of course, for friendship to work, it needs to be accessible in the first place.
In this age of social-media led communication, with its focus on style over substance, immediacy of response is often prioritised over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even if in reality isolation is king.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists term extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply impacts our mental health.
And as a billionaire video-game creator explained recently, money really doesn't buy greater happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
Each of the characters were not defined by their work, but rather their personalities, which shone through the interaction as friends.
The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments watching football on the comfy chairs, and Ross's pining for Rachel, came from the knowledge that yes, men can all relate to this, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As a Samaritan worker explained to me: ...."my listening role to people feeling depressed and suicidal has really highlighted how even the smallest interactions from friends can make a difference."
Often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends.
The old adage of "getting on with it" is strong, as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the little moments of male friendship.
As much as my objective, outsider status over the phone helps people in moments of desperation, the long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friend network.
And so, if you attend Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, with the sets fully redesigned in celebration, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, better still, if in Starbucks you see someone alone, give a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcasting on Comedy Central from start to finish - the full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores to help PSG swat aside Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG ease past Swedish side Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on target as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player to set the French champions on their way, but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cavani headed home in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they target not just qualification for the knockout rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a vintage display by Laurent Blanc's side with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasteful in front of goal and later being substituted against his hometown team and the club with whom he started his illustrious career back in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on," said Blanc.
It augurs well.
We wanted to win and we did, although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-2 draw at home by Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but he was upstaged in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentina winger was labelled as the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month, and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco Verratti's pass in behind the Malmo defence before angling a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland and into the far corner of the net.
However, if anyone then expected PSG to romp to a big victory, they were to be disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, lined up with nine full internationals on the field at kick-off and, with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield, were stuffy opponents.
But, save for a Nikola Djurdjic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Trapp's far post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG let themselves down at times with some wasteful passing and poor finishing, not least from Ibrahimovic, who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cavani just after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more adept when it came to setting up his colleagues, and it was from an Ibrahimovic pass that Di Maria sent in a curling shot which was tipped around the post by Wiland on 52 minutes.
The second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan heading home his sixth of the season after Ibrahimovic had flicked on a left-wing cross from Maxwell.
That ended any ideas that Malmo had of coming back into the game, and only a superb stop by Wiland from point-blank range to deny David Luiz kept the final score down before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi had a goal disallowed right at the death.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were a class above his side, the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level.
The qualifiers are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a magnificent match from them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in share sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, hit by collapsing commodities prices, on Wednesday raised $2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt-slashing plan.
London-listed Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay down debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is grappling with tumbling commodity prices as China's economic slowdown weighs on demand and sparks havoc across markets.
The rights issue sent Glencore's share price soaring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had last week revealed the $2.5-billion shares sale as part of broader plans to slash its $30 billion debt pile by about a third.
The company sold the new stock at 125 pence per share, which marked a 2.4-percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday.
It offloaded 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns over prolonged stalled Chinese growth have slashed iron ore prices by roughly a half, as coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Washington Visit
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official one to Washington, will take place on Sept. 25 and reciprocates President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner that evening, after the two leaders have engaged in bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will present an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a range of global, regional, and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while also enabling President Obama and President Xi to address areas of disagreement constructively," the statement added.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet several U.S. tech leaders on his way to Washington, before going on to New York City for the U.N. General Assembly on Sept.
Obama and Xi are expected to broach a range of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns over China's alleged cyberespionage and its increasing assertiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
The reckless driver who hit a biker on Kutuzovsky gets 2 years in prison.
Furthermore, the court partially granted the complainants' civil claims against Deni Mirzoev in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
Moscow's Dorogomilovsky Court has sentenced Deni Mirzoev who hit and killed a motorcyclist on Kutuzovsky Prospect in Moscow.
According to Russian News Service reports, Mirzoev received a sentence of two years imprisonment in a penal colony settlement.
He was found guilty under the article "Violation of the rules for traffic safety and the operation of transport vehicles" of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
Furthermore, the court partially granted the complainants' civil claims in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
During the presentation of cases, the prosecutor asked that Mirzoev be sentenced to three years imprisonment and requested that he pay the full amount of the complainants' claims: eight million roubles.
The accident in question happened on May 22 at around three o'clock in the morning, near building No. 30 on Kutuzovsky Prospect.
Mirzoev was behind the wheel of a BMW vehicle that crossed into the oncoming lane of traffic and hit a motorcyclist standing on the side of the road.
The man, who was born in 1989, died from his injuries at the scene of the accident.
Friends of the deceased reported on social media that the driver of the BMW was travelling at high speed and crossed into oncoming traffic before the accident.
Fearing that the driver would try to evade responsibility, bikers organised a motorcycle ride from Sparrow Hills to the City Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs at 38 Petrovka.
Shortly thereafter, it became known that, following the results of the interrogation, the individual suspected of being responsible for the accident was detained.
In Moscow, a man who went into a church naked has been detained.
He behaved calmly and didn't commit any illegal acts; the police handed him over to emergency psychiatric care doctors.
The capital's police officers detained a resident of Moscow who went into one of the churches without clothes.
Moscow news agency reports on this.
According to Andrei Galiakberov, Head of the press service for the City Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Moscow, the incident took place on Tuesday, September 15, at approximately 16:00 on Kashirskoe Highway.
A naked man entered the Church of St. Nicholas.
He behaved calmly and didn't commit any illegal acts.
A police squad was called and arrived at the scene.
The law enforcement officials waited for the doctors from the emergency psychiatric care team to arrive and handed the man over to them.
He turned out to be a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
Vladimir Yakushev signs more than 40 decisions and orders.
The Governor of Tyumen region, Vladimir Yakushev, has signed more than 40 decisions and orders at a session of the presidium of the regional government.
A portion of them concerned the allocation of funds to educational and medical institutions in the municipal districts of the region.
In particular, funds were dispensed for the purchase of a bus for a school in Nizhnetavdinsky district, and for capital repairs to the regional hospital in Kazansky district.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will go towards finishing capital repairs to the second floor of the medical ward.
The hot and cold water supply network, the sewage system, the electrical supply and electrical equipment, and the ventilation system will undergo repairs; the building's façade will be refurbished; the premises will be renovated; and a series of measures concerning fire safety and energy efficiency will be completed.
The second forum of regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
From September 17-18, the second forum of regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, in which the Tyumen delegation, headed by the governor, will take part.
The Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen, Vladimir Shuglya, who is included in the official delegation, spoke about the upcoming event and the interim results of cooperation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what objectives does the Sochi forum set?
This major event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is built on the effective cooperation of the regions, and important links between the two states.
It's planned that the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko, will attend the plenary session.
During the plenary and breakout sessions, the conversation will be about the experiences of regional and municipal authorities in Russia and Belarus with the implementation of industrial policy, the regulatory and statutory framework, and the programmes of the Union State.
The Governor of Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
I think that this is evidence of the successful and sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
The forum will also be attended by representatives from relevant ministries and agencies, as well as by Russian and Belarusian businesspeople.
There will also be trade shows and specialised exhibitions, including those from Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help us sign profitable new contracts and agreements.
I'll add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk in June of last year.
More that two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia, took part in the event.
At that time, a very important cooperation agreement was signed between Tyumen and Minsk regions.
The significance of the work we have accomplished is evidenced by the fact that a meeting of the standing seminar of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumen.
Furthermore, a delegation from Tyumen region's agricultural sector visited the Republic of Belarus in order to study the experience of Belarusians with training staff in agriculture, identify additional areas of mutual interest, and organise new investment projects in the agricultural sector.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What issues did you discuss?
During the meeting with the Governor of Tyumen region, Vladimir Yakushev, the conversation was about cooperation between the region and the Republic of Belarus in today's challenging environment.
The issue of supplying Belarusian agricultural equipment and using financial mechanisms - they are needed to reduce the cost of machinery for the end-consumer - were also touched on.
Issues associated with the work of the Tyumen trading house, Belshina, and options for loss prevention, were discussed.
These are important issues, since investment projects need to work well and generate profit for the region.
The continued delivery of JSC MAZ passenger trucks and development of the JSC MAZ service centre, which was established in Tyumen at the JSC TPATP facility, were also talked about.
The conversation also concerned preparations for the visit of a working group from the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of the current year.
Another topic of discussion was the completion of negotiations and the signing of an agreement on trade-economic, scientific-technological, and cultural cooperation between Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
As such, the dynamic of our mutual relationship promises to reach a new level.
These issues also concerned the regional centre.
During the meeting with the Head of the Administration of Tyumen city, Aleksandr Moor, we talked about upgrading the Tyumen bus fleet.
Approximately 100 buses are already "at death's door", and, as such, a new set of vehicles from Belarus is needed, which will operate on clean gas fuel.
Yet another aspect: the Tyumen elevator factory is working with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products, JSC Mogilevliftmash, by procuring components from them.
In my opinion, these activities could become even more developed, given the programme to install new elevators in the regional centre.
I'll add that a meeting was held with the Governor of Kurgansk region, as part of the expanded powers of the consul, during which the issue of increasing the turnover of trade and the delivery of modern Belarusian equipment to the Trans-Ural region was discussed.
A meeting with the Governor of Omsk region is planned for the end of September.
The expanded consular district contains five federal subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called the original headquarters of the district.
The region is a testing ground for the launch of many promising projects, including the work of the honorary consul general.
On the whole, these types of meetings are important and worthwhile because they make it possible to directly and quickly resolve many issues, while removing their contentiousness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current environment, it's critically important to not undermine groundwork while continuing to develop future possibilities.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn't needed behind the scenes.
During Sunday night's episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, the seasoned actor cut Brown off while she was emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project's chosen screenplay.
"When we're talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show," Damon asserted.
Shocked, Brown reacted with offended disbelief, letting out "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as The Martian actor's comments settled in the air.
Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I would urge people to think about -- whoever the director is, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony," Brown initially said.
The only black character who's a hooker who gets hit by her white pimp.
The Dear White People producer pushed for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted their directing could "end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disapproval over Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger toward the clip writing, "Matt Damon speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is SO WHITE it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since being posted.
Damon's comments come at a time where accurate racial representation in media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took nationwide effect, urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince alluded to the movement while introducing the nominees of Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question of whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," leaders said.
Damon was recently announced as one of a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church's portrayal in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Pro-rock climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win American Ninja Warrior Monday night taking home the $1 million grand prize.
The competition show, which just wrapped up its 7th season, has never seen any competitor complete all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
The final task involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten went first completing the challenge on time, making him the first-ever athlete to complete American Ninja Warrior's grueling stage 4, however, Caldiero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard-fought victory, still in shock about winning the $1 million grand prize.
"I mean it's amazing to think about, like I've never made or lived off more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! of his serious pay-bump.
So to all of a sudden...like I can't even imagine what it's going to be like...the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why, despite Britten being the first ever competitor to finish the course, won't be awarded any prize money.
By the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finisher, the one with the fastest time gets it," said Weed.
As much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing, he does get the great gratification.
I don't think he harbors any ill will about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he's done.
He's received tons of accolades from fans.
He's such a great guy, and a family man.
He's a hero to his kids and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I was going to be beat by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they roles were reversed.
America Ninja Warrior was renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in Spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers tiptoe past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half the season hasn't been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central.
Reducing to being a spoiler, the Tigers played the part perfectly Tuesday, beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins squandered a chance to climb to within one-half game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that has been so elusive over much of the season's second half.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it happens," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon made his early offensive support hold up, as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then tacked one in the sixth and one more in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third quality start in his past nine outings.
"I just want to finish strong this year," Simon said.
It's hard for the bullpen to throw every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good in (batting practice), looked noticeably better in BP, and he carried it right into the game.
Trailing by three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton led off the inning with a double down the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached on a bunt single, and Simon got second baseman Brian Dozier to strike out swinging before being lifted for left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only man he faced, ahead of rookie designated hitter Miguel Sano, who ripped a two-run single to left off right-hander Drew VerHagen.
With a pair of runners on and the tying run at second, VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to ground into a double play.
It was the major-league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit into a DP.
After Detroit tacked on an insurance run in the top of the ninth, Mauer ripped an RBI double to the gap against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon to make it 5-4.
However, the right-hander struck out Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of a rusty Phil Hughes in the early going.
The Tigers posted three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander, who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inflammation.
"Obviously not the start I'd like to have," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After getting the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk to right fielder J.D. Martinez brought up Victor Martinez, who singled up the middle for the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez snapped his 0-for-21 streak with runners in scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to right, scoring another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out trying to advance to third, ending the threat.
The Tigers added on in the second, getting a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
"That was a big hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit it particularly well, but he got it in the right spot.
Hughes, who was on a pitch count, pitched a scoreless third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed surgery on Sanchez's shoulder back in 2007.
Sanchez, on the disabled list with a shoulder strain since mid-August, was scheduled to be activated for a Wednesday start.
With Sanchez out, LHP Daniel Norris will come off the DL to start against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a trade for LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been out since Aug. 20 with a strained right oblique.
The Tigers and Twins will wrap up their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will oppose Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Kadyrov's original complaint regarding the book, "A Prayer to God", has been received by the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Court.
The original appeal by the Presidential Representative for Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, against the decision to recognise the book, "A Prayer to God: It's meaning and place in Islam", as "extremist material", has been received by the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Court, Interfax reports, with reference to the chairperson of the city court, Aleksandr Chukhrai.
The court is now waiting for possible objections from parties to the proceedings.
Chukhrai declined to comment on statements by several deputies from the Russian State Duma about the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence agencies and ISIS.
"Let them comment on such stupidity themselves", he said.
On September 11, the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against the decision by Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognise the book as "extremist material".
An appeal from the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Prosecutor's Office was received Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they asked the court to only recognise the opinion of the author of the book as extremist and not the verses from the Koran.
It is the opinion of the prosecutor's office that the judge made the wrong ruling", Chukhrai stated.
The decision to recognise the book as "extremist material" was made on August 12, 2015.
Specifically, the following quotes from the Koran were dubbed "extremist": "We worship You and we pray to You for help" and "Do not invoke anyone along with Allah".
Kadyrov has called those who made the ruling about the book "devils and provocateurs".
He has requested State Duma deputies to legislatively ban the court's decision concerning the texts from the holy book.
"I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should adopt a law that would ban court rulings related to texts from the Koran and other Divine Scriptures", Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram account.
Facebook will delete comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to delete posts and comments in which a negative assessment of migrants and refugees is given.
Furthermore, the social network will provide financial support to organisations that collect user complaints about content that violates Facebook's community standards.
Facebook's management intends to fight the rise of xenophobia and racism on the network in cooperation with Germany's Ministry of Justice.
As such, yesterday, the agency's head, Heiko Maas, stated that the Ministry of Justice was currently working with social media specialists to create special groups of moderators.
Group participants will be required to monitor and delete inappropriate comments about migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is expected that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notices explaining the reason for the deletion of their entries.
The organisations and specialists involved in collecting incoming complaints from network users about offensive posts will also assist with the timely blocking of content that violates Facebook's community standards.
Facebook's management intends to provide them with the required financial support.
The decision to delete posts containing negative remarks about migrants and refugees was made by the social network's management and Germany's Ministry of Justice following a significant rise in xenophobic attitudes on the German section of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for this has been the migration crisis, unprecedented in size, gripping the countries of the European Union recently.
For example, in Germany today, all of the locations designated for accommodating refugees are already overcrowded.
Yesterday, the country's authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants at the former concentration camp, Buchenwald.
The forced migrants from Middle Eastern and African countries are being housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held during the Nazi regime.
Relaxation areas will appear at Moscow cemeteries.
In the near future, several cemeteries in the capital will be equipped with special areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
The first of them will be Butovskoye, Domodedovskoye, and Shcherbinskoye cemeteries.
The very first area for psychological rest has already appeared at Troyekurovskoye cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar areas will appear in other districts of the city.
Artem Ekimov, who holds the post of head of the state-funded institution (SFI), Ritual, spoke to m24.ru portal about this.
The relaxation areas will look like small green spaces, reminiscent of parks.
According to specialists, cemetery visitors will be able to relax in these "corners", be alone with their thoughts, and gather psychological strength.
Soon, relaxation areas will be built at Domodedovskoye, Butovskoye, and Shcherbinskoye cemeteries, and then in other districts of the capital.
According to the head of the SFI, Ritual, in the event an expansion of the cemetery's area is required, builders will try to preserve existing wooded areas to the greatest extent possible.
Greenery will serve as a living fence that will separate the relaxation areas and the territory just outside that is designated for burial.
SFI Ritual's experts also stated their intention to submit a proposal to ban fences at gravesites.
New cemeteries really could become barrier-free.
Furthermore, SFI Ritual spoke about a readiness to engage in installing electronic terminals that cemetery visitors could use to help figure out the GPS coordinates and plate numbers of gravesites.
In June of this year, SFI Ritual also proposed adjusting the cost of burial services depending on the time of year.
So, digging a grave in the summertime will cost one thousand roubles less than in the winter weeks when the ground is frozen.
It bears noting that, over the past year, prices for all types of ritual services have increased by an average of 10 percent.
Lost mushroom picker is found in Elninsky woods after five days.
The elderly man turned out to be alive even though he had spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without provisions.
The poor mushroom picker was found thanks to the joint efforts of rescue workers and volunteers.
Aleksandr Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old pensioner from Tambov region spent five days in the woods."
Without food or water.
Relatives, rescue workers, and volunteers were searching for him.
There were even cynologists with dogs, but to no avail.
The man was only found after a helicopter joined the search efforts.
On that day, Vitaly Aleksandrovich went out into the woods, as per usual, to collect honey fungus and birch boletus mushrooms, but he hadn't returned by the evening.
Relatives immediately called for help and, already on the next day, rescue workers and concerned residents from the neighbouring village started searching: there were approximately 30 people in total.
On the fifth day, a helicopter from the fire-rescue centre joined them.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue group section of the Smolensk Region Fire and Rescue Centre, said: "The helicopter was brought in and the man was found".
He had walked very far away, into a totally different area.
It was around 12 km from the search area.
He travelled a huge distance for his age.
It's a miracle he's still alive.
The mushroom picker was admitted to Elninsky Central District Hospital unconscious and in critical condition.
Paramedics diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as with severe dehydration and hypothermia.
Doctors can't fathom how the elderly man could still be alive after spending five days in the woods.
Valentina Nepsha, Head of the medical ward at Elninsky Central District Hospital: "An examination of the patient has been completed and treatment has been determined".
Intravenous and antibacterial treatments.
While taking into account all of his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, and it remains critical, but with positive tendencies.
The pensioner, Vitaly Aleksandrovich, comes to Smolenshchina from Tambov region every year.
His grandson says that his grandfather had gone collecting mushrooms before, but he had never gone deep into the woods.
Aleksei Spitchenko, grandson of the found mushroom picker, shared the following: "The woods aren't far from the road; he's not really a local himself."
He's just been coming to visit for a few years now, to visit relatives.
And well, he went out to collect mushrooms.
Obviously, he went a little too far and got lost.
With the beginning of mushroom-picking season, people frequently get lost in all districts of Smolensk region.
Over just the past several days, there have been five similar cases.
Rescue workers offer this reminder: you must go out into the woods in bright clothing, with a small supply of food, matches, and a compass.
Furthermore, it's advisable to leave a trail behind you, so that later on it's possible to find your way back.
An emergency AN-2 lands in a clearing in the Bratsk taiga.
The emergency AN-2 landed right in a clearing in Siberia.
The emergency landing of the plane owned by Yenisei airline company was completed 68 kilometres from Bratsk.
There are no dead or injured, but the plane was seriously damaged during the landing.
The AN-2 was conducting a service flight.
There were three crew members on-board: a captain, a co-pilot, and a flight mechanic, Interfax reports.
The emergency plane was flying a route between Zheleznogorsk, Ilimsky, and Achinsk, where the airline company is based.
The flight crew has already been delivered to Bratsk.
Following the emergency landing of the AN-2, the Bratsk Transport Prosecutor's Office started to look into compliance with flight safety regulations.
An investigation team from the Eastern Siberian Transport Prosecutor's Office has left for the scene of the accident.
In September 2010, the flight crew of a Tu-154, due to a technical failure, landed their plane with passengers on-board at an abandoned airfield in the taiga in Komi.
The engines and on-board electronics on the airliner failed, but the flight crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on-board the plane.
No one was injured during the emergency landing of the plane.
Vesti Economy - Nobel Laureate: Globalisation
Printing the Processes of Globalisation should have helped to reduce inequality in the world.
In practice, the situation looks entirely different; the income gap in developing economies is, on the contrary, growing.
Eric Maksin.
To correct this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, says Chief Research Fellow at the International Laboratory of Decision Choice and Analysis at the National Research University, Higher School of Economics (NRU HSE), and 2007 Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics, Eric Maksin.
Over the past twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly more open.
Proponents of globalisation predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have to a great extent come true", Maksin underscores.
So, for example, China and India achieved significant GDP per capita growth.
However, not everything is so rosy.
It was expected that globalisation would narrow the gap between the "haves" and the "have-nots" in poor countries, which presents itself in the form of income inequality, or, to be more exact, wages.
But, in reality, this inequality only became more pronounced, Eric Maksin points out in his article "Why global markets haven't reduced inequality in developing economies", which was published in The World Bank Economic Review, and was translated and quoted by the NRI HSE.
Eric Maksin, in cooperation with the economist and professor from Harvard University, Michael Kremer, developed an alternative theory, which demonstrates why income inequality increases in poor countries in proportion to the growth of globalisation, NRI HSE recalls.
Specific processes are at play in the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, Maksin distinguishes four skill levels for specialists: A and B for wealthy countries, and C and D for poor ones.
After globalisation, the D specialists from poor countries don't have the required skill level to cooperate with specialists A and B from wealthy countries.
And while the wages of C level workers from poor countries rise thanks to cooperation with B colleagues from wealthy ones, D workers either don't experience the same effect or their salaries totally plunge.
The resulting effect is that the internationalisation of production will lead to an increase in the wage gap between these two categories of specialists in poor countries and, consequently, increased levels of inequality.
Kremer and E. Maksin have proposed a remarkably beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It makes it possible to explain why globalisation has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, tenured professor, Head of the International Laboratory of Decision Choice and Analysis, and Head of the Department of Mathematics at NRI HSE.
And, like any powerful theory, I am sure it will lead to an upsurge of empirical work in this field.
The solution to the problem, in Eric Maksin's opinion, is to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, the academic notes, don't have the money for this, and it's not profitable for companies to pay for their training.
In a situation like this, governments, international agencies, NGOs, and private foundations can play a significant role, Maksin believes.
The academic notes that the developed theory in no way calls for an end to the process of globalisation, which has brought and will bring benefits in the form of GDP growth of countries.
Derbent: a living link with time.
Derbent is one of the most ancient cities in Russia; in September, it celebrates its 2000th anniversary.
The programme of celebratory events includes: a festival of the ethnic cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of times past; an exhibition of Derbent carpets and an open-house day at places of worship; a historical-musical show, "2000 years in one hour", and tours of the renovated Peter I Museum.
The medieval stone Naryn-Kala fortress, old Arabic inscriptions on walls, narrow streets, and palace gardens: all of it appears as if from the pages of "One thousand and one nights".
Derbent is the only Russian city that has survived in the same place since antiquity.
Even though it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar Khaganate, and the Golden Horde.
The age of the oriental planes that grow in the courtyard of Derbent's Juma mosque equals several centuries.
These massive plants are protected under the All-Russia "Trees are the monuments of living nature" programme.
The shade of the spreading crown saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
A visitor to the mosque is poured aromatic tea and offered Dagestani delicacies: honey fig, persimmon, medlar, miracle flatbread, ayran, and sweets.
Large samovars have been used in Derbent since the dawn of time so that tea can be served to many guests at one time.
The inscription at the entrance to the Juma mosque says that the building was constructed in the 115th year of the Hijra.
That is, in the year 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
It is the most ancient mosque in Russia.
The interior dazzles in terms of scale and solemnity: the arcades of domes and arches rest on square columns and are lit by sunlight streaming through miniature windows.
Keeping and breeding doves is a traditional pastime for residents of Derbent.
Owners of these domesticated birds place dovecotes in courtyards, under trees, and in attics.
It's a spectacular sight to see a flock of white doves take off into the sky, looking like a flash of festive fireworks.
In order to defend against the ancient Persian enemies, the Caspian gates were blocked off by twin stone walls.
Jutting out 500 metres into the sea, this construction enclosed Derbent's harbour.
In 2003, Derbent's fortress walls were included on UNESCO's world heritage list as the best-preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
Carpets were woven in Derbent as far back as in the fifth century, and the technique for this unique craft has remained almost unchanged up to the present day.
Carpets to suit every taste are sold on one of the streets adjacent to the city market: carpets woven from wool, cotton, or felt, in every colour and shade, with long or short pile and complex designs and whimsical fringe.
Construction of the city began with magals: neighbourhoods of single-story stone buildings.
For many years, the magals remained virtually unchanged.
Only the satellite dishes, air conditioners on the walls, and streetlights serve as reminders that you are in a modern and not a medieval city.
In the old part of the city, parts of the aqueduct, built by the Persians approximately a thousand years ago, are preserved.
Ancient springs, from which local residents still collect water, survive to the present day.
Many residents of Derbent prefer the water from the trusted historical fountains to regular tap water.
Derbent was one of the centres of the pottery trade.
Glazed and painted vases, dishes, pitchers, and cups were prized throughout the Caucasus.
Even today, potters' hands produce marvellous ceramic works for both everyday use and as souvenirs.
During holiday and festival days, crowds of spectators gather under a tightrope, where students from the Republican School of Circus Arts perform.
The history of this amazing and risky artform dates back several centuries.
A new trend is seeing increasingly more girls amongst the tightrope walkers.
Today, the Museum of Culture and Everyday Life of Ancient Derbent operates at the location of the former Maiden's Bathhouse.
Previously, this is where unmarried and betrothed young women would wash themselves in the company of their girlfriends, but now, anyone who wants to can see the vaulted domed hall, hot and cold pools, and bathing tools from times past.
The majority of Derbent's homes have hot water, but bathhouses and steam rooms are just as popular today as they were in the old days.
The benefit of warming the body with steam was written about in ancient books.
After using the bathhouse, the blood is improved, the muscles no longer feel tired, and the body gains flexibility and a sense of lightness.
Ethnic households from many areas of Dagestan participate in the Fellowship Festival, which is held at the Naryn-Kala fortress.
Participants in ethnic costumes dance, play folk music, perform songs of the peoples of the Caucasus, and treat visitors to delicious homemade cheese.
Kyrkhlyar is the burial site of forty martyrs who laid down their lives for Islam.
It is one of the most revered sites for Muslims in the North Caucasus.
The sarcophagi, yellowed by time and carved from solid stone blocks, are oriented on a west-east axis, as is the Arab custom.
Brothers, Gavril and Albert Yakubov, cut hair and shave clients in a small shop near the Upper Bazaar.
The barbershop has been operating at this site for many years.
The tricks of the barber trade are passed down from generation to generation.
Moreover, the Yakubov brothers can do not only traditional, but also the most modern hairstyles.
On one of the streets of the Old City, a house where exiled Decembrist writer, Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, lived, has been preserved.
Having learned Turkish and collected ethnographic materials, he described Derbent in the first third of the 19th century, with its ancient monuments and the everyday life of its citizens.
The teahouse is a traditional meeting place in the East, where only tea and home-baked goods are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, converse with friends, and resolve business issues.
As in the past, it is not recommended that women cross the threshold of a teahouse.
Derbent's dance troupe, Caspian, was founded three years ago, but it has already managed to participate in events at the republican and national level.
The troupe's principal performers rehearse every day, perfecting Avar, Dargin, Tat, and Armenian folk dances.
At nightfall, when the noise fades away and the streetlights come on, local residents settle onto benches outside of their homes with protruding terraces.
Usually, Derbent residents discuss everyday issues.
But in the lead-up to the anniversary, they increasingly recall episodes from the unique history of their city, which has influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea and Caspian region.
A business "game in the airport" takes place at Domodedovo.
A new form of training is being tested in the capital.
Four hundred students tried their hand at being airport staff.
To accomplish this, three airport models were built at Domodedovo.
The young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also maintained the airplanes.
All of this was in the form of a business simulation game, however, in terms of difficulty, it was on par with real life.
Delayed flights, two passengers with broken bones on-board at the same time, and a gangway that got lost somewhere on the way to the airplane.
For a real airport this would be hell.
But for those set up in the hangar at Domodedovo, it was just a standard set of tasks that the rookies needed to address.
Three large airports from different countries of the world were contained in just one hangar.
Four hundred students from colleges and universities in the capital are working inside of it today.
It's an unprecedented chance to learn everything about the inner workings of an airport.
The registration of passengers, maintenance of airplanes, handling of baggage - they were even entrusted with operating the buses on the tarmac, the gangways, and the inspection of passengers.
And passengers are full of problems.
One has an issue with their documents, another missed their flight, and a third filled their bag with suspicious items.
And all of this must be dealt with, as in real life, within the shortest time frame.
For each of these completed tasks, they are given a certain amount of virtual money, as if the airline company were paying them a given amount for servicing the flight.
"For failing to complete given tasks, they were penalised with a fine", explains the game's financial analyst, Dmitry Khilko, in an interview with the programme Vesti-Moskva.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely watching these events.
For them, this test is an effort to try out a new type of training.
They've already found a place for it in a secondary vocational education course.
"Six interregional centres of excellence will be created, which, essentially, will become the new business models for modern colleges, with an up-to-date management system, highly-qualified staff, and the latest equipment", says Natalya Zolotareva, Director of the Department of State Policy in the area of labour force training and continuing professional education at the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation.
Although, the students aren't really concerned about grand plans.
After three days of such training, it looks like they are in need of a day off.
On the plus side, the marks for this exam were expressed in entirely material terms.
The very latest smart glasses, better than anything else I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding in a timely manner to complaints about our airport on Instagram", said a satisfied game participant, PR Manager for the "Frankfurt Airport" team, Sergei Shuvalov.
The judges took note, so to speak, of the very best, in order to offer them jobs at the end of the training.
The US Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret in relation to the closure of the American Centre, which operated out of the Library of Foreign Literature.
The Centre operated in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The US Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the US Embassy's American Centre at the M.I. Rudomino All-Russian State Library in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation as of late call into question the commitment of the Russian government to the relationship between the Russian and American peoples, which was maintained even during the Cold War and other difficult moments in the long history of relations between our countries", reads a statement by US Ambassador John Tefft received by Interfax.
The American Centre created deep and strong ties between the people and the cultures of Russia and the United States.
It was a centre of American culture, history, and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a venue for meetings with many notable American figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, academics, politicians, and writers.
"Just last year, the American Centre held more than 400 cultural and educational events and welcomed more than 50 thousand Russian visitors", the diplomat underscored.
Tefft recalled that, about a year ago, a decision was made to close another joint Russian-American project: The FLEX educational exchange programme (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal turns out to be quick to judge.
A typical situation: four officials stand in front of Judge Swatanter Kumar's bench while listening to his complaints about work done.
The court is entirely unsatisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't provide you with a 110-page order for you to make a mockery of it, says Kumar.
If even just one more brick is put up, we will order that every existing building site be demolished.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NGT), a judicial authority established in 2010, in order to stop the rapid pollution of the environment that has accompanied the explosive economic growth of the past decades.
Since that time, the Tribunal has managed to hear more than 10 thousand cases related to air pollution, waste collection, geological developments, hazardous waste, and the construction of dikes.
In two out of three cases, the court rules to halt construction that is causing pollution.
The stakes are unbelievable high: in the not quite 60 years that have passed since the declaration of independence, intensified industrial development has turned India from a country of unadulterated jungles into one of the most over-populated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is especially acute in large metropolitan areas where the development of infrastructure is lagging behind rapid urbanisation: cities are blanketed by thick smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and industrial and household waste, and the few remaining residential areas are being razed to build new residential neighbourhoods.
Despite the government's formal support of the green movement, the NGT is regularly criticised by Narendra Modi's government, since it is frequently the main cause for the cancellation of large investment projects.
For example, in May of this year, the Minister of the Environment called the courts rulings "extreme" and "unenforceable".
Sometimes the court's decisions really are impossible to carry out within the judicially set timeframe, confirms Raj Panjwani, an environmental lawyer.
However, impossible deadlines have an upside: at least they force the responsible parties to get cracking.
"Its main purpose is to shake up this system", the lawyer adds.
The Green Tribunal has already cancelled major projects on several occasions: construction of an airport, an electrical power station, and hundreds of other smaller facilities has been terminated on its account.
Furthermore, they also try not to forget about the people: for example, during deliberation on the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telangana that had polluted the local river with fluoride.
We could shutdown your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs", Kumar commented on his ruling.
However, similar explanations are by no means always met with understanding from ordinary people, whose lives could be changed by one stroke of the judicial pen.
For example, in April, the Tribunal issued a ruling to ban transport vehicles older than 10 years from entering the capital, which caused a nation-wide outcry.
In spite of a steep decline in popularity and a barrage of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to reverse the ruling.
Instead, he requested statistics on inbound and outbound vehicular traffic from the Delhi government, and also submitted a proposal to purchase 10 thousand additional buses, after having checked in advance with the factories whether or not they were capable of filling such an order.
As sources of pollution like landfills, fuel quality, and even road incidents started to fall into the purview of the court, the people's wrath began to gradually dissipate.
But the most painful subject for the principled judge became the clean-up programme for the Ganges River, which was announced to great fanfare by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When talking about the Ganges, a river that is sacred to Hindus, the judge is often unable to restrain his emotions and will switch to shouting.
Do you know what the word "sacred" means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges onto a statue of a god and it ended up covered in faecal matter, the judge states angrily.
You continue to pollute the river because you think: the Ganges is the Ganges and it washes away all of our sins.
This is the river that we worship, but just look at what you do to it every day.
The clean up of the Ganges is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the level of faecal bacteria in the river exceeds acceptable norms by more than 120 times.
Every year, anywhere between 1.5 and 3 million of the 700 million Hindus that bathe in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated the money received from the sale of the outfit he wore when he met Barack Obama, as well as 455 other items from his personal collection, to the Save the Ganges Foundation.
Environmentalists immediately accused the Prime Minister of populism: the outfit was purchased for 700 thousand dollars, while the clean up of the river requires at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India still has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country; nevertheless, they don't believe that the environment should be the cost of progress.
"Conversations about the environment in a developing country are often perceived as being an unaffordable luxury, says an activist for the Ganga Ahvaan organisation, Mallika Bhanot.
But the court is trying to find a middle ground between the environment and development".
A man pours blood on several Dali paintings at an exhibit in Riga.

Xi urges to open economy wider to world
The economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering reform on Tuesday.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise, and improve opening-up policies," he said, addressing the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vitality, and provide new room for economic growth, Xi said.
The leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access, relaxation of border-control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and overhauling the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list, identifying sectors and businesses that are off-limits for investment, will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs.
The move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in allocating resources, ensuring a law-based business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies, making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses.
The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In a bid to open up state-controlled sectors, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment, and will protect the lawful interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits, or "green card," by optimizing requirements and streamlining the application process.
Guaranteeing lawyers' right to practice and nurturing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang, and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.
