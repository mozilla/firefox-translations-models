This not only proves the already widespread theory that in any case certain dinosaurs had feathers, but also offers more details than fossils, such as the color and three-dimensional placement.
. According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or a rachis, but do have other characteristics of feathers - such as hooks.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that these were not used to fly, but to regulate the temperature or to what it looked like. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this monster shows mature feathers and therefore not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the monster had an adult's plumage and not the down of a chick.

In France, hardly any technology is needed for voting: voters go into a box and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope that says which candidate they are voting for.
Officials first check the identity of the voter. Then the voter slides the envelope into the ballot box and then he puts his signature under the voice roll.
The process is relatively closely laid down in France's electoral law.
Voting buses have to be transparent since 1988, so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in them at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes other than those of registered and authorized voters are added.
The candidates can send representatives to witness any part of the trial. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Her first was the Slalom, where she got a Did Not Finish on her first run. 36 out of 116 participants received the same result in that race.
In the other match she participated in, the incumbent Great Slalom, she became tenth of the ladies, with a combined time of 4:41:30. That's 2:11:60 minutes slower than Austrian winner Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four skiers from the women's group for the sitting slalom could not finish their rides and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to place themselves during the race.
The stolen laptop and cell phone have been recovered by Madhya Pradesh police.
According to Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya have arrested five of the Swedish woman's rapists and found her cell phone and laptop. 
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was inducted into Great Yarmouth, at James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court of killing her son.
She is in custody awaiting the indictment and the trial, but the eyewitness account may have been covered up because her story has been frequently published.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have labeled the publication of photographs as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists play a dangerous game when they publish photos etc. of suspects.'
Crown Office is in general charge of prosecutions and has indicated to journalists that no further rulings will be made, at least until charges have been made.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute settlement, something the Palestinians were eager to do on the grounds of the borders for the war in the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, a city sacred to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding that, after signing an agreement, there has been a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years. However, the PA is only prepared to have a five-year presence.
Gunmen in the additional pest control trial had to be closely monitored by forest rangers. The trial was followed and its effectiveness was assessed.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen gunmen for the first shooting operation have had extensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a nine-member new electoral council (Provisional Electoral Council of CEP).
With this, Martelly has achieved a CEP five times in the last four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the earlier National Electoral Council. This is part of a package of measures so that new elections are held in the country.
The committee was set up by Martelly in response to the widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests arose due to the absence of elections, some of which should have taken place since 2011.
There have been about 60 cases reported from faulty iPods that overheat. In total, this led to six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was familiar with the 27 accidents associated with the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents that the company called "not serious." 
'Very regrettable,' the ministry's response to the fact that Apple postponed the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07:19 local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
The Northern Marianaeans' Office for Calamity Management stated that no damage has been reported nationwide.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former policeman from the Philippines has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists.
Several hostages have been brought to safety and for the time being at least six fatalities have been confirmed.
Six hostages were previously released, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an elderly woman who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot eventually.
Liggins went to work in medicine and followed the example of his father.
Trained as a midwife, he went to work at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working in hospital, Liggins conducted preliminary birth research in his spare time.
His research showed that the maturation of the fetal lungs of babies was accelerated by administering a hormone.
Xinhua has reported that government investigators found two 'black boxes' with flight recorders on Wednesday.
Co-wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first "Queen of Extreme." My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. as unique as she was. A strong woman." 
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels indicated that 'Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even weirder... I love her and I'm going to miss her... hopefully she's in a better place'.
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who opposed the fact that Australia became a republic rose by 8 per cent since 2008.
Demissionary Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the participants of this poll supported this view. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last prince.
29 per cent of respondents felt that Australia should become a republic once it's possible, and at the other end, 31 per cent said that should never happen.
The Olympic winner of the gold medal swam the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and three relay competitions during the Commonwealth Games, but his condition was questioned because of his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to ease his pain, because they're banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematical and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number at the moment on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using various hardware and software and this one has been announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source through which water has come to Earth, along with organic matter that forms proteins and sustains life.
Scientists hope to gain insight into the way planets form. They especially want to know how the earth originated, given that it has been a long time since comets with the earth have collided.
Cuomo (53) was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and signed a law last month that legalizes same-sex marriages.
He called the gossip "political nonsense and chatter." 
There is speculation that he wants to run for president in 2016.
With the NextGen system, aircraft could take shorter routes, according to the FAA, which could save millions of tons of fuel annually for lower carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technologies with ground radars, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better, and allow them to provide pilots with clearer information.
No additional transport is used and no above-ground trains stop at Wembley; in addition, the parking spaces and the P&R are not accessible on the premises.
A possible lack of transport caused the chance that the match would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published in the scientific journal Science on Tuesday was about the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden, reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process took much longer because the crossing of a native Darwin finch, the Middle Ground Finch, with an immigrated Cactus Groundfinch, the Española Ground Finch, lasted longer.
Gold can be processed into many forms. It can be rolled up in small forms.
It can be pulled into a narrow wire that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into plates.
After it is made very thin, it can be stuck on another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books that were called 'enlightened manuscripts'.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You are already creating an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Then the color of the carbon juice changes based on the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
Based on the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical that has been tested, the pH value is indicated.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, wet your hands and clean and make a ball of it.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of casing.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet that was connected to an advanced sewage system.
Sewerage remains have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Furthermore, there were already toilets in China, Egypt and Persia in ancient times. For example, in the era of the Romans, toilets were often part of a public bathhouse, in which both ladies and gentlemen came together in a mixed group.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it will be returned immediately.
The satellite was shot into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and image.
To power a satellite or telescope in space, you need to have a huge rocket that is more than 30 meters long. 
The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing that the wheel has given us is easier and faster transport.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result of this.
There are felines of medium size between that prey of average size eating, from hares to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as loose cats kept as pets) that hunt larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
Their success stems from the idea of a niche, a special job that every cat has that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called troops.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are family of each other and also have up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are normally closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A troop of lions behaves pretty much the same as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that look surprisingly much like lions (but not other big felines), and that are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not well), swim, jump great distances and have five times as much pulling power as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones who can roar.
A tiger does not roar out of full power like a lion. It's more like he's growling a whole sentence.
The favorite meal of ocelots are small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they succeed. The ocelot hunts almost exclusively on animals that are much smaller than it is.
Scholars suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey), by smelling the ground where these have been.
They can see very well in the dark through night vision and move very unobtrusively. Ocelotts hunt prey by making one with the environment and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) become detached from the large population from which they originate (for example, by moving over a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to another island, from where they cannot return easily), they are often in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, different raw materials and other enemies occur, so the new population has to stand up differently or adapt to cope with the competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called species formation and simply involves the formation of new species. Species formation is an unpreventable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in and they absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Through photosynthesis, the plants extract their nutrients from the sun. They also provide shade.
Our homes and clothes are made of plants. We mainly eat plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaur was at the top of the food chain of the time. He had nothing to fear from anyone except from other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, meaning nothing or no one could escape him.
It's not certain, but possibly his tongue was forked. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and perhaps even its own kind.
In water features, nothing was safe from the attacks either; giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him either.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their portion of strange or unusual treats, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a kind of rodent called a sleeping mouse.
In addition, there was another difference; poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, but rich men liked to hold a banquet together where they were lying on their side while eating.
Meals from Roman antiquity do not contain food that has come to Europe in later centuries from America or Asia.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa. Moreover, no ancient Roman has ever eaten a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for all their gods. This temple was seen as the God's own house.
One made sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with organizing ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a back room that was only accessible to priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, towers were built in the form of pyramids, called ziggoerats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family often took place outside.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests and therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had few inhabitants. According to Norwegian sagas, Erik the Red was banned from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west and gave his name.
He made this discovery, but there were already Eskimostammen living there at the time.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the persons, the royal family, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different.
You may think after the film National Treasure that there is a treasure map behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is based on a misconception. There's something written on the back, but it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the American Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original American Declaration of Independence, dd. 4 July 1776'. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
While no one is sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (from 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was previously rolled up for storage.
So it seems that the designation has simply been added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the fighting that followed, the north of France was liberated. The south, however, remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy-France. These were French people who joined the Germans in 1940 and thus healed with the enemy instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated southern France within just two weeks. Then they headed to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, which means bourgeois, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, which again stands for citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and that also defines in a certain way the format of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and balanced spread.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence behind. Thus, they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states under the articles of the Confederacy formed a weak central government, consisting only of a congress.
It lacked the congress in power to levy taxes, because there was no national executive or judiciary and for carrying out all decisions on state authorities trusted those often did not want to cooperate.
Nor did it have the authority to ignore tax laws and tariffs between states.
First, all states had to unanimously agree to the articles, before they could be modified, but the states did not take the national government so seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team worldwide, is the second most successful team and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, sword fighting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports is especially popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (with the largest island of Honshu). Japan is the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands at its disposal Japan, Japan is often referred to geographically as a 'peninstral island'
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe sail along the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself in the southwest of Taiwan as a base, where the VOC tackled the indigenous grain production processes and put Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas were conquered by men of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated in the year 1885 as the province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, in which sovereignty over Taiwan is transferred to Japan, which governs the island until 1945.
Constructed of three large constructions, the Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three-Range Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists get a better idea of what they looked like before.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had recovered. The renovation is still underway.
For example, worldwide the most common photo format for still images is 35 mm, which was the usual film format in the end of the analog film age.
These are produced to this day, although it is mainly the ratio of the image that the image sensor took over from the digital camera.
Strangely enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, at a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (particulate by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) would be 3:2 in that case.
Many common formats (e.g. APS-like layouts) are similar to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
The rule of third parties, which is widely abused and which is found ridiculous by many, is a simple guideline through which the image is dynamic, and yet also clear.
The most effective place for the main subject lies at the intersection of the lines. This way you divide the image vertically and horizontally into threes (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic church was under fire.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has connected European states, despite language differences and differences in customs.
From the king to the ordinary citizen, his all-pervading power had an impact on everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that prosperity must be used to combat suffering and poverty and the church has funds for this reason.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to begin to doubt whether this principle was adhered to.
Britain instituted a sea blockade directed against Germany, just after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, because it was no longer possible to provide vital provisions to military and civilians. However, this blockade did violate the generally accepted international law that has been enshrined in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has placed mines in international waters so that no more ships could sail in whole parts of the ocean, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unrestrained undersea warfare.
During the 20's, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever taking place again.
Tesla immigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he only had 4 cents, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) for Thomas Edison with him.
Ancient China had a unique way to display different time periods; every stage of China or every ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
Also between the different dynasties there was an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most famous was the era of the Three Kingdoms, this has taken place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasty.
There were fierce wars at that time between different nobles who fought for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the era of the Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in the battle for the highest spot in Xi'an's grand palace.
The Revolution has had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from the absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism and the view that the country belongs to its inhabitants rather than a single leader.
For all male applicants, positions were available after the revolution, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same goes for the military. The army ranks are no longer based on one's class but on the caliber of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolutionize.
Muhammad was intensively involved in superterrestrial issues. He often went for reflection to a cave that later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mountains of Noer.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on one of mountain peaks on the north side of Mecca and is completely closed off from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it was not easy to find at all. Once inside the cave there is total isolation.
The only thing to see are the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. There is very little of this world to see or hear from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of the countless pyramid structures in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
 The Plateau of Giza or 'pyramids of Giza' in the Egyptian valley of the dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the large sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built as a tribute to the women and relatives of Khufu.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a staple or a square whose bottom is missing. 
Upstairs means you have to start at the tip and push away the bow. Under means that you have to start at the bow frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and put on the bow.
An upward movement usually gives a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the freedom to sketch your personal characters, but do not forget that the printed string marks are there for a musical reason, so they usually have to be respected.
A group of market women sat behind the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4) on 6 October 1789, and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
They drove back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by joking and threatening mobs who threatened the royal couple.
Through the actions of the crowd of people, the king and queen were forced to open the windows of their carriage altogether.
At one point, someone in the crowd held the head of a royal guard murdered in Versailles up in front of a terrified queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism regarding the conquest of the Philippines have been paid for by the people of the Philippines.
They were imposed on the U.S. colonial regime to pay taxes to finance much of the costs and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Filipino government.
U.S. imperialism rested to a large extent on the huge gains of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must know what the context was that initiated the origin of the order.
The era in which this has happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the high Middle Ages. These were succeeded again by the late Middle Ages, which usually end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technology offerings or the technological obligation to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and its appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: the development of technology follows a trajectory that for the most part extends beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies inherent rather than those socially conditioned. 
For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed so that the cost of car ownership can be reduced.
Mass car ownership also causes a greater number of accidents on the road and this leads to the development of new techniques in the field of healthcare in order to restore the human body.
In romance, a large part of cultural determinism was included, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In Romanticism, geography formed the individual, and over time, customs and cultures emerged in response to this geography. These constituted a harmonious society and were better than the arbitrary imposed laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is the current fashion capital.
It was known from about 400 AD to about 1100 AD as an epicenter of luxury.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
The Gothic celebrated its heyday in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Clothing was strongly influenced at first by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the West were 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, a style began to unfold in Western Europe. One of the biggest developments was the result of the Crusades: people began using knots to confirm their clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture where enough food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture with the aim of living is a simple system that is usually organic. Stored seed is used from the ecoregion, which is combined with changing crops or other relatively simple techniques to make the yield optimal.
In the past, most farmers worked in self-sufficient agriculture. This is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures ensure that like-minded persons who feel neglected are brought together by social norms. This gives them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can distinguish themselves through age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be determined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or one or more of these factors combined.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to through a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave and the jargon they speak to.
One of the most commonly used methods for illustrating the importance of socialisation were the few deplorable cases of children who were not socialized by adults by neglect, setbacks or willful abuse during growing up.
They are called "wolf children" or "wild children." Some wolf children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned, because the parents did not want to accept the child's severe mental or physical disability. 
Unruly children may have experienced severe child abuse or serious trauma before they were abandoned or before they walked away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
A feral child who has not been raised by humans may exhibit behaviors similar to the behavior of the animal that the child has cared for (within the physical limits), such as fear of or indifference towards people.
Learning on a project basis should simplify education and make it more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are dealing with a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or who are embarking on a new project.
Support can be virtual as well as real. For example, a teacher is a form of support, but Microsoft Office’s paper clip man is too.
There is virtual scaffolding that is built into the software that asks questions, provides reminders, and explains procedures that may be difficult to understand for students without help.
There are several reasons that children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not properly cared for, where one does not care about them and where they cannot develop, but still this happens.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
Foster care is intended to ensure a safe home, loving caregiver, stable education and reliable healthcare.
In foster care, all needs that have been neglected in the previous home must be met.
On the Internet, parts of interpersonal and mass communication are merged.
The different characters of the Internet lead to new dimensions in terms of the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
For example, 'Learning' and 'socialization' are presented as important reasons to use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as “personal engagement” and “persistent relationships” when they examined audience responses to websites.
That video recordings are used led to remarkable finds in interpreting micro-expressions, that are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that no one can recognize a lie by paying attention to micro-expressions only.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's Speech how it is possible that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can nevertheless accurately estimate its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret people's behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Due to mutation, new genetic variation is added; through selection, this variation is eliminated from the pole of expressed variation.
For each generation, through separation and recombination, there is a variety between the two groups.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can on the savannah but difficult to get the necessary amino acids from the plant sources that can be found there.
Furthermore, not taking into account can have serious consequences: growth delay, malnutrition and ultimately even death.
The easiest to find plant sources are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) slightly digestible, but it also contains a lot of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way as chimpanzees on the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep interruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and that you fall asleep again within a short time (10–60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively gentle alarm clock that will take you back to your consciousness without waking up completely immediately.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room. This way, you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
For example, other options based on the biorhythm are drinking a lot of liquid before you go to sleep (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic). This means you have to get up to pee.
The amount of inner calm that a person possesses is opposed to the amount of stress that a person carries in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present. Every person is able to achieve contentment and total peace.
Anyone can lighten their mind. Only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism has its foundation in Buddha’s teaching. This form of Buddhism, however, has been expanded with the mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation and an imitation of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (illumination energy) is generated.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as a focus. Using the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleaned up, chakras are activated and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, a collaboration between the USSR and the US came about. When the war came to an end, the conflicts between system, process and culture cause the countries to get into a fight with each other.
The former allies faced each other two years after the war ended, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last for 40 years and battles with proxy armies took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defence forces only lasted until 17 September 1939, after which they had to withdraw and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were outdated in one night, when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts, after they occupied the eastern parts of Poland. This was contrary to the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression treaty and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Freight transport by ship is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the Navy's job to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport persons and goods, while the possibility of the enemy to transport people and goods is precisely impeded.
The U.S. tried to get troops and material across the Atlantic from the British and with this North Atlantic campaign from WWII, this is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
The German Navy at the same time tried to stop this traffic using mainly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain was likely to have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the goats have been domesticated for the first time in the Iranian Zagros Mountains some 10,000 years ago.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could always easily get to her, flesh, milk and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area. They were then guarded by goat herders, as were the more well-known shepherd often a child or youngster. Today, is still being herded in the same way.
Already in the 16th century, horse railways were built in England.
Although horse railways consisted only of a rail of shelves, the horses had to walk faster and faster and move on larger quantities than on the somewhat difficult roads of the time.
Crossbars were used fairly early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that rails would be more efficient if an iron point was present on the top.
This quickly became the common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear and tear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were constructed.
The first form of transport we know is walking. People started walking upright two million years ago when the Homo Erectus came up (that means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, ran less often upright.
In fossils of the Australopithecus of 4.2-3.9 million years ago, two-legged specializations are found. The Sahelanthropus may have also run on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, join an environmental movement or even take action to mitigate future suffering somewhat.
In many cases, it is like symptomatic treatment. But if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the cause of the problems and get rid of them.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have obviously profoundly changed the earth. Moreover, overpopulation and the extravagant human lifestyle have exacerbated the problems.
After the declaration of independence was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten design was sent to John Dunlap's printing company a few blocks away. This draft was signed by the President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night. These are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
John Nixon held the public reading of the document for the first time on July 8 in the Garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York City on July 9. Another specimen arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap quicks are the oldest survived copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that a dinosaur species still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are still reminiscent of a dinosaur.
On their paws are claws and scales, they lay eggs and walk on their two back legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary digits forms the basis for almost all computers used today.
A binary number can have only two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The presence of open boxes of drugs or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
View the label for specific first aid instructions for that precise poison.
This insect group is formally called "mittens" by entomologists.
This term stems from an age-old similarity with bedbugs, which are insects that can very well parasitize on humans.
Both red predatory bugs and bedbugs are nest-bound, they have adapted to live in their host's nest or house.
In the U.S., there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disorder in adults of both younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system. This includes the brain, the spine and the optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to give up their baby for adoption.
Upon adoption, the parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works using the scientific method is the main goal of science. This method is the guideline for most scientific research.
Yet it is about more than just experiments; a trial is a test to exclude one or more potential assumptions, question and make observations, as a guideline for science research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
The views of Aristotle regarding science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less because the knowledge of Greek decreased.
In physiological and behavioral perceptions of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production through the biological clock.
Most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not just reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that go through a cycle for a certain period of time, even if no external signals are issued for this.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses for implanting their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted. In one experiment, the DNA in the phage was marked with a radioactive phosphorus and in the other experiment, the protein of the phage was marked with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are germ orbit cells.
Only mutations in germ orbit cells are hereditary. Due to other mutations, cells can die or cancer can occur.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit nature reserves because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On the spot you can hunt, fish, photograph, observe birds, go to parks and study the ecosystem.
An example is a visit to, photographing and learning about the orangutangs in Borneo.
Every morning people go to their workplace from small villages by car and pass people whose workplace is located in the village where they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is somehow in contact with and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that this enormous carbon economy no longer puts the biosphere in the stable state, allowing human evolution to take place over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges are rare in comparison.
Why is it that so many complaints arise with transport systems, why does it go wrong every day? Are transport engineers simply incapable? Or is it something more fundamental?
A traffic flow examines the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between the individuals.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to investigate the traffic flow, because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave reasonably predictably. This means that traffic flows show some degree of consistency and there is something to be said about this in the mathematical field.
There are links between the three core properties to better reflect the traffic resolution: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
With the help of those relationships, planning, designing and exploiting road construction facilities is facilitated.
Insects began to fly first. Thanks to their flying power, they were able to escape enemies more easily and find food and mating partners more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide from predators in a larger number of small places.
Currently, only dragonflies and May flies can't collapse their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the Earth, and so did the Sun (and other stars).
This sounds pretty logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second longest river and carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth and has a width of six miles in some places.
At least 20% of all the water flowing into the sea via the rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although building stone pyramids continued until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of the construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was more than a thousand years old at the time.
There are about 800 inhabitants in Vatican City. This is the smallest independent country in the whole world and also the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language of instruction for the official communication and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the most spoken language by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People know the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper from ancient times, because these are all found in nature and it is fairly easy to mine them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like what we know from the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he has also theorized that they are transitioning into new substances to transform into what we see.
Alloys are simply a combination of at least metals. As you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are covered by the metals. There are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys can also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, for example, carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms fit into the tip at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a loyal friend to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have emerged, the pen has been lowered in status and is used much less.
Today, messages are written on a computer screen without ever needing a sharpener.
You may wonder what will happen to the keyboard as soon as something new comes on the market.
The atomic bomb works according to the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like you're pushing up a heavy cart a hill. When the core is split up again, part of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they fall apart at the slightest or slightest.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outermost layer of the moon.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the mary and thicker beneath the plateaus.
There may be more butts on the side, because the crust there is thinner. Lava could come to the surface more easily.
Content theories are aimed at finding out what moves people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or wishes that become internalized as they mature.
With these theories, they want to explore the reasons why certain people want certain things and what environmental factors they influence to do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are the need pyramid of Maslow and Hertzberg's Motivation-Hygiene Theory.
In general, two practices emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. In one course of action, they try to act as an equal.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and disciplinary action, conduct evaluation interviews, delegate and appeal to people at their responsibility.
On the other side of the spectrum, it transforms into an unrecognizable individual. He or she feels like he or she has to change everything the team has done so far, and wants to make everything his or her own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
Often, this behavior leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are small differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their direct physical group.
They are often more independent than traditional team members. That's because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to embark on the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity come to light when all available resources are effectively deployed within the functional departments of an organization.
The result of this is that the process of an organization that works together to overcome a hurdle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
To enable innovation in an organization, management must stimulate a culture in which innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning are central.
According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to examining cognition. This allows the research area to be reduced and more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between the pathology of the brain and behavior helps scientists during their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, wounds and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental ability.
As there are more and more new technologies, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI reminds most people of science fiction right away, but it’s also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior fall under research into AI.
Some examples include management, planning, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions and recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real-life problems.
Today, this artificial intelligence system is widely used in the economic, medical, technical and military fields, as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many excursions are planned for each class. Often, a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible. This allows students to view the artifacts in a museum from the classroom, look inside an aquarium or see beautiful works of art.
Virtually sharing an excursion is also a fantastic way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state's capital, which is reshaped every year and whose earlier versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students write better. Often their grammar and spelling are still bad at first, but this changes quickly because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing and thus avoid criticism.
Blogging 'students are also forced to learn more about the world around them'. The need to keep the audience interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004). 
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning far beyond traditional school day.
With good use, blogs can 'help pupils develop analytically and think critically; by actively engaging in the discussion on the internet, students can find their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time determine their own point of view in certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
Canada's bilingual capital is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums in which Canada is exhibited in the past and future.
Further south you will find the Niagara Falls. To the north you will find the beautiful untouched Muskoka and more.
This kind of thing makes Ontario in the eyes of outsiders typically Canadian.
Further north, large areas are quite sparsely populated and some of these areas are even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in the field of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are made up of independent countries or are connected to France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also took the Islamic faith with them, after which it spread widely on the Comoros and Mayotte.
Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the cape route from Europe to India, which marked the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region borders the Atlantic Ocean and north on the Sahel region.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say that they are married, whether or not they are true.
Also, it helps to put on rings (not too pricey-looking rings).
Women should keep in mind that cultural differences can lead to behavior that they see as intimidating and that it is common to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don’t be afraid to stand your male (cultural differences don’t talk this right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinides and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755, they left the city again.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and called it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish traders who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan stuff, such as tagines, pots, leather products, water pipes and other gadgets, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the fact that the Nyiragongo volcano was spewing lava and most of the city's streets, and especially the city centre, was buried.
While Goma itself is relatively safe, for visits outside Goma, you should check the state of affairs regarding the fighting going on in the province of North Kivu.
In addition, the city is the base for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano and you will find some of the cheapest trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
With boda-boda (a motor taxi) you can move to Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short drive.
'Timbuktu' is relatively poorly accessible and is therefore used today as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a pauperized city, although the city's reputation makes it a tourist attraction and features an airport.
In 1990, due to desert storms, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites.
It was one of the most important stops of the PBS exhibition Special Wonders from the African world of Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from the other cities in the country, because it has a more Arab appearance than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) can be found in the northeast of South Africa and runs to the east along the border with Mozambique, to the north along the border with Zimbabwe and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
19,500 square kilometers in size is the park, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wild species are kept.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the showpiece of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, daily conservation fees and access fees apply.
It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card. These provide or access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong and that is considered by many tourists to be the most important place.
The large number of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has already been compared to a glittering bar chart that becomes visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the waterfront of Kowloon across the street.
The vast majority of the island of Hong Kong's population lives very closely on each other on won land along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers have settled, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, then you can start well here.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world and stretch from the coast 80 km (50 miles) to the Indian and Bengal interior.
The Sundarbans are now officially listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove marshes — they also feature some of the last mighty stretches of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is peat and swamp area.
The Sundarbans have been a game reserve since 1966 and in the area there are now an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axis deer.
During the day, buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (opposite the river). Most depart between 6.30 and 7.30 a.m., especially in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days earlier, because the regional buses are often fully booked.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses run that are comfortable and robust.
With shared taxis, one can quickly and comfortably travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable bridge that goes over the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French-Guyanese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passages with a width of 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge, the passage height is 15 meters. In August 2011 the construction of the bridge was completed, but it only opened for traffic in March 2017.
According to the planning, the bridge is fully operational in September 2017. Brazil's customs posts are then expected to be ready for use.
The Guaraní was the most notable indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now East Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also did self-sufficient farming.
In the province of Chaco, other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, lived who found their food by hunting, fishing and collecting.
Paraguay, formerly called 'the great province of India', originated in the 16th century when Spanish settlers encountered the indigenous population.
A three-century colonization period followed among the Spanish.
Asunción was founded in 1537 and Paraguay has since managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year will take place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here you can also see smaller tournaments and competitions at other times in the year.
Check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Island pound (FKP). The value is about one British pound (GBP).
On the islands there is only one bank, namely in Stanley opposite the FIC West store. You can exchange money here.
In general, British pounds are accepted anywhere in the islands and in Stanley you can also often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
On the remote islands you probably can't pay with a credit card, but probably with the British and American currencies. Ask the owners in advance how you can pay.
Exchange your money before you leave the islands, because Falklands currency is very difficult to exchange outside.
Montevideo is below the equator, so when it's summer there, it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures higher than +30°C occur.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never goes below zero, but the wind in combination with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rain level remains roughly the same throughout the year, without recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods. 
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are just wild in the end. Therefore, they should not be fed or disturbed.
Keep in the park at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wildlife.
Moose, bison, reindeer, bears and about all other large animals can attack you, no matter how tame they may seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, you should be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid wearing or cooking fragrant food and keep the camping spot clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Around the year 1850 Apia was founded and it is the official capital of Samoa from 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the US and Great Britain did not want to leave the port. This later became known as the infamous stalemate.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the independence struggle by the Mau movement, the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, died at an out-of-hand non-violent gathering in the city.
There are many beaches, particularly because of Auckland's two ports. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore in North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely and most have pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
At Waitemata's port, in the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you'll find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shops on the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer that is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to be found, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for travel.
The local drinking water can simply be drunk safely, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A flat white is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
Tours to the reef take place all year round and injuries resulting from these trips to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, ask for expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish occur from October to April near beaches and estuaries north of Town or 1770. Sometimes they also occur outside of this period.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack people. Most of the sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is located in the estuaries north of Rockhampton and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Pre-booking provides peace of mind at the traveler, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other accommodation forms, such as a camping spot, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transport to and from the airport and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to think about the offer for a little longer or if you need to acquire documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you must do so through the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on the spot and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should be early to get a camping spot near the music.
And remember the following: even when the music on the main stages has finished, music may be played on other parts of the festival site until the late hours.
For families whose children are still young, there are special camping sites at some festivals.
Pay close attention to where your cabin is when you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, because the trip through the ice makes a huge noise. if you are too close.
Cruises to St Petersburg include time to explore the city. Passengers of the cruise are exempt from the visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically commit to getting the most out of the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are normally not present and the exit is sometimes difficult to find.
They normally have special offers in terms of food, drink and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to avoid leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic beverages. However, when people are drunk, that affects their judgment and all seasoned gamblers know that it is hugely important to stay sober.
If you go into the mountains on high or drive over mountain passes, you should keep in mind that there can be snow or ice and the temperature can be extremely low.
On icy and snowy roads there is little friction and it drives differently than asphalt.
During snowstorms, there may be enough snow in a very short period of time to get stuck.
The visibility can also be obstructed by falling or blowing snow or because there is condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and traffic is not hindered by this.
The biggest tourist African attraction are safaris, which for many visitors are the highlight of their trip.
The concept of safari refers in popular use to travel by land to view the beautiful African wildlife, particularly on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and standard equipment allows for good views.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you need binoculars. Otherwise, there's little chance you'll see them.
A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'loop safari') means that you walk for several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics are from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some parts are played in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city where the Olympics have taken place twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you can be in a miserable situation.
The cancellation policy varies, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for events cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000. Normal tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available. You can borrow these things often, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hairdryer if available.
Make sure that the substance does not get too hot (this can shrink the substance or, in extreme cases, scorch).
You can purify water in different ways. Some ways are effective to counter specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in other areas water should be boiled for several minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective. In case of doubt, it is best to drink water from a sealed bottle of a reliable company.
Travelers may face animal pests that are not there in their own country.
Pests can cause food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that violently injure or kill people, are not considered pests.

Rise brackets support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can also cause safety problems because a rider’s feet can get stuck in it.
If a horse rider is thrown off but lingers with the foot in the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of security measures have been taken.
Most riders firstly wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety brackets. This allows a stirrup leather to loosen from the saddle if this is pulled backwards because a rider falls off the horse.

You can think of the ski route as a hiking trail.
In good conditions you can travel greater distances than walking, but it rarely happens that you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on landscaped slopes without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers between different countries have to apply for a visa several times and undergo passport checks.
However, the Schengen area functions almost as one country in this area.
As long as you are staying in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo a passport check again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.

There are many books and magazines with articles about survival in the wilderness. However, there are very few publications on war zones.
Travelers who have planned a sex operation abroad should ensure that they have the correct documentation for the return journey.

Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery may assume that they will not come through this scan with unscathed privacy and dignity.
Mub currents are the recurring current of waves that break on a reef or something similar and flow on the beach.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow is located in a few deeper parts, where a rapid flow to deep water can occur.
Most of the deaths fall due to fatigue because they try to swim against the current. This could be impossible.
When you have escaped from the strong current, swimming back is so squeaky.
Try to focus on a place where you won't be caught again. Depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have a lesser 'honeymoon' feeling), it takes longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who adapt easily to new cultures sometimes struggle to adapt to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then returning, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits from your own culture.

Others are Livingston Island, and Deception. Here you will find the flooded crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula cross into the plateau, after which they reappear to form the 360 km long mountain range Mount Ellsworth, which is crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.

Finland is a great destination to sail. The 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the island groups off the coast.
A yacht is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagos on the coast and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for every yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their free time, that the ratio of boats on people is one in seven or eight.
The figure is equal to the figure of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
So you can spend several full days in the historic place and stay overnight on the ship.

Courier companies receive a generous fee to deliver items quickly. For business documents, merchandise or spare parts for a necessary repair, time often plays a very important role.
Larger companies were able to use their own aircraft for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
If they send things through air transport, it may take days for them to be unloaded and passed through customs on some routes.
Only if checked baggage could it be processed faster. According to the rules of airlines, there must be an associated passenger and that is you.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to count down a bag of money for this privilege (or even better, by having your employer do this).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times economy class for business, and about eleven times for the first class.
There is usually no point in looking for discounts for business class or first-class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know all too well that there is a group of pilots who are willing to count down a lot of money to fly somewhere fast and comfortable and the airlines therefore charge matching costs for this.
Chişinău is the Moldovan capital. Here the Romanian language is mainly spoken, but also the Russian language is common.

The hard exterior of the Parisians quickly disappears when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing things.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested and this wooded area consists mainly of beech, spruce and pine, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
