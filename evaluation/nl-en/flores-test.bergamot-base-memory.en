This not only proves the already widespread theory that at least certain dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides more details than fossils, such as the color and three-dimensional placement.
. . According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was maroon with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers drew the conclusion that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or a rachis, but do have other characteristics of feathers - such as weather hooks.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that these were not used to fly, but to regulate the temperature or to what it looked like. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this monster shows adult feathers and therefore not the down of a chick.

In France, there is traditionally hardly any need for voting: voters go into a box and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope that states which candidate they vote for.
Officials first check the identity of the electorate. Then the voter slides the envelope into the ballot box and then he puts his signature under the voice role.
The process is relatively closely laid down in France's electoral law.
Voting boxes must be transparent since 1988, so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in it at the start of the vote and that no envelopes other than those of registered and authorized voters are added.
The candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the trial. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Her first was the Slalom, where she got a Did Not Finish on her first run. 36 of the 116 participants got the same result in that race.
In the other match she participated in, the sitting Great Slalom, she was tenth of the ladies, with a combined time of 4:41:30. That's 2:11:60 minutes slower than Austrian winner Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four women's group's skiers for the sitting slalom could not finish their rides and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify during the race.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone have been recovered by Madhya Pradesh police.
According to Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya have arrested five of the Swedish woman's rapists and have found her cell phone and laptop. 
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious injuries to the head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially he was admitted to Great Yarmouth, at James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted of killing her son in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody pending the charges and the trial, but the eyewitness account may have been covered up because her story has been published frequently.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland is working differently and courts have labeled the publication of photographs as possible adversely.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists play a dangerous game when they publish photos, etc. of suspects.'
Crown Office is in overall charge of prosecutions and has indicated to journalists that no further rulings will be made, at least until charges have been made.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute settlement, something the Palestinians were keen to do under the borders for the war in the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics that had been discussed are the future status of Jerusalem, a city sacred to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding that after signing an agreement, there be a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years. However, the PA is only willing to have a five-year presence.
Shooters in the additional pest control trial had to be closely monitored by forest rangers. The test was followed and its effectiveness was assessed.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four elected gunmen for the first shooting operation have had an extensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly swore a nine-member new provisional electoral council (CEP).
In the past four years, Martelly has achieved a CEP five times.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous National Electoral Council. This is part of a package of measures to bring new elections in the country.
The commission was set up by Martelly in response to the widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests arose from the absence of elections, some of which should have been held since 2011.
There have been about 60 cases reported of faulty iPods that overheat. In total, this led to six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was familiar with the 27 accidents associated with the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents involving overheating that the company called "not serious." 
"Very regrettable," the ministry's response was made to the fact that Apple has postponed the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands emergency management agency stated that no damage has been reported nationwide.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former policeman from the Philippines has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists.
Several hostages have been brought to safety and for the time being at least six fatalities have been confirmed.
Six hostages were previously released, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an elderly woman who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was eventually shot.
Liggins went to work in medicine and followed the example of his father.
Trained as a midwife, he went to work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working in the hospital, Liggins did research into premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the maturation of the fetal lungs of babies was accelerated by administering a hormone.
Xinhua has reported that government investigators on Wednesday found two 'black boxes' with flight recorders.
Co-wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first "Queen of Extreme." My first manager. Luna died on the night of two men. Just as unique as she was. A strong woman." 
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels indicated that 'Luna was just as weird as I was... maybe even weirder... I love her and I'm going to miss her... hopefully she's in a better place'.
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who opposed the fact that Australia became a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Demissionary Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the participants of this poll stood behind this view. Queen Elizabeth II is the last monarch of Australia.
29 per cent of respondents felt Australia should become a republic once it's possible, and at the other end, 31 per cent said that should never happen.
The Olympic winner of the gold medal swam the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and three relay matches during the Commonwealth Games, but his condition was questioned because of his complaints.
He could not take the medication he needed to ease his pain, because they are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematical and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the currently largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using different hardware and software and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source through which water has come to Earth, along with organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand the way planets are formed. They especially want to know how the earth originated, given that it has been a long time since comets have collided with the earth.
Cuomo (53) was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and signed a law last month that legalizes same-sex marriages.
He called the gossip "political nonsense and chatter." 
There is speculation that he wants to run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to take shorter routes, which could save millions of tons of fuel annually for lower carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technologies with ground radars, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft rigs much better, and they can provide pilots with clearer information.
No extra transport is used and no above-ground trains stop at Wembley; in addition, the parking spaces and the P&R are not accessible on the premises.
A possible lack of transport increased the likelihood that the match would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published Tuesday in the scientific journal Science was about the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process took much longer because the crossing of a native Darwin finch, the Middle ground finch, with an immigrant Cactus ground finch, the Española ground finch, took longer.
Gold can be processed into many forms. It can be rolled up into small shapes.
It can be pulled into a narrow wire that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into plates.
After it is made very thin, it can be stuck on another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books called 'enlightened manuscripts'.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You already make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Then the color of the cabbage juice changes based on the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
Based on the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical that has been tested, the pH value is indicated.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, wet and clean your hands and make a ball out of it.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flushing toilet that was connected to an advanced sewage system.
Sewerage remains have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
There were also toilets in China, Egypt and Persia in ancient times. For example, in the era of the Romans, toilets were often part of a folk bathhouse, in which both ladies and gentlemen came together in a mixed group.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it will be returned immediately.
The satellite was shot into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and image.
To power a satellite or telescope in space, you must have a huge rocket that is more than 30 metres long. 
The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing the wheel has given us is easier and faster transportation.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result of this.
There are menat-sized felines between eating prey of medium size, from hares to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as loose-running cats that are kept as pets) that hunt for larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
Their success stems from the idea of a niche, a special job that every cat has that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called troops.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are related to each other and also have up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are normally closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A troop of lions behaves pretty much the same as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big felines), and which are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances and have five times as much pulling power as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger does not roar with full power like a lion. It's more like he's growling a whole sentence.
The favorite meal of ocelots is small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they succeed. The ocelot hunts almost exclusively for animals that are much smaller than it is itself.
Scholars suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by smelling the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark due to night vision and move very unobtrusively. Ocelots hunt prey by making themselves one with the environment and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) detaches from the large population from which they originate (for example, by moving across a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to another island, from where they cannot easily return), they are often in a different environment than before.
In this new environment there are different resources and other enemies, so the new population has to be different or adapt to cope with the competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments they did before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called species formation and simply involves the formation of new species. Species formation is an unpreventable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and they take on carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
By means of photosynthesis, the plants extract their nutrients from the sun. They also provide shade.
Our houses and clothes are made of plants. We mainly eat plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain of the time. He had nothing to fear from anyone except other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, meaning nothing or no one could escape him.
It's not certain, but possibly his tongue was forked. It ate turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs and maybe even his own kind.
In water features, nothing was safe from the attacks; also giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their portion of strange or unusual treats, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a kind of rodent called a sleeping mouse.
In addition, there was another difference; poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, but rich men liked to have a banquet together where they were lounging on their side while eating.
Meals from Roman antiquity do not contain food that has come to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa. Moreover, no ancient Roman has ever eaten a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for all their gods. This temple was seen as that god's own house.
They made sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with organizing ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a back room that was only accessible to priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, towers were built in the form of pyramids, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family often took place outside.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests and therefore wood was enormously expensive.
Greenland had few inhabitants. According to Norwegian sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way to the west and gave it his name.
He made this discovery, but there were already Eski mostams living there at the time.
Although they were all Scandinavian countries, the people, the royal family, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different.
Perhaps after the film National Treasure, you think there is a treasure map behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is based on a misconception. There is something written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the U.S. Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original American Declaration of Independence, dd. 4 July 1776'. The text is at the bottom of the document.
While no one is sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (of 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) used to be rolled up for storage.
So it seems that the designation is simply added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, the north of France was liberated. However, the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy-France. These were French people who sided with the Germans in 1940 and thus healed the enemy instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated southern France within just two weeks. Then they headed for Germany.
A civilization is a single culture that is shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, which means civil, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, which in turn stands for citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and that also defines in a certain way the format of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and balanced spread.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence. Thus, they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states under the articles of the Confederacy constituted a weak central government, consisting only of a congress.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, because there was no national executive or judiciary and for executing all decisions relied on state authorities that often did not want to cooperate.
Nor did it have the authority to ignore tax laws and tariffs between states.
First, all states had to unanimously agree to the articles, before they could be adapted, but the states did not take the national government so seriously which often left their representatives absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team, is the second most successful team worldwide and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, swordfighting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports is especially popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (with the largest island Honshu). Japan is the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands available to Japan, Japan is geographically often referred to as a 'peninsula'
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe sailed along the island and named it Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself in southwest Taiwan as a base, where the VOC tackled the indigenous grain production processes and put Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan were conquered by troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was annexed as the province of the Qing Empire in the year 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, in which sovereignty over Taiwan is transferred to Japan, which rules the island until 1945.
Constructed of three large constructions, the Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists get a better picture of what they looked like before.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was recovered. The renovation is still underway.
For example, worldwide the most common photo format for still images is 35 mm, which was the usual film format in the outcome of the analog film age.
These are produced to this day, although it is mainly the ratio of the image that the image sensor of the digital camera took over.
Strangely enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, at a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) would be 3:2 in that case.
Many common formats (e.g. APS-like formats) are equal to or a close approach to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is widely abused and which is found ridiculous by many, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic, yet also clear.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. This way you divide the image vertically and horizontally into threes (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under attack.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has linked European states, despite language differences and differences in customs.
From the king to the ordinary citizen, his all-pervading power had an influence on everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that prosperity must be used to combat suffering and poverty and the church has money resources for this reason.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this ratio of power and money led many people to begin to doubt that this principle was observed.
Britain imposed a blockade at sea against Germany, shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to provide vital facilities to military personnel and civilians. However, this blockade did violate the generally accepted international law that was laid down in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has placed mines in international waters so that no more ships could sail throughout the ocean, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's uninhibited submarine warfare.
During the 20's, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he only had 4 cents, a poetry collection and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) for Thomas Edison with him.
Ancient China had a unique way of displaying different time periods; each phase of China or every ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
Also between the different dynasties there was an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The best known was the era of the Three Kingdoms, this has taken place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynastys.
At that time, fierce wars took place between different nobles who fought for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the era of the Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in the battle for the highest spot in the grand palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution has had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from the absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism and the view that the country belongs to its inhabitants rather than a single leader.
For all male applicants, positions were available after the revolution so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same is true of the military. The army ranks are no longer based on one's class but on the person's caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolutionize.
Muhammad was intensively concerned with otherworldly issues. He often went for reflection to a cave that later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mountains of Noer.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks on the north side of Mecca and is completely closed off from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it was not easy to find at all. Once inside the cave there is total insulation.
The only thing to see are the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. There is very little to see or hear from the cave of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of the numerous great pyramid structures in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
 The Plateau of Giza or 'pyramids of Giza' in the Egyptian valley of the dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the great sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in tribute to the women and relatives of Khufu.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a staple or a square whose bottom is missing. 
Above means that you have to start at the tip and push the bow away. Under means that you have to start at the bow frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and put on the bow.
An upward movement usually gives a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the liberty to sketch your personal characters, but remember that the printed strings are there for a musical reason, so they usually have to be respected.
A group of market women sat behind the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
They drove back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by jolting and threatening mobs that threatened the royal couple.
Through the actions of the crowds of people, the king and queen were forced to open the windows of their carriage altogether.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism regarding the conquest of the Philippines have been paid for by the people of the Philippines.
They were imposed on the U.S. colonial regime to pay taxes to fund much of the cost and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism rested in large part on the enormous gains from the long-standing exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know what the context was that prompted the origin of the order.
The era in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the high Middle Ages. These were again succeeded by the late Middle Ages, which usually end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technology offerings or the technological obligation to a strict sense that human fate is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: the development of technology follows a trajectory that for the most part extends beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies inherent rather than those socially conditioned. 
For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed so that the cost of car ownership can be reduced.
The massive car ownership also causes a greater number of accidents on the road and this leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health care to be able to restore the human body.
In the romance was a large part of cultural determinism included, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In Romanticism, geography formed the individual and over time habits and cultures emerged in response to this geography. These formed a harmonious society and were better than the arbitrary imposed laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is the current fashion capital.
It was known from about 400 AD to about 1100 AD as an epicenter of luxury.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
The Gothic celebrated its heyday in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Clothing was influenced in the beginning by the Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west were 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, a style of its own began to develop in Western Europe. One of the biggest developments was the result of the Crusades: people started using knots to attach their clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture, producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture with the aim of living is a simple system that is usually organic. Stored seed that comes from the ecoregion is used, and that is combined with changing crops or other relatively simple techniques to make the yield too optimal.
In the past, most farmers worked in self-sufficient agriculture. This is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures ensure that like-minded people who feel neglected are brought together by social norms. This gives them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can distinguish themselves through the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be determined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or one or more of these factors combined.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to through a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave and the jargon they speak.
One of the most commonly used methods of illustrating the importance of socialization was the few deplorable cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, setbacks or willful abuse during growing up.
They are called "wolf children" or "wild children." Some wolf children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned, because the parents did not want to accept the severe mental or physical disability of the child. 
Unruly children may have experienced severe child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or before they ran away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
A feral child who has not been raised by humans may exhibit behaviors similar to the behavior of the animal that cared for the child (within the physical limits), such as fear of or indifference towards people.
Learning on a project basis should simplify education and make it more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are dealing with a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or who are embarking on a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. For example, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the Microsoft Office paperclip guy.
There is virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides reminders, and explains procedures that may be difficult to understand for students without help.
There are several reasons that children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well taken care of, where they do not care for them and where they cannot develop, but this still happens.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
The aim is for foster care to ensure a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the earlier home must be met.
Parts of interpersonal and mass communication are merged on the internet.
The different characters of the internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
For example, ‘learning’ and ‘socialization’ are presented as important reasons to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivation aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'persistent relationships' when they investigated public responses on websites.
That video recordings are being used led to remarkable finds in interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is stated that no one can recognize a lie by only paying attention to micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's Speech how it is possible that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can accurately estimate its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Through mutation, new genetic variation is added; by selection, this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, the two groups are varied by means of separation and recombination.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can hardly get the necessary amino acids from the plant sources that can be found there.
Furthermore, it cannot take serious consequences: growth delay, malnutrition and ultimately even death.
The easiest to find plant sources are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a lot of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way as chimpanzees on the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep interruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and that you fall back asleep within a short time (10–60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively gentle alarm clock that will bring you back to your consciousness without waking you up immediately.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room. This way you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
For example, other options based on the biorhythm are to drink a lot of liquid before you go to sleep (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic). Because of this, you have to get up to pee.
The amount of inner calmness a person has is in their opinion about the amount of stress that someone carries in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present. Every human being is able to achieve contentment and total peace.
Anyone can enlighten their mind. Only your own stress and negativity get in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism has its basis in the teachings of Buddha. However, this form of Buddhism has been expanded to include the Mahayana Path of Love and with a host of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation and a follow-up of universal love.
Through yoga postures, exercises for breathing, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightenment energy) is generated.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as its focus. Using the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleaned up, chakras are activated and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, a collaboration between the USSR and the US came into being. When the war was over, the conflicts between system, process and culture cause the countries to quarrel with each other.
The former allies were facing each other two years after the end of the war, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last for 40 years and fighting with proxy armies took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defense forces lasted only until 17 September 1939, after which they had to retreat and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were obsolete in one night, when 800,000 soldiers invaded from the Soviet Union's Red Army and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts, after occupying the eastern parts of Poland. This was contrary to the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression treaty and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Freight transport by ship is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the Navy's job to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while hindering the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
The US tried to get troops and material across the Atlantic to the British and with this North Atlantic campaign of WWII this is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
The German navy simultaneously tried to stop this traffic using mainly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the goats were domesticated for the first time in the Iranian Zagros Mountains some 10,000 years ago.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could always easily get to her, flesh, milk and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area. They were then guarded by goat herders, as was the more well-known shepherd often a child or young person. Today, it is still being hated in the same way.
As early as the 16th century, horse railways were built in England.
Although horse railways consisted only of a rail of planks, the horses had to walk faster and faster and increase quantities than on the somewhat difficult roads of the time.
Crossbars were used fairly early on to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that rails would be more efficient if an iron tip was present on the top.
This quickly became the usual practice, but the iron resulted in more wear and tear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were built.
The first form of transport we know is walking. People started walking upright two million years ago when the Homo Erectus came up (that means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, walked upright less often.
In fossils of the Australopithecus of 4.2-3.9 million years ago, two-legged specializations are found. By the way, the Sahelanthropus may have been running on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, join an environmental movement or even take action to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, it is like symptomatic treatment. But if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the cause of the problems and get rid of them.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have obviously changed the earth. Moreover, overpopulation and the extravagant human lifestyle have exacerbated the problems.
After the declaration of independence was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten design was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away. This draft was signed by the President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night. These are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
John Nixon held the document's public reading for the first time on July 8 in Independence Hall's garden.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9. Another specimen arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap flight writings are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that there is still a dinosaur species today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are still reminiscent of a dinosaur.
On their legs are claws and scales, they lay eggs and walk on their two rear legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary digits forms the basis for almost all computers used today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately clear. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made directly.
The presence of open boxes of drugs or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that precise poison.
This insect group is formally called 'bugs' by entomologists.
This term stems from an age-old similarity with bedbugs, which are insects that can very well parasitize on humans.
Both red predatory bugs and bed bugs are nest-bound, they have adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
In the U.S., there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disorder in adults of both younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system. This includes the brain, the spine and the optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to give up their baby for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works using the scientific method is the main goal of science. This method is the guideline for most scientific research.
Yet it is about more than just experiments; a test is a test to exclude one or more potential assumptions, to question and to make observations, as a guideline for science research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views regarding science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less because the knowledge of Greek declined.
In physiological and behavioral observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live by periodic rhythms. These are not just reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that go through a cycle for a certain period of time, even if no external signals are issued for this.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted. In one experiment, the DNA in the phage was marked with a radioactive phosphorus and in the other experiment, the protein of the phage was marked with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are hereditary. Other mutations can cause cells to die or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit nature reserves because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On site, one can hunt, fish, photograph, observe birds, go to parks and study the ecosystem.
An example is a visit to, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people go from small villages by car to their workplace and pass through people whose workplace is located in the village where they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is in contact with and supports a private car-based transport system.
Science shows that because of this vast carbon economy, the biosphere is no longer in the stable state, which allowed human evolution to take place over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges are rare compared to.
Why is it that so many complaints arise in transport systems, why does it go wrong on a daily basis? Are transport technicians simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
A traffic flow looks at the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the individuals.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to investigate the traffic flow, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave fairly predictably. This means that traffic flows show some degree of consistency and that there is something to be said about this in the mathematical field.
There are links between the three core properties to better reflect the traffic resolution: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
With the help of those relationships, the planning, design and operation of road construction facilities is facilitated.
Insects began to fly first animals. Thanks to their flying ability, they were more easily able to escape from enemies and find food and mating partners more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide from predators in a larger number of small places.
Currently, only dragonflies and May flies cannot fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said the solar system orbited the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the Earth, and so did the Sun (and other stars).
This sounds pretty logical, because you don't feel the Earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second-longest river and carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth and has a width of six miles in some places.
At least 20% of all the water flowing into the sea via the rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unbeatable in terms of size and technical excellence of the construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was more than a thousand years old at the time.
There are about 800 inhabitants living in Vatican City. This is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the official language of Vatican City's official communications and laws.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People know the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper from ancient times, because they can all be found in nature and it is fairly easy to mine them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like what we know from the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but it has also theorized that they transition into new substances to form into what we see.
Alloys are simply a combination of at least metals. As you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium fall under the metals. There are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys can also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, for example carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter consists of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms fit into the tip at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a loyal friend to many people when it was launched.
The pen is unfortunately lowered in status as newer writing methods have emerged and is used much less.
Nowadays, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a pencil sharpener.
You may wonder what will happen to the keyboard as soon as something new comes on the market.
The atomic bomb works according to the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the core is split up again, part of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they fall apart at the slightest.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outermost layer of the moon.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the plateaus.
There may be more butts on the side, because the crust is thinner there. Lava could get to the surface more easily there.
Content theories are aimed at finding out what moves people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
With these theories, they want to explore the reasons why certain people want to have certain things and what environmental factors they influence to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are the need pyramid of Maslow and Hertzberg's Motivation-Hygiene theory.
In general, two practices come up when managers start to lead over their former colleagues. In one course of action, they try to act as an equal.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and disciplinary action, conduct evaluation interviews, delegate and appeal to people on their responsibility.
On the other side of the spectrum, it transforms into an unrecognizable individual. He or she will have the feeling that he or she has to change everything the team has done so far, and wants to make everything his own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
Often this behavior leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are small differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their direct physical group.
They are often more independent than traditional team members. That's because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to embark on the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity come to light if all available resources are used effectively within the functional departments of an organization.
The result of this is that the process of an organization that is working together to overcome a hurdle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
To enable innovation in an organization, management must stimulate a culture in which innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning are central.
According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to researching cognition. This allows the research area to be reduced and more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between the pathology of the brain and behavior helps scientists during their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, traumas, wounds and tumors can influence behavior and lead to changes in mental ability.
Because there are more and more new technologies, we learn more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI immediately reminds most people of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research on machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior is under research on AI.
Some examples include management, planning, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions and recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real life problems.
Today, this artificial intelligence system is widely used in the economic, medical, technical and military fields, as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many excursions are planned for each class. Often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible. This allows students from the classroom to view the artifacts in a museum, look inside an aquarium or see beautiful artworks.
Virtually sharing an excursion is also a fantastic way to look back on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state's capital, which is reshaped every year and whose earlier versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students write better. Often their grammar and spelling are still bad at first, but this changes quickly because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing work and thus avoid criticism.
By blogging, "students are also forced to learn more about the world around them." The need to keep the public interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004). 
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages pupils to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
When used properly, blogs can 'help students develop analytically and think critically; by actively engaging in discussion on the internet, students can find their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time determine their own point of view in certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums in which Canada is exhibited in the past and future.
Further south you will find Niagara Falls. In the north you will find the beautiful untouched Muskoka and more.
This kind of thing makes Ontario in the eyes of outsiders typical Canadian.
Further north, large areas are quite sparsely populated and some of these areas are even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canada's total population.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in the area of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are made up of independent countries or are connected to France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also took the Islamic faith with them, after which it spread widely on the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the cape route from Europe to India, which marked the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region borders the Atlantic Ocean and the Sahel region south and west.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say they are married, whether or not that is true.
Also, it helps to put rings on (not too pricey-looking rings).
Women should keep in mind that cultural differences can lead to behaviour that they see as intimidating and that it is common to be followed, to be caught by the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don’t be afraid to stand your guy (cultural differences don’t talk this right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755, they left the city again.
Morocco's sultan rebuilt the city and called it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish traders who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan stuff, such as tagines, pots, leather products, hookahs and other gadgets, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the spewing of the lava by the Nyiragongo volcano and most of the city's streets, and especially the city centre, were buried.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, for visits outside of Goma you have to check the state of affairs regarding the battles that are going on in the province of North Kivu.
In addition, the city is the base for the climb of the Nyiragongo volcano and you will find some of the cheapest trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
With boda-boda (a motor taxi) you can move around on Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short drive.
'Timbuktu' is relatively poorly accessible and is therefore used today as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although the reputation of the city makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, due to desert storms, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites.
It was one of the main stops of the PBS exhibition Special Wonders from the African world of Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from the other cities in the country, because it has a more Arab appearance than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs to the east along the border with Mozambique, in the north along the border with Zimbabwe and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
19,500 square kilometers in size is the park, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wild animal species are kept.
As an important attraction in South Africa, this park is the showpiece of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, daily conservation fees and access fees apply.
It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card. These provide or access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong and that is considered by many tourists as the most important place.
The large number of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has already been compared to a glittering bar graph that becomes visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the waterfront of Kowloon across the street.
The vast majority of the population of the island of Hong Kong live very closely together on won land along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers have settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, then you can start here well.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the whole world and stretch from the coast 80 km (50 miles) to the Native American and Bangladeshi interiors.
The Sundarbans are now officially listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The section within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove swamps — they also feature some of the last mighty stretches of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is peat and marshland.
The Sundarbans have been a game reserve since 1966 and the area now has an estimated 400 Bangladeshi tigers and about 30,000 axis deer.
During the day, buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (opposite the river). Most leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m., especially in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days earlier, because the regional buses are often fully booked.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses run that are comfortable and robust.
With shared taxis, one can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French-Guyanese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passages with a width of 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge, the clearance height is 15 meters. In August 2011, the construction of the bridge was completed, but it only opened to traffic in March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017. Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use.
The Guaraní was the most notable indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also did self-sufficient agriculture.
In Chaco province, other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, lived, who found their food by hunting, fishing and collecting.
Paraguay, formerly called 'the great province of India', originated in the 16th century when Spanish settlers encountered the indigenous population.
A three-century-long colonization period followed among the Spanish.
Asunción was founded in 1537 and since then Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year will take place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here you can also see smaller tournaments and competitions at other times in the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information on tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Island pound (FKP). The value is about one British pound (GBP).
On the islands there is only one bank, namely in Stanley opposite the shop FIC West. Here you can exchange money.
In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley you can also often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
On the remote islands, you probably can't pay with a credit card, but probably with the British and US currency. Ask the owners in advance how you can pay.
Redeem your money before you leave the islands, because Falkland currency is very difficult to exchange outside.
Montevideo is located below the equator, so if it is summer there, it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures higher than +30°C are found.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never goes below zero, but the wind in combination with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rain level remains roughly the same throughout the year, without recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods. 
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are wild in the end. Therefore, they should not be fed or disturbed.
Keep in the park at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wildlife.
Moose, bison, reindeer, bears and about all other large animals can attack you, no matter how tame they seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild and possibly dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, you should be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking fragrant food and keep the camping spot clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Around the year 1850, Apia was founded and it is the official capital of Samoa from 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain did not want to leave the port. This later became known as the infamous stalemate.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the independence struggle by the Mau movement, the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, was killed in an out of control non-violent gathering in the city.
There are many beaches, mainly because of the two ports of Auckland. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely and most have pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
At Waitemata's port, in the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you'll find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shops on the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer that is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to be found, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for travel.
The local drinking water can just be drunk safely, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
There are trips to the reef all year round and injuries related to these trips to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, seek expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish occur from October to April near beaches and estuaries north of Town of 1770. Sometimes they occur outside of this period.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack people. Most of the sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is located in the estuaries north of Rockhampton and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Pre-booking provides peace of mind to the traveler, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other accommodation types, such as a camping spot, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transport to and from the airport and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to think about the offer for a little longer or if you need to acquire documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you must do so through the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on site and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should be early to get a camping spot near the music.
And remember the following: even when the music on the main stages has ended, music may be played on other parts of the festival site until the late hours.
For families whose children are still young, there are special campsites at some festivals.
Pay attention to where your cabin is when you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, because the trip through the ice makes a huge noise. if you are too close.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos are typically committed to getting the most out of the time and money guests spend. Windows and clocks are not normally present and the exit is sometimes difficult to find.
They normally have special offers in terms of food, drink and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to avoid leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic beverages. However, if people are drunk, that affects their judgment and all seasoned gamblers know that it is hugely important to stay sober.
If you go up high in the mountains or drive over mountain passes, you have to keep in mind that there may be snow or ice and the temperature can be very low.
On icy and snowy roads there is little friction and it drives differently than asphalt.
During snowstorms, there may be enough snowfall in a very short period of time to get stuck.
The visibility can also be obstructed by falling or blowing snow or because there is condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and traffic is not hindered by this.
The biggest tourist African attraction are safaris, which for many visitors are the highlight of their trip.
The concept of safari refers in popular use to travel overland to view the beautiful African wildlife, particularly on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and standard equipment allows good views.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you need binoculars. Otherwise, chances are slim that you'll see them.
A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'walking safari') means that you walk for several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics are from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some parts are played in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city where the Olympics have taken place twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policy varies, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policy lines are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Expected to cost most tickets for events between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000. Normal tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available. You can borrow this stuff often, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hairdryer if available.
Make sure that the fabric does not get too hot (this can cause the substance to shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
You can purify water in different ways. Some ways are effective to counter specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in other areas water should be boiled for several minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective. In case of doubt, it is best to drink water from a sealed bottle of a reliable company.
Travelers may have to deal with animal pests that are not there in their own country.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that forcibly injure or kill people, are not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means that you can buy goods that are exempt from tax and excise duty in certain locations.
Travelers who go to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected via the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, you often drive through deserted underlying terrain and that makes this trajectory one big challenge.
Aren't you used to driving on country lanes? Then keep your head. You will encounter many steep slopes, narrow streets and sharp curves.
The maximum speeds set are strikingly lower than in previous and consecutive areas — usually some 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h — and it is even more important here to stick to it than usual.
Surprisingly, you have much more range here than in other corners of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste fine and in Bavaria the pastry is fairly rich and varied, just like the pastry of the southern neighbor, Austria.
You see a lot of fruit pastries. Throughout the year, the pastries contain apples, and in the summer months also cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and taste fine with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a few small but mighty pastries, try some called in the Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen region.
To make a curry you need spicy and spicy ingredients, in combination with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be 'dry' or 'wet'.
In the interior of northern India and also of Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesian cuisine includes dishes from 17,000 islands and is an umbrella concept for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without additional information, the term refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago and offers several simple spiced dishes. The most common Javanese seasonings are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant herbs.
Stirrups support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can also cause problems with safety because the feet of a rider can get stuck in it.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but lingers with the foot in the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of security measures have been taken.
Most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety brackets. This allows a stirrup leather from the saddle to come loose if it is pulled backwards because a rider falls off the horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is Chile's most popular climbing destination. This is known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all parts of the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock faces that seem to have endless potential.
Winter sports where you descend, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down on a snow-covered descent with skis or a snowboard at your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are occasionally also called 'ski bums', who plan entire holidays around skiing in a certain location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers that date back to 5000 BC!
The beginning of ski sport dates at least from the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It's not quite the same, but it looks like alpine skiing or mountaineering, which is done a lot on steep terrain. You need much stiffer skis and boots for this.
You can see the ski route as a walking route.
In good conditions you can travel longer distances than on foot, but it rarely happens that you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on landscaped slopes without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers between different countries have to apply for visas multiple times and undergo passport checks.
However, the Schengen area functions almost as one country in this area.
As long as you are staying in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo a passport check again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition indicating which articles produced are antiques. Some tax offices give goods that are over 100 years old the definition antiques.
The definition may vary by location. In North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to label artisanal products as antiques, despite being newer than comparable mass products.
Under the Sámi, keeping reindeer is an important form of livelihood. The culture around trade is also very important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer farming. They were involved in fishing, hunting and such matters. Reindeer were usually used as draft animals.
Many Sámi work in modern professions today. In Sápmi, the Sámi area is tourism is an important source of income.
The word 'gypsy' is mainly used by non-Roma. However, it is also often considered offensive because of the associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Roma. 
If there is travel advice for the country you want to go to, this can have consequences for your health insurance for the trip or your cancellation insurance.
In addition to the advice of your own government, you can also consult the advice of other governments. However, their advice is aimed at their own residents.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face situations other than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions include only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often give a fleeting, general and extremely simplistic picture compared to other, more detailed sources.
Storms are the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can lead to damage, serious societal disruption or the loss of human lives.
Extreme weather events can occur all over the world. There are different types of weather conditions, which vary based on the geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Symptoms and consequences of severe weather include strong winds, hail, large amounts of precipitation and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, water hoses and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms include examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks that severe weather conditions entail in their environment, as they can also influence some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country considered a war zone should be trained professionally.
A search for "course in hostile environments" on the Internet is likely to provide the address of a local company.
In a course, normally all the issues set out here are covered in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing games, a lot of first aid and occasional weapon training.
There are many books and magazines with articles about survival in the wilderness. However, there are few publications on war zones.
Travelers who have scheduled sex surgery abroad should ensure they have the correct documentation for the return journey.
It varies considerably whether governments want to provide passports that do not mention gender (X), or to want to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much difference in the benevolence of foreign governments to recognise these documents.
Moreover, searches at the security checks have become much more extensive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery may assume that they will not come through this scan with unblemished privacy and dignity.
Mouse currents are the recurring current of waves that break on a reef or something similar and flow on the beach.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is located in some deeper parts, where a rapid flow to deep water can occur.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue because they try to swim against the current. This could be impossible.
When you have escaped from the strong current, swimming back is so squeaky.
Try to focus on a place where you won’t be grabbed again. Depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, you may also be waiting for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have a less big 'marrian travel feeling'), it takes longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who adapt easily to new cultures sometimes have difficulty adapting to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then return, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your own culture.
When you went abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding. They understood that travelers had to adapt in a new country.
Usually, patience and understanding are not expected to be required for travelers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in silence before the show begins.
Often, noise from sellers and tourists is always audible here. The story of light and sound resembles that of a book.
The Sphinx forms the background and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as projections on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are highlighted.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by several countries. They have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is the King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception. Here you will find the flooded crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula cross into the plateau, after which they reappear to form the 360 km long mountain range Mount Ellsworth, which is crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif. Mount Vinson is the highest mountain at 4892 meters.
A satellite phone can be your only option in remote locations, where there is no reception for mobile phone.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to be able to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions where there is a need for external data and communication.
Your local phone provider can give you more information about how to connect to this service.
It is becoming increasingly popular for people planning a gap year to travel and learn.
School leavers in particular use this to take a gap year before the university without adversely affecting their education.
Often, an enrolment for a course abroad during a gap year can increase your chances of pursuing higher education in your own country.
Normally, tuition fees should be paid for enrolment for these educational programmes.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailing. The 'Land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the island groups off the coast.
A yacht is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagos on the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for every yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their spare time, that the ratio of boats to people is one in seven or eight.
The figure is equal to the figure of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
So you can spend a few full days in the historic place and stay overnight on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only go on shore during a boat excursion.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something for you to be ashamed of: it's no different than many fears that other people have, too.
If you know how planes work, this can contribute to removing a fear that stems from the unknown or from the fact that you have no control over the plane.
Courier companies receive a generous fee to deliver items quickly. For business documents, merchandise or spare parts for a necessary repair, time often plays a very important role.
Larger companies could use their own aircraft for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
If they send things by air transport, it can take days on some routes before they are unloaded and come through customs.
Only as checked baggage could it be processed more quickly. According to the rules of airlines, there must be a corresponding passenger and that is you.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to pay a bag of money for this privilege (or even better, to have your employer do this).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times economy class for business, and about eleven times for the first class.
It usually makes no sense to look for discounts for business class or first-class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know all too well that there is a group of pilots who are willing to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere fast and comfortable and the airlines therefore charge matching costs for this.
Chişinău is the Moldovan capital. Here the Romanian language is mainly spoken, but the Russian language is also common.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova suffered from an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-appointed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by the members of the UN.
Economic ties have once again been established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the fact that the political negotiations have failed.
Orthodox Christian is the main religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port next to Istanbul and a good traffic junction.
The once ancient city of İzmir is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center on a bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern shopping malls that are covered with red roof tiles, the 18th-century markets, the ancient mosques and churches, yet the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditional Turkish.
In the village of Haldarsvík you can enjoy views of the island of Eysturoy, which is nearby, as well as a special church with eight corners.
On a number of graves near the church are fascinating marble pigeon sculptures.
If you have half an hour, you should definitely look around this village.
In the north you will find the easily accessible, romantic and fascinating place Sintra. Sintra became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron spoke with praise of the beautiful monuments there.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stopover in Cabo da Roca.
Also go north and see the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally known Marian appearances have taken place.
Remember that you are actually just visiting a mass grave, but also a place that has a virtually immeasurable meaning for a large part of the world’s population.
Many men and women who have survived their time here are still alive and many of them have loved ones who have been murdered there or worked themselves to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Show all applicable respect, solemnity and dignity during your visit. Do not trivialize the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not damage the site by applying markings or graffiti to the buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
Yet most of the signs are in Catalan, because that is the first official language according to the law.
In public transport and other facilities, Spanish is frequently spoken.
Common announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are made by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and also in Japanese.
The people of Paris are known to be selfish, rude and arrogant.
 While this is usually just an incorrect stereotype, it doesn't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and behave like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-behaved). This will make it a lot easier to explore Paris.
The hard exterior of the Parisians disappears quickly when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing things.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested and this wooded area consists mainly of beech, spruce and pine, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are particularly many different plant communities, due to the different microclimates, the different soil types and the varying height differences.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
There are rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the eagle, in addition to all kinds of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt to over the knees and must be their shoulders covered.
Usually you get a shawl as a woman when you arrive at a monastery unprepared, but if you bring your own copy, with nice screaming colors, the monk or nun who is at the entrance will smile kindly.
On the other hand, men should wear pants to minimally over the knees.
You can also borrow it from the stock at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed every time afterwards, so you may not feel comfortable with that. One size fits all for men!
Like many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and a lot of olive oil is used.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, mainly during the summer months, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever is available to seasonings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Self-employed nouns, like Sie what you mean, always have a capital letter at the beginning, even though they are in the middle of the sentence.
In this way you make a first name difference between a number of verbs and objects.
It probably makes reading easier, too. Despite this, writing is more complicated, because you have to find out whether a verb or adjective should be used as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so the pronunciation generally poses few problems.
You have to pay the most attention to the c and the g. The pronunciation of this depends on the vowel that follows.
Also, you have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means sweetheart, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and usually regular grammar.
Reading this introduction to grammar will teach you a lot about Persian grammar and helps you to understand your sentences.
It is quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it is easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar to this that you do not have to learn it separately.
Premodern observatories are outdated today, and serve as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution was not as big a problem at the time as it is today, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the sight of cherry blossom and this has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers and that's where the concept came from.
The first cherry blossom festivals of Japan were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, requiring you to suppress the tendency to remove even 'just one' species.
When you collect monsters during a visit to a landscaped garden, you will be denied access to the garden immediately and without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate and almost everything is available after arrival.
But if you are in the 'high tropics', but a few degrees on the north side of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and powerful sun (when the sky is clear, this is less common).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the narrated burial site of the biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham and their wives.
Check whether the bus you are taking Hebron really goes in and does not only drive to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Domestic waterways can be a good holiday destination.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting cities along the Danube or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also indicate popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
People who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have also adopted many traditions that are part of the holiday.
There is a tradition where you stay up the whole Easter night until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Obviously, there are Christian theological explanations to be found for this tradition, but it may as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, an Easter guile is often held on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend. In doing so, the congregations often celebrate a feast at midnight at a clock in honor of the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived at the islands have come here by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, it was not possible for mammals to make the trip. This made the giant turtle the most common grazing mammal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since man set foot on the Galapagos, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
During the winter, the polar night takes place in the Arctic and Antarctic region, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you can see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark more or less day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is not often a problem. That means you can enjoy the starry sky too.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal in nature than in the Western world.
Packs are standard work clothes and colleagues call each other by the last name or job name.
Unanimity in the workplace is crucial. The focus is on group performance rather than pricing individual work performance.
Employees often need to get permission from their executives before they can make a decision and they are expected to follow the executives' instructions thoughtlessly.
