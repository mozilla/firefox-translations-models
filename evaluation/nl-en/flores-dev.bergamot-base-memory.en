Leslie Aun, spokesman for the Komen Foundation, said the organization has established a new rule, which means that no more subsidies or funds may be provided to organizations that are being investigated in court.
Under this policy of Komen, Planned Parenthood was no longer eligible by an ongoing investigation by Representative Cliff Stearns into the expenditure and declaration of the organization's money.
As chairman of the subcommittee Overview and Investigation, which falls under the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives, Stearns investigates whether taxpayers' money is used to fund abortions through Planned Parenthood.
Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney won the Florida Republican Party election on Tuesday with more than 46 percent of the vote.
Former U.S. Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich was second with 32 percent.
Florida applies the "winner takes all" principle and assigned all fifty delegates to Romney, after which he became the frontrunner for the Republican Party nomination.
According to the organizers of the protest, there were about 100,000 people present in German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
In Berlin, according to police, there were an estimated 6500 protesters.
Also in Paris, in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, the Maltese capital Valetta, the Estonian capital Tallinn and the Scottish cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow were protests.
In London, a protest of some 200 people took place at several copyright holder offices.
When Poland signed the ACTA last month, major protests broke out, leaving the Polish government to decide not to ratify the agreement for the time being.
Latvia and Slovakia have both postponed the process of joining ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are once again making themselves strong to require the hanging of CCTV cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
David O'Shannessy is Chief Inspector of RSPCA New South Wales and he told the ABC that oversight and controls of slaughterhouses in Australia should be a normal procedure.
'The surveillance cameras make it clear to the people who work with animals that the welfare of the animals is top priority.'
The international earthquake map used by the United States Geological Survey did not feature earthquakes in Iceland in the previous week.
The Meteorological Institute of Iceland did not report seismic activity in the last 48 hours in Hekla.
The large amount of earthquakes that caused a phase transition took place on March 10 on the northeastern side of the volcano's upper caldera.
Dark clouds that had nothing to do with volcanic activity were observed at the foot of the mountain.
The clouds caused confusion about whether the volcano had really erupted.
There was 120-160 cubic metres of fuel aboard the Luno when the ship got engine trouble and was pushed against the breakwater by the strong winds and waves.
The twelve crew members have been brought to safety by helicopter, with the only injury being a broken nose.
The 100-metre-long ship was on its way to retrieve the usual cargo of fertilizer. Initially, authorities feared that the vessel could start leaking with the cargo.
In 2011, both parts of Congress already voted in favour of the proposed amendment.
This legislative session was amended when the second sentence was first scrapped by the House of Representatives and then passed by the Senate in a similar form on Monday.
Failure to comply with the second judgment, which states that cohabitants of the same sex are not allowed, could in the future lead to this being allowed.
HJR-3 will be reviewed by the next elected legislature in 2015 or 2016.
The director Vautier will also be remembered for his hunger strike in 1973 against, in his own words, political censorship.
French law has changed. He was an activist at the age of 15, when he decided to join the French Resistance in World War II.
He recorded himself in a book in 1998.
In the 60's he went back to the newly independent Algeria to teach in film directing.
Winner of two Olympic gold medals, Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, has died at the age of 54.
It was reported that the cause of death was bile duct cancer.
He died Tuesday in Osaka.
Saito was at the time of death not only the former Olympic and world champion, but also the chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation's training committee.
There were at least 100 people present at the party who celebrated the first wedding day of a couple who married last year.
A formal birthday event was scheduled for a later date, according to the officials.
The couple married in Texas a year ago and celebrated in Buffalo with friends and family.
The 30-year-old husband was born in Buffalo and one of four people killed in the shooting, but his wife has not been injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher who taught under Modern Education and King's Glory. He claimed to have 9,000 students at the height of his career.
In his notes, he used words that some parents took offense to and he would have used blasphemy in class.
Modern Education accused him of sticking large advertisements on buses without permission and that he was an English teacher.
Previously, he was accused of copyright infringement, but he has not been prosecuted for this.
A former student said he 'used street language in class, taught in dating skills in notes and was like a friend of the pupils'.
Over the past three decades, despite the fact that it is officially still a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the first economic changes were implemented.
From then on, the Chinese economy has increased 90 times in size.
Last year, for the first time, China exported more cars than Germany and even the US, making it the largest market in the industry.
China's GDP could be greater than the United States within two decades.
The fourth tropical storm over the Atlantic Ocean in the 2010 season, Danielle, has formed in the east of the ocean.
The storm, which is located about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has a maximum sustained wind speed of 40 mph (64 km/h).
The National Hurricane Center scientists predict that Danielle will reach hurricane force around Wednesday.
Since the storm is far from over, it remains difficult to estimate the potential consequences for the United States or the Caribbean.
Bobek, born in Zagreb (the capital of Croatia), became famous when he played for the club Partizan Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and continued to play for them until 1958.
During his time with the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 games.
No one else has ever appeared or has scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
He was voted the best player in Partisan history in 1995.
The festivities were kicked off with a special show by the world famous group Cirque du Soleil.
Then followed Staats-Symphonieorkest of Istanbul, a Janitsar band and the singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
Then the Whirling Dervishes came on stage.
The Turkish diva Sezen Aksu shared the stage with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and the Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
In conclusion, the show 'Troy' was performed by the Turkish dance group Fire of Anatolia.
After an accident at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, thirteen-year-old motorcycle driver Peter Lenz was killed.
During his warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his bike, and was hit by fellow driver Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately treated by the medical staff present and transported to a local hospital, where he later died.
Zayat was not injured in the accident.
Zapatero continued that, given the global financial situation, 'the financial system is an essential part of the economy. 
We've been in a financial crisis for a year that has reached a peak in the past two months, and I expect the financial market to start to recover now.'
Last week, Naked News announced that it is going to dramatically expand international coverage with three new broadcasts in different languages.
The global organization is already reporting in English and Japanese, but is now also launching programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for TV, internet and mobile devices.
Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw a terrifying spectacle: people were trying to break windows to get out. 
People hit with chairs against the windows, but the windows were unbreakable.
'One of the windows broke it and they started climbing out through the window,' said survivor Franciszek Kowal.
Due to the energy released when merging (or merging) hydrogen atoms to form heavier elements, the stars release light and heat.
Scientists are developing a reactor that can generate energy in this way.
However, this problem is difficult to solve. It will be many years before usable nuclear reactors are built.
The steel needle floats on the water thanks to the surface tension.
The surface tension is created by the fact that the water molecules on the surface of the water react more strongly to each other than that they react to the air molecules that are above it.
On the water level surface, the water molecules make a kind of skin layer that is not visible, so that objects float like needles on it.
The irons of modern skates have a double edge with a hollow void in between. The two edges provide more grip on the ice, even when making curves.
Because the bottom of the knife is slightly curved and the knife tilts to either side, the edge that comes into contact with the ice will also be curved.
This will make the skater turn. If the skates are tilted to the right, the skater turns right and if they are tilted to the left, the skater turns left.
They need to lose the extra energy that is extracted from the light to get back to the previous energy level.
They do this by radiating a small light particle called a 'photon'.
Scientists call this process a "stimulated emission of radiation," because the bright light stimulates the atoms, causing the emission of a photon of light, and light is a type of radiation.
The following photo shows atoms broadcasting photons. In reality, of course, photons are a lot smaller than in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the particles that are atoms made of!
After hundreds of burning hours, the filament in the lamp will eventually burn through, after which the light bulb will no longer work.
The pear must be replaced. Be careful when replacing the pear.
First of all, the switch of the light fixture should be switched off or the cable removed from the socket.
This is because the electricity that flows into the socket where the metal part of the lamp is located can cause a severe electric shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the lamp if it is still partly in the socket.
The main organ of the blood vessel system is the heart that pumps the blood.
Blood leaves the heart through a kind of tubes, called arteries, and comes back to the heart through other tubes, veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
With its teeth, a Triceratops could not only have shattered leaves, but even very tough branches and roots.
Some scientists think the triceratops ate cycades. That's a type of plant that was common to the Cretaceous Age.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, prickly leaves.
With his strong beak, a Triceratops could have taken the leaves off the trunk before he ate the trunk.
According to other scientists, these plants are highly toxic and were not eaten by dinosaurs. Even though some animals that live today, for example, sloths and parrots (descents of the dinosaurs) can eat leaves or fruits that are poisonous.
What effect does Io's gravity have on me? On the surface of Io, you weigh less than on Earth.
A person who weighs 90 kg on Earth would weigh about 16 kg on Io. That means gravity is pulling less hard on you.
The sun does not have a tangible outer layer like the earth's crust, but consists entirely of fire, gases and plasma.
As you get further from the core of the sun, the gas becomes thinner.
When you look at the sun, the outer part you see is the photosphere, or "ball of light."
About three thousand years later, the Italian astronomer used a telescope in 1610 and found that Venus, like the moon, exhibits phases.
If only the side of Venus (or from the moon) to the sun is illuminated, phases arise. Copernicus's theory that the planets orbit the sun is supported by the phases of Venus.
The transition of Venus was observed a few years later, in the year 1639, by Jeremiah Horrocks, an astronomer from England.
After the Danelaw was recaptured, it was long peace in England.
Ethelred came face to face in 991 with a Viking fleet that was a lot bigger than Guthrum's a century earlier.
The fleet leader was Olaf Trygvassion, a Norwegian who wanted to reclaim his land on the Danes.
After a number of military setbacks, Ethelred and Olaf managed to agree. Ethelred returned to Norway to win back his kingdom with varying success.
The only deliberately designed alphabet that is still widely used is Hangul. It was designed in 1444 under King Sejong (1418–1450).
King Sejong was the fourth and one of the most prized kings of the Joseon Dynasty.
He initially called the Hangeula alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum. That means "the right sounds to instruct the people."
There are many theories about the origin of Sanskrit. One is about the migration of Aryans from the west to India, who took their own language.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is similar to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The world's oldest known book is in Sanskrit, which was competed away after the Upanishads were drafted.
Sanskrit has formed the source for a large number of modern Indian languages and is a very complex and comprehensive language. For European languages such as French and Spanish, Latin was the source.
When the battle of France was over, Germany was getting ready for the invasion of the island of Britain.
Germany gave the attack the code name 'Operation Seelöwe'. Most of the British army's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost during the evacuation from Dunkirk, which severely weakened the army.
However, the Royal Navy was still stronger than the German Navy ('Kriegsmarine'). They could have destroyed any invasion fleet that would cross the English channel.
However, there were few royal naval vessels that were near logical attack routes, because the admirals were afraid that they would be sunk in a German airstrike.
First we are going to talk about the plans of Italy, the little one opposite 'big brothers' Germany and Japan.
Both his army and the fleet were weaker, despite four new ships having been manufactured just before the war.
Italy's main goals were African countries. To conquer these countries, they needed a strategic opening for their troops so that these troops could enter Africa across the Mediterranean.
For that, they had to get rid of the British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to these actions, the battleships of Italy were not allowed to do anything else.
And then we have Japan. Like Britain, Japan was an island state.
Submarines are ships that are specially designed to sail underwater for a longer period of time.
Submarines were used in the First and Second World War. At the time, they were very slow and their weapons had a limited range.
In the first phase of the war, they often moved on floating, but when radar developments led to greater accuracy, the submarines had to dive to remain unseen.
German submarines were called U-boats. The Germans were very adept at the steering and navigation of their submarines.
Germans had great success with submarines, and therefore, after the war, they do not become familiar with too many submarines.
Yes! Yes! Today, King Tutankhamun is one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt.
In ancient times, however, he was not considered important and he is not included in most lists of ancient kings.
Through the discovery of his tomb in 1922, he became a celebrity. Although many ancient tombs have been robbed, his tomb remained virtually untouched.
Most of the objects buried together with Tutankhamun are well preserved, including many artifacts made from precious metals and rare stones.
Thanks to the invention of the spoke wheel, the chariots of Assyria became lighter, faster and therefore better equipped for the avoidance of soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows shot with the deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of hostile soldiers. The first calvary was introduced by the Assyrians around 1000 BC.
A cavalry is an army fighting on horseback. Because the saddle had not yet been invented, the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses.
We are familiar with many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Probably Homer is the most famous Greek person: the legendary blind poet who wrote two Greek literary: the poems Iliad and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights and their pieces are counted among the top of world literature.
Another known Greek mathematician is Pythagoras. He has become known for his famous theorem about the relationship between the different sides of rectangular triangles.
Estimates of the number of Hindi speakers range from the second to the fourth most widely spoken language worldwide.
It depends on whether or not the very highly related dialects are counted, how many native speakers there are.
It is estimated that there are 340 million to 500 million speakers. About 800 million people can understand the language.
As for the vocabulary, Hindi and Urdu are similar, but the writing differs; speakers of both languages can usually understand each other in everyday conversations.
Around the fifteenth century, the north of Estonia was strongly culturally influenced by Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring the original population into contact with God and therefore developed the Estonian letter language.
It was based on the German alphabet and one character 'Õ/õ' was added.
Over time, many German loanwords were merged. This was the beginning of the lighting.
According to tradition, the heir to the throne would go directly into the army after completing school.
However, Charles went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he earned a 2:2 (a lower, second-rate diploma) by studying anthropology, archaeology and later history.
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to receive a diploma.
The European part of Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Romania in the Balkans) covers 3% of the land area.
The Turkish territory covers more than 1,600 km (1,000 miles) in length and 800 km (500 miles) in width and has a bit of the shape of a rectangle.
Turkey's area, including lakes, is some 783,562 km2 (300,948 mi2), of which there is about 755,688 km2 (291,773 mi2) in southwest Asia and some 23,764 km2 (9174 mi2) in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world and is about the size of Metropolitan France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey borders on three sides on a sea: the Aegean Sea on the west side, the Black Sea on the north side and the Mediterranean Sea in the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but has only been independent since 1839.
Parts of present-day Belgium used to be part of Luxembourg and came into Belgian hands in the 1930s after the Belgian Revolution.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain neutral, but was occupied by Germany both in the First and Second World War.
Luxembourg co-founded the organization we know today as the European Union in 1957.
The Drukgyal Dzong is a derelict fortress and Buddhist monastery at the top of the district of Paro (in the village of Phondey).
According to tradition, the fort was made in the year 1649 by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel in memory of his victory over the Tibetan-Mongolian troops.
After a fire in 1951, there are only a few relics of Drukgyal Dzong left, including the effigy of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
The fort was preserved and protected after the fire. Also, it remained one of Bhutan's most spectacular landmarks.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was surrounded by two powerful neighbours: Thailand and Vietnam.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was invaded by the Thais several times. In 1772, Phnom Phen was destroyed.
In the last years of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of the Venezuelan population is unemployed. Most people who do have a job are employed in the informal economy.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans work in the service sector, a quarter of which work in the industrial sector and a fifth in agriculture.
Oil is an important industry for Venezuelans, as the country is a net exporter; yet only one percent of the population works in the oil industry.
In the early years of the country's independence, experts from Singapore's botanical gardens helped transform the island into a tropical city garden.
In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a crossbreed of orchids, was chosen as a national flower.
Around October, nearly 1.5 million herbivores migrate from the northern hills to the southern flat areas every year because it rains there. They cross the Mara River.
And after the rainfall of April again northwards through the west, again through the river Mara.
The Serengeti region includes the Serengeti national park, the nature reserve Ngorongoro, the Maswa game reserve in Tanzania and the Masai Mara National Nature Reserve in Kenya.
To create interactive media, you need to master conventional and traditional techniques and be able to handle tools in interactive training (storyboards, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to rethink your assumptions about media production and learn to think non-linearly.
In an interactive design, parts of the project are connected, but they can also be understood on their own.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that you need much more focal complexity and lens parts than for prime lenses to reach a number of focal lengths.
Now that lens manufacturers use an ever-higher standard when manufacturing lenses, this is becoming less and less of a problem.
As a result, zoom lenses yielded a similar photo quality to lenses with a fixed focal length.
Zoom lenses also have the disadvantage that the maximum aperture (the speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes cheap zoom lenses difficult to use when there is low light and no flash is used.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie to a DVD format is the overscan.
TVs are usually created to please the general public.
Therefore, on TV you see that often the edges on the top and bottom and on the sides are cut off.
This is made to so that the image covers the entire screen. It's called overscan.
If you make a DVD, the edges are unfortunately also cut off. If the subtitles of the video are placed too close to the bottom edge, it will not be displayed in its entirety.
The traditional medieval castle has long appealed to the imagination and evokes images of knights' games, banquets and knighthood like Arthur's.
Even if you stand among the millennial ruins, it is easy to imagine the sounds and smells of long-gone battles. You almost hear the clatter of the hooves on the paving stones and smell how the fear increases in the dungeons.
The question is whether our imagination is based on reality. Why did we start building castles at some point? How were they designed and built?
The Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified mansion than a real castle, which is characteristic of this time.
With its large windows and thin walls, it would not have been resistant to a serious attack for long.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began construction, it was relatively peaceful in the country and only small groups of wandering poachers were a danger.
The balance of power was a system by which European countries wanted to preserve the national sovereignty of all European states.
The concept meant that all European countries had to prevent one country from becoming too powerful. National governments regularly had to enter into new alliances to keep the balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession was the first war in which the balance of power was central.
This was a major change, as the European powers would no longer have a pretext for the conduct of religious wars. This could make the Thirty Years' War labeled the last religious war.
The temple of Artemis near Ephesus was set on fire on July 21, 356 BC, by Herostratus and destroyed.
According to the story, he was driven by fame at all costs. The Ephesians were indignant and said the name of Herostratus would never be recorded.
The name was later mentioned by the Greek historian Strabo, so that we still know it today. The temple was destroyed on the birth night of Alexander the Great.
During his reign, Alexander was willing to pay for a rebuild, but this was rejected. After his death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Try to touch all nuts with as little tension as possible and unnecessary movements with your hand.
You don't get so tired like that. Remember that you do not have to turn on the keys with a lot of power for extra volume such as on the piano.
To make more sound with the accordion, you need to compress the bellows louder or faster.
Mysticism is believing in, identifying with or awareness of an ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth or God.
The churchgoer strives for a direct sensation, intuition or insight into the divine reality.
Followers pursue a certain way of life or want to gain experiences that give them that same feeling.
Unlike other religious beliefs and worship, mysticism emphasizes the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially of a peaceful, insightful, blissful or ecstatic nature.
Sikhism is a religion of the Indian continent. It originated in the 15th century from a sectarian split within the Hindu tradition in the Punjab region.
The faith is seen by Sikhs as a separate religion, although the origin and tradition of Hinduism is recognized.
The religion of the Sikhs they themselves call 'gurmat', Punjabi for 'the path of the guru'. Gurus play a fundamental role in all religions in India, but are particularly at the heart of the beliefs of Sikhism. 
Guru Nanak (1469-1539) founded the religion in the 15th century. Then followed a further nine gurus.
But Khrushchev's promises were put to the test in June 1956. Then riots in Poland changed, demonstrating by workers against food shortages and pay cuts, namely in an overall protest against communism.
Eventually, Krushchev sent tanks to restore order. He gave in to a number of economic demands and agreed to designate the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus civilization from the Bronze Age was located in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent and included most of contemporary Pakistan, some regions in northwestern India and northeast Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the basins of the Indus and also owes its name to this river.
Although some scientists suspect that 'Indus civilization' is the appropriate name for civilization that lived in the pelvis of the dried-up Sarasvati River, others call it the Harappan civilization after Harappa, the first excavation site of the 20's.
Thanks to the militarist nature of the Roman Empire, development could be made in medical progress.
By Emperor Augustus, doctors were recruited who also formed the first Roman medical corps, intended to be deployed after wars.
Surgeons had several sedatives, including morphine from extracts of poppy seeds and scopolamine from butterweed.
They became amputation experts with the aim of saving patients from gangrene and were also adept at applying tourniquets and artery clamps to stop bleeding.
The Roman Empire has been very successful in the field of medicine for many centuries and is responsible for much of the knowledge we have today.
Pureland origami is origami where only one fold is allowed at a time. More complex ways of folding, such as folding, should not, and only straight forward should be folded.
John Smith designed this in the 70's, in support of inexperienced folders or folders with limited motor skills.
Children develop a sense of race and racial stereotypes at a young age and these can influence their behavior.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority who, according to the stereotype, do not do well in school, tend to confirm this assumption once they know that the stereotype is associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States and currently contains 54 million profiles.
These websites have attracted a lot of attention that comes mainly from education.
These websites have positive aspects, such as being able to easily set up a class page that can have blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
Access to this page is easy by specifying only one web address, making it easy to remember and easy to type in by students who have trouble spelling or using a keyboard.
It can be customized to make it easy to read with as much or little color as one wishes.
Attention deficit disorder (ADD) 'is a neurological syndrome that is expressed in a combination of three classic characteristic symptoms, such as impulsivity, distraction and hyperactivity or too much energy. 
It is a learning disability and not a learning disability. It affects 3 to 5 percent of all children and up to 2 million children from America. 
Children with ADD struggle to focus on things like schoolwork. However, they can focus on things they like, such as games, their favorite drawing series, or writing phrases without punctuation.
These children often work themselves in the nests because they 'show risky behavior, argue and challenge authorities'. They do this to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be stimulated with normal methods. 
ADD affects relationships with peers. Other children often do not understand why the ADD'er reacts in a certain way or spells words differently. There may also be too much difference in adulthood.
The basic pace at which knowledge was gained changed, because the ability to gather knowledge and learn in the way described above changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. There was no longer any pressure within the individual recall, but the focus was more on the possibility of recalling text.
In essence, the Renaissance caused a great change in the way of learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands for moving, carrying or waving through the trees.
The chimpanzee's hand and foot have a similar size and length and reflect the use of the hand for carrying the weight when walking on the knuckles.
The hand of homo sapiens is shorter than the foot, and has right phalanges.
Petrified hand bones of about two to three million years old show this shift from propulsion to manipulation in the specialization of the hand.
There are also people who think that if you often experience artificially evoked lucid dreams, this can be very tiring.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that lucid dreams extend the time between the different REM sleep states.
If you don't get enough rem sleep every night, your body won't recover fast enough so it becomes a problem at some point.
This was as exhausting as if you woke up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch the television.
The effect depends on the number of times your brain tries to dream clearly each night.
The Italians in North Africa have not been doing well from the start. After Italy declared war on June 10, 1940, Fort Capuzzo was seized in Libya within a week by the British 11th Hussars.
During an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured General Lastucci, the army's Italian tenth engineer.
On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, Libya's Libyan governor-general and intended successor to Mussolini, died in Tobroek by friendly fire when they landed there.
Modern fencing sport is played on all kinds of levels, from students who learn it at the university to the Olympic level.
The sport is mainly played in duels, with two fencers dueling with each other.
Golf is a game where players have to hit balls with a club in a hole.
In a regular round, eighteen holes are played. Players basically start on the first hole of the course and finish at the eighteenth.
The player who needs the fewest turns or strokes with the club to complete the course is the winner.
It is played on grass, which is mowed shorter around the hole (the green).
Perhaps the most common form of tourism is what almost everyone associates with travel: recreational tourism.
This happens when people go to a place that is different from their daily environment and relax and enjoy there.
Tourists often seek out beaches, amusement parks and camping grounds for recreation.
If someone visits a specific place with the aim of learning something about the history and culture of that place, we call this cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different sights of a particular country or they can explore a specific area.
The settlers had also called for help troops.
New Hampshire's first and third regiment, consisting of 200 men led by Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both were later promoted to generals), was part of the troops who were to strengthen the forward position.
The men of Stark took positions along the fence all the way north from where the settler was located.
When a space emerged along the Mystic River and the northeastern part of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a short, stone wall to the north to the waterfront on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed a pole at about 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the fence and ordered everyone to wait to shoot until the regular troops were past it.
The U.S. plan meant that coordinated attacks were carried out from three different directions.
According to this plan, General John Cadwalder would attack the British garrison at Bordentown as a distraction to stop reinforcements.
General James Ewing, with 700 of his militia members, crossed the river at Trenton Ferry, conquered the bridge that ran over the Assunpink River, and managed to prevent enemy troops from escaping.
The largest attacking troop of 2400 men crossed the river, some 9 miles above Trenton, and split into two groups, a group led by Greene, and one led by Sullivan, to be able to attack before sunrise.
Now that the run is not a quarter-mile, but a half-mile, it's less about speed and much more about endurance.
Of course, a first-class half-miler, or a person with a time of less than two minutes, should have a decent speed, although endurance must be protected at all times.
One prepares best for the running season with some field runs in winter in combination with breast training in the gym.
A good diet alone is not enough to perform at the highest level, but is very important for the overall well-being of young athletes.
By maintaining a healthy energy balance, putting into practice effective hydration habits and understanding the various aspects of supplements, athletes can improve their performance and enjoy the sport more.
Medium-distance running is less expensive compared to other sports. However, there are many misunderstandings about the few required pieces of equipment for participation.
Products can be purchased if necessary, but most products have little to no real impact on performance.
Athletes may feel like preferring a product, even though that product has no real benefits.
The atom is seen as a fundamental building block for all matter.
It is a complex whole that, according to the simplified Bohr model, consists of a central nucleus surrounded by electrons, similar to planets orbiting the sun - see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two parts: neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge, and neutrons have no charge. The electrons have a negative electrical charge.
In order to investigate the victim, you must first check the environment to ensure your own safety.
You should pay attention to the victim’s position and any alarm signals when approaching him or her.
If you get hurt while you're trying to help, maybe you're just gonna make it worse.
This study found that the link between lower back pain and disabilities is based on depression, anxiety and fear of catastrophes.
The regular weekly structured PA sessions only had an effect on catastrophic thinking and not on depression and anxiety.
Regular activity participants needed more support in the area of negative pain perception, making the difference between chronic pain and discomfort and normal physical movement clear.
Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the senses of the visual system or eyes.
There is a large number of abnormal constructions of eyes. These differ in complexity depending on the needs of the organism.
The different constructions have different possibilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different sharpness levels. In addition, they require different processing to be able to become wise from the input and different figures to work optimally.
The concept of population refers to a group of organisms belonging to the same specific species located within a specific geographical region.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments with it.If all individuals in a population have the same phenotypic properties, they are known as monomorphic.
If, on the other hand, they show different variants of a certain characteristic, it is called polymorphy.
Colonies of predatory ants also march and reproduce at different stages.
Predominants move in the nomadic phase at night and they stop during the day to rest.
When the available food sources decrease, the colony lives as a nomadic species for a certain period of time. During this period, they make a temporary nest in a different place every day.
All these nomadic storms or marches last about 17 days.
What is a cell? The Latin word 'cella' is the origin of the word, this means "small space." The word was first coined by a microscopist who studied the structure of cork.
Each living entity is made up of one or more cells: they form the basis of life.
If you study life, cells are so fundamental and crucial that they are often called "the building blocks of life."
By sending nerve stimuli through the body, the nervous system maintains homeostasis and the blood flow can go through undisturbed.
The nerve impulses pass through the body very quickly. This promotes the safety of the body in the case of potential danger.
Compared to other severe storms, the affected area at tornadoes is relatively small. On the other hand, everything that comes their way is destroyed.
The damage from tornadoes includes uprooted trees, destroyed walls and highly thrown-up cars. They can last very long, up to three hours for the two percent most violent tornadoes.
Such monster storms can have winds up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
Man has been making and using lenses for thousands of years to magnify things.
However, the first real telescopes were made in Europe by the end of the 16th century.
By combining two lenses, objects in these telescopes appear to be both closer and larger.
Man will always remain greedy and selfish, and in cooperation it is always the case that if the majority benefits from something, it will benefit more from acting selfishly in the short term
It is to be hoped that most people realize that in the long run, it is best to work with others.
Many people dream of the day we can travel to another star and discover other worlds. Some people wonder what can be found in space and some believe that there are aliens or other forms of life on another planet.
But if this is ever going to happen, this won't be until a very long time. The stars are so far apart that there are trillions of miles between stars that are considered 'neighbors'.
Maybe one day your great-grandchildren will be on top of an alien world and they'll wonder how their ancestors were doing?
Animals consist of many cells. They eat things and digest this food in their stomachs. Most animals can move vision.
Only animals have brains (although they don’t have all of them; for example, jellyfish don’t have a brain).
You can find animals everywhere on earth. They dig into the ground, swim in the oceans and fly in the air.
A cell is the smallest part of a living being or organism with its structural and functional properties.
The word 'cell' is derived from the word 'cella' from Latin, which is a small room.
If you look at living things with a microscope, you can see that they consist of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, discovered small squares in cork with a microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first person to see dead cells
Elements and compositions can be brought from one state to another without changing.
As a gas, nitrogen has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state has a higher density, but the molecules are still the same.
Another example is water. The composition of this is two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom.
Regardless of whether it is a gas, liquid or solid, the molecular structure is the same.
The chemical state remains the same, even though the physical state can change.
Time is all around us, affects everything we do, but still remains something elusive.
Religious, philosophical and scientific scholars have been studying time for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events that go from the future through the present into the past.
The duration (length) of events is also compared with time.
If you observe the re-event of a cyclical event, you can mark the passage of time yourself. A cyclical event is an event that occurs regularly over and over again.
Today, computers are used to edit photos and videos.
Complex animations can be made on the computer, and this type of animation is increasingly used on television and in movies.
Advanced computers are often used to record music with the aim of processing and mixing sounds.
For much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the earliest inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori, who hunted huge birds called moas.
The theory led to the idea that the Maori people came into a large fleet from Polynesia and conquered New Zealand on the Moriori, after which an agricultural society was formed.
However, there are new indications that the Moriori were a group of Maoris on the mainland who moved from New Zealand to the islands of Chatham and built a personal, peaceful community there.
Another tribe in the Catham Islands were Maori who emigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves the Moriori and after a few skirmishes and were eventually wiped out the Moriori
People with decades of experience helped us assess our strengths and passions, while acting candidly assessing the difficulties and even the mistakes.
Listening to individuals who shared their stories about themselves, their family or the organization, brought us valuable insights about the past and about the individuals who influenced the company culture in any way.
While understanding one’s past is not the same as understanding the culture, it helps people at least get a sense of where they are in the history of the organization.
While evaluating the success and becoming aware of mistakes, one finds out together with all participants what the values, the mission and the driving force of the organization are.
In these circumstances, it was very useful to look at previous examples of entrepreneurial behaviour and the successes that emerged from it. This ensured that people were receptive to new changes and a new direction for the local church.
Thanks to such success stories, the fear of change has diminished and at the same time one becomes more positive about changes in the future.
With thinking patterns that converge, you can come up with a solution by combining different concepts or areas.
The emphasis in this mindset is on speed, logical thinking and accuracy, as well as determining facts, reapplying existing techniques and gathering information.
In this way of thinking, it is paramount that there is only one correct answer. There are only two answer options: right or wrong.
This way of thinking fits with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking can think logically, are able to remember patterns, solve problems and work on scientific research.
As a species, humanity is by far the best at reading one’s intentions.
That means we can properly predict what other people perceive, mean, believe, know or desire.
It is important to understand the intention of others. This allows us to remove possible ambiguities of physical acts.
For example, if you see someone smashing into a car window, you're probably going to assume that this person is trying to steal a stranger's car.
If he tried to break into his own car because he had lost his keys, he must be judged in a different way.
The physical phenomenon behind MRI is called nuclear spin resonance (NMR) and was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (at Harvard University).
Thanks to the magnetic field and radio waves, atoms in this resonance emit tiny radio signals.
Raymond Damadian is a physician and research scientist who made a discovery in 1970: he stumbled upon the basis for the use of magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnoses.
Four years later, a patent was granted, the world's first MRI patent.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian the first MRI scanner for the "whole body." He called the scanner the "impermanent."
Asynchronous communication gives time for reflection and to respond to others.
This way, students can decide for themselves how quickly they work and receive instructions.
In addition, there are fewer time constraints now that it is possible to have flexible working hours (Bremer, 1998).
The use of the internet and the world wide web allows students to always have access to information.
Instead of waiting for the next face-to-face appointment, students can ask questions to their supervisors at any time of the day and get a fairly quick answer.
The postmodernist learning approach offers absolute freedom. There is no right way to learn.
There is not, in fact, one good way to learn. Learning takes place in the experience between the one who learns and the one who transfers the knowledge.
This point is reflected in all the educational and DIY programs.
Many of us watch television shows about situations or experiences that we will never experience, and that we will never do anything with.
We will never refurbish a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to see ancient ruins or renovate our neighbors' house.
Thanks to submarine fiber optic cable connections with Europe and broadband satellite, Greenland has good connections. Thanks to these connections, 93% of the population has internet access.
Your hotel or host family (when you stay in a private home or guest house) probably has Wi-Fi or a PC with internet and in all places you can find an internet cafe or a location with public Wi-Fi.
As mentioned earlier, the word 'Eskimo' is considered derogatory by many non-American Arctic populations, especially in Canada. In the US, however, usage is still accepted.
You may have heard of the term Greenlandic Natives, but this word should be avoided by foreigners.
In Greenland, the indigenous residents call themselves Inuit when they are in Canada, and Kalaalleq (plural Kalaallit), which means a Greenlander, when they are in Greenland.
Crime, and generally malevolence to outsiders, hardly occurs in Greenland. Even in villages there is no "dangerous area."
Cold is probably the only real danger for someone who is unprepared.
When you visit Greenland in the cold season (assuming it gets colder the more you go north) it is very important to bring plenty of warm clothes.
The long days in the summer can make it difficult to get enough sleep and can lead to related health problems.
During the summer months, also watch out for the Norwegian mosquitoes. Although they do not transmit diseases, they can be annoying.
Although the San Francisco economy is tied to its status as a world-class tourist attraction, the economy is diverse.
The biggest employment is created by professional services, government, financial sector, trade and tourism.
The frequent portrayal in films, music, literature and popular culture has led the city and its monuments to be famous all over the world.
San Francisco has a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants and top facilities for congress.
For the Eastern cuisine (Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese) it is best to go to San Francisco.
A trip to Walt Disney World is a big milestone for many American families.
A 'typical' visit includes a flight to Orlando International Airport, a bus ride to a Disney hotel on site, a week-long stay without leaving Disney's grounds, and the way home.
Although there are infinite variants, most people really mean this when they say they 'go to Disneyland'.
Many tickets sold online on auction sites like eBay or Craigslist are partly used multi-day Park-Hopper tickets.
Despite this being common, Disney is banned: tickets are not transferable.
You need a permit to camp under the edge of the Grand Canyon.
The permits remain limited to protect the mountain gap and will be made available on the 1st day of the month, four months in advance.
A backcountry permit with a start date in May is thus available on January 1.
In the most popular places, the available seats can quickly run out, for example the Bright Angel Campground near Phantom Ranch, which is generally already filled on the first available booking day.
There is a limited number of permits available for walk-in requests based on who comes first, first serves.
If you want to see all the beauty of southern Africa, it is best to go there by car. You will also arrive at places where the regular tourist routes do not come.
This is possible in a regular car if you plan it well, but a 4x4 is recommended; many locations are only accessible with a 4x4 with high wheelbase.
Keep in mind that, although the situation in southern Africa is stable in southern Africa, this does not apply to all neighbouring countries.
The costs and requirements for a visa vary by country and are determined by the country of origin.
Each country has unique rules regarding which items for emergencies must be present in a car.
Victoria Falls is a city in western Zimbabwe, just across the border at Livingstone, Zambia and near Botswana.
The place is right next to the waterfalls. These are the biggest tourist attractions, but this popular tourist destination has plenty of opportunities for both adventurers and standard tourists to offer for a longer stay.
The amount of water is larger in the rainy season (November to March) and the waterfalls are then a lot more spectacular.
If you venture to the bridge or the winding paths along the falls, you will certainly not come back dry.
In addition, the enormous volume of water ensures that you can see the waterfalls less well.
Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). It could well be that KV62 is the most famous tomb in the valley. In addition, this is the place where Howard Carters discovered the young king's almost intact royal tomb in 1922.
The tomb of Tutankhamun, compared to the other royal tombs, is hardly worth a visit because it is smaller and has only minimal decorations.
You can only see the head and shoulders of the mummy, so you see nothing of the damage done when tried to take it out of the coffin.
The magnificent treasures have been transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and are no longer in the tomb.
Visitors who are tight in time would be better off going somewhere else.
Phnom Krom, 12 km away in the southwest direction of Siem Reap. This temple was built on a hill at the end of the 9th century under King Yasovarman.
Climbing the hill is worth it because of the moody atmosphere of the temple and the view over Lake Tonlé Sap.
A visit to this place can be combined with a cruise on the lake.
To access the temple you need an Angkor Pass, so do not forget to bring your passport with you when you go to Tonle Sap.
Although many other countries and the United Nations do not recognize the city as Israel’s capital, Jerusalem is both Israel’s capital and largest city.
The ancient city in the Judean Mountains has a fascinating history that is thousands of years old.
For Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the holy city is a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
The important Jerusalem for religions is one of the most popular tourist destinations of Israel because of the many sights in the ancient core.
In Jerusalem you will find a wide variety of historical, archaeological and cultural sites. In addition, you will also find lively and crowded shopping malls, cafes and eateries.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to be able to show an invitation before entering Ecuador through international airports or border posts.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador must legalize the letter and it must meet certain requirements.
In order to enable an organised migration flow between the two countries, these requirements have been drawn up.
Cuban citizens who have a Green Card in the U.S. must go to an Ecuadorian consulate to get an exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid at least 6 months after the travel date. A return ticket is required to prove the duration of your stay.
The tour prices are lower for groups with more people, so if you are with one or two, you can try to form a group of four to six with others for a lower price per person.
However, you don’t have to worry about that, because tourists are often pushed back and forth to fill cars.
Rather, it seems to be a way of making people think that a larger payment needs to be made.
High above the northernmost tip of Machu Picchu towers this steep mountain. Often this mountain is used as a background for the many pictures of the ruins.
It looks rather exciting from below, as it is a steep and difficult climb, but in principle it should be possible for fit people in 45 minutes.
Along most of the path you can find stone staircases and for the steeper parts there are steel cables placed as a handrail.
Nevertheless, it is very tiring and you should pay close attention to the steeper parts, since these can be dangerous especially in wetness.
Near the top is a small cave that you have to go through. It's pretty low and narrow.
You can best see the Galapagos Islands and the wildlife that live there by boat, just like Charles Darwin did in 1835.
In the waters around the Galapagos Islands, more than 60 cruise ships offer space for 8 to 100 passengers.
The boats are usually full in high season and therefore most people book their place well in advance.
Be sure to book with a Galapagos expert with a lot of knowledge of the wide variety of ships.
This ensures that your specific interests and/or limitations are matched with the ship that best suits this.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the rule of the Incas, while the middle and south of Chile was inhabited by the native Araucans (Mapuche).
The Mapuche was one of the last independent groups of Native Americans. They were only included in Spanish-speaking rule after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the midst of the Napoleonic wars that caused Spain to have no functioning central government for a few years), it was not until 1818 that the decisive victory over the Spanish was achieved.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominica) is a Caribbean country. It consists of the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola. Haiti is the other part of the island
The country not only hosts white sandy beaches and mountain landscapes, but also the oldest European city in America, which has now merged into Santo Domingo.
First the island was inhabited by the Taínos and the Caribbean. The Caribbean was an Arawakan-speaking people who were settled here around 10,000 BC.
After the explorers arrived from Europe, the population of Tainos had already been severely thinned by the Spanish conquerors after a few years.
The conquerors from Spain have finished around 100,000 Taínos from 1492 to 1498, according to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias)
Jardín de la Unión. This space used to be the atrium of a 17th-century monastery, the Templo de San Diego is the only building that still exists.
It is now used as a central square and there is plenty to do day and night.
There are several restaurants near the garden. In the afternoon and in the evening, free concerts are given in the centrally located arbor.
Callejon del Beso (Alley of the Kiss). Two balconies that are 69 centimeters apart are the starting point of an old love legend.
Give them some money and some kids will tell you the story.
Bowen Island is a popular destination for a day trip or a weekend trip. You can go kayaking, take long walks, shop and visit restaurants.
This authentic community can be found in Howe Sound, located just outside Vancouver. It is easily accessible with regularly departing water taxis from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
If you like outdoor activities, don’t miss out on the Sea to Sky Corridor.
Whistler (1.5 hours by car from Vancouver) is pricey, but is known for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In winter, this is one of the best North American ski locations and in summer you can mountain bike authentically.
You must have a permit reserved in advance. You must be in possession of a permit to stay overnight at Sirena.
Sirena is the only ranger station where you can not only camp, but where you can also have a hot meal and spend the night in a dormitory. In La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos you can only camp, but no meals are served.
You can buy parking permits directly at the Ranger Station in Puerto Jiménez, although they do not accept credit cards here.
No park permits are issued by the Park Service (MINAE) if the scheduled arrival lasts more than a month. 
At CafeNet El Sol, you can reserve a day ticket for a fee of $30 or $10; the details are on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands is a land of islands in free association with New Zealand. The islands are located in Polynesia, in the middle of the southern Pacific.
The archipelago consists of 15 islands that spread over an ocean area of 2.2 million km2.
The islands are sometimes called "Hawaii down under," because of the equal time zone with Hawaii.
It may be smaller, but it reminds some of the older visitors of Hawaii before this became a state, without all the major tourist hotels and other developments.
There are no cities in the Cook Islands, but they consist of fifteen different islands. The most famous islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Luxury bed and breakfasts offered in rich countries have become a form of art today.
In the top segment, of course, B&Bs mainly compete on two important points: the bed and breakfast.
In the most beautiful establishments you will often find the most luxurious bedding, or perhaps a handmade bedspread or an antique bed.
At breakfast you can get seasonal delights, or the speciality of the house.
It may be in an antique furnished historic building with a well-kept garden and swimming pool.
Getting into your own car and taking a long tour has an intrinsic appeal because it’s so simple.
You’re probably already used to driving your own car and you know its limitations, unlike larger vehicles.
Setting up a tent on private property or in any place of any size may result in unwanted attention.
In short: your car is ideal for taking a road trip, but is rarely convenient to 'camp' in.
Camping in your car is possible if you have a large van, SUV, sedan or station wagon where the seats can be folded down.
There are hotels whose history goes back to the 19th and early 20th centuries (i.e. the golden age of steam trains and ocean liners), even before the WWII.
In these hotels the rich and the celebrities stayed and they often offered a sophisticated dining and nightlife.
Also characteristic are the old-fashioned decoration, the lack of modern facilities and a kind of elegant age.
They are usually owned by a private individual, but sometimes visiting heads of state and other dignitaries are accommodated.
A traveler with enough money can consider a flight around the world which is divided into stays in numerous these hotels.
Travelers are put in touch with the local residents in the cities they are going to by the hospitality exchange network.
Usually, all you have to do is fill out an online form to join such a network; already offer or require some networks extra verification.
A paper or online list of available host families is then provided, sometimes together with references and reviews from other travellers.
In January 2004, computer programmer Casey Fenton booked a cheap flight to Iceland but had no place to stay overnight: couch surfing was a fact.
He sent students to the local university emails and received a huge number of offers for free accommodation.
The typical guest for a hostel is relatively young, in their 20s, but there are also older visitors.
Families with children you see few, but some hostels do offer private rooms for families.
The city of Beijing in China will be the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics. This will be the first city to host both summer and winter games.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and events on the indoor ice rink.
Other ski events take place in the Taizicheng ski resort in Zhangjiakou, which is about 220 km (140 miles) away from Beijing.
Most of the temples have an annual festival from the end of November to mid-May, but that varies per temple and per yearly calendar.
Most temple festivals are part of the anniversary of a temple or that of the deity of the temple or of other major events related to the temple.
The temple festivals of Kerala are very interesting to attend and there are regular parade of decorated elephants, temple orchestra and other festivities.
A world exhibition (usually called World Exposition or simply Expo) is a major international art and science festival.
Participating countries draw up artistic and educational exhibitions in national pavilions to show the world problems or the culture and history of their country.
International horticultural exhibits are events for connoisseurs with flora exhibitions, botanical gardens other plant-related matters.
In theory, these can take place annually (if in other countries), but in reality this is not the case.
These events usually last between three and six months and take place in places of at least 50 hectares.
Over the years, many different film formats were used. The standard 35 mm film (negative of 36 by 24 mm) is much more common.
Normally, it can be easily refilled when it is up and provides a resolution that more or less matches a current DSLR.
For some cameras in medium format, 6 by 6 cm is used or, more precisely, a negative of 56 by 56 mm.
This ensures a resolution that is almost four times the size of the resolution of a negative of 35 mm (3136 mm2 versus 864).
One of the most challenging topics for a photographer is wildlife and this requires a combination of patience, happiness, experience and good equipment.
Nature photography may often be taken for granted, but just like photography in general, a picture says more than a thousand words.
Wild photography often requires a long telephoto lens, although, for example, a group of birds or a small animal requires a different lens.
It can often be difficult to see exotic animals and in parks there are sometimes rules for commercial photography.
Wild animals are either reluctant or hostile. The environment can be cold, hot or otherwise hostile.
There are more than 5000 languages worldwide, of which more than twenty have at least 50 million speakers.
Words on paper are also often easier to understand than outspoken words. This is especially applicable to addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce properly.
In many countries the entire population speaks fluent English, and in even more countries you can at least expect a limited knowledge of English, especially among the younger generations.
Imagine a person from Manchester, from Boston, Jamaica and Sydney going out to dinner together at a restaurant in Toronto.
They tell each other stories about their birthplace, told in their distinctive accents and local jargon.
Buying food in the grocery store is probably the cheapest way to get food. However, without the possibility of cooking, the possibilities are limited to ready meals.
More and more supermarkets are expanding their supply of ready-to-eat food. Some even have a microwave or other appliance to heat up the food on the spot.
In some countries or certain shops you will find at least one restaurant. Often it has an informal atmosphere and you can eat cheaply.
Make a copy of your policy and the contact details of your insurer and keep it with you.
This should include the email addresses of the insurer and international telephone numbers for advice/authorization and the submission of claims.
Make sure you have another copy in your luggage and online (send yourself an email with attachment, or save it in the cloud).
If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, it is useful to keep a copy of the memory or disk (where it is accessible without the internet).
Provide the travel companies, as well as friends and family at home who want to help, with a copy of your insurance information.
Moose are not normally aggressive, but can defend themselves if they feel threatened.
If you think you are not in danger of a moose, you can get too close and that can just go wrong.
Drink alcohol in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone in a different way and it is important to know your own boundaries.
Excessive drinking can lead to long-term health problems such as liver damage and even blindness or death. consuming illegally produced alcohol carries an even higher risk.
Illegal spirits can contain several dangerous impurities, such as methanol. These can cause blindness or death, even in small amounts.
Glasses may be cheaper abroad, especially in low-income countries and lower labour costs.
Imagine that you have an eye test done at home, which is also reimbursed by the insurance, and that you then submit it somewhere else.
There are two problems with expensive branded frames that are available in such places: some are fake frames and the real ones are more expensive than they are at home.
Worldwide, coffee is one of the most widely traded resources. Also in your own region you will find many different types.
Despite this, there are many different ways of drinking coffee worldwide that are worth trying.
Canyoning (or: caynoneering) means you go to the bottom of a canyon that is dry or full of water.
In canyoning, elements of swimming, climbing and jumping are combined. You need relatively little training or physical condition to start with it (compared to, for example, mountaineering, diving or alpine skiing).
Hiking is an outdoor activity where you walk in a natural environment, usually on hiking trails.
A day hike can include a walk of less than a mile to longer walks that can be walked in one day.
For a one-day walking tour along an easy route, few preparations are needed and anyone with an average condition can enjoy it.
Families with small children may need to prepare more, but a day outdoors is perfectly possible even with babies and toddlers.
There are nearly 200 organizations operating worldwide for running tours, most independent.
Go Running, the successor to the Global Running Tours, consists of a network of dozens of providers of 'sightrunning' spread across four continents.
It started in the Running Tours Barcelona and Running Copenhagen (Copenhagen), followed by, among others, Running Tours Prague (Prague).
There are many things you should think about before you and when you travel somewhere.
Don't expect things to be "just like home" when you're traveling. Ways, rules, food, traffic, your stay, use and the language - it will all be to some extent different than you're used to. 
You should always keep this in mind, to avoid disappointments or even dislike local ways of doing things.
Travel agencies have been around since the 19th century. You can ask a travel agency for help when you are going to make a type of trip that you have no experience in when it comes to nature, culture, language or when you go to low-income countries.
Most agencies take on the most common bookings, but many agents specialize in certain types of travel, budgets, or destinations.
It may be better to use a tour operator who books more frequent trips that resemble yours.
Look what trips the agent promotes, on a website or in the shop window.
If you want to travel around the world without spending a lot of money, out of necessity or because of your lifestyle or a challenge, there are some ways to do this.
They basically fall into two categories: working while you travel or trying to limit your expenses. In this article, attention is paid to the latter.
If you are willing to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability to keep spending as low as possible, check out travel with a minimum budget.
It is taken for granted that tourists do not commit offences such as stealing, entering illegally, participating in the black market, begging or that they otherwise exploit people.
An immigration point is usually the first stop when you leave a plane, boat or other vehicle.
On some international train journeys, train inspections are carried out on the road and you must therefore carry a valid ID.
On some night train trips, the conductor collects the passports so you can stay overnight.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa procedure. In some countries, you must report your presence and your residence address to the local authorities.
For this, you may need to fill out a form with the local police or go to an immigration office.
In many countries with such legislation, local hotels arrange registration (ask for this).
In all other cases, only people staying outside the tourist accommodations need to register. However, this makes the legislation a lot more vague, so ask in advance.
Architecture is all about the design and construction of buildings. Tourists often come to architecture alone.
Many buildings are quite beautiful to see and the view from a tall building or a well-placed window can be beautiful.
In many ways, architecture has overlaps with other areas. Think of planology, civil engineering, decorative art, interior design and landscape design.
Many of the pueblos are hugely remote, so you're not going to find a lot of nightlife if you're not traveling to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
Still, drinks are served in almost all of the casinos mentioned above. Some casinos even offer brand entertainment (especially the large casinos in the immediate vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Please note: for visitors from another state it is not always wise to visit the bars in the villages.
In northern New Mexico, for example, there are major problems with driving under the influence. The concentration of drunk drivers is highest near bars in villages.
Unwanted murals or scribbling is also called graffiti.
While it is certainly not a modern phenomenon, it is usually associated with young people who covered public and private property with spray paint.
Now there are also established graffiti artists, graffiti events and 'legal' walls. Because of this, graffiti paintings often look more like artworks than unreadable scribbling. 
Many tourists would like to learn the popular boomerangwerpen.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang so that it comes back, you need to make sure that you have a suitable recurring boomerang.
Most of the boomerangs available in Australia do not even come back. It's best for beginners not to try throwing in windy
In a hot pit in the ground, a Hangi meal is prepared.
The pit is heated with hot stones from the fire or there are places where geothermal heat warms the soil naturally.
The hangi is used to prepare a traditionally roasted meal.
In various places in Rotorua, geothermal hangi is offered. Other forms of hangi can be tried in Christchurch, Wellington and in other places.
MetroRail offers two classes in the commuter trains around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also known as first class) and Metro (known as third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and with less crowds, but more expensive, although still cheaper than normal metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has wagons of both Metro and MetroPlus, the latter of which is always located at the end of the train that is closest to Cape Town.
Transport for others: never lose sight of your bags, especially if you travel internationally.
It may happen that you are deployed as a drug smuggler without even realizing it. That's why you're getting into a lot of trouble.
This includes waiting in line, as drug dogs can be used at any time without notice.
In some countries, extremely severe penalties apply, even for the first offence; these can include prison sentences of more than 10 years or even the death penalty.
If you leave your bags unattended, you may fall victim to theft and, moreover, they may stand out from the authorities fearing bomb threats.
Chances are that you are already immune to these bacteria at home due to the constant exposure to the local germs.
But in other parts of the world, where the bacteriological fauna is new to you, you run much more risk.
Bacteria also grow faster in warmer climates and can survive longer outside the body.
And so you will have to deal with a 'Delhi Belly', the curse of the pharaoh, the revenge of Montezuma or one of the other nicknames of the disease.
Just as many people suffer from breathing problems in colder climates, people in warm climates have more intestinal problems. In most cases, this is very disturbing, but not very dangerous.
Always consider the potentially large cultural differences if you are travelling to a third world country for the first time, or somewhere in the world you have not been to before.
Traveling in an unknown developing country can easily become overwhelming due to all the small cultural differences that are rapidly piling up.
It may be wise to use hotels, Western-style food and services especially in the beginning until you are acclimated.
Make sure you are aware of the local fauna before you go to sleep on a mattress or mat on the ground.
If you go camping, you need to bring a camping bed or hammock so that there are no snakes, scorpions and the like near you.
Fill your house in the morning with the rich smell of coffee and evening with relaxing chamomile tea.
During a staycation you have the time to spoil yourself and to prepare something special.
If you’re in an adventurous mood, take the chance to squeeze or mix smoothies:
You may discover a simple drink that you can make for breakfast when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a varied drinking culture, you can go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods where you don’t often visit.
For those who have little knowledge of medical jargon: there is a difference between the English words 'infectious' and 'contagious'.
An infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, bacteria, fungus or other parasite.
A disease is contagious when it can easily be transmitted to someone else near the infected person.
Many governments are demanding that visitors entering their country or residents leaving their country be vaccinated against various diseases.
These requirements usually depend on the countries that the traveler has previously visited or is still going to visit.
One of the strengths of Charlotte in North Carolina is that there are a lot of good quality opportunities for families.
Residents from other areas often cite family friendliness as a major reason to move there and visitors with children can often enjoy themselves in the city.
Over the past 20 years, the number of child-friendly opportunities in the centre of Charlotte has grown explosively.
Families in Charlotte generally do not use taxis, but in some cases they can be useful.
A surcharge will be charged for more than 2 passengers, which may cause this option to be unnecessarily expensive.
Antarctica surrounds the South Pole and is the coldest place in the world.
Tourist visits are pricey, require a good physical condition, are only possible in the summer (from November to February) and are limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
In the summer, a few thousand staff members live here on some fifty bases, mainly in those areas. Only a small number of staff are also wintering there.
The Antarctic interior consists of a barren plain under a low ice of 2-3 km thick.
Sometimes special flights go further inland, mainly for mountain climbing or to go to the pool where a large base is located.
The South Pole Traverse (or Highway) is a route that is 1600 km long and runs from the McMurdo base station on the Ross Sea to the South Pole.
It is compressed snow with crevices that are padded and marked with flags. You can only drive here with specialized tractors and sleds with fuel and supplies.
These are not very agile, so the walking route runs with a large detour around the Transantarctic Mountains to get to the plateau.
In winter, slippery roads, sidewalks and especially stairs cause the most accidents.
At least you should have shoes with good soles. With summer footwear, ice and snow is often very slippery. Some winter shoes are not even good enough here.
It should be a pattern with a minimum depth of 5 mm (1/5 inches) and if it is cold, the material should remain soft enough.
There are also models with studs and special attachments are available for when it is slippery: fits most boots and shoes, on the heels and/or the sole.
You have to have heels that are low and wide. There is often sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) sprinkled on roads or paths to get more grip.
Avalanches are not a strange phenomenon; steep slopes can only handle a certain amount of snow and the excess snow comes down in an avalanche.
The problem is that the snow is sticky. Something is needed to make it come down and snow coming down can pull the rest of the snow with it.
Sometimes the original reason is the snow that is warmed by the sun, sometimes it is due to a bit more snowfall and sometimes due to other natural events, but often there is a human cause.
A tornado consists of a rotating air funnel of very low pressure, which sucks the outside air inwards and upwards.
They generate high winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air that are carried along as the tornado moves.
First they come down like air cookers from thunderstorm clouds. Once on the ground, they're called "tornadoes."
Providers of a personal VPN (virtual private network) provide a good way to avoid political censorship and commercial IP geofiltering.
For a few reasons, they are better than web proxies: instead of just http, they redirect all internet traffic.
Normally, they offer higher bandwidth and better quality service. They are encrypted, making it harder to keep an eye on them.
Media companies regularly lie about the purpose of this and say they want to prevent piracy.
Actually, region codes have absolutely no effect on making illegal copies; a bit-by-bit copy of a DVD will do just as well on all devices as the original copy.
The real goal is for such companies to gain more control over their markets; after all, money has to roll.
Because calls are routed over the Internet, you do not need to use a telephone company that is located where you live or where you are going.
You also don’t have to request a local number from the municipality where you live; for example, you can use a satellite internet connection in the wilderness of Chicken in Alaska and choose a number that indicates that you are in sunny Arizona.
Often you have to buy an international number separately, so you can get a call from PSTN phones. Where the number is registered is important for the people who call you.
Apps for real-time translations of text: applications capable of automatically translating entire segments of a text from one language to another.
Some apps in this category can even translate texts on boards or other objects to other languages when the user holds his or her smartphone for the object.
Translation machines have improved tremendously and now yield more or less correct translations (and less often tangle), although some concern must be provided, as it is still possible that they are wrong.
In this category, one of the most prominent apps is Google Translate, which allows you to translate offline if you have downloaded the desired language data.
When you’re not in your own country, GPS navigation apps on your smartphone are the easiest and most convenient way to find your way.
You save money because you no longer have to buy new tickets or buy a separate GPS device or rent them from a car rental company.
If you don’t have a data connection for your phone, or if it’s up, it doesn’t work or only works limited.
Each convenience store is filled with a confusing range of prepaid phone cards that can be used in phone booths or for regular phones.
Although you can call anywhere with almost all cards, some providers specialize in offering favorable call rates for certain groups or countries.
These services are usually accessible via a free telephone number that can be reached free of charge from many telephones.
Rules for regular photography also apply to video recordings. These rules may apply even more to this.
If it is forbidden to take a picture somewhere, you should not make a video of it at all.
When using a drone, you should check in advance what you are allowed to film and what permissions and additional licenses are required.
Flying a drone over an airport or crowd is almost always a bad idea, even when it’s not banned in your neighborhood.
Today, prices are almost always compared first before booking, rather than booking directly with the airline.
It sometimes happens that you pay completely different prices for the same flight with different airlines and it can be worth comparing the search results for booking and also looking at the website of the airline itself.
Although you do not need a visa for a short tourist or business visit to certain countries, as a student you often stay longer than a normal tourist.
In general, you must apply for a visa in advance if you want to stay abroad for a longer period of time.
For student visas, different requirements and application procedures generally apply than for ordinary tourist and business visas.
In many countries, the desired research institute must provide you with an offer letter and you must demonstrate that you have sufficient finances for the first year of study.
Ask the institution or the immigration department of the country where you want to study to details about the requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, if you work abroad, you usually have to file income tax in the country where you are located.
In each country, income tax is structured differently, which can greatly vary tax rates and scales per country.
In certain federal countries, including the U.S. and Canada, income tax is levied both at the federal and local level. This allows the applicable rates and disks to differ greatly between regions.
While there is normally no immigration check or it is only a formality when you arrive in your home country, the check at customs can be quite a hassle.
Make sure you know what you can and cannot enter and declare everything that crosses the legal boundaries.
A good first step in the world of travel reports is writing for an existing travel blog website.
If you have mastered formatting and editing on the internet, you can create your own website later.
You can really make a difference if you volunteer while traveling, but it's not just about giving.
If you want to get acquainted with a new culture, gain new contacts and develop yourself, actually living in another country and volunteering is a good option.
It can also be a good way to stretch your budget and stay somewhere a little longer, since a lot of volunteer work offers a room and food and some even offer you a small salary.
The Normans reached the Black Sea and Caspian Sea via waterways in Russia. Part of this route is still useful. You may need a difficult to obtain special permit.
The White Sea Sea Canal connects the Arctic Ocean mainly via rivers and lakes with the Baltic Sea via the Onegameer, the Ladogameer and St. Petersburg.
The Onegameer is also connected to the Volga. So it is still possible to go through Russia via the Caspian Sea.
Once in the marinas, everything shows itself. Here you will find other boat lifters that will notify you.
In fact, you hang notes in which you offer help, polarize through the harbor, you approach people to ask if you can clean their yacht, try to make contact with sailors in the bar, etc.
Try to chat with as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will recognize you and give you tips on which ship is looking for someone.
Think carefully when you make your choice for a Frequent Flyer airline in an alliance.
While you may think that you might be best able to join an airline you use the most, you should be aware that the benefits offered are often different and that one airline can be more generous with frequent flyer points than the other, even if they are in the same alliance.
Airlines Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Etihad Airways and Emirates are greatly expanding the number of flights to the African continent and flying at sharper prices than airlines from Europe in many major destinations in Africa.
Turkish Airlines has been flying to 39 destinations in 30 African countries since 2014.
If you still have time left during your trip, you can see how you compare total price quote to Africa with a quote for a world trip.
Do not forget to include the extra costs of extra visas, departure tax, land transport, etc. for all those places outside Africa.
If you want to fly all the way around the world in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited by a lack of transocean flights.
There is no airline alliance that takes care of all three ocean crossings in the southern hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not provide any crossings).
Everything with the exception of the eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti is covered by the services of Star Alliance. This is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
You can not only cross the South Pacific and the South American West Coast with this flight. (look below)
The ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan waged war against the Azerbaijanis in 1994.
A new republic was established with the help of the Armenians. However, there is not a single recognized nation (not even Armenia) that officially recognizes this state.
Diplomatic disagreements about the area remain an obstacle in the relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
The Canal Belt is the famous 17th-century district around the Binnenstad of Amsterdam.
The entire area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its unique cultural and historical value. House prices are nowhere else in the country so high.
Cinque Terre, or Five Countries, consists of five coastal villages with the names Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso and is located in Liguria, an Italian region.
UNESCO has included them on the World Heritage List.
In the past centuries, terraces have been built carefully, from the rugged, steep landscape to the cliffs that overlook the sea.
Part of the charm is because there is hardly any business development. Paths, trains and boats are used to connect the villages and cars from outside the villages have no access.
The different forms of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from the French spoken in France, although they still look similar enough to be understood by both parties.
In particular, the numbering system in the French-speaking part of Belgium and Switzerland contains some particulars that differ from the French used in France and a few words are pronounced differently.
Still, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss would have learned Standard French in school so they could understand you, even if you were using the Standard French numbering system.
In many places in the world, waving means a friendly greeting.
In Malaysia, at least in the rural areas, however, it means 'come along', similar to a curved index finger that is directed towards the body, a gesture used in certain Western countries, and should only be used in this way.
A British traveler in Spain can wave in a similar way to say goodbye, with the palm facing the swayer (instead of direction the person being waved to), standing for the gesture to come back.
Supporting languages are artificial or composite languages with the aim of easing communication between people who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are different from lingua francas. Lingua francas are languages that have emerged naturally or organically and for whatever reason have become the dominant form of communication between people with other native languages.
At the hottest time of day, travelers can start to see mirages, making them think they see water (or other objects).
If the traveler moves towards the mirage, it can be dangerous because precious energy and the remaining water is consumed.
At night it can also get particularly cool in very hot deserts. The risk of becoming hypothermic is significant if you are not wearing clothes that keep you warm.
When you walk through the rainforest, you should beware of mosquitoes especially in the summer.
If you drive through the subtropical rainforest, you only need to keep the doors open for a few seconds while you step in and the mosquitoes are already in your car.
Both birds and mammals can become infected with bird flu.
There were fewer than a thousand cases in people; in some cases this was fatal.
People who work with poultry are most often involved in these cases, but birdwatchers are also at risk.
Characteristic of Norway are steep fjords and valleys that are followed by an almost even plateau
These plains are also called 'vidde', or a vast space without trees or borders.
In Rogaland and Agder, they are generally called "heath." This confesses that it is a treeless moorland that is covered with heather.
The glaciers are not stable, but flow down from the mountain. This causes cracks and crevices that may be covered by snow.
The walls and ceilings of ice caves can collapse and gorges can be closed.
At the edge of the glaciers, large ice blocks break loose, which fall down and can kettle or roll over the edge.
The tourist season for the hill stations usually peaks in late summer.
In winter, however, they possess a different, but equally charming beauty. Many mountain stations get a good layer of snow, so you can ski and snowboard there.
Only a few airlines still offer mourning fares, lowering the cost of last-minute funeral trips.
These are available from airlines such as WestJet, Air Canada, Delta Air Lines and, for a flight from the US or Canada, Lufthansa.
In all cases, you book by phone with the airline.
