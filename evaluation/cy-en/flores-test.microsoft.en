In addition to confirming that some dinosaurs had at least feathers, a theory that is already spread, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional order.
Scientists say the feathers of this animal are chestnut brown on the higher side with a bottom side the color of a seer or caretonial.
The discovery provides a straightforward to the evolution of hawkbird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have well-developed shafts, called rachis, but have other feather features - arrowflies and branchlets - the researchers gathered that the rachis are likely to be a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying but rather for temperature control or display. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample showed adult feathers and not minor chick feathers.
The researchers suggested that although this was a young dinosaur tail, the sample showed adult feathers and not chick manoeuvres.
A car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killing two policemen and injuring more than twenty others.
The governor's office said nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected a Daesh (ISIL) militant was responsible for the attack.

The lightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which belongs to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is from the point of view of magnetic inversions.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the programme was written to simulate observations made of the Archer galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark substance of the galaxy and the dark substance of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls on the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way casts power on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that the dark substance affects another dark substance in the same way that a regular substance does.
This theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy like some kind of leuzone, and is made up of a number of small particles.

Dr Tony Moll discovered the Highly Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "very troubling and very alarming because of the very high death rate".
Some patients may have contracted the infection in hospital, Dr Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health workers.
In a year's time, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the whole group of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters will isolate themselves in a booth, and put a sheet of preprinted paper showing their preferred candidate in an envelope.
After officials check the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
French electoral law regimes cases quite strictly.
Since 1998, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote except those of the authorized voters who were properly counted.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all parts of the process. In the evenings, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following certain procedures.

Superintendent of police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit him, none were hurt.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed as emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently relocated to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been at Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then accused of murdering her son.
She is in custody pending indictment and proceedings, but any eyewitness testimony could be tainted because her image has been published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have looked at the publication of photographs as potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists walk a dangerous line if they publish pictures etc. of suspects".
The Crown Office, which has overall charge of prosecutions, has suggested to journalists that no further comment will be given until at least the indictment.
The document, according to the secret tor, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly addressed include the future state of Jerusalem which is sacred to both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel insists on a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
Shooters in the additional pest control trial would be closely supervised by custodians, as the trial is monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership of NPWS and the Australian Sport Shooters Association (NSW) Inc, eligible volunteers were recruited, under the Sport Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting campaign received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly sworn in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Marteller's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by a failure to hold elections, some due since 2011.
Around 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people and minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 24 additional cases of overheating, with the company calling them "non-serious".
The administration responded by calling the report's postponement by Apple "truly unfortunate."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said no damage had been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has kept tourists from Hong Kong afloat by hijacking their bus in Manila, the Filipino capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle towards the tourists.
Several moths have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six ostracists, including the children and elderly, were released early, along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an aged woman as she needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and went into a career in intoxication.
She trained him as an obstetrician and started working at the Auckland National Hospital for Women in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began researching prematurely conceived during his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed up the maturation of the baby's lungs in the womb.
Xinhua reported that government investigators discovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extremism. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two lions. Pretty unique just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels made the comment that "Luna is as weird as I am... perhaps more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Out of 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 per cent of those surveyed share this view, keen for Queen Elizabeth ll to be Australia's last monarch.
In the extremes of the survey, 29 per cent of those surveyed thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim in the 100m and 230m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his problems his fitness is in doubt.
He has been unable to take the drugs needed to overcome his pain as he has been banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known constellation number to date on Jan. 25.
Several people verified the discovery using hardware and software by early February and it was made public on Tuesday.
It is possible comets were the source of water supply to the earth along with an organic substance that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, as comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumours as "political gossip and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow planes to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than older ground-based radar-based technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft in more detail and provide pilots with more detailed information.
No extra transport is being arranged and above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park and ride facilities are not available at the stadium.
Fears of a lack of transport raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to have taken much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin pink, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus pink, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can be twisted and polished. It can be mortified or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and adhered to on another metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "decorated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You are able to make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are prototons with their electrons removed (since Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Spin the two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel weird and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a towering toilet in almost every house, connected by a complex sewerage system.
Traces of sewerage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoian cities of Creta and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in Egypt, Persia and ancient China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space gets the call and then mirrors it back down, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere misrepresents some of our light and scent.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is give us much easier and faster transportation.
He has brought us the train, the car, and many other transport devices.
Underneath them are more moderately sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopians and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to her success is the layby concept, a special job by each cat that keeps her from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called nuns.
Nuns consist of one to three mature male lions that belong, along with up to thirty females and natives.
The women are usually closely related to each other, a large family of sisters and daughters.
Nuggets of lions behave much like nuns of wolves or dogs (but not to other big cats), and are also very lethal to their lungs.
A good all-around athlete, the tiger is able to climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the power of a strong human being.
Tigers are in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full roar of a lion's voice, but more like a sentence of whispered words being shouted.
Oselots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. All the animals oselots hunt are almost much smaller than himself.
Scientists think oselots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling, sensing where they have been on land.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move very stealthily, too. Oseliots hunt their lungs by melting into their surroundings and then jumping on their lungs.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (as if it moved over a series of mountains or rivers, or if it moved to a new island so that it is not easy to move back) it will often find itself in a different environment from the one it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can't be called the same species.
We call this process species, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciesisation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also offer shelter.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the dominant predator of its time, so it wasn't afraid of anything, except other mosasauruses.
His long soul was filled with more than 70 very sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of his mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that would cross his path.
We do not know for sure, but it could have a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he might even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; a giant dinosaur like T. rex wouldn't even be his equal.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual wolf items, including a wild boar, a pawn, a snail, and a type of novice called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have feasts together lying on their sides as they ate their meals.
The meals of Ancient Rome could not have included foods brought to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have grain, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods which was considered the home of that god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple chant followed by an inner saint that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called cigars, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special saint to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place in the open air.
The girls were cooking in the yard; The shops looking out over the street were open counters. It was stone used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the lands of Canaan, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was thinly veiled. In the Norwegian sages they find that Erik the Red was deported from Iceland for murder, and that while travelling further west, he found and called Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living in the place at the time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've watched the film National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not the case. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in her life, the large parchment document (she measured 29 inches and three-quarters by 24 and a half inches) was rolled into storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added as a label only.
The Day-D landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
They were controlled by France "Vichy". These were French who had agreed peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than fought them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the attack was dubbed "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks the Americans and Free France forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
Civilization is an individual culture shared by a large significant group of people who live together and work together as a society.
The word "civilisation" comes from the Latin civilis, meaning cityal, belongs to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and that somehow defines the size of the society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilised culture implies the transfer of knowledge across several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and a fair dispersal.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognised as proper civilisations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen provinces first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to enforce taxes, and, because there was no activism or national judiciary, it relied on provincial authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Nor did it have authority to sarcasm tax laws and tariffs between provinces.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the provinces before they could be amended and the provinces were so deprecated from the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, as well as Germany national football team, are the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, swordsmanship, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster, a group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "islet".
The beginning of Taiwan starts way back in the 15th century where European sailors coming by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in south-west Taiwan, initiating a transformation in grain production practices and employing Chinese labourers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing royalist forces (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing in the First War between China and Japan (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, ruling the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windows Room.
Most buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common lane image photography format in the world is 35mm, and was the foremost film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high, which is a little confusing.
So the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the most simple whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or roughly equivalent to this aspect ratio.
The often abused and ridiculed dray rule is a simple guide that creates dynamics while keeping a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective place for the primary topic is at the crossroads of lines that divide the image into traverses vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years the Christian religion had tied European countries together despite variations in language and customs.
His ubiquitous power affected everyone from king to common man.
One of the main Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's financial funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this belief was being answered.
Shortly after the war began, Britain initiated a blockade against the German navy.
The strategy proved effective, blocking vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade was a generally accepted violation of international law orchestrated by several international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, posing a danger to even neutral vessels.
As there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant aspects of the majority of citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and indignities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 sent to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous position) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; every period of China or every ruling family was a distinct monarchy.
There was also an unstable era of divided provinces between all monarchs. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin Kings.
During these periods fierce warfare took place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China; thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are a number of social impacts such as the use of a metric system, the move from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people not to just one ruler.
Occupations were also open to all male candidates after the Revolution, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for soldiers because instead of the army ranks being founded on a class they were now founded on gun quality.
The French Revolution also inspired a number of other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this noble life. He used to go to a cave that came to bear the name "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for meditation.
the cave itself, which survived the times, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Lying on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you're inside the cave, it's complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the beautiful clear sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built to honour dead Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt consists of a number of pyramids (the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and large Sphinxes.
The great pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up arch" mark looks like V and the "down arch mark" looks like a staple or square with its bottom side missing.
Up means you should start at the front and push the arch, and down means you should start at the handle (which is where your hand holds the arch) and pull the arch.
An upward arch usually produces a softer sound, while a downward arch is stronger and more assertive.
You are welcome to mark your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the arche marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be treated with respect.
King Louis XVl, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, a frightened Madam Elizabeth, were on 6th October 1789 forced back to Paris from Versailles by a flock of market women.
In a carriage, they travelled back to Paris surrounded by a flock of people screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to have the windows of their carriage open wide of the head.
At one point a member of the flock waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed in front of the Queen who had scarred for her life.
The war expenditure of US imperialism in the conquest of the Filipinos was borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.D. to pay a large amount of the spending and interest on bonds levied in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the special profits derived from the exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Temples you have to understand the context that motivated the creation of the guild.
The era in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by tradition ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the push of technology or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is motivated by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general notions: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence to a wide extent, and that technology in turn has "effects" on indigenous, instead of socially conditioned societies.
For example, one might say that the motor car necessarily leads to road development.
However, a road network across the country is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher number of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
There was a large element of cultural determinism in romanticism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the geography shaped individuals, and over time it arose customs and culture belonging to that geography, and these, existing in harmony with the place of society, were preferable to oppressively imposed laws.
As Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Caer Gystennin was regarded as the fashion capital of fickle Europe.
His fame for being a luxury supercentenarian began around 400 B.C. and lasted until about 1100 B.C.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the return of Crusaders bringing gifts such as silks and spices that were worth more than what Byzantine markets offered.
This is when the title Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style peaked between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th centuries.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, as a result of the slow channels of communication, fashions in the west could lag behind by up to 25 to 30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the era as a result of the crusades, people started using buttons to close clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is made to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the agriculturist and his/her family.
Sustaining agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses preserved seeds native to the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other fairly simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social standards allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate their membership through unique and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, rudeness, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "semi-fernal" or wild. Some semi-fertile children have been captivated by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases the children had been abandoned because the parents had rejected the child's profound intellectual or physical impairment.
Semiconscious children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma as children before being abandoned or before running away.
Others are alleged to have been reared by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When brought up entirely by non-human animals, the semi-feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely like those of the particular animal caring for him, such as his fear of or indifference to human beings.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step beyond that.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather an aid that supports individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold but so is the little paper clips guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolding is internalized in the software and is intended to question, motivate, and explain procedures that may have been challenging for the students to cope with on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even crucifixion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that isn't nurturing, caring, and educational, but they are.
We believe the Foster Care System is a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is meant to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessary that wasn't provided in the home they were taken from.
The Internet combines elements of mass as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet give rise to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to materials and satisfactions.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighgmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, namely facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that whether a person is lying can be ascertained by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his paper The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks suggested how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Separation and reemergence move back and forth between two pools with each generation.
Out on the safana, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements of available plant resources.
Furthermore, failing to do so has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide many proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in rather the same forbearance that the chimpanzees on the safana do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking up during the period of your normal sleep and falling asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up fully.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of liquid (especially water or tea, which we know to be a diuretic) before sleeping, forcing someone to go and drop water.
The amount of inner peace an individual has correlates contrary to the amount of tension in one's body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the potential to find complete peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing hindering this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but was extended by the path of mahaiana love and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a complete love path.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mandibles and imagining.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Godhead. By visualizing various goddesses the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are invigorated and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. With the end of the war a conflict of system, process and culture caused the guerrilla nations.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to continue for the next 40 years and would be truly fought, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish guards were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian foothills.
However, these plans were almost superseded overnight, when over 800,000 troops of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after attacking eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Proliferation Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral as well as multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to invade Britain as it did in the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in Iran's Zagros Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed on hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goat shepherds, usually children or young people, similar to the better-known shepherd. These methods of shepherding are still in use today.
Wagon roads were built in England as early as the 16th Century.
Although wagon tracks consisted only of parallel planks of wood, they enabled horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Line slippers were introduced quite early on to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realised that tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on the top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused further expense on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first known mode of transport, humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning backstreet man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus did not walk trunks as often.
Two-foot specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We're able to start living more environmentally friendly, we're able to join the environmental movement, and we're even able to be activists to reduce the suffering of the future to an extent.
This is just like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, then we should discover the root of the problems, and we should seduce them.
It is clear enough that the world has changed a lot because of humanity's scientific and technological advances, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and humanity's profligate way of life.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
Through the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap sheets".
The first public reading of this document by John Nixon was in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and was readied to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to remain in existence are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have many features that look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with leashes and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on both their back legs like a T-Rex.
Effectively every computer in use today is based on manipulating information coded in the form of binary numbers.
Only one of two values, that is 0 or 1, a binary number can have, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that no diagnosis can be made immediately.
Perhaps the best sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of toxic medication or chemicals in the home.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bugs are formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with bed Lice, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Murderous bugs and bed lice are colorless, adapted to live in a nest or their host's home.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple Sclerosis is a disease that has an effect on the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have Multiple Sclerosis than males.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in their child's interest, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main aim of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this approach guides most scientific research.
It is not alone however, experimentation, which is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible theories, ask questions, and make observations, also informs scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and, especially, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As understanding of the Greeks declined, the West found itself divorced from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
A number of observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of intracellular cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic suggestions, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will perpetuate a period of free-running cycling even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the foremost suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments with either marking the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material being affected and whether the affected cells are lineage cells.
Only mutations in lineage cells can be transmitted to children, but mutations elsewhere can cause cells to die or cause cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the country in cars to go to their workplaces and are passed by others heading to their work destination at the place they have just left off.
In this dynamic shuttle transport everyone is somehow connected to and supports a private car-based transport system.
Now, science suggests that this massive carbon economy has knocked the biosphere out of one of its stable conditions that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling.
Why do transportation systems incentivize such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two places and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behaviour is not predictable with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic streams tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) intensity, and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them dodge enemies more easily and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to bend their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't bend their wings back are the snake's wasp and Mai's midges.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was correct but many people thought the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the sun ( and even the other stars).
This seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel as if it's moving, does it?
The Amason River is the second longest and largest on Earth. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amason is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
A complete 20 percent of the water that flows out of the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amason.
The main Amason River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles). She collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction continued to the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never exceeded in terms of their size or the technical campusiness of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the memorials of their predecessors, who at the time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its official legislation and correspondence.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these can be found in an indigenous form and are relatively simple to excavate with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made of a mixture of one or more four elements. They were earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four substance conditions (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what you see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain a small amount of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of substance. All substances are made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the full stop at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as new methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been downgraded to lesser status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, without having to come close to a binder.
One can only guess what the keyboard will be when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's rather like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to break away from each other with little or no pushing.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called a crater.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the uplands.
There may be more moon missions on the near side because the gray is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what drives people or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or cravings that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they want and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory are two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can arise as managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the lads" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, perform disciplinary actions, perform performance assessments, assign responsibility, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she has to change everything the team has been doing and take ownership of it.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often leads to rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The virtual teams are held to the same standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their team may meet according to different time zones that their local managers may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the laborious process of setting up an institution of learning? One goal for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can become evident.
As a result, the process of an organization working collaboratively to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative new process to serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation as well as common knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organisations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. So it limits the area of research and makes it much more detailed.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour aids scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, seizures, injuries, and tumours have effects on behavior and cause changes in certain mental operations.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand processes in our thinking.
While Artificial Intelligence has a significance of science fiction, Artificial Intelligence forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent machine behavior, learning and adaptation.
Research in Artificial Intelligence involves making machines automate work that requires intelligent behavior.
Examples include management, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognising handwriting, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been built into several home computer apps and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom. Quite often a teacher would love to take her students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the Capital of the Province, the website is remodeled every year, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often start their blog experience with messy grammar and spelling, audience attendance changes that across the board.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces pupils to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to feed audience interest inspires pupils to be capable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of others' writings as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating, bilingual capital of Canada and features a variety of art galleries and museums showcasing Canadians past and present.
Further south is the Niagra Falls and to the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered fully Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost deserts uninhabited.
What a comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the United Provinces than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent on its own in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are well known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and had a large place in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama found the Peninsular Route from Europe to India.
In the north the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveller say they are married, regardless of what their marital status actually may be.
She also helps to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realise that cultural differences may lead to what they would consider harassment and that it is not uncommon to be followed, have your arm amputated, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century Before the Common Age, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading centres there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in the whole of Morocco.
Around ancient Medina it's easy to find places that sell Moroccan traditional goods, like taglines, pottery, leather goods, husks, and a whole spectrum of jewels, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devoured by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the town's roads, especially the town centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along with tracking Mountain Gorillas which is among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to travel around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese French for a short trip.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poorer town, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sands.
He was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities in the country, because it has more Arab than African instincts.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 sq km and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each hosting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the main symbol of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and access fees for the Park.
It could also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either a selection of parks or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider it the main hub.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart made visible by the presence of Victoria Harbour water.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the shores of Kowloon opposite.
Most of Hong Kong Island's ample urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place the British colonists took as theirs and so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove area in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) into the heartland of Bangladesh and coastal India.
The Sundarbans has been declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Sundarbans National Park is the name of the part of the forest that is within Indian territory.
The forests aren't just mangrove marshes, however – they contain some of the last vestiges of the great jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometers, a third of which is covered with water/marsh areas.
Since 1966 the Sundurbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and there are an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 placenta deer in the area now.
Buses leave the intercity bus station (over the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the buses between areas are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stabilized bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oyapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers rise to a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two lanes 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now East Paragwai, living as semi-roaming hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century Paragwâi, previously known as "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the Spanish conquerors' encounter with the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial period, and lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paragwai has managed to retain much of its native character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be found here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) and its value is the same as that of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands located in Stanley across the road to the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
On the outlying islands credit cards are likely not to be accepted, although British and US currencies may be accepted; Check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so you should exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it's summer there when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the sub-tropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold; Temperatures barely get below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain received stays more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/metre away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/metre away from all other wild animals.
However domesticated they may appear, wild oxen, giants, elks, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so allow them space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking hungry foods and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval disagreement in 1889 when seven German, US and British ships refused to leave the harbour.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British crewman. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the killing of Tupua chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland occupies two harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, in the wealthy suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Mid Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded with a good range of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are a number of French wines available, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might fare better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're concerned.
For the Australian people, the idea of "white flat'' coffee is foreign. One black short is "espresso", cappuccino comes high loaded with cream (not foam), and tea is served dairy-free.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of those reefs are rare.
However, you should take advice from authorities, obey all indications, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box sea slugs are found near beaches and river estuaries between October and April north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside of these times.
Sharks exist, however they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater Crocodiles do not actively live in the sea, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the passenger peace of mind that she will have a place to sleep once she reaches her destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even flight and hotel packages combined.
They can also reserve the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or acquire other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, enquiries about any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees camp out on site, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the events, you'll have to get in early to get a campsite close to the music.
Although the music on the main stages is finished, keep in mind that there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have dedicated camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, you should check the location of the cabin, as going through a row causes some pretty awful noise for those most affected.
The Saint Petersburg cruise includes time in town. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos usually put a lot of effort into making the most of the time and money guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offerings, to keep guests in a good mood, and keep them in the building.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness defies judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone going to drive on high latitudes or over mountain gaps should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy roads with snow on them, friction is low and you can't drive as if you're on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow to captivate you can fall in very little time.
Visibility can also be limited by snow falling or blowing or by vapour or frost on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, and traffic continues mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in general usage refers to travelling over land to see Africa's stunning wildlife, especially on safana.
Some animals, such as elephants and jiraffod, tend to come close to cars and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, hunting lions and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with a sparrow.
The walking safari (also known as a "wilderness walk", "hiking safari", or even "trekking") involves hiking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August until 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could have a thorny situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but at the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic games were scheduled.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥ 2,500 and ¥ 130,000, with normal tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them out. Many hotels have iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if there isn't one present in the room.
If irons aren't available, or you're not keen to wear ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow fabric to get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for a minute is enough, in others several minutes is required.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you had a concern, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can ruin food, cause painful itching, or in worse case cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually considered pests.
Toll-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and customs in some locations.
Travellers entering heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often crossing through an isolated rural landscape.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be alert: steep alleyways, narrow lanes, and harsh turns are common.
Posted speed limits are strikingly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - commonly 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour) - and strict obedience to them is even more important than otherwise.
Oddly, though, mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of road, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are fatty and varied, similar to those of their neighbour to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastry cakes are common, with apples cooked into pastry throughout the year, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German baked goods include almonds, barbed nuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you have an appetite for small but rich pastry cakes, try those called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Knapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a meal based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is commonly used in curries; in the South Indies and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a huge variety of regional foods found across the nation.
But, if used without additional conditions, the term tends to mean the food originally coming from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the island, Jafa's cooking method consists of a collection of simple flavored dishes, the main flavors of which Jafa people prefer are peanuts, china, sugar (especially Jafa cocoa cane sugar) and various fragrant spices.
Warthogs are harpoons to the rider's feet hanging down on the bow of the saddle.
They offer more stability to the rider but may have safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but his foot is caught in the warp, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear saucy riding boots and a rather narrow leash den.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather warhead to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as Yosemite South America, with a variety of large granite walls and rocks.
Peaks feature amazing views of mountain peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly setting up new routes amongst its endless potential of walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered landscape with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski headhunters", who plan an entire holiday around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depict skiers as far back as 5000 Before Christ!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the seventeenth century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skipacking: This activity is also known as perched skiing, tour skiing or ski hiking.
It is associated with but not involves travel on alpine skies or mountaineering, the latter on steep terrain and requiring much stronger skis and shoals.
Think of the ski trail as a similar walking trail.
In good conditions you can travel distances considerably greater than walking - but you rarely get the speed of cross-country skiing without heavy pucks in gray trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through multiple countries would mean having to maneuver through visa applications and passport control a number of times.
The Schengen zone, however, works somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, given a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas to each Schengen member country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be less in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Deer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture associated with the craft is also important to many with other professions.
Nevertheless, even traditionally, not all Sámi have engaged in large-scale deer husbandry, but have lived from fishing, hunting and the like, and keeping deer primarily as pulling animals.
Today a number of Sámi work in modern crafts. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, Sámi district.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani, the word "Gypsies" is considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of Romani people.
If the country you visit becomes subject to travel consultation, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance could be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but theirs is designed for their own citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisory documents are a brief summary of the political situation in only one country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe disruption to society, or loss of human lives.
Severe weather can happen anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Powerful winds, hail, excessive wetness, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornados, water columns, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include hurricanes, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as they may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "Hostile environment Course" is likely to offer the address of a local company.
A course will usually cover all issues covered here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course usually runs from 2-5 days and will include role play, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the desert are common, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Passengers planning a foreign gender redirection operation must ensure they carry valid documents for the journey home.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with undeclared gender (X) or updated documents to match desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is equally widely varied.
Searches at security controls have also become much more intrusive in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Bifurcation is the flow that comes back from waves that break off the beach, often in a reef or something similar.
Because of the underwater topology the returning flow is concentrated in a few deeper places, and fast currents into deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue when trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you don't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and on if someone has noticed you, you may want to wait to be rescued.
Second entry shock comes faster than culture shock (there is less of a new servant period), it lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travellers who had an easy time adjusting to the new culture sometimes have a particularly difficult time readjusting to their native culture.
In returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs from your home culture.
When you first went to a foreign country, people were probably patient and tolerant, knowing that travellers in a new country had to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of noise and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenery is displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by a number of countries and possess the largest number of stations, with sixteen operational in 2020.
The islet lies 120 kilometers north of the Penrhyn. The largest one is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the callor of a still-active flooded volcano provides a stunning natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Penrhyn, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsular mountains here join the plateau, then reappear to form the 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antartica's highest mountains, the Vinsion massif, highest at Vinson Mountain at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without the reach of mobile phones, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally no substitute for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure ships, as well as missions with remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information about contacting this service.
Travel and learning is an increasingly popular choice for those planning a gap year.
This is particularly popular among school leavers, allowing them to take a year out before university, without jeopardising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can improve your chances of moving into higher education back in your home country.
There is usually a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Lake Bill Country" also has thousands of islands, both lakes and coastal islands.
In the islands and lakes you don't necessarily need a sailboat.
While the largest coastal islands and lakes are actually big enough for any boat to sail, even smaller boats or kayaks offer a different experience.
Going by boat is a national leisure activity in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic Cruises involve a long stay in St Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of days as well as return and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore using shipboard excursions you will not need a separate visa (in 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's not unlike fears and dislikes of other things many people have.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown or on not having control.
Transportation companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Time is often very important with business documents, goods or spare parts for an emergency repair.
In some ways, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other roads and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they had sent things by air transport, on some routes it could have taken days to get through unloading and tolls.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as logged luggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you become relevant.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to pay a big batch of money for the privilege (or, better still, get your company to do it for you).
However, this isn't cheap: as rough rules, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business, and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in even looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charging appropriately.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-published Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the breakdown in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Once in the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, advanced and busy commercial centre, set around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide walkways, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are littered with traditional red tile roofs, the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a fairer atmosphere to Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual eight-storey church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble statues of pigeons over some tombs.
It's worth half an hour to take a walk around the interesting village.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra which was made famous for aliens after a complimentary account of its exploits by Lord Byron.
Bus 403 Scotturb travels to Sintra regularly, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady Fatima (Concert), a place famous worldwide for Mary's appearances.
Remember that you are basically visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site that has almost immeasurable meaning to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Treat the site with all the dignity, reverence and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti into structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. About half prefer to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understand it, and effectively everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are shown in Catalan only because it is established by law as the official first language.
Yet Spanish is widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements at Metro are made in Catalan only, but unplanned hits are published in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a bad reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get ahead in Paris is to be on your best behavior, behave like someone who is a "bien éléve" (well-bred). It will make moving around quite a bit easier.
The supple fuss of the people of Paris will quickly disappear if you show some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes national park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and pine trees, and contains a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a distinctively wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and woodpecker can be found there, as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monastery, women are required to wear skirts over the knees and have something over their shoulders, too.
Most of the monasteries provide cloaks for women who come unprepared, but if you bring one yourself, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same line, men must wear trousers covering the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but those clothes are not washed after each user so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Food from Faiorca, like foods from similar zones in the Mediterranean Sea, is based on bread, vegetables and dog (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available condiments such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Each noun, alongside the Sie word for you, always begins with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be argued that it makes reading easier, although writing is complicated somewhat by the need to ascertain whether a verb or adjective is being used in a noun form.
Pronunciation is quite easy in Italian as most words are pronounced exactly the way they are written.
The capital letters to look out for are c and g, as the way they are pronounced varies depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure you pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means vehicle.
Persian grammar is generally relatively easy and consistent.
Therefore, reading this grammar book would help you understand a lot about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
It goes without saying that if you know the language of Româwns, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know little Spanish can hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today, and are used as museums, or sites of education.
Since light pollution at their peak wasn't a problem as it is today, they're usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Seeing cherry blossoms, or hanami, has been an element of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from a China where plum flowers were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the emperor would hold the first cherry blossom parties around the Imperial Court only for himself and the other members of the gentry.
Plants look their best when in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you're visiting a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" is also going to make you thrown out, without discussion.
Singapore is an exceptionally safe place to be in general and very easy to move around, and you're able to buy almost anything on arrival.
But being located in the "high tropics" a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to cope with heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
A few buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you plan to take is going to Hebron and not only to the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base your holiday on.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhein valley or taking a waterwalk to interesting cities on the Donwy or taking a boat along the Erie Canal.
They also define roads for popular walking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and celebrates Jesus' birthday.
Many of the holiday traditions are also followed by non-believers living in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night awake in some open space to see the dawn break.
There are Christian theological explanations for this tradition of course, but it could be a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning to celebrate at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the great tortoise the Galapagos' main grazing animal.
Since the arrival of man to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Light, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since the population of the areas is sparse, and light pollution is therefore not often an issue, you will also be able to see the stars.
Japan's working culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be used to.
Suits are standard business clothes, and colleagues call each other by their family names or by job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is essential, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual feats.
Employees often have to have the approval of their bosses for any decision they make, and are expected to obey their bosses' instructions unquestioningly.
