28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind spirit with a big heart.
His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation.
He was the brother that went with the flow.
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.

Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.
The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS.
The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended.
He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.
But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also turned since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He's denied that emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of sorts.
For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has slumped by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.
They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.
"Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides.
It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the chief executive.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.
But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.
He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
I'm very emotional because my family are here as well
I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.
I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!
Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see.
He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.
It has been a rollercoaster ride.
Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban.
Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best.
And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.
Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but gave no reason.
Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
Later he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian).
On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.
Do the smiles convince?
This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.
So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?
No-one knows yet.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.
In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.
Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.
But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.
Mystery as fish land in Banff garden
A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500m from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
Happily, it all went very well.
Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Dynamic on vault.
Effortless on beam.
Jaw-dropping on floor.
Brilliant all over.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.
Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.
Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.
United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.
While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.
She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.
Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.
Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.
She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.
She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.
"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
Family tells the station he is expected to recover.
He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.
Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.
It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.
First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.
The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This is powerful.
Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.
These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, success in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.
To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government.
This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns.
If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."
Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.
Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.
If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.
And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period.
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report
A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today.
Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote.
Currently, a voter merely has to state their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.
Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.
He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting.
Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.
Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.
Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.
He also criticises the ineffectual "tick-box inspections" of town hall electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs.
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.
And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.
'I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe besides the facial hair,' Brady told Huffington Post.
'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.
Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor
Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.
Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
Floating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason behind the pair's similar looks
One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that 'the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.'
Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' could be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'.
Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.
Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'
Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.'
Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's broadcast apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.'
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf
CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.
We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.
That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'
'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'
Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.
To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'
She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'
Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.
'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'
'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.
'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: 'I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.'
'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.'
All the product in question has been removed from sale.
How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga
It's a dangerous world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.
Whether you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger.
If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'.
You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.
Sounds tricky?
Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.
Family of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction
A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.
She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.
There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.
This family are notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.
Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished
Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past
Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.
The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.
One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'
We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.
The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.
The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property
Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.
She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
'This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said.
Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Willingness to spend might boost the economy.

Mayor of Cannes prohibits burkini swimsuits on beaches.
The Mayor of Cannes, the southern France sea resort, has prohibited wearing burkini swimsuits, which almost completely cover the woman's body and resemble a wetsuit, on the beaches of the city, local officials announced on Thursday.
David Linard, the Mayor of Cannes, has signed an order that "persons, who have no swimsuit honoring good customs and secularism, are prohibited to access beaches and swimming areas" as the basic principle of the Republic of France.
"The swimsuit, which displays religious affiliation in times when France and religious venues are the target of terrorist attacks may put public order at risk (stampedes, clashes etc.), and it is necessary to prevent that," the ordinance says.
"We are not speaking of prohibition of wearing religious symbols on the beach, but of pretentious clothing which is associated with devotion to terrorist movements waging a war against us," the manager of the local government's utility services, Thierry Miguel, explained.
He added that burkini swimsuits on the beaches of Cannes haven't been seen since July 28 when Linard, a member of the center-right party the Republicans, signed this ordinance and it came into force.
This week, a water amusement park in Marseille cancelled a scheduled private event for Muslim women who would be wearing burkini suits, because politicians from both right wing and left wing political parties were outraged at such possibility.
In France it is prohibited to wear Muslim women's head-gear covering the person's face, yet religious symbols or clothing items are not prohibited.
85 people were killed in Nice, a resort close to Cannes, on July 14 in a terrorist attack, the responsibility for which was undertaken by the group Islamic State.
Two attackers who had sworn loyalty to the Islamic State brutally killed a priest in a church in the north-west of France on July 26.

Kubana festival opens in Lucavsala.
In Thursday evening, August 11, one of the last summer festivals, Kubana, was launched and it continues until Sunday night.
The first evening visitors were pampered with such bands as "Enter Shikari" from Great Britain, which was expected to come last year but it quietly disappeared from the program, American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from "The Prodigy" and others.
Also the next festival days can boast with noteworthy names - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", drummer Marky Ramone from punk rock legend "Ramones" with his band "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with Belorussian punk rock leader Sergey Mikhalok, the popular Georgian actor and singer Vakhtang Kikabidze, Ukraine's "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and many more; look here for the complete event program.
The Kubana festival is taking place in Latvia for the second year.
Last year it suffered financial failure and huge losses, but it did not keep the organizers away from another try: they added a phonetic length mark in the festival's name, also included a Latvian band in the program ("All Day Long" will appear on stage in the evening at 19:15) and announced that from now on the festival has become "[...] closer and obtained a local feel alongside such symbols of Riga as its skyline and cats."
It is too early to judge whether their efforts justify themselves, because the festival has just started, but during the first evening "Delfi entertainment" observed that so far the festival hasn't managed to attract large crowds and the number of visitors was similar to that of the last year.

The President who avoided the spotlight: 145th anniversary of Gustavs Zemgals
On Friday, August 12, we commemorate 145 years since the birth of Gustavs Zemgals, the second President of Latvia.
Zemgals was among those who declared the statehood of Latvia but later remained undeservedly overshadowed by the oft-mentioned first President of Latvia, Janis Cakste, as well as the last pre-war period President, Karlis Ulmanis.
No other politician has defended democracy and the rule of law as did Zemgals, Arnolds Auzins writes in his book about Gustavs Zemgals that was published a decade ago.
In conversation with "Delfi", Auzins notes that Zemgals was one of the few high-ranking politicians endowed with a good sense of humor.
By comparison, others appear quite stiff and concerned about "correctness".
Zemgals knew how to be different and nowadays we might draw a parallel to Raimonds Vejonis.
"He was a person who didn't lose touch with the nation," Auzins says.
Today's politicians' knowledge of history is lacking: they refer to Karlis Ulmanis as the good leader, but very few seem to know about his hot-headed personality.
The only person at whom Ulmanis did not yell during government meetings was General Janis Balodis.
Even if Ulmanis is all smiles and kindness in photos, he in fact displayed some "hysterical" traits.
"Zemgals, with his sense of humor and democratic personality leaves the exactly opposite impression," explains Auzins.
Professor Aivars Stranga from the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia, in a conversation with "Delfi", agrees with Auzins' evaluation of Zemgals as a calm and level-headed statesman.
Stranga also notes that Zemgals has stood out from the crowd with a respectful attitude towards minorities and quite frequently invited members of the Jewish community to visit the Presidential Palace.
"This had not been a common practice, and after Zemgals' presidency, this tradition was continued by Alberts Kviesis," the historian tells.
[Zemgals] was a quiet and even-tempered as a person, so it took quite a long time to convince him to become the president.
It wasn't really his aspiration, nor did he crave fame.
He was also a rather harsh critic of himself because he did not speak French, what he believed was a must for the country's president.
"He did however learn basic French during his presidency," Stranga adds.
Zemgals could not be convinced to run for another term, and he didn't saw high-ranking positions as a suitable pursuit.
But by all means, he remains a very respected personality in the history of Latvia and had held an esteemed job even before becoming president, namely as a highly-demanded notary public.
Zemgals also headed the famous Zemgals cash-office at number 3 Suvorova Street, where a savings brokers and credit-savings association was located; it was there the Republic of Latvia was actually created in discussions among the founding fathers.
His views were unremittingly progressive.
Not a huge admirer of Ulmanis, he however did not argue against him publicly.
"Nevertheless, he occasionally revealed in private conversations his discontent with Ulmanis' course of actions," Stranga points out.
He led a peaceful life, and there are no suspicions whatsoever about involvement in illegal issues or corruption.
How is Zemgals remembered today?
Unfortunately, many people only know the Riga street named after Zemgals.
He was committed to democratic views and held a generally centrist beliefs.
"There were no large turmoils during his time in office, namely, he could be associated with a truly stable presidency," Stranga sums up.
During Gustavs Zemgals' presidency, from 1927 to 1930, a state visit to Sweden took place, which for Latvia additionally reconfirmed the recognition of its sovereignty by the neighboring country as well as having been accepted into the community of the Northern European democratic nations.
Zemgals' state visit to Stockholm started on May 28, 1929.
The return visit of Gustaf V, the King of Sweden, took place on June 29, 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871 and passed away in January 1939.
Simple ways that help dealing with kids' tantrums.
I often face situations where parents view their child's tantrums as something wrong and abnormal.
When a child openly expresses anger, we don't know how to react, psychologist Jekaterina Kesa told Econet.
The specialist also recommends a discussion on these natural human feelings, anger and rage, which are occasionally experienced by every one of us.
However, aggression is a physical act against another person and it usually happens in anger.
When we adults feel angry or worried, we usually know what's happening to us and how to handle it.
We can do the following with our anger or rage: express, suppress, hide, keep inside, tell our friends or loved ones about it, we can kick the sofa in anger, smoke a cigarette (not the best way to dispel anger!), take a shower, bang our fist on the table or do other things we don't normally do.
We know how to not direct our aggression towards others, because we have other ways of dealing with these emotions.
When children become angry, they do not understand what is happening to them, how to name it and how to handle it over a period of time.
They might say: "Go away!", "You're stupid", "Bad mommy", "I hate you", "I'm your friend any more" - and only rarely are they capable of saying "I am angry at you".
Children's perceptions are quite direct and literal: they are completely here and now, they are spontaneous and authentic in expressing their feelings and often they are held captive by their various emotions.
It is very important for parents not to prohibit a child to express his or her emotions, including anger, not to blame and shame them; instead, they need to help the child.
Do relationships need a pause?
A long working day in which not everything has gone smoothly, or you just simply are having a bad mood: there are plenty of reasons why you'd want to "disconnect" from the entire world for a moment, a day or even longer.
Can one also take a break in relationships and have a good rest?
Or perhaps it means that teammates have to go separate ways?
Men of various ages shared their opinions on that.
Janis (23) makes his point succinctly: "I believe that if a break is needed in a relationship you're just not with the right person."
Meanwhile, Eduards (30) has discovered a method which could possibly help some of you.
If you feel that a partner is getting on your nerves due to every minute issue, it is definitely the right time to start looking around in order to understand, whether you miss him or her or, perhaps, you don't think much about of them or even do not want to see them ever again.
So, the answer is : yes, a pause can help to save time and understand how important the other person is to you.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, there must be breaks in relationships opposing the routine, because if you're with someone 24/7, some arguments are inevitable.
They are triggered by the fact that you see every tiny detail of the partner's activities and it starts getting on your nerves.
People grow tired of each other, especially if they don't have anything else to talk about apart from what you've done during the day.
I am judging from my personal experience and it is the reason none of my relationships lasted for more than a few months.
If at some moment you think that it could be better somewhere else or with someone else, why would this woman, with whom you are together, deserve a person like you, who is able to think that it is not good enough here and somewhere there, behind the mountains, the grass is certainly greener?
Such thinking is almost a petty form of cheating.
If it does not work, it is not worth trying.
"I practice it, therefore I somewhat condemn those who do not," says Edmunds (46).
Karlis (33) has a completely opposite view.
I think that everybody needs a break.
You cannot just sit and look into your partner's eyes every day, from morning till evening and rejoice at never-ending love.
Wake up!
There are so many things around us: friends, work, partying.
Everything has its proper time.
Of course, also for your girlfriend or wife, but if both partners are able to keep that balance between family life and the rest of the world, then one can have the "happily ever after".
This is the only way.
Martins (27) says: "It is hard to say whether one needs or does not need a break, but one thing is clear: for the person who requests the "break" something is certainly missing in the relationship."
If this idea arises, one must look for changes in the nearest future, be they to good or bad, and it depends on the persons involved.
I think that breaks are useful when you're young and crazy, be it all the time if needed, but later when it gets serious and relationships enter another phase, you cannot have any "restful pauses".
You are making a decision to spend the rest of your lives together!
"If you cannot stand each other's company and need a break every now and then, what will happen when you retire as seniors spending their time commenting on cats' behavior or what's the best day to weed the garden," Kristaps (19) explains.

Due to his delightful and enthusiastic personality, Janis Rozentals was the first to stir up interest in fine arts among Latvians.
"In this sense he was the first love of the Latvian nation and will remain unforgettable forever," Romans Suta once wrote about the old master of Latvian painting Janis Rozentals.
Also in 2016, when opening the vast retrospective in the reconstructed main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it became clear that Rozentals was the first love of the Latvian art.
The exhibition opened on August 12 and since August 13 it is available for visitors and will run until October 30.
The Latvian National Museum of Art with a wide retrospection in the recently opened Great Exhibition Hall honors the painter Janis Rozentals (1866 - 1916) whose 115th birthday is mentioned internationally in UNESCO's Calendar of Events.
The retrospective, with more than 150 works of art, is one of the central events of the program for Janis Rozentals' anniversary year.
A selection of art works is mainly created from the museum collection which convincingly represents the main periods, genres, stylistic variability and diversity of the techniques of the classic's creative life.
The show is supplemented with exhibits from Akseli Gallen-Kallela Museum, the Museum of Literature and Music, the Liepaja Museum, the Tukums Museum and several private collections based in Latvia and Finland.
The mood of the turn of the century is revived with the presence of photos; the mobile app of the exhibition reveals a correlation between several art works and photos, which were taken by the painter for the needs of his creative work with his own camera.
The Rozentals Society "Rozentals-seura" promoting friendly relationships between Finland and Latvia and named after the Latvian classic, in its turn offers the first stop of a small informative traveling exhibition "With a view to Finland, with a heart in Latvia" at the Latvian National Museum of Art.
A similar exposition with explanations in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened at the Virka gallery in Helsinki in the fall.
Matt LeBlanc impatiently looks forward to return to the TopGear show.
TV show TopGear host Matt LeBlanc has told that he can't wait for his return in the second season of the motor vehicles show, however, also admitted that he does not know what his future would be.
Officially, so far nothing has changed.
"If there is something, BBC will announce it," LeBlanc revealed in a conversation with TV critics.
Doubts about TopGear future arouse in July when another presenter, Chris Evans, announced that he was leaving the show.
After leaving Evans admitted that LeBlanc and TopGear are "made for each other".
Evans characterizes the former star of the TV series Friends as "real and decent man" hence dispelling the rumors that their friendship had ended during the shooting of the series.
When LeBlanc was asked about what his favorite things in the show were he mentioned traveling to other countries, for instance, South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
BBC TV informed that they do not plan to replace Evans in the new, 24th season of the show.
Kalvins: Meldonium could be excluded from the Prohibited Substances List for athletes.
It is expected that Meldonium contained in Mildronats, a medical drug manufactured in Latvia, could be removed from the Prohibited Substances List for athletes within this year, Ivars Kalvins, the Director of Latvian Organic Synthesis Institute, revealed on LNT's morning news show 900 sekundes on Friday.
He said that he is going to Canada in September to discuss the Meldonium issue with the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) officials.
The scientist expressed his hope that Mildronats would be removed from the blacklist already this year.

71 traffic accidents in which 16 persons were injured have happened in Latvia during the last 24 hours.
Rain and colder weather expected in some locations.
On Friday, in Latvia one can expect intermittent rain and a temperature drop by approximately one degree Celsius, LETA learned from the Environment, Geology and Meteorology Center of Latvia.
There might be thunder at some locations.
According to forecasts, it is going to rain mainly in Kurzeme and northern Vidzeme.

During the day, there will be no precipitation and mostly sunny in Riga.
The air temperature will not rise above 18 degrees Celsius.
His portrayal of the shadier aspects of the modeling business in the United States combines the perversely subtle glamour of a photo shoot with the unease of a horror movie.
The picture is, in a manner of speaking, highly provocative and somehow balances on the edge between sophistication and tasteless vulgarity, so it becomes hard to draw a line between the European art house cinema and the traditional Hollywood genre.
The movie, starring Viggo Mortensen, poses the question whether parents' conceptually chosen lifestyles (they're eco-oriented, vegetarians, alternative thinkers and turn away from the consumer society's shallow propensities) are in fact a blessing or a destructive influence on their children.
A father of six children is facing the issues of rightness of these choices and a search for true values after the death of his wife.
It is a moving and emotionally wise movie whose director Matt Ross won the prize for best director at this year's Cannes film festival.
Of course, sharks are attacking beautiful girls all the time: it was a swimmer in Jaws, but in this case we meet a courageous surfer played by Blake Lively.
Filming required a lot of courage from her.
This solo feat of survival can be compared to the masterful acting of James Franco in 127 Hours and that of Ryan Reynolds in the Buried Alive movie.
Perhaps one can blame the main character played by Mila Kunis, whose transformation from a model mom into a creative party animal and almost a mocker of family values seemed like a poor fantasy created by rather desperate Hollywood script writers.
Islamic State has abducted 2,000 civilians in Syria.
The combatants for the Islamic State fleeing from Manbij, Aleppo Governorate in Syria, have captured about 2,000 civilians who are being used as human shields, the US-supported Kurdish and Arab alliance and observers reported on Friday.
"We did not shoot at them, because they took civilians with them when fleeing to Jarabulus," press officer of the Kurdish Manbij Military Council announced.
After two months of clashes, the Democratic Forces of Syria (QSD) led by Kurds, which is a US-supported Kurdish/Arabic alliance in the north of Syria, announced on Friday that Manbij has been freed from jihadists.
The Islamic State occupied Manbij in 2014.
QSD drove away the majority of Islamic State fighters from Manbij last week, but some of them remained and resisted.
Eventually, they left the city on Friday together with their hostages.
Islamic jihadists are heading for Jarabulus, which is located near the border with Turkey.
The London-based Syrian activists' organization Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that the Islamic State has abducted approximately 2,000 people.
The SOHR informed that jihadists stole cars of the city's residents, forced them to get into the cars and then took them to Jarabulus.
It is not the first time Islamic jihadists carry out a large-scale abduction.
In January, when taking control of territories in the Deir ez-Zor Governorate in eastern Syria, jihadists abducted more than 400 civilians, women and children included.
Later they released approximately 270 of the hostages.
There is no information about the number of IS members who fled Manbij.
The press officer of the Kurdish Manbij Military Council told that the QSD has managed to rescue 2,500 people that were held prisoners by islamists in Manbij.
Information gathered by SOHR shows that at least 437 civilians, 105 children among them, have lost their lives during the Manbij offensive.
299 QSD soldiers and 1019 jihadists were killed.
Kolegova declines running for the position of SRS head.
The State Environment Service head Inga Kolegova decided to withdraw her candidacy for the position of Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), LETA was informed by the Ministry of Finance.
Kolegova indicated that a discussions around her candidacy has intensified controversies among the parties of the ruling coalition.
It seems that the true causes of discussions are related to explicit, but more often, implicit interests of politicians and they have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional skills.
"It is not acceptable for me," the former candidate for head of SRS emphasizes.
If her candidacy was approved by the government, it is clear that the voting results would not be convincing and it would not allow her working competently and implementing the necessary changes in the SRS, feeling the support of the entire government.
Proper work is not possible without that, Kolegova concludes.
"I have repeated openly for several times that I do not want to be politically dependent, but currently the process of candidate selection is overpoliticized," the official explains.
"Thank you for the demonstrated trust and support; it is an experience I value," Kolegova wrote in her application to Reizniece-Ozola.
The Unity political party announced on Wednesday that during the meeting with Kolegova "essential controversies" were revealed between the candidate's explanations and records in public registers regarding the payment of dividends of SIA Pallogs, because the available minutes of Pallogs shareholders meetings show a decision to not distribute profit.
Currently the responsibilities of the SRS head are carried out by its Deputy Director General, Dace Peleka.
The police in Livani engages in saving two unattended children, the Latgale Region Division of the State Police reports.
Information about unattended strollers with infants inside was received on Friday around7 AM.
The event took place in Livani near the building of a former store.
Both infant girls were immediately delivered to physicians to provide medical aid.
A bag with documents and mobile phone was also left in the strollers.
In less than half an hour the police officers identified the possible location of the children's parents.
When arriving at the house of the woman's partner, the police officers found out that the woman is sleeping, because she is under strong influence of alcohol.
According to the initial information, the woman, born in 1992, had visited her friend the previous day where she drank alcohol.
Heading home after the party, the woman had decided, due to unclear reasons, to leave the children outside the store.
The police immediately reported this event to the orphan's court which is going to decide the fate of the children.
Riga Free Port has implemented all recommendations suggested by State Control regarding Krievu Island project.
The Riga Free Port administration has implemented all five recommendations by the State Control (SC) concerning the transfer of port activities away from the city center within the project "Infrastructure development of the Krievu Island Port", the company informed portal Diena.lv.
The project approval is expected at the nearest Riga Free Port's board meeting.
For the recommendations to be implemented in compliance with the SC wishes, the Riga Free Port administration, when preparing the necessary documentation, followed also the conclusions and provided recommendations for project supervision improvements in the further stages of the project, contained in the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditors Deloitte at the Riga Free Port administration.
Information about the implementation of recommendations today was sent also to the SC.
Regardless of the fact that the Riga Free Port administration does not agree with the SC's prepared opinion concerning the usefulness of implementation of the Krievu Island project, we have a very responsible approach toward the project implementation and our funding provider, the European Commission (EC).
I want to emphasize that the construction works that were planned within the framework of the project, have been completely finished at the stipulated deadlines and at the planned level.
"In order to prove to all parties involved in the project implementation, including the EC and SC and also stevedores, that the main goal of the free port is to implement the project successfully, we have completely implemented all SC's recommendations concerning the issues of project management and supervision," the manager of the Krievu Island project, Sanita Kaire, points out.
The current long-term operation plan was supplemented with the most important planned activities of the stakeholders and deadlines for necessary decisions, definitions of meetings and regular reports, supervision tools for the planned construction process and definitions of the most important milestones, in order to control and monitor the progress toward the project's goal.
The approved action plan for achieving the project's goal by December 31, 2018, was supplemented with performance monitoring activities pursuant to the SC's recommendations thus enhancing the Riga Free Port's control over the deadlines for activities of other stakeholders of the project implementation.
In order to improve management and reduce potential risks, a new project management plan was elaborated by defining project management areas and indicating the prepared documents that put in place controls and monitoring mechanisms for each of them.
In order to increase project capacity, a project management chart reflecting the planned project management team's structure, staff qualifications and functions has been elaborated.
In order to improve the Riga Free Port communication with project stakeholders, a communication plan has been elaborated, which in addition to the parties specified in the project's action plan additionally defines the stakeholders, necessary for a successful completion of the project, the principles, types and frequency of information exchange.
Also, in order to improve the control of usage of funding, the necessity for entering into a service contract or starting a procurement, as well as the legal basis for both, will have to be specified in more detail.
Port-related infrastructure, i.e., four new deep water quays, access railroads and utilities, all meeting world-standard requirements , has been built within the framework of the project at the Krievu Island.
Buildings co-financed by the cohesion fund were completed and put into operation at the end of last year thus saving 10.6 million euros from the allocated funding.
Threats force Slovakia to increase airports security.
On Friday, after receiving unspecified threats, Slovakia increased its security measures in several airports, the Ministry of Interior announced.
"Taking into account the threats, we have enhanced security measures at the international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Kosice," press officer of the Slovakian Ministry of the Interior told news agency AFP on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Center is currently analyzing the received information," he added.
An informal European Union (EU) summit will take place in the capital of Slovakia on September 16, in which all the bloc's countries except Great Britain are going to participate.
The consequences of Great Britain's Brexit and EU's future without Great Britain will be the topics of discussion.
Slovakia holds the EU presidency until January.
German researchers discuss the number of "Berlin Wall deaths".
According to a new study, the number of fatalities at the border of former Eastern Germany, greatly subdued by the Communist regime, could be considerably larger than so far believed, but doubts about the actual number of victims have not been cleared yet.
The data publicized by the Berlin Wall museum Checkpoint Charlie on Wednesday show evidence that from 1945 to 1989 the Communist authorities killed 1841 persons trying to escape the territory under their control across its border with the Western allies-controlled territory and later West Germany.
The museum has spent years researching the deaths related to the border, and it occasionally updates the number of victims.
Another 11 fatalities were added to the list this year, including a six year old boy who drowned when his family tried to get to Western Germany through former Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Soviet Army deserters are also included in a new group of Berlin Wall victims.
"The scale of total damage, caused by the double evil of Communism and Socialism has not been fully documented," director of the museum, Alexandra Hildebrandt, admits.
"Our task is to make sure that the graves of those who died trying to escape the Communist-controlled country would be maintained and not lost", emphasizes Hildebrandt in her public report.
But other researchers have already contested the new numbers.
"The number of 1841 is unconvincing," the East Germany history expert Johann Stadt from the Free University of Berlin stated in an interview to Süddeutsche Zeitung.
Together with other researchers of the Free University of Berlin, he currently reviews other alleged suspicious fatalities near the border and so far they have managed confirm only 260 cases.
Previously researchers assumed that the Communists had killed 138 persons at the Berlin Wall.
Stadt believes that if one counts those who have died when trying to escape by the Baltic Sea or by traveling to the West trough a neighboring country's territory the number of victims could reach approximately one thousand.
At any rate, it is considerably less than the 1841.
Different methodologies could be one reason for the different numbers of victims.
The Checkpoint Charlie museum also counts in all suicides of East German border guards, whether or not related to their service.
The museum also counts the fatalities not related to direct use of force.
"If seniors aged 70 to 80 died from a heart attack after a stressful contact with the border control," it also must be considered a consequence of the "murderous border", Hildebrandt believes.
But Stadt is sure that one must differentiate between the old people who, possibly, died due to the attitude and conduct towards them and those who died due to protracted waiting inside a bus at the border in time of hot weather.
Notwithstanding that, it is not easy to count the victims, because the authorities of the communist East Germany did not gather such statistics , so researchers must examine documents in various scattered archives, Stadt points out.
Yet, Stadt's group recently has found more documents, therefore he might soon announce his new calculation of victims.
LSF president Pone went to Rio with a coach's accreditation; he is surprised at that himself.
The Latvian Swimming Federation's (LSF) president Kaspars Pone, who has recently become ill-famed, has arrived at Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games with a coach's accreditation; nevertheless, he is surprised at that.
On Wednesday, a wide a hullabaloo was raised after the statements of Germans Jakubovskis, the coach of olympic swimmer Alona Ribakova, revealing that in the last minute Pone decided to go to Rio de Janeiro while the coach had to stay home.
Alona Ribakova and Ulvis Kalnins, coaches Jakubovskis and Dave Collins as well as the federation's president Pone were in the initial list.
The Latvian Swimming Federation applied with five participants for the Olympic Games and just before the flight Aldons Vrublevskis assured that Mr Germans will go and tickets are being booked.
"But obviously due to objective reasons he did not manage to go," Pone said by expressing an opinion that it did not affect Ribakova's result.
At the request of the federation the coach of Uvis had agreed to help her.
Pone, who is a member of the LOC executive committee, harshly criticized LOC's activities when they blamed the organization supervising the Olympic sports.
I believe that it is unethical to confirm five persons with the LOC executive committee and then not to take them all to the Olympics.
"I don't know why there were no vacant places for the Swimming Federation," Pone said, adding that the society does not value the work of the Federation and their presidents and reminded that the federations' presidents do not receive a salary.
Pone also criticized Jakubovskis, stating that before the Olympic Games in London when Ribakova was not among the approved participants, he addressed the International Water Sports Federation (IWSF) and called Latvia not to send any athletes.
Pone could not comment why he arrived to the Olympic Games with a coach's accreditation, which, most probably, was meant for Jakubovskis.
"I was declared as the team leader, but due to reasons unknown to me I received a coach's accreditation and now I cannot get in anywhere.''
The situation changed every day, and the number of available accreditations also changed.
Until the last minute I thought that Mr German will come, because I had no other information.
According to the information possessed by LETA, several days before Ribakova's start she spoke tête-à-tête with Pone and afterwards the swimmer had tears in her eyes, yet the president of LSF himself told that it was a routine conversation aimed at putting the sportswoman in the right mood before the start.
Pone reminded that the LSF supervises five sports disciplines, which are included in the Olympic program too, and in four of them also children are being trained in Latvia.
The federation's president revealed that issues of drowning are essential for Latvia and he has spoken also about relevant programs while in Rio de Janeiro, for almost two weeks now.
He praised the work of the federation and noted that the World Championship tournament could take place in Latvia in 2018.
I have not come to Rio de Janeiro for a vacation but to do work here and spend my time trying to implement quadrennial programs.
600,000 salmon smolts to be released in the Daugava.
Within the framework of AS Latvenergo's fish stock recovery program, salmon and sea trout smolts will be released in the Daugava near Mangalsala this week. This year it is planned to release more than 600,000 one year old salmon and sea trout smolts grown in the "Tome" and "Dole" fisheries of the scientific institute Bior.
Latvenergo informed news agency LETA that the fish release is going to continue also in the upcoming months: a total of 6,300,000 smolts and larvae of various species are released in the Daugava basin system annually.
In spring 2016 and beginning of summer, pike and lamprey larvae will be released, as well as whitefish in June, summer salmon in July, and pike perches and vimbas in August and September.
The production director of Latvenergo, Maris Kunickis said that care about the environment is one of sustainable development milestones of the holding company Latvenergo.
"When implementing measures of fish stock protection and replenishing, every activity is aimed at environmentally friendly goals, in a close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior for growing fish and releasing them in the Daugava basin as well as implementing other activities," Kunickis pointed out.
More than 600,000 one year old salmon and sea trout smolts will be released in the Daugava estuary this year.
This is the second year when smolts to be released are marked by cutting off the adipose fin.
In today's cargo there are 25,000 salmon smolts with 31.3 grams average weight.
Fish smolts and larvae in scientifically substantiated composition of species are released in the Daugava and its tributaries each year.
Fish stock propagation in Daugava and other watercourses of its basin pursuant to the laws and regulations is carried out by Bior on the basis of expertise of damage caused to fish stock resulting from Latvenergo's industrial activity and an opinion is formulated on what compensation measures are to be taken to ensure fish stock diversity.
The State Environment Bureau, on the basis of said expertise, adopts a decision on the amount and type of compensation.
The total annual compensation from Latvenergo for the fish stock recovery program amounts to 1,035,000 euros.
In spring 2016, Latvenergo cooperated with the association "Mes zivim" (We for fish) to create 400 artificial fish spawning areas in the Daugava near Kaibala and Ikskile, for the fifth year already.
The cooperation with the association, promoting natural spawning of fish, is an initiative additionally supported by Latvenergo within the framework of fish stock recovery.
The placement of artificial spawning nests in a water-reservoir is an important measure for enhancing fish stock protection and growth in the Daugava.
"Sansusi Concert Hall" festival offers country house, forest and tree-felling experience.
You sleep in a tent, eat like in restaurant, walk in sneakers and listen to fine chamber music and at the same time enjoy the quiet and peaceful nature: this is a combination offered by the alternative chamber music festival "Sansusi", inviting visitors to the Akniste region for the third summer already.
The festival will take place in the back yard of the town council of Suseja, a village that does not exist anymore, and in the surrounding woods and tree-felling areas.
Three days, from August 12 to 14, five stages intertwine careless and exquisite enjoyment of nature and erudite music.
Here, music meets theater, contemporary circus, performance art and installations.
Opera and erudite music, especially in their newest manifestations, find new listeners in free and open environment without the typical concert hall stiffness.
The distance from here to Riga is approximately 150 km, but it's only a few minutes until there's a smile on your face and lightness in feet.
"Please, do not look for a program guide, because we have intentionally chosen not to publish it so that people do not come to see a certain event or artist, as the real taste of Sansusi can be captured only if all three days are spent here," says Armands Silins, the initiator and host of the festival, an operatic baritone.
We open the festival's gates on Friday at 5 PM, and the first concert starts at 7 PM.
Once you've arrived, you can get the program guides with all the necessary information.
For those who can come for only one day we recommend Saturday, because it is the most saturated: from 9 AM until the dawn of the next day.
"Names of the artists are available at our website www.sansusi.lv," Armands Silins tells.
The splendid roster of performers boasts such names as violin player Eva Bindere, cello player Kristine Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinet player Guntis Kuzma, trumpet player Janis Porietis, piano player Reinis Zarins, quartets Quadra and RIX and even the Estonian air acrobat Grete Gross, who has created a contemporary circus piece called Confines portraying an artist's inner struggle and performed together with musicians Eriks Kirsfelds, Martins Zilberts and actress Ance Strazda.
Several other new pieces have also been created.
Children's performance "Bug", based of Kafka's story "The Metamorphosis" has been composed by Olesja Kozlovska and Jekabs Nimanis and will be staged with the participation of Armands Silins, musicians, actors and entomologist Ugis Piterans.
Oskars Herlins has composed his first String quartet, while Anna Kirse offers her Tree Opera, a performance with trees as its main characters arranged in three small clusters in three hectares of clear felling; it is directed by Andris Kalnozols, supplemented with Katrina Neiburga's video projections and Andris Eglitis' stage design.
Voices of Laima Ledina, Dinara Rudane and Zigmars Grasis will portray their romantic relationships just like in research "The Marriage of Trees" (1729) by the Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus back in the Enlightenment age.
One of the Latvian team's most visible members, heptathlonist Laura Ikauniece-Admidina, starts her participation at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics today.

The heptathlon events finish on Saturday with long jump, javelin and 800 meters as the last disciplines.
Ikauniece-Admidina, who won bronze in last year's world championship, was mentioned as a candidate for winning an Olympic medal before the games began.
The Latvian achieved a new national record in May (6622 points) and won the second place in the prestigious heptathlon event in Gotzis, Austria.
Ikauniece-Admidina participated at the London Olympic Games in 2012, attaining the 9th place with a repeated Latvian national record.
During the last 18 months the athlete has broken the national record four times.
Today at4 PM, the Latvian judo fighter Arturs Nikiforenko will participate in a contest in the weight division over 100 kg, meeting the Azerbaijani athlete Usangi Kukauri in the first round.
It will be the first Olympic Games in our judo fighter's career.
NThe news agency LETA previously reported that the Latvian judo fighter Jevgenijs Borodavko lost his first fight in the division over 100 kg on Thursday.
He was overcome by the Japanese judoka Ryunosuke Haga, who eventually won bronze.
Back in the year 2000, Vsevolods Zelonijs brought Olympic bronze to Latvia, but during the consequent four Olympic Games Latvian judo fighters have won only one in seven fights, accomplished by Borodavko in London.
At4:30 PM Latvian, time Dainis Upelnieks will start clay target shooting qualification round, a selection that concludes on Saturday.
Upelnieks was officially confirmed to participate in the Olympics only on the day when the composition of the Latvian team was unveiled, yet he later told LETA he had been rather sure of going to the Olympics already since April.
He was among the first Latvian athletes to arrive at the Olympic Games location and tried to make the most of the training opportunities in the venue's shooting-ground.
At7:05 PM Latvian time, three concluding races will be performed by an Olympic Games debutante, the 17 year old Latvian Ketija Birzule, who competes in windsurfing in the RS:X class.
After three days of sailing, i.e., in nine races and their total score considered, Birzule has taken the 25th place among the 26 participants.
The decisive final race for medals is taking place on Saturday.
The rowing is finally expected to take place today, in which Latvian Sanita Puspure will represent Ireland.
On Wednesday, this race was postponed due to unfavorable weather.
Puspure will compete in theC/D women's single sculls semifinal for the 13th place at the Olympics at 7:10 PM.
At Tuesday's quarter-final, she won the fourth place stepping down from the third position she held, which would have allowed her to poise for a medal - however, she fell behind by a mere 0.65 seconds.
Puspure won the 13th place four years ago at the London Olympics, where she also represented Ireland.
24 sets of medals will be granted in today's Olympic events: archery, track and field, track cycling, equestrian, fencing, diving, judo, rowing, shooting, swimming, tennis and weightlifting.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is unfit for office.
Treats says nude calendar for 'women, as well as men'
Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s' Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they're setting out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We need to get back to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit pics online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.

French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp.
They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.
A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."
The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.
Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.
But, regardless, Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team.
It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
It has been some journey for GB.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost just one.
This hammering will hurt but the progress is startling.
Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun.
It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.
With four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing, which was converted.
12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.
A superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji.
On seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17-0 to the bad.
Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.
The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.
It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade.
Which is pretty much how it is.
GB made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the Fijian dam...for all of four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay.
Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.
Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn't need icing with another try in the dying moments.
The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference.
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle
There will not be a more emotive gold at these games, and that is saying something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Though they were the two pulling on the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height.
Their dominance was absolute, after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans, does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, it was touch and go.
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.
If they don't it goes everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It alters your outlook a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season, keeping the disruption to a minimum, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough.
That's how it starts off.
Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.
In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for Williams, who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."
It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well.
It's been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.
Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much in the moment.
Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything amazing.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did.
The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.
For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," she said.

Kolegova's promotion for the position of SRS head "will persist by all means".
According to his words, now it is "important in principle" for the Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Union of Greens and Farmers) and the Minister for Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Union of Greens and Farmers), that Kolegova's candidacy for the position of the head of the SRS, supported by the Minister for Finance, is approved.
Rajevskis assumed that approval of the SRS head is the "first big decision" in the government for both Kucinskis and Reizniece-Ozola and it might affect their political careers in the future.
If they start changing their positions regarding the choice of the candidate for SRS head, it could adversely affect their image concerning governance issues.
Next week's agenda of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the question of transferring Kolegova, the current head of SES, to the position of Director General of the SRS, the government's agenda reveals.
Kolegova was promoted for the position of the SRS head by the Minister for Finance, Reizniece-Ozola, after Inara Petersone stepped down from this position and the competition for the position of Director General of the SRS ended without results.
On Thursday, August 11, Deputy head oft the SRS, Dace Peleka, told in an interview with the Latvian Radio, that if she was offered to run for the executive position she might agree.
The Minister of Finance later admitted that currently she is not considering any other candidates for the position of the SRS head.
Also the head of Saeima faction of the National Alliance, Raivis Dzintars, acknowledged that the NA still supports Kolegova as the prospective head of the SRS.
Spain's opportunity to reduce budget deficit compromised by failure to set up new government.
A month ago, on July 12, the European Commission (EC) published an assessment that Spain and Portugal have not managed to implement a sufficient amount of measures to reduce their budget deficit to 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) as per the eurozone rules.
According to some calculations, despite the implemented austerity measures Portugal's budget deficit stood at 4.4% of GDP and at 5.1% in Spain at the end of last year.
The European Commission nevertheless decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries and instead only defined fiscal goals for the nearest period.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions on the two countries is the growing euroscepticism in many EU countries.
Additional sanctions would only add to such negative moods.
Nevertheless, the critics have pointed out that the EC has been inconsistent in its decisions, because it had agreed on uniform rules and then turned out unable to apply them.
For instance, Jens Weidmann, president of the German Bundesbank, has indicated that Europe starts losing its self-reliance by creating a public impression that European Union rules are merely recommendations.
Now the EC has proposed, and all member states have approved, an extension of the term given for tidying up the budget issues by the end of the year for Portugal and by 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission promises to check on the progress in both countries, while at the same time indicating that Spain and Portugal must be ready to for additional austerity measures, should the situation call for it.
Preliminary forecasts say that Portugal could manage achieving the stated goal within the given time-frame and its budget deficit might decrease to 2.5% of GDP already this year.
It means that the country's government must go on with austerity measures related to the Stability Program in the amount of 0.25% of GDP.
These measures should be included in this year's budget and additional attention must be paid to the oversight of procurement of goods and services.
In Spain's case, the situation is more complicated.
Its budget deficit must be reduced down to 4.6% this year, to 3.1% next year and to 2.2% of GDP in 2018.
Additionally, during the next two years consolidation measures must be equal to 0.5% of GDP.
The goal is especially difficult to achieve due to the fact that Spanish political parties have failed to agree on forming a new government for eight consecutive months, and the likelihood that Spain might be forced to organize early Parliament election for the third time in one year has increased.
Public opinion surveys show that a third election would not essentially change the national political pattern.
The People's Party, headed by the present Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, is still the most popular one and it would again win up to 33% of votes in an election.
Socialists are the only ones to have slightly increased their ratings while the popularity of parties speaking up against the austerity measures, such as Podemos ("Together we can") and Ciudadanos ("Citizens"), have decreased a little.
The People's Party wants to involve socialists and Ciudadanos in the government already this month, otherwise it will not be able to approve and to submit to the European Commission the draft budget of 2017 by mid October.
The faction representative of the People's Party, Rafael Hernando, announced that Spain would become a laughingstock for the entire Europe if the country fails to set up the government and instead the third election takes place.
Cleanness of beaches around the Gulf of Riga is in critical condition.
After five years of inspecting beaches, activists have concluded that, unfortunately, the amount of rubbish gradually increases year by year and beach visitors themselves are to blame in the first place.
The most polluted swimming areas are located in Riga.
The Riga City Council explains that the beaches are being cleaned on a daily basis but it is rather difficult to reign in littering visitors.
Besides, garbage left on the ground can be washed into the water during heavy rain thus largely damaging its quality.
Except Liepaja's beach and several places in Kurzeme, cleanness of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is in a similar critical condition.
This conclusion was spread by the volunteers of a campaign called "My Sea".
The activists, after walking along the Riga Gulf for the fifth year already, have realized that the amount of garbage discarded by visitors per hundred meters has increased.
Unfortunately, this year the condition is evaluated as critical.
"We see that this is going to be a year when the amount of garbage might exceed 200 units per 100 meters," says a representative of the expedition "My Sea", Janis Ulme.
When the Latvian Radio called him, he was on the Tuja beach where the volunteers continue walking along the Riga Gulf coastline.
This year, even fluorescent light-bulbs were found among the household waste items and picnic remains littering the beach sand.
Ulme, who is a participant and organizer of the walk, tells that many people are to blame for the pollution.
"The main source of pollution is beach visitors, because more than a half of the total garbage amount is plastic items and various other rubbish: plastic bags in degradation stage and they cannot be identified anymore, as well as cigarette butts, bottles, caps, etc.," Ulme explained.
The swimming areas of Riga are also on the list of the dirtiest beaches.
For example, in Daugavgriva we gathered almost 800 units per hundred meters on average and it is way more than acceptable.
The organizers of the campaign explained that almost on every step one can see cigarette butts and that warning or prohibition signs are not placed everywhere.
"The average numbers in all three swimming areas of Riga (Daugavgriva, Vakarbulli and Vecaki) are unfortunately huge and far from the desirable, or the goal to which Latvia ought to strive, in order to reduce the garbage to 135 units by 2020," the environmental activist concludes.
The Riga swimming areas are cleaned on a daily basis and even two times per day in the hottest summer periods, City Council's representative Ugis Vidauskis explained.
It is, however, rather difficult to fight against untidy visitors.
Again, we face an issue of whether these persons are truly cultured.
"Those, who litter, drink alcohol, smoke and do all that's prohibited, will not even care about special signs," Vidauskis emphasizes.
Therefore Vidauskis calls on the visitors of bathing places to even report polluters to the police.
One can call police and confidentially report these violations and that is the way we can collectively fight such problems.
Perhaps one can set up new warning signs, but, as I already told, it is not likely to make radical changes.
"We all must address the authorities and must be intolerant towards such violators," he stresses.
Meanwhile water quality measurements have been performed by the State Health Inspectorate for the fourth time this summer, and the agency is entitled to impose prohibition on official bathing places.
This year, just like the previous years, water quality is good or satisfactory everywhere.
Currently the water quality at all 56 swimming places remains good and there are no swimming restrictions.
"We will take the last samples of water at the end of August," Normunds Kadikis, senior specialist in environmental health issues of the Inspectorate, revealed.
Dropped garbage can be washed into water during heavy rain.
Consequently, it can affect water quality, the environmental expert points out.
Reshuffle among Russian elite continues: Putin's executive office appoints new chief of staff
Did he step down voluntarily?
Vladimir Putin told Russian media that Sergey Ivanov wanted to leave his position but will remain as the President's special representative in nature preservation, environmental and transportation matters.
When informing about the changes, Putin spoke approvingly of Ivanov in front of cameras: "Dear Sergey Borisovich, I have worked together with you for many years and we are doing it successfully."
I am satisfied with the way you carry out your job.
I remember well our agreement to employ you in this position at the Presidential Executive Office for no more than four years.
Therefore I understand your wish to change the things you work on.
And I hope you will make the most of your skills and experience in the new position.
However, it has been pointed out that being in charge of the Presidential Executive Office is a very powerful position and that through it Ivanov has become one of the most influential persons in the entire country.
In the context of the Russian State Duma elections approaching next month, there have been rumors that this change is related to a power struggle among the country's political elite.
Ivanov has even been mentioned as a prospective successor of Putin as the president, which casts doubt on the assertion that Ivanov would willingly become the President's representative in environmental and transport matters.
According to information available to Lsm.lv, Ivanov is a Colonel General of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov is a close and long-term ally of the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career in secret services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov was assigned as his deputy.
At the end of the Russian President Boris Yeltsin's term in office, Ivanov was appointed as the Secretary of Russian Security Council.
In year 2000, when Putin came to power, an "Information Security Doctrine" developed by Ivanov and actually reviving government-run censorship in Russia was made official.
In 2001, Sergey Ivanov became the Minister for Defense of Russia and, in 2005, deputy of Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov, also becoming responsible for the development of Russian defense industry's companies and arms export.
After leaving the current position, Ivanov will retain a job at Russia's National Security Council and work together with Vaino, the new head of the Presidential Executive Office.
Vaino comes from a family of Soviet party elite.
Ivanov himself allegedly encouraged Vaino to pursue the leading position at the Presidential Executive Office.
Anton Eduardovich and I have known each other for a long time.
In fact, it goes back to the times when we worked under your leadership in government.
For the last five years, we keep in touch with each other on an almost daily basis.
"Therefore I am sure that in terms of all professional and individual characteristics he is ready for this job'', Ivanov said.
Vaino comes from a family that was part of the Soviet party elite.
His granddad Karl had high-ranking positions in the Communist Party of the Soviet Estonia, serving as its First Secretary for ten years up until 1988.
The online media outlet Meduza, using a book "Estonian Self-determination and Independence" as it source, has reported that in late 1980s Karl Vaino had asked Moscow to authorize violent oppressive actions against participants of political rallies.
Somehow the authorization wasn't granted and it wasn't long before he lost his position.
Shortly afterwards Vaino moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations and speaks Japanese.
However, he left the diplomatic career to work in the Presidential Protocol Administration.
As reported, during recent weeks Russia has been rocked by dismissal of several high-ranking officials and even arrests, including the replacement of several district governors and federal representatives.
According to political scientists, Vladimir Putin is reorganizing the elite circles before the upcoming elections of 2018.
Of note is that persons from military, security and law enforcement authorities are increasingly appointed to nationally leading positions.
Judo fighter Nikiforenko loses in the first fight of the Olympics.
This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian judo fighter has already concluded his participation in the Olympic Games with the 17th place.
His coach Olegs Baskins admitted to the Latvian Television that Nikiforenko had little hope and it was clear before the contest.
He also revealed that the athlete got a shoulder injury during the fight.
It must be noted that, in order to get his Olympic opportunity, Nikiforenko had to fight in a different weight division than his usual, namely in the weight division of up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani athlete was 25 kg heavier.
As reported, in the weight division up to 100 kilograms, Jevgenijs Borodavko manged to hold out against Ryunosuke for two and a half minutes, until the opponent implemented a clear victory throw.
Therefore the judo contest in Rio is over for Latvia.
Athletes' dreams crushed in Rio sand.
Thursday saw the entrance of judo fighter Jevgenijs Borodavko.
He indeed had a more prize-winning opponent, but the ambitious can sometimes surprise.
He did not, however.
A task for Arturs Nikiforenko was even more complicated, because he had less experience and a very respectable opponent.
The outcome was similar, even though he managed to remain on the mat for one and a half minute longer than Borodavko did.
Unfortunately, the Latvian judo fighters mainly seem to lack ambition.
Since Gunars Kirsons and his financial supporter Vladimirs Sestakovs stepped aside from the management and Aleksandrs Jackevics left Latvia, the Golden Score event is not organized anymore, and thus the development of judo is slowly deteriorating.
No successors are seen for Jackevics, who consults judo fighters from Kazakhstan, and for Vsevolods Zelonijs.
But if one does not help the athletes grow, the outcome will be poor.
And it is the federation's prerogative.
Therefore the Judo Federation's president's promise to win medals in Rio came as if from another galaxy in the Morning Panorama news.
Dreams are far from reality.
In the evening we were impatiently and anxiously looking forward to the beach volleyball match of Samoilovs/Smedins against Evandro/Pedro Solberg.
The intrigue was just like in a "death" group, because the Olympics is over for those who lose.
The Latvian team had a small reserve: they could lose but by not more than 4 points in two sets.
A protracted previous game just added to their stress.
Nobody wanted to "die" - this feeling could be sensed over the windy court for the entire match.
The gusty wind created additional complexity for the players.
In the beginning it seemed that our players, being more versatile, would benefit from it.
But they did not.
Thus it was rather easy to defeat the Latvian pair.
Just serve toward Samoilovs and wait for him to break.
He started to break in the game against Canada but broke against Cuba at the end of the 1st set and the beginning of 3rd set, because it was a huge physical challenge.
Smedins could go fishing meanwhile, because he had little to do, but when he did, he did it very well.
Samoilovs and Smedins could win against the Brazilians in two sets, because they took a lead in the first one with 16-15, but remained at 16 points thus exhausting the limit of lost points.
They could also lose with 0-2, because in the 2nd set they had a deficit of -4, however they managed to win, also thanks to the wind.
The 3rd set went under Evandro's serves.
One could observe a chain pattern: unconvincing return of a serve, the second pass sometimes flies too close to the net and Samoilovs having few options for an efficient attack.
If an unseen Samoilovs was in the court during the game against Cubans, now he returned to playing more efficiently and it would be incorrect to blame only Aleksandrs for the loss.
Also Kreilis made a mistake and it was symbolic that he was the one to send the last ball into the block.
The loss was by the team.
This time luck had also turned away: in the third set alone, two attacks by Evandro almost went outside the court, but the ball did hit the line.
Two aces landed next to the line.
In this contestable situation, a video playback gave the victory to the opponents.
If Evandro was struggling with serves in the first two games, he became very efficient in the game against our players.
Eventually it resulted in a loss, shown on the scoreboard.
The causes of this failure could now be analyzed with some detachment.
Perhaps they should have, as many did, stayed near the stadium and not with the rest of the delegation in the Olympic Village.
Two and a half hours were lost commuting.
Perhaps some confidence was given to them by a series of seven semifinals.
Or perhaps, they should not have played in Klagenfurt and instead arrive here earlier and adapt to the situation.
Perhaps there was a mistake in finding their best athletic shape.
For the time being, there are more questions than answers.
The games are over for our beach volleyball players.
And so is the dream about winning medals.
What's next?
There remain a few World Cup tournaments and also the Jurmala "Masters".
Smedins and Samoilovs have never been friends outside the sport and will probably not become such, because their personalities are just too different.
But it is also not necessary .
When a dream about Olympic medals dies, one could start thinking of splitting up, because the fault will be searched for not only in oneself but also in the teammate.
It is not difficult to split up, but it is much harder to find an appropriate teammate in Latvia.
Both athletes have brothers who play beach volleyball, but Janis and Toms have tried and also split up, while Mihails Samoilovs is still too fresh to start aiming for global top positions.
He could try it with Haralds Regza, Aleksandrs Solovejs, Edgars Tocs, or reunite with Martins Plavins, but that combination will be in no way better than the current one, as seen several times during the World Cup.
The sand of Copacabana was not their friend this time.
And that's about it.
Of course, one must also take into consideration that beach volleyball is gaining popularity and new pairs join and only a few players are below two meters in height.
It does not automatically guarantee success, but is an essential argument when struggling to win.
Our athletes cannot grow taller.
Both athletes and journalists can stay in accommodations offered by the games' organizers or rely on their personal choice.
US men's basketball team lives on a cruise ship, and some tennis players do not stay at the Olympic Village.
Also some beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Copacabana.
This time the modest accommodation offered to journalists was overpriced.
Therefore we chose to rent an apartment.
It is risky, because sometimes it can be inconvenient in terms of logistics.
This time the risk paid off.
Together with Vladimirs we rented an apartment on the border of Copacabana and Ipanema.
The beach was 200 meters away and the beach volleyball arena in 30 minutes' walk.
The area was rather safe because the favelas were far away, yet one should be careful here as well.
"Vladimirs" is not the person one might think about globally; in fact, we mean the most experienced sports journalist in the Russian-language media in Latvia, Vladimirs Ivanovs.
P.S. It looks like another dream about medals has died on Friday morning.
Laura Ikauniece-Admidina fell behind her previous personal records in 100-meter hurdles and high jump.
Yet, there are still five other disciplines.
"Porgy and Bess" returns to stage after 10 years' break in Liepāja.
The opera "Porgy and Bess" was first performed in Latvia in 1973, as a production of the Latvian National Opera.
But, since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not seen another production.
Aware of this, the organizers of the Cesis Art Festival, in close cooperation with the organizers of the Liepaja Art Forum, decided to give audience an opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin's masterpiece again.
"We are extremely happy that, after a ten years' break since Liepaja could enjoy this opera for the last time, the new wonderful concert version of George Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess" has returned to the recently opened Great Amber concert hall", head of the concert hall Great Amber Baiba Boze told us.
"Porgy and Bess" is a story told in vivid operatic language about love, its impermanence, passion as well as everyday tragedies and simple joys of daily life.
It reflects the Afro-American vitality, music and rhythms.
The opera is so alive, because it forgoes political correctness and is unaware of our modern polities.
"And yes, this love story is very powerful, very beautiful and, in some respect, truly profound," said director Viesturs Kairiss.
When listening to or performing this opera, my favorite moments are its most popular tunes, famous motifs and transitions from one character to another by illuminating one person after another or alternately the choir and then the orchestra.
"The building is the most exciting part," the production is thus evaluated by Andris Poga, musical director and conductor of the "Porgy and Bess" concert version.
Audiences of the opera all agree that it is a cultural landmark.
They appear overjoyed at the possibility to see this world-renowned work by Gershwin.
It is so good to feel the world's culture descending in Liepaja.
"Professional performance," commented Edgars Lams after listening to the opera.
The concert version in the new concert hall Great Amber was significant due to the facts that an orchestra was playing in the orchestra pit for the first time and that an opera concert version was staged for the first time.
The square near the renovated building of the Latvian Museum of Art could be named after Janis Rozentals.
The Riga Vice Mayor Andris Ameriks announced during the opening of the Rozentals anniversary exhibition that the museum's address in the future might become 1 Janis Rozentals Square instead of 10a Krisjana Valdemara Street.
The museum's director Mara Lace remarked that a re-registration of its address would result in a serious amount of unnecessary paperwork, but in general she might like the idea and therefore agreed to support this initiative by the municipal authority.
The Riga City has preceded this idea in 1936 by erecting a monument for Janis Rozentals by sculptor Burkards Dzenis, which is stands in front of the museum.
The museum's then-director Vilhelms Purvitis was one of the promoters of the monument.
The newest initiative might thus be considered its logical continuation.
I have constant remorse: what about Vilhelms Purvitis, where shall we enshrine his name?
"But if you, Mr Ameriks, promise to think about that"... said Lace.
As reported, the building of the National Museum of Art, after a major reconstruction and modernization, re-opened this May.
Reconstruction of VEF Culture Palace will finally start this week.
Limited-liability company Velve is going to renovate the Palace for approximately 11 million euros.
It is planned to renovate several interior parts of the palace, including two auditoriums, and to make the building accessible for persons with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to attract EU funding for the project in the amount of six million euros, but Olegs Burovs, the director or the Riga City Council's Property Department, admits that currently there is no absolute clarity about the European money for this project.
"Notwithstanding that, there is a political will to start the repair works at the VEF Culture Palace and attracting European structural funds, we have been waiting for months for a decision, some real move by the officials of the Ministry of Finance, to understand if that money is granted or not," Burovs says.
Last December we were told that it completely depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission telling us to make a decision and that Brussels is not the entity to do that.
Now we see that another discussion round is being created, so let's see what to expect in the closest days to come.
"I want to confirm that the Riga City Council definitely guarantees that this process will be begun and completed in a timely manner," Burovs says.
As reported more than a year ago, in March 2015 the arts collectives of the VEF Culture Palace organized a farewell concert since the building's renovation was about to start very soon.
Even though a year has passed, the renovation has not started and the collectives have continued working in unsuitable conditions.
The strategy elaborated by the Riga City Council's Property Department for the renovation of the VEF Culture Palace is divided into seemingly independent units of reconstruction works each of those relate to different functions of the palace.
The first one concerns improvements of the VEF Culture Palace's accessibility and landscaping of the surrounding area.
It implies rebuilding the surrounding territory and utilities as well as renovating the building's exterior.
The second part concerns improvement of the VEF Culture Palace's range of services.
It mentions an improvement of building's interior; wall and ceiling restoration; stage and recording studio improvements; renovating the cabling and plumbing.
The third part: improvement of work conditions of the amateur arts collectives, namely, improvement of workshop equipment, heating and ventilation systems.
Legendary rock band "Livi" 40th anniversary anticipated with exhibition.
The exhibition will feature various items characterizing "Livi": a timeline with photos reflects the band's activities from its beginnings until 2010 when the band officially announced the end of its career.
Band members' costumes, instruments, awards and taped live performances as well as other items yet unseen by a wider public yet telling the story of "Livi" will also be on display.
The exhibition has received some items from the Liepaja Museum collection.
The visual design of the exhibition was created in cooperation with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniece.
Also other musicians who had this or another kind of connection with "Livi" as well as their families came up and shared both items and memories.
The story of "Livi" began in 1972 when Juris Pavitols founded a band of popular music.
The band's first line-up participated in the "Liepajas dzintars" festival in 1972 and 1974 as well as performance review concerts around Latvia.
Year 1976 marked a decisive turn when Juris Pavitols met Eriks Kigelis: the band found a base at the Metal Worker's Culture Hall and invited Ingrida Gutmane, Andris Kruzins and Janis Grodums to join.
Later the band's line-up changed many times.
Some musicians joined, others left and some returned again.
The major, perhaps most enduring motif was the desire to show that the Latvian rock music can live on.
"There was a lot to see: jeans, long hair and beards; these guys were different from the conventional stereotype of a crooner on stage," music journalist Klass Vavere comments about the band.
Such popular musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krievins, Modris Sterns, Valdis Starks, Laims Racenajs, Talis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brize, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Kleins and many more can be mentioned among the participants of the band.
Entrance to the exhibition is free of charge.
It runs from August 19 until October 30.
On August 27, the 40th anniversary of "Livi" will be marked with "LIVIfest 2" at the Liepaja concert garden "Put, vejini".
Bulgaria Posts Inflation for 1st Time in 8 Months
Inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July, national statistics show.
This is the highest value in years (since June 2012) and the first one above zero since October of last year when a positive 0.2% was posted.
The annual average inflation, measured by CPI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, an increase was observed in the price of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); recreation and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%); furnishings, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).

Zbignevs Stankevics: when the time comes, the truth is resurrected.
The archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church, Zbignevs Stankevics in an interview with Neatkariga emphasizes that if we want to obtain energy in our life, the word of God must be in its center.
It is because the power of truth is greater than evil's whim.
Many have started on their way to the Assumption Day celebration (15 August);
What message will be received by the followers of religion this year?
In the recent years, the Pope's nuncio has expressed a desire to lead the main church service at Aglona.
Therefore, the content of the main message is left at his discretion.
Bishop Janis Bulis leading the Procession of the Cross is another tradition, which has been already accepted.
He will also bring out his message.
I lead the service of vigilia on the day before.
Last year, I addressed Pope Francis' encyclical "Laudato si" and rose the topic of "common home" and the subject of Earth in the context of Latvia.
This year... Of course, I follow the world events and try to address them in my speech.
My approach conforms to the church opinion, namely, that the Gospel message must be at the center of one's life.
It must be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of person's life and inspires them in their further path.
In that way, it speaks to people.
But in Cesis, at the Lampa discussion event you said that "we have to return to an understanding of the complete man".
What did you mean by that?
Does it mean that a person turns away from the message spread by the church?
Does the church have something to offer to facilitate such return today?
A dying man robbed on roadside in India.
In the capital of India, nobody had paid attention to a man who was dying after knocked down by a vehicle: it turned out he had lain there for an hour and meanwhile was also robbed.
As reported, a man identified as Mathibul used to ride his rickshaw during day and also worked nights as a security guard.
Mathibul went home at 5:30 AM along the roadside and was knocked down by a car.
Recordings from surveillance cameras show that the driver stepped out of the car to look at the victim but then left.
An hour later, while nobody paid attention to the bleeding man, he was robbed by a thief.
Approximately 90 minutes after the accident, police arrived at the spot and the injured man was brought to a hospital where he died from his injuries.
By withdrawing her candidacy for the position of Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), the head of the State Environment Service Inga Kolegova has saved the government from collapsing, believes Ojars Skudra, prof. asoc. of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
Kolegova's explanation about her withdrawal of the candidacy in the context of controversies in the leading coalition is related to the fact that she has prevented the government from falling apart.
In conversation with the LETA news agency Skudra revealed that it is hard to imagine that in next week's session the Unity political party could support Kolegova's candidacy.
Therefore, if the ministers from Unity voted against but Kolegova would be elected anyway, it would lead to the resignation of the government.
The expert also believes that Kolegova had consulted both with the Minister for Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola and Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis before she announced that she withdraws her candidacy.
At the same time it means giving in to Unity which strongly opposes her candidacy.
If one should predict, whether it will be possible to find a more suitable candidate through a competition, Skudra told that there are two options: either a compromise figure is selected or the Deputy Director General Dace Peleka continues heading the institution.
He also points out that if the Minister for Finance so far asserted that another candidate is not being considered now, it is a hint to Peleka that she is not invited to participate in the competition.
As LETA already informed, the State Environment Service head Inga Kolegova decided to withdraw her candidacy for the position of Director General of the SRS.
Due to objections voiced by Unity, on Wednesday the government postponed Kolegova's approval for the position of Director General of SRS for one week.
After the government adopted a decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova assured that she is still ready to become the head of the SRS.
However, later she changed her mind: on Friday, in her application to the Minister for Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, she points out that she withdraws her consent to be transferred as the head of SRS and that it is not an easy choice for her.
Andrejs Vaivars , the Press Secretary of the Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis, explained to LETA that a new competition would be organised for the vacant position of General Director of the SRS.
Car accident in Riga center involves a police car.
A car accident involving a police car occurred in Riga center this afternoon.
The police car with turned on sound and light signals was in a hurry for a top level call when it collided with another car at the intersection of Krisjana Barona Street and Dzirnavu Street.
The police is investigating the conditions, but the initial information reveals that the second car did not give way to the police car.
A woman has suffered in the accident.
Riga's population has shrunk this year.
At the beginning of this year, there were 638,784 residents in Riga, which is by 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641,000 residents had officially declared their domicile in the capital city, the Central Statistical Bureau (CSB) told LETA.
In terms of number of residents, the capital of Latvia took the 30th place among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and large cities with more than a million inhabitants.
According to Eurostat, the Statistical Bureau of EU, Riga has the largest proportion of women: the capital of Latvia takes the first place among the largest European cities with its proportion of 127 women per 100 men.
The highest ratio of women among all European cities is found in all three Baltic States: there are 123 women in Vilnius and 121 women in Tallinn per 100 men.
Warning pictographs will be used by LNMA.
In the coming days, warning signs in the form of pictographs will be placed at the Latvian National Museum of Arts (LNMA), the Riga City Council Property Department representative Baiba Gailite told the LETA news agency.
The repair of the glass roof, which was damaged by skateboarders has been completed successfully.
In the next few days warning pictographs will be placed there.
They will indicate that the pavement may be slippery during rain and snow and that using cars, bikes, roller skates and skateboards on it is prohibited.
Usakovs also wrote on Facebook that it does not pose any safety threats, yet "looks inaccurate" and one will "have to chase" skaters.
New playgrounds in Riga for children and happier parents.
This summer the Riga City Council has introduced two more playgrounds, in Kipsala and Ciekurkalns, which are already available for children.
A spacious, multifunctional ship-like play-structure with various climbing elements, little bridges, games, tubes and slides has been set up on the Kipsala beach.
The playground is intended for children of all ages.
There are also swings and various balancing challenges.
The nautically-themed fantasy world is enhanced by its location near the Daugava riverbank, opening a view to the Passenger Terminal and cruise ships.
Another playground, erected between Ciekurkalns Avenues No. 4 and No. 5, contains a play house, trampoline, step track, balance bridge, swings, play balls and other play elements as well as an exercise zone with special rings for strength and coordination training, parallel bars and other devices.
The playground's floor is covered with a colorful rubber mat.
A new, cheerfully colored pavement connects the playground to the street.
Reconstructed road section opened in Medumi.
The Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of the SJSC Latvian State Roads (LSR) and representatives of the construction company SIA Binders as well as local municipality representatives today opened a reconstructed road section of the motor road connecting the border of Russia (Grebneva), Rezekne, Daugavpils and the border of Lithuania (Medumi): from Medumi to the border of Lithuania (156.4th -163.05th km).
Roads are the country's business card, especially border area roads, therefore we are especially excited to open the reconstructed section near our southern neighboring country.
This is another example showing that thanks to co-financing by the European Union funds the situation of the national motor roads improves.
"According to forecasts, the funds available for roads in this planning period will be acquired already in 2018 and we have to think how to further maintain the most heavily used motor roads in very good quality and how to ensure mobility in all regions of Latvia without the European Union funding," Uldis Augulis said when cutting the symbolic ribbon.
The Minister for Transport also pointed out that proposals on sustainable financing for Latvia's roads, prepared by traffic experts, will be soon presented to the government.
Roadworks from Medumi to the border of Lithuania (156.4th- 163.05th km) were started by SIA Binders last year and continued this year after a technological pause.
The reconstruction costs are 13.5 million euros (VAT inclusive), and the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The road structure has been completely restored in the reconstructed road section and next year construction works will start again in the next section: from Medumi to Daugavpils, thus the entire road section from the border of Lithuania to Daugavpils will be reconstructed", Janis Lange, the chairman of LSR informed.
The national motor roads are the most heavily used, and we plan to ensure that by 2018 all national motor roads are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in shape by timely maintenance and replacement of road surface every 7 to 9 years.
"It will require proper funding, of course, and all the involved are hopeful about proposals elaborated by the expert group concerning the road financing system's improvement," Lange noted.
Road connections and lighting in the center of Medumi center have been improved as part of the project.
Large-scale earthwork has also been completed: massive removal of peat and large-scale entrenchment and embankment works; the previously uneven longitudinal road profile has been leveled out in four large sections.
Public transport stops have been renovated, and a square for public transport maneuvering (for making turns) has been built anew.
Previously, the road did not have sufficient bearing capacity and the surrounding terrain prevented good visibility due to hills and valleys, and also the old road went along the course of the natural terrain.
During the next construction season, it is planned to reconstruct the motor road section from the Daugavpils city border until the currently reconstructed section (144.80thto 156.40th km).
This year, LSR plans to carry out different roadworks along more than 1,100 kilometers of national roads.
Information about all the planned repair works on national road network is available on LSR's website at www.lvceli.lv.
"For achieving the desired results in weight loss, a crucial factor is choosing your combinations of foods properly," believes the Lithuanian dietician Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
And it shouldn't be that complicated during the summer season when fresh fruit, berries and vegetables are available from our gardens.
Well-considered combining of foodstuffs not only can help you in losing weight but also directly promote various useful processes in the body.
Pasta and vinegar make a good combination as they fill you up and help reducing body fat.
Studies published in the the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition show proof that vinegar favorably affects blood glucose levels and increases general vitality.
Thus, cayenne pepper and high-protein dishes such as poultry or protein mixes not only provide a sensation of satiety, but also reduce craving for large portions in subsequent meals.
This product combination can increase the amount of burnt calories after the meal even by up to 35 percent.
Research indicates that cayenne pepper can help getting rid of abdominal fat.
Eggs contain a metabolism-boosting nutrient called choline, while bell pepper is a great source of vitamin C.
Sufficient intake of these nutrients may reduce one's cortisol level and thus ward off fat deposits around the waist.
Oatmeal porridge with fresh berries is another kind of tasty fat-burning breakfast, worth including in your menu.
Oatmeal and berries contain dietary fiber which, according to some findings of Canadian scientists, control ghrelin, a hormone responsible for appetite and the amount of food we eat.
Moreover, berries contain polyphenols which help losing weight and prevent increases in body fat.
Vegetables and protein can also work wonders in weight loss.
Combined in one meal, they can make you feel satiated.
Vegetables contain water and dietary fiber therefore they also make you feel full.
At the same time protein slows down digestion and prevents feeling hungry for a longer time.
For lunch, you may want to choose chicken with salad or prepare a dose of protein mix and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
Food combinations to avoid.
Fruit contains sugars known as monosaccharides and disaccharides, appearing as single molecules or pairs.
By comparison, the starch found for example in vegetables is a polysaccharide.
Fruits are digested in the stomach mechanically but not chemically; the latter takes place when they reach the third or fourth stage in the digestive system, i.e., the intestines.
Digestion of starch is split over three various stages, starting in the mouth.
Therefore it is essential not to eat a dessert right after a meal.
If you do eat the dessert right after, it becomes "trapped" in the stomach together with other foods, yet it is not properly chemically digested and starts putrefying.
Certainly avoid consuming bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other high-carbohydrate foods together with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other sour fruits.
The enzyme ptyalin, found in saliva, is active only in alkaline environment.
Fruit acids not only hinder the digestion of carbs, but also activate their fermentation.
Do not combine eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar protein-rich pairs in one meal.
Different digestive fluids are required for digesting these, each fluid having a different acidity, characteristics and time to appear in the stomach.
Watermelon, honeydew, muskmelon and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach together with other foodstuff.
Combinations of fats and high-protein foods.
Fat makes a good combination with starch, but that is not the case with fats and proteins: fat impedes the digestion of proteins.
However, proteins can be combined with small amounts of fat.
If you tend to have a protein-rich diet, avoid consuming fats altogether.
The same applies also to the raw food diet: it is not recommended to combine large quantities of nuts (which contain protein) with an entire avocado (contains fats).
Such combination hampers weight loss.
Best ways of cooking.
"Cooking by heating the ingredients results in considerable loss of nutrients - about 15 to 55 percent of their initial nutritional value," points out the dietician.
In many cases nutrients are destroyed, if the cooking method is boiling.
Yet, the overall nutrition value of certain foodstuffs actually increases with boiling.
The liquid that remains after boiling your vegetables can be later used for making soup: thus you will not lose nutrients that dissolved in the water and they'll still be part of your meal.
The most recommended cooking method for vegetables is steaming.
Thermal processing considerably increases the availability of lycopene found in tomatoes.
After 30 minutes of boiling, the lycopene level in tomatoes rises by 25 percent.
Thermal processing also considerably increases the availability of beta-carotene, found in red, yellow and orange plants, for instance tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
Thermal processing of eggs and meat change some of the proteins' natural properties thus making them easier to digest.
Moreover, thermal processing of meat and eggs facilitates the absorption of iron and other minerals contained in these foods.
Bear in mind that freezing can reduce the quantities of vitamin C by 10 to a whopping 90 percent, yet freezing does not affect the fiber content.
Combined with tomatoes, beans can increase iron uptake in humans, resulting in a better brain and muscle performance.
Our body absorbs up to 33 percent less of the non-blood-building iron found in such plant-based foods as beans, leafy greens and cereal grains than the blood-building iron found in animal products such as beef, chicken or fish.
You can considerably increase the absorption of non-blood-building iron by combining products that contain it with additional vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to alter non-blood building iron in such a way that our body can take it up more easily.
Iron is necessary for producing hemoglobin, which in its turn transports oxygen to muscle and brain.
To get the ultimate benefit from salads, add healthy fats such as olive oil or linseed oil.
When preparing sandwiches with salmon (ample source of vitamin D) or sardines, add plain yogurt - a great source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the quantity of calcium absorbed in the intestines, thus it is important in bone building process.
Oats (as well as other wholegrain products) combined with sources of vitamin C, for example, strawberries, black currant, raspberries and other fruits or berries, helps to stabilize the cholesterol level and to prevent artery clogging.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any missteps quickly enter the public record.
Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, distorted teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface."
And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action.
Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."
She added that "it's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects.
It shows that the filter isn't just yellowface, but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they're able to make decisions like this," Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, "or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up."
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.
For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."
Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says
Officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday.
The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this much is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continued.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).
But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.
The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown With Britain
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.
"I have no clue," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.
The first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin.
However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster.
Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.
The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change.
"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.
She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.
She is on a roll.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.
The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.
His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.
"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.
"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.
Strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.
In researching the book, which includes recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.
As never before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.
"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.
He was fabulously out of touch.
President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."
Many of the Depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.
The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.
"She had a real fear of food waste," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."
There was the cream-puff incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called prune whip," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Mr. Coe went back for seconds, and thirds.
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
Gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, a U.S. district judge has ruled.
In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
In a filing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city.
They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations," he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns.
"Your move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "request" - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers.
Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.
The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.
How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center.
Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception.
The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."
The hotel's clerk said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels."
The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
It is in itself a great shame.
The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace.
That needs no explanation.
We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.
Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.
"Shame on you," another post stated, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue.
The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying.
It adds that the code was now added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.
Under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money.
Some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.
The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.
They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.
He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.
There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.
Hindes said: "It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."
We all as a team came together in the last three months.
We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
That is one event, one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London.
If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits.
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games.
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
That would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny next competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.
The team event is always the best.
You get to win it with your mates.
It's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest.
Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.
He had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.
Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.
After truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London, expectations have been played down in the lead-up to Rio.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the evidence of the first night's racing in the velodrome, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again.
Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed.
The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.
A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.
And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.
The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant.
AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," it said.
AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.
Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event."
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."
The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
And as a generator that wouldn't be good for us," he said.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year, with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.
Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts.
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.
Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.
It's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."
The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing.
"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.
Bordini's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
New tradition: rural community and sports festival in Kulciems.
On Saturday, a community and sports festival in Kulciems gathered people for the first time.
After ten years of the Lake Festival, it was decided to discontinue that tradition.
A new page has thus been opened.
The day starts with a sports contest.
This time people did not compete in traditional disciplines and they were not to be taken seriously, because, for example, darts had to be thrown at a target placed on the ground, there was a flying boot thrown from the left hand, and no Olympic Games have ever seen something called "balling".
However, each participant was given a chance to show his or her strength, courage, dexterity and wittiness.
After the sports games everyone gathered near an open-air stage where the festival began.
At the same time, a "children's corner" was also available for activities and children could jump around in inflatable structures and have their faces painted in a make-up room.
Another novelty, which might become a tradition, was the parade of vehicles, where both tractors and motorcycles took part.
The Kulciems county local government director Inga Kadike-Skadina took the floor to wish everybody a nice rest and good weather, although there was some rain but not as heavy as to disturb the celebration.
The festival continued with congratulation of the youngest residents of Kulciems.
It is really nice that the county now has five young girls and one boy more.
Drama groups from Engure region visited Kulciems residents with their performances: the audience really loved the performances of the senior dance group "Rudens ritmi" (Autumn Rhythms), various folk dance performers "Redas" and youth dancers "Zelta perles" (Golden Pearls).
And it is not a big deal that a few feet slipped on the wet stage.
Of course, the popular duo of actors, Janis Jarans and Dainis Porgans, who again transformed into Mildina Nabina and Skaidrite Kranina, as well as the exuberant ladies from Berzciems, fishermen's house Dieninas all provided a particular enjoyment for the local residents and guests.
The music band "Brugis" took care about the music in the ball.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.
For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.
Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
A woman lay down in the dark on the road "in a desperate act" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.
She died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified, said police, who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
Was it possible to avoid impact?
That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.
Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Signatures are being gathered online to organize a new competition for the position of the SRS head.
The petition portal Avaaz.org has begun gathering signatures for a proposal to organize a new competition in which the new head of the State Revenue Service (SRS) would be chosen.
It is indicated in the petition addressed to the National Alliance (NA) and the Union of Greens and Farmers (UGF) that the society wants a transparent and professional procedure for promoting of officials.
The petition was drawn up on August 10 and currently has been signed by 55 persons.
Promotion of candidate for the position of Director General of SRS, Inga Kolegova, is not transparent and professional.
It somehow reminds of the old bureaucratic traditions of the Soviet Union.
It discredits government as such and repeatedly disappoints the society regarding the government and politicians.
"A competition with clear criteria is necessary, against which all candidates should be evaluated," the petition says.
Its author Janis B pointed out that the society does not know the criteria according to which Kolegova was being promoted for the position.
It is also unclear what are the candidate's intentions for working at the SRS.
The petition says that the State Chancery must start a new and open competition, actively addressing professional candidates, involving recruitment specialists and offering a proper salary.
The Minister for Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola, last week officially put forward Kolegova as a candidate for the position of the SRS head; this week it was intended to confirm her in the new position, but all ministers from Unity voted against, therefore the issue was postponed for a week.
Samoilovs: Lost game means that I have underperformed.
Beach volleyball players Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Janis Smedins had hoped for a medal at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, however, they missed on their goal and, consequently, once you're out of the tournament, it does not matter anymore where to finish the competition, Samoilovs told after leaving the competition.
This Thursday, one of the world's strongest beach volleyball pairs lost the game against the Brazilians Evandro Goncalves Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgado in the subgroup tournament's concluding and decisive match scoring 1-2 (16-21, 22-20, 7-15) thus finishing their participation in the most important sports forum of the quadrennium.
In three pool play matches the Latvian athletes got one victory but two other pairs had the same ratio.
The mutual small-score ratio was considered further, which was the most adverse for the Latvian pair after the apparent loss suffered in this match.
"We were winning in the 1st set, but after reaching 16-15 we remained at the score of 16," Smedins commented on the game's progress.
I don't even know how we managed not to grow the score in the remaining time of the set.
This was just a bad example.
In the 1st set everything was fine and we managed to break up the game at the set's ending, besides it had to be a firm foundation for the 3rd set .
We started it similarly, but after we switched sides, the result was going up only for one team.
We made too many mistakes in attacking.
All pool play teams were similar, there were three sets in almost all matches therefore small-scale points were important.
"We had to play more similar rather than repeatedly losing 3-4 points in a row," the athlete told.
We knew that Evandro can serve.
"We managed it in the 1st set, but in the 2nd set we lost 1-2 points, while in the 3rd set with +4 their game was on the way up," Smedins recalled.
We tried to show our best game.
At some moments we succeeded and at some we didn't.
I did not look at the summary assessment of the situation before the match, but I knew that we had to have more small-scale points.
"The loss means means that I have underperformed", Samoilovs concluded.
We expected a good serve from Evandro and we handled it quite well during the first two sets, but in the third one his serve opened up and it was hard to counter-attack.
I personally made a lot of mistakes when returning Pedro's serves, but I had to somehow manage.
Samoilovs told that, unlike in the previous match, today the athletes were not as nervous.
"We went and played and we had a defense, but we could be better in returning the serves," said the athlete.
"They played well and in the beginning they were riding the wave."
We already told right after the draw that we've picked the most difficult lot possible.
We had a chance to fight for the first place but we did not manage to get past the group.
"Everybody expected us to get a medal or perhaps it was our expectation, but in the end it does not matter whether you have the 25th or the 4th place," commented Samoilovs who predicted that the pair will continue playing together in the future.
I think that there will be no questions and we'll go on playing as the same team, because this situation occurred only in one tournament.
The Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games were the third Olympics for Samoilovs, since he played also in Beijing together with Martins Plavins, but four years earlier in London he joined forces with Ruslans Sorokins.
Meanwhile for Smedins it was the second Olympics.
Latvenergo observes the gas market liberalization process also as a potential provider.
The state-owned energy company Latvernergo is observing the liberalization of the natural gas market both from a position of a consumer and a potential provider, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"A decision on whether Latvenergo will enter the gas market in future also as a seller will be determined by the gas market model and the legal regulation that will be created."
"Therefore we actively participate in the preparation of the legal basis, provide our comments and offer our proposals," Bidere said.
As reported by the news agency BNS, the Ministry of Economics (ME) in cooperation with the Public Utilities Commission and the energy company Latvijas Gaze has come up with a draft Regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers "Regulations on trade and use of natural gas" which will replace the existing natural gas market operation principles by granting the natural gas users a right to freely choose their natural gas supplier starting April 3, 2017.
The goal of ME, when working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, is to make it as simple and transparent for the customer as possible.
Therefore, the most efficient and user-friendly service solution is the "provider-centric model", according to which all activities related to the customer service are carried out by a single provider, which means one contract, one bill and one information channel and customer service location, leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system at the operator's discretion.
A similar solution is now being implemented in the electric power market.
We remind that a gradual opening of the market will be applicable to households; also after April 3, 2017, those households which prefer not to choose an alternative natural gas company will be able to continue to receive natural gas from their current supplier for a regulated price thus becoming the "mandated" users.
"In that case the public trader has an obligation to deliver natural gas to the mandated users at a regulated price," the ministry informed.
Meanwhile the economic operators will be obliged to choose a natural gas trader and sign a natural gas supply agreement.
Before signing the natural gas supply agreement, the economic operators will receive natural gas from the current natural gas trader for a price at its discretion, for a certain period.
The draft Regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers specifies in detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The Regulation stipulates a procedure by which the user receives natural gas and discontinues its supply, the safety requirements in using natural gas, the rights and obligations of a trader, public trader, system operator, user and owner of the property regarding natural gas supply and use; the procedure by which payments are to be made for the services, the amount of late payment fees, the procedure for switching to another supplier and supply to users during natural gas supply disruptions; the procedure by which the public trader supplies natural gas to the mandated users.

Minister: increase of the SRS director general's salary to be discussed next week.
The Minister for Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Union of Greens and Farmers (UGF)) plans to talk with Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (UGF) and the government coalition partners next week about an increase of salary for Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
On Friday, Reizniece-Ozola told journalists that the issue of salary increase for Director General of the SRS must be solved urgently, in order to make this position more attractive to prospective candidates in the new round of competition.
Next week they are also going to discuss changes in the competition charter.
The minister also highlighted that she has no particular candidate in mind for the job.
At the same time Reizniece-Ozola stated that the State Environment Service head Inga Kolegova would have been a good Director General of the SRS.
Regarding the current Acting Head of the SRS, Dace Peleka, who expressed her readiness to run for this position, the minister repeatedly said that the new Director General of the SRS should have an "impartial perspective" and he or she should not come from within SRS's ranks.
She also emphasized that she is waiting for the Parliament to return from vacation so that amendments to the laws required for the SRS reorganization could be carried out.
The BNS news agency already informed that the State Environment Service head Inga Kolegova has submitted an application whereby she withdraws her candidacy for the position of Director General of the SRS.
She explained in her application that it is not an easy choice but during the last two weeks her family has experienced serious emotional pressure although they have not done anything illegal.
Kolegova also indicated that the discussions around her candidacy have intensified the antagonism between the parties of the ruling coalition, which is quite unfortunate.
As reported, the previous Director General of the SRS, Inara Petersone, stepped down from her position at the end of June.
Oil price continues to rise; stock exchange indexes in USA and Europe and value of US dollar increase.
Oil prices continued to grow globally on Friday morning as Saudi Arabia oil minister's statements positively affected investors' mood, and it is expected that the largest oil mining countries will take action at the OPEC meeting next September to stabilize the global oil market.
The three main US stock exchange indexes hit a high on Thursday resembling that of 1999.
The main positive indicator in the market was an oil price increase and strong financial indicators of several big companies.
The oil price increase and strong financial indicators of several companies on Thursday encouraged the rise in European stock exchange indicators.
The value of the US dollar as compared to the euro, British pound and Japanese yen increased on Thursday.
The WTI crude oil price at the New York Stock Exchange electronic trading platform for supplies in September increased by 1.78 US dollars up to 43.49 dollars per barrel on Thursday.
The price of Brent crude oil for supplies in October increased by 1.99 dollars up to 46.04 dollars per barrel at the London Stock Exchange.
Turnover of canned food manufacturer Zila laguna shrank by 33.8% last year.
The turnover of the canned food manufacturer "Zila laguna" was 4.202 million euros last year, which is by 33.8% less than the year before; meanwhile, the company's losses decreased 5.7 times, down to 904.7 thousand euros, its annual financial report, published in the Lursoft data base reveals.
The company's management report indicates that in 2015 the company operated at loss that was caused by several reasons, including constant lack of liquid assets - due to Unicredit Bank leaving the Baltic market and discontinuing the effective credit line, thus leaving Zila laguna with signed contracts without the possibility to fulfill them.
Therefore, the company did not have sufficient means to purchase cheaper raw materials in bulk at volume discount rates.
As the bank was leaving the Latvian market, it also became impossible for the company to implement European Union Structural Funds' supported projects that would allow buying new equipment for the plant and modernize the infrastructure.
The company's financial indicators were adversely affected also by increased prices of raw material and unwillingness of customers to pay more for the company's products.
"Only in the second part of July 2016, customers accepted price changes and became willing to buy them at the new, higher prices," the company's management points out.
In 2015, Zila laguna started negotiations with prospective investors, including an evaluation of the company's movable and immovable property.
The investors have already visited the company's largest creditor Unicredit Leasing and the parties have learned about and discussed the prospective investment plans.
At the same time, the company's business and further development were positively affected by the implementation of restructuring and optimization plans started in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included improvement and optimization of the industrial processes permitting to increase the production output and capacity.
"Several units of equipment were purchased thus ensuring higher output rate," the company's management indicated.
The management of Zila laguna highlights that the equipment purchase will enable the company's factory in year 2016 to fulfil orders that were previously impossible.
The first batch of production made on this equipment will be ready for delivery in August.
Since letters of intent on sales of products have been already signed, all manufactured products will be sold according to the letters of intent.
The new product will increase turnover by approximately 300 thousand euros per month," the company's management says.
In August 2016, the company also plans to sign a cooperation contract for deliveries of processed fish products to Iraq.
In 2016, "Zila laguna" has shipped its first experimental container of goods to Israel, expanded sales in Cyprus, and this September is going to sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the USA.
As a result of all aforesaid activities, the company hopes to increase its turnover.
In 2014, Zila laguna operated with a turnover of 6.347 million euros and incurred losses of 5.113 million euros.
Zila laguna was established in 1997 and its equity capital is 1.156 million euros.
The company belongs to two Latvian nationals, Mihails Kaidanovs (89.11%) and Igors Sirsons (10.89%).
You are welcome to encounter the screen diva Zarah Leander at 3 PM outside the museum and to participate in a press conference.
Riga might be considered the city where the much-admired star of the big screen Zarah Leander began her career and gained inspiration.
Zarah Leander's 1924 visit to her godmother Ruta, the wife of the Swedish Ambassador to Latvia, changed her life, because she was the one to notice Zarah's unusually low contralto voice when she rehearsed for her first appearance at the Riga Cabaret Theater.
Perhaps the turn of events in Riga made a major impact on Zarah's artistic path toward international fame.
Riga remained in Zarah Laender's warm memories and she later hoped to go on tour to Riga, but this was cut short by the Second World War.
This unrealized visit will be re-imagined within the Riga City Festival 2016, with the much-adored Ieva Kerevica playing Zarah Leander.
Large-scale traffic restrictions come in effect near Aglona.

Insurer pays compensation to the passengers of a flight that was cancelled at the airport on Wednesday.
The insurance company If has paid travel insurance compensation to a family for the flight that was cancelled at the Riga Airport on Wednesday, August 10, due to which they had to abandon their plans for attending a music festival.
A customer had submitted an indemnity application to If on August 11.
The family had planned to attend a music festival in Belgium but since it was not possible due to flight cancellations at the airport, the customer had the compensation calculated for hotel booking, which had not been possible to cancel, as well as for the festival tickets costing 204 euros.
The airline promised customers to refund money spent on their tickets.
In 15% of travel insurance indemnity cases the insurance company If has paid a compensation for disruption or cancellation of trips.
"In such situations the costs of flight ticket purchase, returning or change as well as hotel booking are reimbursed," explained Dagnija Rutka, Personal Risk Insurance product manager of the insurance company If.
As already known, in the evening of August 10, a private plane stopped on the runway of Riga Airport due to technical reasons, and therefore several outgoing flights were canceled and several incoming flights had to be redirected to other airports.
Due to repair works, a neighbor's ceiling crumbles and makes him leave home.
The LTV program The 4th Studio was addressed by Dmitrijs Saidjasevs, whose neighbor had started an overhaul in his apartment and since then Dmitrijs' apartment ceiling's plaster started to crumble and fall down, so he wasn't sure whether it was safe to stay there.
The problem is that my neighbors carried out unauthorized construction and the ceiling in my apartment is now damaged.
Then I informed the Riga Construction Board, my building manager and other organizations.
The Construction Board answered that they are not an emergency service and they do not have any experts.
"The apartment owner is supposed to go to the Association of Civil Engineers of Latvia and there will be an expert," Dmitrijs tells.
The invited expert came, made a record of the situation and concluded that the overhead cover is in unsatisfactory condition.
But a month has passed since Dimitrijs' first application to the Construction Board and by the beginning of this week no one was able to answer, whether it is dangerous to stay in the apartment.
They said, at the Construction Board: that is the law, if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in a row.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council but they referred the case to the building manager, then the building manager referred it back to the Construction Board and now we're in a dead-end," Dmitrijs tells.
After considering the pile of documents it is clear that the construction works have been suspended even, though every now and then one can hear that somebody is working there.
An expert evaluation must be carried out within two months and the owner of the apartment under repair must improve the situation within six months.
The external expert has developed his opinion, but the Construction Board considers it to be incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated, whether the metal grid that is integrated in the bearing structure has been affected, therefore it is not certain whether the owner of the apartment below is really in danger.
"For that reason we have requested additional explanation from the expert," the Riga City Council Construction Board representative Ilze Zuka tells.
Regardless of the prohibition on any repair works in the upper apartment, one can still hear that the construction goes on.
Unwarranted construction without a construction permit can be fined with a penalty from 70 to 700 euro, but in this particular case the penalty might be more severe.
While the expert is preparing his opinion, the Construction Board has made a decision that both apartments cannot be used: both the one where the construction works take place and Dmitrijs'.
"This is an unprecedented case in the Construction Board's practice, when in such a way due to ignorance or simply unwillingness the residents probably have posed a threat not only to their property, but also to the owner living beneath and therefore this owner cannot use his property," the representative of the Construction Board tells.
Now Dmitrijs has to look for another place to live: with his relatives, friends, a hotel or to rent another apartment.
Or, Dmitrijs can try to recover the losses from the neighbor in civil proceedings, which may take a lot of time.
Due to unwarranted construction it is prohibited now to enter both apartments until a construction engineer provides his opinion, which could last up to three weeks.
The owner of the flat under repair will be liable to reimburse for the losses.
The owner is also facing up to six months in prison, because he has not taken into account the warning of the Construction Board.
Guess what!
How many lion cubs are in this picture?

They feel fine and sometimes hiss at the zoo workers, regardless of the fact that they are feeding them.
Transformation of former Kemeri spa resort into five star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
A transformation of the former Kemeri spa resort into a five star festival "Park Hotel Kemeri" will cost 22 million euros, the manager of the prospective hotel and representative of limited-liability company Park Hotel Kemeri, Gita Zelve, told LETA.
The development of a hotel is the first stage of the former resort's reconstruction project in Kemeri.
The second stage will involve wellness clinics, intended to be opened in 2022, while opening of the hotel is scheduled for 2018.
Zelve notes that accurate expenses for developing the clinic are not known yet.
But she points out that it will be located in the building of the former Kemeri resort health center whose floor area is about 12,000 square meters .
The clinic will be situated on three floors.
Park Hotel Kemeri and the clinic project is owned by the international foundation G Capital Europe, which invests in European assets.
G Capital Europe belongs to several investors who invest their money in this foundation, Zelve indicates.
According to George Jones, Executive Director of "G Capital Europe", it is planned to invest 12 to 15 million euros in setting up the health center in the former resort, with the total investment exceeding 30 million euros.
As reported, the Jurmala City Council plans to attract 14.5 million euros with three to four million euros co-funding for the recovery of more than 42 hectares of historic park area, reconstruction of access roads and street sections, construction of an interactive nature tourism object, landscaping and amenities, as well as construction of car parking lots in Emils Darzins Street which altogether will promote the socioeconomic development of Jurmala and increase the number of tourists.
The designing phase is intended to take place until mid-2017, while construction and area development works are to start next autumn.
As reported, it is planned to develop a five-star hotel Park Hotel Kemeri and wellness clinics at the historical health resort complex Kemeri.
Nevertheless, the reconstruction kept being postponed.
It was stated in the annual report of 2010 that Ominasis maintained regular communication with the hotel group Kempinski, which continues providing routine technical supervision at the Kemeri resort and that in 2011 the "reconstruction of the new hotel Kemeri would be finished", immediately followed by preparations for opening the Kempinski's chain hotel.
In October 2014, Park Hotel Kemeri expressed willingness to purchase a group of properties of the Kemeri health resort, owned by the insolvent Omnasis Latvia, in auction, but one month later the auction was declared invalid, because the winner did not pay for the purchase at the agreed time.
The price was determined according to the initial price of the invalid auction, at 2.86 million euros.
As LETA was informed by a City Council representative Ieva Aile, the municipality has confirmed by signing a protocol that it is going to improve the adjacent infrastructure: restore the historic Kemeri park, create an interactive nature tourism object, repair roads and car parking lots, with co-financing from the European Union structural funds.

The State President, Raimonds Vejonis, will present the Order of Three Stars, Third Class, to opera singer Aleksandrs Antonenko, President's agenda reveals.
The awarding ceremony of the Order of Three Stars will take place at the House of the Blackheads at1 PM.
According to the information received from the Latvian National Opera and Ballet, Antonenko graduated from the Jazeps Medins Music College in 1998 where he learned to play wind-instruments and vocals taught by Margarita Gruzdeva.
He studied at the Jazeps Vitols Latvian Academy of Music, Vocal Department in the group taught by Arvids Luste.
In 1997 he began to sing in the Latvian National Opera choir, and in 1998 had a debut playing the character of Oberto in G. F. Handel's opera Alcina.
He received the Grand Music Award 2003 for his vocal performance in operas and Verdi's Requiem.
It was noted that in the 2004/2005 season he became the most internationally recognized Latvian tenor, employed by the largest opera houses in the world.
Since the fall of 2004 he has worked for the Düsseldorf Deutsche Opera am Rhein, Berlin and Graz operas, Dresden's Semperoper, Oslo and Stockholm's royal operas, London's Covent Garden Opera, Vienna State Opera as well as Geneva, Dresden and Düsseldorf operas as well as the Salzburg Festival.

E-mail of former NATO commander Breedlove was hacked by Russian hackers.
The hackers, who broke into the US Democratic National Committee's computers, allegedly made several other cyber attacks as well as hacked the e-mail account of Philip Breedlove, the ex-Commander of NATO's European Forces as well as the servers of George Soros' Institute "Open Society", business news agency Bloomberg reported on Thursday.
The hackers have published the extracted information on the website DCLeaks.com.
Also Breedlove's correspondence and information about Soros Institute's work have been placed there.
The institute's computers had been accessible to hackers for one year.
According to data provided by Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers related to Russian secret services as those hacking the DNC e-mail system.
The Wall Street Journal in its turn reports that the Administration of US President Barrack Obama is currently working on the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia thus reacting to the hacking of the DNC computers.
In order to introduce sanctions, the Administration will have to officially accuse Russia or hackers supported by the Russian authorities for the cyber attacks against the Democratic Party's servers.
As reported, in July the website WikiLeaks published approximately 20,000 e-mail letters obtained from the DNC computer system and it can be deduced from them that the leaders of the Democratic Party have put in an effort to damage the campaign of Vermont's senator, Bernie Sanders, the former rival of the party's candidate Hillary Clinton, who is struggling for the democrats' nomination to run for president.
According to US press sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the case of hacking the Democrats' server, and also other US seecurity services believe that Russia's connection to the cyber attack is almost indubitable.
McCartney: presence of Yoko Ono jeopardized The Beatles.
Paul McCartney has admitted that the presence of Yoko Ono made the legendary band The Beatles feel jeopardized.
The 74 year old rock star ''maintains'' good relations with the widow of John Lennon, but back when she came to visit the band in the recording studio, McCartney was afraid of her, because she was the only woman in the company of the band members George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney.
When the singer was asked about the relationships between them, he told to Rolling Stone that "they are really good."
Back then we felt threatened.
She sat on the amplifier while we were recording.
The majority of the band could not stand it.
We managed, but not very well as we were stressed out.
We weren't sexists but girls usually did not come to the recording studio, they'd let us do our thing.
When John started to hang out with Yoko, she sat among the four of us, not in the sound engineer's room.
The author of the hit song Yellow Submarine also admitted that he now regularly communicates with Ringo, the former band member, and occasionally approves the work plans of the recording studio Apple, but in other terms The Beatles have ceased to exist.
When asked, whether he still meets the other remaining member of the legendary rock group, McCartney revealed to Rolling Stone: "not very often".
We meet at social events and parties.
I do not go to meetings, I feel somehow disassociated from that.
I left Apple during my complicated divorce.
I sent John Eastman to represent me and told, "Tell me what they're saying, because I cannot stand sitting at that table".
It was too painful as if watching your pet die.
The company now works in such a manner that I have to only listen to the records.
I am a part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.
The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement.
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.
We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and right across the country, we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average of around $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood, having been born roughly 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they ever will.
At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
