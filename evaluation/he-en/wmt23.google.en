In the Shadow of Endangered Species: Three Cheetah Cubs Born in Iran
The world&#39;s fastest animal falls victim to brutal hunting, droughts and deadly road accidents across the Islamic Republic •
As a result, their number dropped to less than 20 cheetahs.
Three Asiatic cheetah cubs were recently born in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This is a rare birth, which only slightly improves the tragic situation of the animal, which is in danger of extinction in the country due to droughts, poachers, and fatal road accidents.
This is the first birth of a cheetah in captivity in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where cheetahs still live in the wild.
The Iranian news agency IRNA reported that the veterinary team in charge of the Turan National Park in the northern province of Semnan decided on a cesarean birth in captivity.
It was also noted that less than 20 cheetahs have been recorded in seven different districts of the country recently.
Due to the danger of their extinction, the United Nations implemented a protection plan for them back in 2001.
Now, in Iran, they hope that the new cubs will be able to lead to an increase in the cheetah population in the future.
Last January, Iran&#39;s Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs, Hassan Akbari, said that the country&#39;s cheetah population had dramatically decreased from 100 cheetahs in 2010 to just 12 cheetahs.
&quot;Their situation is extremely dire,&quot; said Akbari, noting that the cheetahs have fallen victim to drought in their habitat, hunting, and even traffic accidents.
The cheetah is considered the fastest animal in the world, capable of reaching speeds of about 100 km/h.
Cheetahs can be found in various places across the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to upgrade your car: We tested the Car Thing
Quietly, Spotify has also begun to try its luck in the world of hardware.
After years of development - Car Thing was unveiled and launched as a small experiment in the US •
We got our hands on the first device in Israel •
The vision: to make your old vehicles smart
The Car Thing is Spotify&#39;s first hardware product, and was built specifically to provide a solution for people with older vehicles.
A few weeks ago, I got an initial opportunity to try the new product, which is currently only available to a few testers in the US, here in Israel.
For me, the timing of the delivery was exceptional, as our home vehicle broke down and we had to drive for several days with a replacement vehicle with an old system.
After two weeks of playing around, I realized how the Car Thing could easily become an integral part of many people&#39;s systems.
On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty regarding a global launch, I believe that many will already prefer to use other solutions.
From idea to reality
Sometime in 2018, Spotify users began receiving an interesting offer in their email inbox - the opportunity to purchase a new device with voice control and fourth-generation connectivity, which would turn any old car system into a smart one.
The rumors slowly faded until a year later, when the Financial Times website revealed that the company was planning to soon introduce a new product for cars that simulates a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.
A few months later, these rumors returned to the headlines after the music service was updated with the car mode - the same one we know today from the app - which is activated as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the car system.
Two years have passed since then.
After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify unveiled &quot;Car Thing,&quot; its smart system for vehicles, last April.
Spotify chose to release the new device in a very limited manner, with a long waiting list and many delays in shipments.
So of course, right after the press conference, I went to the website and registered.
Two months later, the long-awaited announcement arrived.
Reconnecting to the site will give me the opportunity to purchase the device with a little surprise - it won&#39;t cost me anything.
After another month of waiting, the delivery man finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.
The Car Thing
First and foremost, Spotify&#39;s device impressed me greatly with its build quality.
It&#39;s slightly smaller than my iPhone 11 and has a larger, brighter, and sharper touchscreen on the front than I expected.
You will also find a round button and dial next to the screen that you can turn to navigate between the interface screens.
And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to maintain a relatively thin profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.
Personally, I would prefer the company to allow me to change the dial activity so that I could control the smartphone&#39;s volume, since I can also navigate using the touchscreen.
Maybe this will be possible in a future version update.
The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, which includes, among other things, a USB Type C cable and various adapters for installing it.
Many of you probably remember how in the past we used to unplug our radios and hide them in a drawer after getting out of the car.
The Car Thing certainly brings back that feeling with its construction.
All adapters connected to the body of the device using a very strong magnet, which prevented it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.
In addition, along the entire top you can find small buttons, which can be easily configured to play various playlists or podcasts.
By long-pressing one of the buttons while listening, or by requesting it from the voice assistant, I defined several playlists that I listen to frequently and the radio program that I listen to every morning on the go.
In doing so, the feature made me feel like the Car Thing was more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.
Old Smart Car Body
After a fairly simple physical installation, I connected the Car Thing to power.
I was pleasantly surprised by the setup process.
The instructions were clear, connecting to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and controls the app like a remote control, and can therefore copy all the information about our account from it.
This means that you will still have to connect your smartphone to the car, either via Bluetooth or an AUX cable, in order to listen to the music.
The home screen is familiar to all users of the app, as like the smartphone application, it emphasizes album art and playlists.
Also, on the home screen, like the one in the app, you can find music recommendations based on your taste, the search screen, and your personal library.
As mentioned, you can navigate between the different screens using the touchscreen or the manual dial.
Moreover, you can call the device&#39;s voice assistant at any given moment by saying &quot;Hey Spotify.&quot;
With it, you can play songs, playlists, albums, and even search for podcasts.
From my experience, it recognized my voice quite easily even when music was playing in the background and the air conditioner was blowing directly on the device.
This is probably thanks to the four microphones installed at the top.
It is important to note that currently the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time of publication of the article, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.
So is it worth waiting for him?
My experience using the device was great, which is a positive surprise to me considering it is still in the initial release phase.
Even with intensive use on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
Still, there is occasionally a small stutter in the interface, but I believe Spotify will address such bugs with future version updates.
It&#39;s clear that the Swedish company has worked on it a lot in recent years, and of the various versions that have leaked online during this period, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.
Still, when I first saw the Car Thing, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to target.
After all, its activity amounts to controlling the application on the smartphone, and not much beyond that.
How is this different from buying a car stand for a few shekels and attaching it so that the smartphone is closer to us while driving?
This question is reinforced when considering that iPhones and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify, and in most cases will give the user much more functionality.
Despite all this, the more I used Car Thing, the more I realized how it could improve the driving experience.
The ability to see Waze on my smartphone screen and control music on a completely different screen is one I&#39;ve learned to appreciate in the last two weeks.
One question remains - will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?
And if so, will it also be launched here in our small country?
The Swedish company is not saying much at the moment.
It didn&#39;t even share how many testers for the device it currently has running around the world, and how many it plans to add in the limited launch in the United States.
The only thing we know for sure is the price, which is expected to be $79 (about 255 shekels).
In the meantime, the Car Thing provides an initial glimpse into a concept that Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Spotify Israel said there is currently no information on plans to launch the device in Israel.

Have you recruited talent for the company?
This way you will ensure that competitors don&#39;t &quot;steal&quot; it from you.
The economy is still in a labor market that is largely dominated by workers, and this is doubly true when it comes to the most desirable employees - the talents •
Here are some tips to help you keep it in the workplace:
.
Despite the increase recorded last month, the unemployment rate in Israel continues to be one of the lowest in the world, and in the top ten among OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5% (150.6 thousand unemployed, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics).
In other words, the economy is still in a labor market that is largely dominated by workers, and this is doubly true when it comes to the most desirable workers - the talents.
With regard to those professionals and managers who constitute centers of proven knowledge, experience, and ability - trends in the labor market show that competition for them, the talents as they are called by employers, is still in full force.
What this means for employers is that in the current labor market situation, they do not have the luxury of resting on their laurels even a minute after recruiting a coveted talent, because as soon as he enters the company&#39;s doors, another company will already try to snatch him away.
In other words, the competition for talent is so fierce that even after being recruited, many will continue to receive a host of tempting job offers, with 30% of employees actually leaving within just a month of accepting the position and starting work.
This is why wise employers will immediately move from the talent recruitment phase to the talent retention phase, with the path beginning first and foremost with advance preparation and creativity already in the talent absorption process.
An efficient, structured, and thoughtful onboarding process will make the talent enthusiastic about their new workplace from day one and even look forward to what&#39;s to come.
Below are some tips on how to prepare and manage a proper onboarding process that will help retain new talent:
It&#39;s no secret - sharing and organizational readiness |
Share with the parties who will work with him on his recruitment, explain to them why he is essential and important to the company and the position, and how you see his contribution.
A new employee who arrives at a place where they are expected and their value is understood will feel welcome and strive to prove the expectations placed on them.
Knowledge is power - coordinating expectations |
On the very first day, they had a conversation with the talent to coordinate expectations.
Get to know his professional background and check where he sees himself in the future, so that you can present him with the diverse and unique tools that you and the workplace can provide him with to get there.
We are all people – personal introductions |
During the intake days, try to get to know the talent beyond his professional qualities and take an interest in his hobbies and interests.
A new employee who is shown interest in him and allowed to realize and express himself beyond the boundaries of his role will appreciate this and want to maintain it.
Curiosity advances |
Already at the onboarding stage, you can create an attractiveness that will make talent want to integrate quickly.
Do this not necessarily through a discussion of bonuses and benefits, but by exposing him to an exciting field or interesting technology, as this type of stimulus for creativity leads to curiosity and increased interest in the workplace.
Also, encourage the talent to voice his thoughts and opinions on the various projects in the company and make it clear to him that they are important to the organization.

Electrification in your pocket: The cost of not closing coal-fired power plants in June - a billion shekels
Report by the Knesset Research and Information Center: Failure to close coal-fired power plants by the scheduled date of June 2022 is estimated at approximately one billion shekels
• The Electric Company: &quot;Fuel use policy is dictated primarily by the Ministry of Energy&quot;
.
The economic cost of not closing the coal-fired power plants on the scheduled date of June 2022 is estimated at approximately one billion shekels for 2022, according to a report by the Knesset Research and Information Center.
According to the report, this cost is reflected in the consumer electricity rate, which, as mentioned, is expected to increase in the coming months due to the increase in the price of coal.
In addition, in 2023, an additional excess amount of coal use of approximately 900,000 tons is expected, so this will be reflected in additional costs to the electricity sector for not closing the coal-fired plants, assuming that the price of natural gas remains significantly lower than the price of coal.
The report states that the significance of a reduction of approximately one billion shekels in the electricity tariff in 2022 was a reduction of approximately 4% in the electricity consumption tariff for the household consumer.
In other words, the economic cost of not closing the stations is about a billion shekels, and the total discount that could have been for the domestic consumer is about 4%.
It should be noted that as part of the reform of the electricity sector, it was decided, among other things, to establish a subsidiary of the Israel Electric Corporation, which will build units powered by natural gas, intended to replace the coal-fired units 4-1 at the Orot Rabin site.
Following this decision, a government decision was made in July 2018, determining that the operations of coal-fired generation units 4-1 at the Orot Rabin power plant should be discontinued.
The decision set timetables, so that the construction of the first natural gas unit will begin in January 2020 and its operation will begin in June 2022, and accordingly, the coal-fired production units 4-1 will also cease operation at this time.
The Israel Electric Corporation responded: &quot;Fuel use policy is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy.
In accordance with the ministry&#39;s decisions, a policy of reducing the use of coal to the minimum possible has been implemented in Israel for several years, even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas.&quot;
Paying the price: everything you need to know ahead of interest rate hikes
Constant decrees: Next week the interest rate on the shekel is expected to rise by half a percent •
How much will the mortgage payment cost?
And what is recommended to do? •
All the answers
The worsening inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of more than 4% in the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise the interest rate on the shekel as early as next week.
Analysts&#39; estimates speak of an increase rate ranging between 0.25% and 0.5%.
If the interest rate does indeed rise by half a percentage point, it will already be 1.25%, the highest level in nine years.
This is after interest rates in the economy were close to zero for years.
The sharp increase in interest rates increases the cost of mortgage repayments by hundreds of shekels and places a drastic burden on households.
With the help of Shai Tzror, a mortgage expert, we examined how much more we will pay and what is recommended to be done now.
If the interest rate increases by half a percent, how much will the monthly mortgage payment increase?
On a mortgage of 1.2 million shekels, which consists of a 40% prime interest rate, the monthly repayment will increase by 125 shekels.
How much has the average mortgage cost increased since the beginning of the year?
This is a significantly sharper increase since the beginning of the year.
This is because the interest rates in the other tracks that make up a mortgage (and not just the prime track) have also increased - in the index-linked track and the fixed-interest track.
If the interest rate does indeed rise by half a percent, the increase in price will amount, according to Tzror&#39;s estimate, to about 620 shekels on a mortgage of about 1.2 million shekels.
The Prime route (40% in this route) will complete a price increase of approximately 280 shekels, assuming there will be an increase of another 0.5% next month.
The variable interest rate track linked to the index (26.7% in this track) will compensate for an increase in price of about 120 shekels.
The fixed interest rate track - not index-linked (33.3% in this track) will increase in price by 220 shekels.
So what is recommended to do today?
For those who have a mortgage that is mostly index-linked, Tzror recommends considering recycling to non-index-linked tracks.
For mortgage holders whose monthly repayments have increased significantly and are finding it difficult to meet their repayments, he recommends considering refinancing their mortgage and rescheduling it for a longer period.
This is to reduce payments despite the increase in interest, as it is always better to meet repayments and not be insolvent.
Regarding new mortgage borrowers, he highly recommends getting to know the different routes and adapting the mortgage to their financial capabilities.
Likewise, in the future, when interest rates drop, they will be able to refinance their mortgage with minimal early repayment fees.
Regarding buyers of apartments from a contractor - Tzror recommends making advance payments to the contractor and taking out a mortgage now.
It should be taken into account that the &quot;construction input index&quot; significantly increases the price of the property even after the purchase contract has been signed.
The residential construction input price index rose by 6.6% in the past year.
In light of the increase in this index, the Banking Supervision Department announced yesterday that it is considering requiring the creation of a mechanism that would allow for the inclusion of linkages within mortgages, but the final decision on the matter has not yet been made.
The price of fuel is rising - and Israelis will have to pay more than 8 shekels per liter in July
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price per liter of 95 octane gasoline will be 8.08 shekels •
At the same time, the reduction of half a NIS per liter in the tax on diesel will be extended until the end of 2022.
A decade-long record: The price of gasoline will jump by 36 agorot per liter - and will stand at more than 8 shekels per liter starting July 1.
The new price per liter of 95 octane gasoline will be 8.08, and those who wish to enjoy full service will be required to pay an additional 21 cents per liter.
At the same time, the reduction of half a shekel per liter in the diesel tax will be extended until the end of 2022, the Tax Authority announced.
As mentioned, the price increase is due to the continued rise in oil prices, due to the war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise in the dollar exchange rate.
If it weren&#39;t for the half-shekel discount that the government has been subsidizing since April, the price of fuel would have exceeded an all-time high - 8.25 shekels per liter.
The discount expires at the end of July, and the Tax Authority and the Treasury are currently promoting the publication for public comment of an order extending the reduction in the tax on gasoline, which stands at half a shekel per liter, until August 9.
Also, starting August 10, an additional reduction of another half a shekel will be determined, so that only from this date will the price of a liter of gasoline be reduced by one shekel, until November 15, 2022.
This was reported by the Tax Authority.
&quot;We have reached a situation where I don&#39;t remember five consecutive months of a surplus in state revenue.
We started a few months ago with the issue of reducing the tax on diesel.
We have been working for a week on extending the excise tax on gasoline and diesel for another four months - instead of half a shekel per shekel.
This is good for the industry and the citizen.
If we lower it, it will affect inflation, make production cheaper, and ease the cost of living.
&quot;As Minister of Finance, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus on this first,&quot; Minister Lieberman said at the Israel Democracy Institute&#39;s Hurwitz Conference on Economy and Society.
As of today, more than half of the price of fuel is taxes collected by the government (excise tax and VAT) - and this is a high taxation rate compared to most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic impact on the cost of living in the economy - because it affects both household and business expenses, the prices of public transportation and flights, transportation costs, and more.
For the third time in a row: Ashdod - the most business-friendly city
Petah Tikva ranked second in the Ministry of Economy&#39;s Doing Business ranking •
Followed by: Rehovot, Ashkelon and Rishon LeZion •
Minister Barabibai: &quot;Corona has highlighted the importance of local government in business development&quot;
.
Ashdod is the friendliest city for small and medium-sized businesses.
This is the third year in a row - this is what the Doing Business in Local Authorities Index of the Agency for Small and Medium-sized Businesses in the Ministry of Economy and Industry found, which ranked local authorities.
In second place is the city of Petah Tikva and in third place is Rehovot.
Following them, in order, are: Ashkelon, Rishon LeZion, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Beer Sheva, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, Netanya and Bnei Brak.
The agency compiles the Local Authorities Index.
This is the fifth time and its goal is to serve as a tool for the local authority, as it allows each authority to compare its performance with other authorities on a variety of parameters, as well as to analyze its performance in the areas in which it is active.
The index is based on several parameters that are examined in each authority, which examine the level of &quot;friendliness&quot; of the authority to businesses located within its jurisdiction.
The index divides authorities into three size groups according to the number of residents, as a local authority of up to 50,000 residents is not similar to a local authority of more than 150,000 residents.
Tel Aviv soared this year
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different ratings in each local authority: business satisfaction, accessibility to tenders, accessibility of information, and property taxes.
The ranking shows that Ramat Gan fell from second place to eighth place, Bat Yam fell from fourth place to 12th place, and Netanya fell from fifth place to 13th place.
A drop in rating does not mean that the authority&#39;s service to businesses has deteriorated, and in many cases it results from the fact that other authorities&#39; service to businesses has improved more and they have risen in rating, while the authority that dropped in rating has improved its services to businesses less.
Among those moving up in the ranking are Petah Tikva, which rose from sixth place to second place, and Rehovot, which rose from 12th place to third place.
Tel Aviv, which dropped from fourth place to 11th place in 2019, improved in 2021 and rose to sixth place.
&quot;Business - an engine of growth&quot;
The ranking shows that Nof HaGalil leads among local authorities with between 50 and 150 thousand residents.
Following it are Kiryat Motzkin, Mateh Binyamin, Modi&#39;in-Maccabim-Reut, Kfar Saba, Ra&#39;anana, Nahariya, Karmiel, Afula and Hod Hasharon.
Tiberias is located in 28th and last place.
&quot;The index is designed to encourage local authorities to make things easier for small and medium-sized businesses, starting from the date the business opens and throughout its activities with the authorities,&quot; says Minister of Economy and Industry, Orna Barbiebai.
&quot;Businesses constitute a significant growth engine for the Israeli economy and are responsible for approximately 50% of business output and approximately 60% of those employed in the economy.&quot;
The development of small businesses is in the public interest of all of us, but the local authority has a direct influence on the businesses located there.
&quot;The coronavirus has emphasized the importance of local government, and we have seen that authorities that have acted and encouraged the promotion of small businesses and found creative solutions for them have become the first government interface for them.&quot;
Ran Kuwaiti, Director of the Agency for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: &quot;Local authorities play a central and essential role in the ability of businesses in their field to thrive and flourish.
&quot;In the last two years, as we deal with the Corona crisis, authorities have had a greater role in helping businesses survive in their field and in general.&quot;
2021 in the mail: 20 packages per household - and a jump in their weight
46.6 million packages arrived in Israel during 2021 - similar to 2020 •
The average weight per package is 435 grams - a 36% jump compared to 2020 •
Busiest month: December, when the average package weight was 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million postal packages arrived in Israel, almost 20 packages on average per household - this is according to Israel Post data obtained by &quot;Israel Today.&quot;
The number of packages that arrived in 2021 is similar to 2020, when 46.5 million packages arrived in Israel, and lower than 2019, when 61.6 million packages arrived.
However, this year there was a jump of more than 36% in the weight of packages arriving from abroad.
In 2021, 20,253 tons of products arrived in Israel from abroad, a 36% jump compared to 14,860 tons in 2020, and 16,743 tons in 2019.
Changes in consumption habits
The average weight per package jumped by 60% in two years - from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
The surge in package weight is mainly influenced by two major trends, both on the seller&#39;s and the buyer&#39;s side: The major shopping sites abroad are consolidating items into one shipment and no longer sending each product from the &quot;shopping cart&quot; in a separate package.
From the Israeli consumer&#39;s perspective, the rapid delivery of shipments, within a few days of ordering, supports the purchase of more everyday products such as clothing and gifts, which buyers are interested in receiving soon after making the purchase.
In 2021, as in 2020 and 2019, the month in which the most packages from abroad arrived with the highest weight and the highest number of items was December, with 4.2 million packages with a total weight of 2,200 tons.
In December, the average weight per package was 524 grams, 20% higher than the annual average weight.
Black Friday effect
More packages arrived in December than any other month, likely due to November shopping holidays, such as Chinese Singles&#39; Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday.
Large orders begin arriving in Israel between one and two weeks after purchase.
Research: Most employees in the economy are unaware that they can receive tax refunds
Many employees receive money from the state, which can amount to tens of thousands of shekels.
Have you changed jobs?
Did you go on unpaid leave?
Did you move from the city to a town?
You may be entitled to receive a significant amount in a simple procedure •
All the details - inside
Most employees are unaware that they are entitled to tax refunds, which can add up to large amounts.
The State Comptroller noted in a report from about two months ago that two million employees are entitled to tax refunds of 3.6 billion shekels, which means that you should also check whether you are entitled to receive tax refunds.
Many employees can receive a high amount, as four out of five employees are eligible for tax refunds.
In practice, however, several tens of thousands of employees submit applications each year.
If you think that these funds will go down the drain anyway, think again: employees can apply to the Income Tax for refunds for six years back.
Tax:On conducted in-depth research among 4,000 of its customers regarding tax returns during 2020.
The company has over 30,000 customers, so the sample reflects their distribution in terms of population groups, gender, age, and geography.
The data shows that during 2020, due to the outbreak of the Corona crisis and the spending of hundreds of thousands of workers on unpaid leave, a number of significant changes occurred, centered on a 15% increase in the average amount of the refund to a household, which stood at 4,300 shekels per year.
The reason is that the social security contributions are lower than salaries, and therefore a gap is created between what the employee paid in taxes and what he actually needs.
By the way, the highest refund received by a company customer in 2020 was NIS 121,054 for refunds over the last 6 years.
What can you get tax refunds for?
One of the reasons for receiving tax refunds is a change in workplace.
81% of people who changed jobs during the year received a tax refund in an average amount of 2,943 shekels.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The data shows that 74% of women who gave birth and were on maternity leave for over 16 weeks were entitled to an average refund of 3,538 shekels for that year.
Another reason for reimbursement is donations.
100% of people who donate and pay taxes received a refund.
Another factor for repayment is failure to record credit points for alimony. 63%
Of the divorced, no credit point was updated for alimony, and therefore the tax refund for each year for which such a credit point was not updated is 2,616 shekels.
Due to unemployment - spending on unemployment benefits: 93% of those who went on sick leave or unemployment and who earned over 12,000 shekels received a tax refund of 4,021 shekels for that year.
Additional reasons for tax refunds are: refunds for life insurance payments, mortgage life insurance, refunds for qualifying settlements, refunds for losses in securities, failure to register credit points for men for childbirth, and distribution of tax refunds by geographic location.
- 94% of people who deposited for personal life insurance or for taking out a mortgage were eligible for a tax refund.
In a study conducted on every million shekels of a 25-year mortgage, the cumulative tax refund for the period is over 20,000 shekels for the entire mortgage period.
100% of those moving to a qualifying locality received a tax refund for the year of the move, since confirmation of residency in a qualifying locality is only granted 12 months after the resident becomes a qualifying resident, and thus in effect the first year full tax is paid.
79% of customers holding securities were eligible for a tax refund for the aforementioned years.
However, it is important for anyone who holds securities to check every year, since losses are not rolled over from year to year, but only through filing a report.
56% of men who have a child do not record credit points in the year of birth on their paycheck.
The repayment rate can reach tens of thousands of shekels over 6 years.
This is a phenomenon that exists mainly in the Arab sector.
Tax:on CEO Tal Carmon: &quot;The coronavirus crisis has caused the Israeli wage earner to become much more active.
He is interested, checks and demands what he is entitled to in income tax refunds.
It turns out that the fact that hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been sitting at home, on sick leave or after being laid off, for months has caused many employees to take a closer look at what they deserve from the state.
&quot;It is important to know that today all procedures for receiving tax refunds can be carried out digitally, easily and simply, without the bureaucracy that deterred many in the past.&quot;
The job market: fewer job candidates, more pay
Oljobs Report 2021 Summary: Top Demand - Jobs Without Experience •
The volume of jobs offered increased by 50% •
&quot;Looking for a job, but not storming the market&quot;
In the year that just ended, there was a 15% decrease in the number of resumes sent, and an average of only 23 candidates competed for each position, compared to 41 candidates the previous year - this is according to a report by the Oljobs website summarizing 2021, on the Corona crisis and its effects on the labor market in Israel.
According to the report, job seekers were mainly interested in job-rich fields such as administration and sales, for which 1,738,485 resumes were sent.
However, jobs without experience led the way in demand with more than 38,000 searches - probably following the return of young people without professional experience to search for immediate work, after the end of unemployment benefits.
The number of searches for sales and administration was 35,000 and 32,000 (respectively), drivers and couriers had 11,000 searches, and security had slightly less than 9,000 searches.
On the other hand, despite the Corona crisis, wages in 2021 increased by 2% compared to 2020, and the average wage in Israel was 11,675 shekels gross.
The average monthly salary in the software field was 17,915 shekels, and in information systems analysis it was 17,140 shekels.
However, there was a wage gap of more than 2,000 shekels between the center and the periphery: in the center of the country it was 12,500 shekels on average, compared to 10,795 in the north and 10,135 shekels in the south.
From a gender perspective, the average wage gap between women and men, which can also be explained by the type of work and the number of hours worked, remained at 36%.
Men earned 13,295 shekels, compared to women&#39;s wages of 9,740 shekels.
Trying to get back into the groove
On the business side, there was broad-based growth in almost all sectors of the economy, and businesses craved working hands.
Thus, the job offer increased by 50% and recorded a record of more than 40,000 jobs on Alljobs.
A survey conducted by the site among employers found that 50% were optimistic about their economic status in 2022, 30% of whom indicated their intention to increase total hiring, but 72% understand that they will have difficulty doing so this year.
The largest supply was for jobs without experience - and there were more than 58,000 of these on the site.
They were followed by customer service and administration positions with about 44,000 jobs in each field, sales and software with 41,000 jobs each, teaching and education with 24,000 vacancies, and warehouse workers are still in demand with 19,000 vacancies.
Einav Boimfeld, Director of Research and Content at Alljobs: &quot;Job seekers are trying to get back on track but are not storming the market, mainly due to the lack of attractive jobs in their eyes.
&quot;Also, the prolonged disconnection from the work cycle makes it difficult for them to return, and some have found creative ways to make a living.&quot;
CBS: Unemployment rate in Israel rose to 6.3%

&quot;Not obvious&quot;: Subliminal sanctifies the Sabbath - and prepares for independence
Celebrates the fact that &quot;we can live as we please,&quot; is excited about meeting the audience, and makes sure to spend time with the children •
The Weekend and Independence Day by Kobi Shimoni, Subliminal
What does your typical Friday look like?
&quot;Weekends are the most important moments in life, for me.
Sanctification and tradition are deeply rooted in my soul.
Fridays are dedicated to my children, Or (10) and Yonatan (8).
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and supplies for kiddush, have lunch and do something fun together, like play soccer, ride horses or play with cars on a remote control.
Sometimes we go to the beach, or even just to wash the car, but we always stop on the way to buy a gift at the neighborhood toy store - and there&#39;s always another excuse.
&quot;When we return home with the many gifts, the smells of cooking greet us.&quot;
What does your Friday dinner look like?
&quot;I was blessed with chefs around me.&quot;
On my side there is Persian-Tunisian cuisine, full of salads and an atmosphere of laughter, music, singing, and joy.
From my wife Ines&#39; side, who is also a great cook, come the Ukrainian dishes, which are deep and spicy, with lots of meat.
When we arrive at my mother-in-law&#39;s, incredible smells are already rising from her apartment, right from the lobby of the building.
I usually do the Kiddush, together with the children, who know it by heart.
&quot;In the end, my fun after dinner is passing out on the carpet, and having the kids jump on me like I&#39;m some kind of inflatable.&quot;
Do you have a special childhood memory from the weekends?
&quot;As a child, I would wake up on Shabbat to the sounds of Israeli music on Channel 3 and the Pale Tracker sketches, which we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in the Land of Israel, usually to the north.
Every remote corner of the country made him proud in his heart.
He passed away three months ago from a serious illness, and for him Kiddush and Shabbat were the holiest of holies, especially in that the whole family needed to be together.
I recently released a song in his memory called &#39;Shomer Eleik&#39;, which I created with Osher Cohen.
&quot;I believe he would have been proud of this work, which sanctifies the bond between father and son.&quot;
We will soon celebrate the 74th Independence Day. As a passionate Zionist, what are your feelings about the holiday?
&quot;Independence Day is a sacred day for me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Persia and Tunisia, my parents were forced to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who is privileged to live with his children in our country.
A week or two before Independence Day, I would already be climbing trees and tying wires with Israeli flags to the house.
Today, my Independence Day is full of performances, and I always meet an insanely happy audience, celebrating the fact that we can live as we please.
We need to ensure that our children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren also have this option, and remember that nothing here is taken for granted.&quot;
Her Friday: Esti Zakheim blesses the Sabbath
&quot;My dream is to open a big table and invite all my dead loved ones&quot;: The Friday dinner that Esti Zakheim dreams of, and how does she deal with the fact that her husband observes Shabbat?
Tell us about your preparations for Shabbat.
.
&quot;Preparations start on Thursday night, when I return from a show or workshop and cook until three in the morning everything that requires long cooking, such as goulash, roasts, and sauces.
On Friday, in the first part of the day, I dedicate time to myself, meeting with friends for coffee, going to a play or a movie, or I attend rehearsals.
In the summer, Saturdays come late, and I have plenty of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch the sunset or just a good series.
&quot;For Shabbat dinner, I usually host my mother, Varda, who celebrated her 89th birthday, and also friends.&quot;
Can you share more cooking?
&quot;I like shortcuts.&quot;
For example, instead of peeling 10 onions, cutting them, and crying, I buy a bag of frozen onions and fry them.
On my Shabbat table you can find meat dishes, vegan tofu dishes, potatoes, and baked cauliflower.
I do most of the cooking, and of course they heat up on the grill on Shabbat.
&quot;Alejandro, my partner, makes chicken soup, vegetable salad and, in the winter, cholent.&quot;
Your husband is a religious man and you are from a secular family.
How does it work?
&quot;Living with a Sabbath keeper is an endless compromise.
&#39;Love your neighbor as yourself,&#39; in practice.
He can&#39;t go on family trips, so I often found myself packing up the kids and joining friends&#39; family trips.
In addition, I am also the children&#39;s regular driver, the one who brings them back on Friday nights from parties and gatherings.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of his Sabbath, because I usually don&#39;t appear on Sabbath and get a kind of &#39;forced vacation&#39; - and that&#39;s a good thing.&quot;
Who would you like to host on Saturday?
&quot;I would open a big table and invite &#39;my dead&#39;.&quot;
Sometimes I imagine what it would have been like if my brother Daniel, the late, were alive, or if my father, the late Shneur, had seen my children: Uriel (23) and the twins Tamara and Naama (16 and a half).
&quot;We must have been arguing about football and politics and getting excited about each other.&quot;
Do you have a special childhood memory from the weekends?
&quot;We were a warm and united family.&quot;
On Friday afternoons, my mother would make a pile of schnitzels, bring hummus and pita bread from the market, and roast eggplant for a tahini salad.
Then we would go to Aunt Hannah&#39;s in Yad Eliyahu, or as she would say, &#39;Yad Eliyayke&#39;, and she would make blintzes.
Since I was the only one who didn&#39;t like raisins, she would make me some without raisins.
She saw me, the youngest of the siblings, and took care of me.
&quot;On Saturdays, we would take a tour with my father at the Jaffa Port, and he would show us where he and his twin brother, Grisha, came to Israel with nothing.&quot;

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are engaged
Nearly two decades after their love story ended in separation, Lopez and Affleck are back in each other&#39;s arms •
Lopez split from baseball player Alex Rodriguez in April 2021
.
His one: Almost two decades after their first love story that ended in separation and a year after their much-publicized comeback, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are coming full circle romantically and are engaged.
Lopez shared the happy news with her fans on her official website onthejlo.com yesterday evening (Friday).
.
The news of the engagement comes after Lopez was photographed this week walking around with a huge diamond ring clearly visible on her engagement finger.
A representative on her behalf confirmed to People magazine that Affleck and Lopez are indeed engaged.
As you may recall, the last time Affleck (49) pulled out a ring and offered Lopez (52) to be his forever was in 2002, and then it was an eye-catching ring with a huge six-carat pink diamond, estimated to be worth about $2.5 million.
Despite the grandiose gesture of love, the two separated in 2004, accusing the media of being overly obsessive and constantly prying into their lives.
Since then, Affleck has managed to marry actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, while Lopez, as is known, had been married three times before, including to singer Marc Anthony, with whom they became parents to twins.
Lopez&#39;s last romantic relationship was with baseball player Alex Rodriguez, from whom she split in April 2021 after a four-year relationship, including a two-year engagement.
The Kardashians Speak Out: &quot;You Can&#39;t Make Up What&#39;s Happening to Us&quot;
&quot;The chaos is endless,&quot; insists mom Kris Jenner about the new series starring reality TV&#39;s first family, and gets backing from her daughters and new producer •
In an article to be published in &quot;Shishabt&quot; magazine, they talk about big money, the PR grind, the brand factory and the change that Kim wants to make in the world: &quot;I&#39;m no longer the one who thinks for hours about which bikini selfie to upload.&quot;
This may surprise many, but the most sought-after brand in 2022 for the Disney content empire, which also includes the Marvel and &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, is the Kardashian family.
The details of the contract between the first family of reality TV and social media and Disney were not disclosed, but estimates suggest a minimum sum of $100 million was transferred to the family&#39;s daughters, who now also function as producers.
In a press conference with the stars, each of whom is accompanied by an entire beauty team that takes care of touch-ups of makeup, hair, and wrinkles in clothes non-stop, the girls of the family, as well as their new and sought-after producer, insisted that this time it&#39;s not a reality show, this time what is shown on screen is completely authentic.
&quot;You can&#39;t make up what&#39;s happening to us,&quot; says the family&#39;s mother, Kris Jenner, firmly. &quot;The chaos is endless.&quot;
&quot;We&#39;re showing how much we&#39;ve grown since that series that aired in 2007,&quot; says Khloe Kardashian.
&quot;When we started, we were scared. A lot happens to us in life and it&#39;s impossible to simply confine everything to a narrative of a beginning, middle, and end.&quot;
Many plots were rushed through editing, wrapped in a sweet, colorful film, and forgotten aside.
This is not how life looks in reality.
&quot;Now we are more exposed, facing the camera directly in a natural way, not just a reality show but an authentic documentary series.&quot;
When confronted with their new involvement in the production of the series, which effectively gives them complete control over the content that ends up on screen, Chloe claims: &quot;We are involved behind the scenes, watching clips during editing and giving comments, but not from a defensive position but simply to give our opinion on what would make the series better.
It&#39;s a reflection of our lives and I personally feel like I&#39;ve experienced emotional growth from watching myself.
&quot;Kendall and Kylie were little girls when we started, so they&#39;re more of a boundary setter.&quot;
&quot;I grew up&quot;
Kim Kardashian, for her part, continues to do her best to change her image, from cheap reality TV trash to a lawyer with an agenda.
&quot;I&#39;ve grown up,&quot; she claims, &quot;I&#39;m raising four black children, meaning from a persecuted community that is discriminated against in this country.
I want to change reality, so that my children and the children of all my friends will have a different future, in the hope that we can heal the crooked system.
This is my motivation.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m no longer the same Kim who thinks for hours about which bikini selfie to upload,&quot; she insists, &quot;but it hasn&#39;t completely disappeared from my life either.
&quot;A person must be true to who they really are and take everything with joy.&quot;
About the reasons for the producer&#39;s firing, as revealed by Ryan Seacrest, and their new and very profitable path in the industry, the significance of the move to Disney, the family&#39;s well-oiled PR machine and its impact on the brand&#39;s profitability, and more, in the full article to be published in &quot;Shishabt&quot; magazine.

The international festival in the capital, which has become a tradition and will be held in several locations, will present musical performances by leading local artists, and will combine circus shows and innovative and surprising artistic performances.
.
Like every summer over the years, alongside the heat, humidity, and boredom of the students, comes the Jerusalem International Outdoor Creator Festival, which has already become a tradition in the capital and will be held in several locations (including Mitchell Garden, the Sultan&#39;s Pool, opposite the Tower of David, and at the foot of the Old City walls) - between August 15-27.

Watch: Tamir Greenberg on the relationship with his father
The winner of &quot;The Next Star&quot; finds a second single and returns to his childhood memories and the significant presence of his father in his life •
&quot;The song talks about how to maintain a connection from a distance,&quot; he says.
Tamir Greenberg with a second single called Into The Night after winning the audience with his first single and his participation in &quot;The Next Star&quot;.
In recent months, Greenberg has continued to perform in many venues: Tel Aviv Culture Center, Tel Aviv Opera House, Shoni Amphitheater, Ganei Yehoshua Amphitheater, Hangar 11, and dozens of other performances.
The song Into The Night was produced and arranged by Greenberg together with producer Stav Beger.
The music video, directed by Daria Geller, brings Tamir back to memories of his childhood and the significant presence of his father in his life.
&quot;The song talks about the relationship between my father and me.
&quot;About the time I left Israel for the US and the way to maintain the connection from a distance,&quot; Greenberg says.
Next month, Greenberg will appear at the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah Games in Israel, and ahead of the new season of &quot;The Next Star,&quot; the song with which he won the show, Tell Me Where The Light Goes, was chosen as the audition song for the upcoming season.
Blue and White: Yuval Shmela is the big winner of the season and the 16th ninja in the world
The phenomenon climbed Mount Madoriyama in 26 seconds and earned the title of &quot;the first Israeli ninja&quot; •
Yogev Malka climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but will not hold the title of ninja.
the
There is a winner: Yuval Shemla defeated Midoriyama, and is the winner of the fourth season of &quot;Ninja Israel&quot; and now holds the title of the first Israeli ninja and the 16th in the world.
Shamel has been a participant in the show since its first season, when he finished in first place, and in the second season he lost to Gil Marantz.
In the third season, he won again and recently returned for the fourth season, and during filming he stated that this would be the last season.
This evening, he climbed Mount Midoriyama for the first time in 26 seconds and finished in first place, after beating competitors Yogev Malka and Vishay Kalfon.
Malka managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds and finished in second place.
It should be noted that according to the rules of the show, only one ninja who managed to climb Midoriyama in time can be crowned each season.
Therefore, despite Malka&#39;s impressive achievement, because Yuval Shemla, the season&#39;s winner, climbed Midoriyama 3 seconds faster, Malka does not win the Ninja World Title.
He will be able to compete for it again next season.
Okay, we understand, that full of superheroes, Rotem Sela is perfect, and &quot;Ninja Israel&quot; is the most important sporting event in the world
.
Two Olympic medalists and a veteran sports broadcaster sat in on the finale of a reality show and acted as if it was the most significant sporting achievement on earth.
.
Rotem Sela represents such a perfect feminine ideal for us that it is distorted to present it this way on television.
She earns more from campaigns than Wonder Woman, she&#39;s too beautiful, she knows how to put Dana Weiss in her place, and when necessary - also stand up for her business partner.
She is a mother and also a career woman who advertises banks and air conditioners, models and hosts series and reality shows, and serves as an unattainable role model for young girls.
And maybe it makes sense that Ruth Sela goes through a too-perfect screen, because on the show she hosts, one has to be perfect, and there&#39;s no need to apologize for that.
In the ninja world, everyone is larger than life, and the guides come first.
Assi Ezer got involved in an affair that was supposedly supposed to erase him from the screen for a certain period of time, but since he is not an ordinary human being, he was extricated from it even before the first set of commercials.
Listen to the soundtrack of the event: Niv Raskin, who broadcasted European Cup wins and world records in his life, but is excited about the mega-wall as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on earth.
In the finale, two Olympic medalists (Yordan Jarbi and Linoy Ashram) sat alongside him as commentators, as if to emphasize how rare and high-quality the conditions for entering the superhuman world that this reality show has been presenting for four seasons.
&quot;Ninja Israel&quot; went out of proportion to market the season, which ended last night with Mount Midoriyama and with Yuval Shamala, who managed to climb it in 26 seconds and was finally crowned Ninja.
An almost impassable path led there, one by one bringing down all the superhuman characters whose egos the show had made sure to inflate throughout the year.
Want to be a Ninja Turtle?
Not here.
They&#39;re looking for superheroes here.
The emphasis was on searching for a successor to his throne, someone known as &quot;the king of kings and one of a kind,&quot; and other nicknames intended to make clear how perfect and unique he was.
As a result, the level of difficulty was raised, the girls who tried to compete in the season&#39;s courses crashed, and the boys competed among themselves to see who had more square stomachs and charisma of plywood to step into the shoes of the retiring Shamla.
They will say that it is a sports program that encourages physical activity and shows overcoming difficulties and challenges, but from the perspective of the vast majority of viewers - mediocre armchair sissies like us - &quot;Ninja Israel&quot; cultivates an unattainable sports-achievement model for us.
Faster, stronger, higher, more perfect.
When Gil Sasover moves between punches and conversations about holiness
It&#39;s strange to see the comedian, ex-Comedy Store host the &quot;Keblat Shabbat&quot; program on Channel 14, where he tastes dishes and gives a platform mainly to men.
If we play an association game, we will all have similar answers to the question &quot;What does the term &#39;preparations for Shabbat&#39; remind you of?&quot;
Say: sponges and cleaning, pots on the gas and smells in the stairwell, Yaron Ilan or Avi Kachon on TV, but the strangest thing would be if someone suddenly said &quot;Gil Sasover.&quot;
Because Gil Sasover in the middle of the sponge and the cooking is the most unrelated thing that television can offer.
And truly, &quot;Keblat Shabbat,&quot; the new program he hosts on Friday afternoons on Channel 14, is disconnected in spirit from the time it is broadcast.
Along half of it - a standing sassover.
He speaks quickly, holds a microphone in his hand even when he tastes dishes, and tries to divide the dose between punches and conversations about holiness.
In its defense, it can be said that the budget is palpable, and this is probably the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.
However, what was also noticeable in the premiere program, which was broadcast yesterday from the Binyamin headquarters, was a clear gender division.
The men sing, play instruments, dance, speak Torah, market restaurants and factories - while the women were content with a small item, in which they excitedly talked about running a sewing shop.
Happy Women&#39;s Day to you.
Kabbalat Shabbat with Gil Sasover, now 14
The Association of Assisted Housing against Ruthie Russo: &quot;Saying &#39;this tastes like assisted housing&#39; harms our activities&quot;
Chairwoman Yuli Gat sent a letter expressing the union&#39;s complaint against an insulting statement, they claim, made by the judge of &quot;The Next Restaurant&quot; in one of the program&#39;s trailers.
Ruthie Russo responded: &quot;I&#39;m glad there are places that invest more in the culinary arts of this population.&quot;
The Association of Nursing Homes and Assisted Living in Israel against &quot;the next restaurant&quot;: A letter sent by chairwoman Yuli Gat and received by &quot;Israel Hayom&quot; reads as follows: &quot;In the trailer before the broadcast, which was distributed on all social networks and on television, it is described that the professional judge of the competition said, &#39;The food tastes like assisted living,&#39; meaning food from a closed institution with low-quality food.&quot;
&quot;The tone chosen by the program&#39;s judge, Ruthie Russo, to describe her disappointment with the food the contestant served instantly nullifies our many years of activity to fight against the existing ignorance in the field, because the assisted living homes operate restaurants in the various homes for the benefit of the residents with chef dishes of the highest level.&quot;
It also states: &quot;Service teams and home managers are fighting for the image of assisted living, which offers quality housing solutions for the elderly, including alleviating loneliness, abundant leisure activities, a high standard of living, and more.&quot;
In Israel, in recent years, more and more families and older people understand that loneliness is the most difficult disease of old age and see community places as a proven solution to the disease.
&quot;Food is one of life&#39;s greatest pleasures, so we dedicate resources and efforts to serving residents the finest food.
Most assisted living homes use professional chefs to create menus.
We would be happy to invite the judging team at any time to be impressed by the winning dishes served every day to tens of thousands of seniors in Israel, and on behalf of the chefs and restaurant staff in the assisted living homes, we would like to ask for your apology and clarification.
&quot;Come together, the media and Israeli society, to encourage community housing for the health of the elderly.&quot;
Ruthie Russo said in response: &quot;I&#39;m glad there are places that invest more in the culinary needs of this population, which definitely deserves excellent food in the advanced period of life.
&quot;I respect the hard work of cooks, cooks, chefs and chefs everywhere, including in assisted living.&quot;
&quot;Double standards: In Russia you cancel a show, but in Israel you don&#39;t?&quot;
Nick Cave responds to criticism
The singer addressed the criticism leveled at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of double standards •
The singer responded: &quot;The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&quot;
&quot;
Nick Cave canceled a show in Russia earlier this week due to the war and announced that he &quot;stands with Ukraine and prays that the madness ends soon.&quot;
In doing so, the esteemed Australian singer joined artists and bands such as Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who also canceled performances in the invading country.
But in the case of Kyiv, its cancellation announcement took a slightly different turn.
A Turkish fan named Ahmet accused the singer of being a hypocrite, as in 2017, Kiev refused to cancel two concerts that took place in Israel, despite the much criticism he received from pro-Palestinian organizations.
During his visit to Israel, Kiev told local media: &quot;Ultimately, I am here for two reasons: The first reason is because I love Israel and Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians.&quot;
That same Akhmet well remembered Kyiv&#39;s statements in favor of music and against politicization.
The fan even published a scathing post on the singer&#39;s personal, uncensored website, &quot;The Red Hand Files,&quot; in which he claimed that Israel is also an occupying state, and therefore the situation in Palestine is identical to that in Ukraine.
&quot;What bothers me about your statement about Ukraine,&quot; Ahmet wrote. &quot;Is that you did not support the Palestinians, who also suffer from a brutal regime.
In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion, Israel is first and foremost the factor responsible for Palestinian suffering.
&quot;This makes me very sad, because you represent a double standard here,&quot; the Turkish fan concluded.
But the story does not end here, as Kiev chose to respond to Akhmet with a long and detailed letter, in which it emphasized that &quot;Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The first situation is an unprovoked attack by one country on its neighbor, in the hope of changing the security order of all of Europe.
The second situation is a complex friction between two peoples.
The conflicts are indeed similar in that innocent people, who share a tragic fate, are forced to hide in shelters.
&quot;I feel great sympathy for all these communities - no matter where they are and who they are.&quot;
Kiev added that although he is not interested in detailing his views regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he certainly supports the Palestinians, and noted that over the past 20 years he has participated in many fundraising events for them.
&quot;But this is not the time for arguments, Akhmet,&quot; the singer clarified, &quot;this is the time to unite and support the Ukrainians, who are currently experiencing a catastrophe on their soil.
I have great fans in Russia, and I know that many Russians strongly oppose the actions of the Putin regime.
&quot;If I could play for them, I would.&quot;

Against the backdrop of the decline in coronavirus cases, coronavirus project director Prof. Salman Zarka will return to manage Ziv Hospital in Safed on Sunday.
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue in his role as a projector.
&quot;I am happy for the citizens of Israel that the Omicron wave continues to fade and that we have regained our normal way of life,&quot; said Prof. Zarka, adding: &quot;We still have a duty to prepare for another wave of morbidity as a result of the virus still being here, in Israel and around the world.&quot;
Prof. Zarka was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the policy for treating the coronavirus in the third and fourth waves.
As of May 1, Israel returned to a &quot;between-waves&quot; state, which includes reducing most of the coronavirus measures, while maintaining capabilities for conducting surface tests and investigations, which will form the basis for action in the event that a new variant is discovered.
Hidden morbidity
The report by the National Knowledge and Information Center for the Corona Campaign, published this morning, noted that &quot;there has been a decrease in the average number of new confirmed cases to below two thousand per day, on a weekly average, alongside a decrease in the number of hospitalized people and those hospitalized in serious condition.&quot;
However, they emphasized that &quot;there is significant hidden morbidity and in reality the number of infected people is much higher.&quot;
The number of institutional tests carried out in the community (excluding tests of returnees from abroad, MI) is low, standing at less than 20,000 tests on a weekly average.
&quot;The low volume of testing makes it difficult to identify and understand morbidity trends.&quot;
State Comptroller&#39;s Report: The actual budget in most years of the Pharmaceutical Basket Committee&#39;s activity is smaller than the recommended budget
According to the report by Matanyahu Engelman, for more than 20 years of the basket&#39;s operation, the Ministry of Health did not supervise the committee&#39;s activities.
The report also states that the minutes of the meetings are published with significant delay, if at all.
The auditor also recommends increasing the transparency of the subcommittee&#39;s activities – and updating the basket work procedures.
Another deficiency found concerns the fact that since the committee began its activities, the Ministry of Health has not requested reports from the health funds on the extent of use and utilization of the drugs in the basket - which would have made it possible to analyze and monitor the budget given to them.
The Pharmaceutical Basket Committee is one of the public committees that has the most influence on our daily lives and our health.
Every year, the committee decides on new medications that will be provided to the public free of charge through health funds - but a new report by the State Comptroller published today (Tuesday) warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without any control reports on its activities and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council supervising and examining its activities.
&quot;Israel Hayom&quot; reporter Ran Reznik adds that the State Comptroller&#39;s investigation was conducted following the ongoing exposures in &quot;Israel Hayom&quot; about the shortcomings of the pharmaceutical basket.
According to Matanyahu Engelman&#39;s report, he recommends &quot;making corrections and improvements in the process of expanding the basket, which will lead to better utilization of the health services basket budget to which the public is entitled.&quot;
Throughout the years of the existence of the mechanism for adding to the basket of medicines, between 1998 and 2021, medicines totaling eight billion shekels were added to the state budget - with the addition varying annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million shekels.
In 2019, 2020, and 2021, applications were submitted to add approximately 800 new drugs and technologies to the healthcare services basket, at a total annual cost of more than two billion shekels.
In practice, the budget allocated to expand the basket was smaller than the scope of the requests.
In most of the years of the committee&#39;s operation (90% of the time), the amount of the budgetary increase was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired increase rate.
The auditor notes that it is necessary to examine and regulate the amount of the annual increment in order to allow for certainty and long-term planning.
Engelman also noted that &quot;the transparency model in basket work is lacking.&quot;
For example, the working procedure of the Basket Committee states that the minutes of the meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published with a delay of 109-160 days, with sometimes the minutes of the final meetings not being published at all.
&quot;The delay in publishing the protocols harms the transparency of decisions; as a result, the ability of the proposers – patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies – to submit repeat applications as soon as possible and relevant may be impaired, after they have learned lessons from the rejection of their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and revised their proposals, and reassessed their feasibility for acceptance in the next round,&quot; the auditor noted in the report.
&quot;The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols in accordance with the schedules set out in the procedure.&quot;
Out of thousands of submissions – only one economic comment was submitted
Another criticism of Engelman concerns the preliminary process of evaluating the technologies submitted to the drug basket.
The auditor found that approximately half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the rejection.
Another deficiency concerns the activities of the subcommittee on the drug basket, which is closed to the media and the public, and where patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.
The auditor recommends including a public representative or examining the possibility of publishing the discussions to the public without confidential commercial details.
The procedure by which the Health Services Basket Committee operates states that &quot;an economic evaluation must be submitted&quot; for a request to add a drug to the basket.
But in practice, over the years, only one economic evaluation has been submitted out of thousands of submissions – and the committee makes its decisions without an economic evaluation.
For example, requests were submitted to the basket committee for the years 2019-2021 to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.
The report revealed that the requests were not accompanied by economic assessments, including an estimate of the amount that could have been saved due to reducing the damage caused by diseases resulting from obesity or due to the ability to avoid gastric bypass surgery.
It also appears that the decisions of the Drug Basket Committee are not consistent with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
For example, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparation for the treatment of the increase in chronic diseases as goals, but in the framework of the decisions regarding the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.
The Comptroller also warns that since 2011, the drug basket also includes services that are not the responsibility of the health funds, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccinations, which are provided by the Ministry of Health (&quot;the third supplement&quot;).
This is because the legal framework for this step is only regulated retrospectively.
In the last six years, 74 million shekels from the addition to the drug basket have been used for these services.
Engelman recommends that the Ministry of Health update the basket work procedures and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is needed for these services.
About a third of the new drugs that enter the drug basket are defined as &quot;drugs without additional cost,&quot; the use of which does not cost the health insurance funds an additional amount because they replace existing treatment.
The auditor suggests examining the possibility of these drugs being discussed in a different, abbreviated track, so that it would be possible to update the drug basket several times a year and not just once a year.
There is no supervision over the use of particularly expensive medications.
The audit also shows that since the work of the basket committee began 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds to report or monitor the extent of use and utilization of the medicines in the basket, information that could have allowed the ministry to analyze and monitor the budget given to the funds.
Over the years, only two reports have been published, covering the years 2006-2009, and even these were published with considerable delay (the last one was published this year and dealt with budget utilization in the years 2007-2009).
&quot;The delay in conducting tests may lead to difficulty in collecting and analyzing data, irrelevance of the conclusions emerging from the test after such a long period, suboptimal pricing by the subcommittee, and making decisions based on inconclusive findings,&quot; the report states.
Likewise, the ministry does not audit or supervise the use of particularly expensive medications and has not conducted any lessons learned.
These are 10 drugs that accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (1.7 billion shekels in 2016-2021).
Regarding this, the Comptroller wrote: &quot;It is recommended that the Ministry of Health conduct individual inspections of these drugs and technologies and analyze the extent of their use compared to estimates.
&quot;Controls and analysis will allow us to draw systemic conclusions about the work process of the basket committee and the subcommittee, and about the manner in which estimates are prepared when pricing medicines and technologies, and to improve them.&quot;
&quot;Shocking and unimaginable&quot;: A heated debate in the Health Committee about the poisoning in Beit Dafna
The first patient to die had normal blood pressure readings ten minutes before her death.
Committee Chairman, MK Silman: &quot;If people there cared that the kitchen was like at home - it wouldn&#39;t look like this.&quot;
Ten minutes before the first 40-year-old resident of the &quot;Beit Dafna&quot; daycare center in Holon died of food poisoning, her medical tests were taken and they were normal, the director of the daycare center claimed today (Tuesday) in a hearing before the health committee.
&quot;We have night nurses who check during the night and there is a nurse who makes rounds.
There were several reports of diarrhea cases and the last time that resident had her measurements taken was 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal.
She was monitored like the other daikers with diarrhea.
She is a nursing patient, we went to get a nurse to help transfer her, and then that resident didn&#39;t respond.
&quot;We started CPR and called the clinic nurse,&quot; the daycare director described what happened last Sunday morning at the daycare.
This is an incident in which three residents died, six were hospitalized, and a total of about a quarter of the residents of the residence (33 out of 131) suffered from diarrhea after eating contaminated goulash meat.
The director of the daycare center said this in light of claims that death from food poisoning indicates neglect and lack of follow-up on the part of the treating authorities.
Dr. Naama Nos, head of epidemiology at the Tel Aviv Health Bureau, noted that &quot;we cannot definitively determine what the three victims died of.&quot;
&quot;Only blood tests were taken from them.&quot;
It was also raised in the discussion that it was no longer possible to take a stool sample from the residents who were hospitalized because they did not defecate, and therefore it is not possible to determine with certainty the cause of death and morbidity.
An engineer from the Ministry of Health also noted that &quot;the Ministry of Health checks the sanitary conditions in kitchens in institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Social Affairs or a request for license renewal.&quot;
The Ministry of Social Affairs admitted that the investigation committee has not yet been appointed for this case and for a previous case of abuse of inmates that occurred three months ago at the &quot;Bnei Zion&quot; institution in Sharon.
The chairwoman of the Health Committee, MK Idit Silman, said during the discussion: &quot;If the people there cared that the kitchen was like at home, it wouldn&#39;t look like this.&quot;
Residents in social housing need more.
They are sensitive in terms of health and require extreme care and attention.
It is shocking and inconceivable what happened there.
The horrific findings were discovered even after they knew the Ministry of Health was coming to inspect.
Where is the oversight and accountability of the ministries?
&quot;How come the ministers and directors-general of the ministries are not present at such a discussion to give an explanation of what is going on here?&quot;
Yigal Nachtomi, CEO of Beit Eckstein, who runs the daycare and even ran the daycare himself, said, &quot;Hundreds and thousands of people throughout the organization stand up for only one goal: to do good for people.&quot;
The people who passed away are people I personally cared for.
I put one of the tenants to sleep in my arms.
&quot;This is a shocking event for us.&quot;
Smadar Una, a former resident of a residential care facility of the same age, lashed out at him, saying, &quot;Enough with the lies and the beautiful words.
&quot;I was there.&quot;
Gali Barami, parent representative at Akim Israel: &quot;We have complained about the food in the past and they did not accept the criticism.&quot;
Oren Hellman, founder of the Equal Opportunity Initiative for the integration of people with disabilities, protested that the names of the deceased residents were not published: &quot;We don&#39;t even know their names.
Are they worth less?
&quot;They are disrespecting the lives of our children.&quot;
Suspected negligence at Wolfson: The surgeon caused a rupture in the heart - and the patient died.
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Faras Abu Akar as director of the thoracic surgery unit at the hospital.
The chairman of the doctors&#39; committee complained that the director, Dr. Engel, was warned before his appointment •
Hospital: &quot;He is respected and experienced&quot;
First publication: A horrific mistake occurred at the Wolfson Government Hospital in Holon, when during surgery the doctor ruptured the patient&#39;s heart, leading to his tragic death.
The surgery on an 83-year-old lung cancer patient was performed on April 19.
This was the first surgery performed by Dr. Faras Abu Akar at the hospital, after he was appointed director of the thoracic surgery unit at Wolfson.
During the operation, which was intended to drain the area surrounding the patient&#39;s heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large tear in the heart, which led to severe bleeding and caused the patient&#39;s death.
But the unusual complication opened a Pandora&#39;s box, raising difficult questions regarding the management of the hospital.
The director of the Oncology Institute and chairman of the doctors&#39; committee, Dr. Ronen Brenner, demanded an investigation into the affair in a letter he sent to the hospital&#39;s director, Dr. Anat Engel.
In the letter, he raised extremely serious allegations about Dr. Engel&#39;s conduct and the appointment of Dr. Abu Akar, after the previous director of the unit, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, moved to Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer.
A huge hole in the heart
According to Dr. Brenner&#39;s letter, the patient was lucid, functioning, and had been treated by him for the past four years.
Recently, his disease spread, and an abnormal accumulation of fluid was discovered within the pericardium, within which the heart muscle is located.
Also, the surgeon, Dr. Abu Akar, was impressed that he could perform the surgery.
According to the complaint, a serious malfunction occurred during the surgery, and Dr. Hagai Dekel, director of the cardiothoracic surgery department at Wolfson, who was at the time operating on a child in the next room, &quot;was urgently called to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart.&quot;
According to him, the heart was drained of blood, the blood pressure was zero, and the surgical approach was wrong.
In addition, Dr. Brenner said that Dr. Dekel contacted him and told him that Dr. Abu Akar was not professionally and personally suitable to manage the thoracic surgery unit at Wolfson.
However, despite his explicit warnings and even though he was supposed to be the chest surgeon&#39;s direct manager, Dr. Engel conducted a tender without involving him and accepted Dr. Abu Akar for the position.
He further noted: &quot;This is an uncomplicated procedure, which lasts a few minutes,&quot; and added: &quot;It is impossible not to address the flawed process of accepting Dr. Abu Akar for the position.
The question arises whether Engel is directly responsible for the failure of the surgery and the death of the patient.&quot;
Experienced surgeon
Israel Hayom was presented with information and claims from additional senior doctors that reinforce the questions raised in the case by Dr. Ronen Brenner.
Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, director of surgery at Wolfson, responded to Brenner&#39;s complaint and wrote that Dr. Abu Akar is &quot;one of the most experienced surgeons in the country, but a relatively young thoracic surgeon.&quot;
He added that he was selected in a proper tender and that Dr. Dekel did not take part in it, in accordance with his statements about his desire to &quot;disconnect&quot; from the chest unit.
He also noted: &quot;I was not a participant in the process either, and perhaps I should have been.
Dr. Shimonov wrote that Dr. Faras Abu Akar began work on April 10 and is entitled to 100 days of grace. &quot;All the doctors at the hospital were impressed by his professionalism and his motivation and willingness to work.&quot;
He has already performed dozens of cases of a similar procedure, and unfortunately the current case ended as it did, in a regrettable manner.
Wolfson Hospital responded: &quot;We share the family&#39;s grief.
This is a patient of oncologist Dr. Ronen Brenner.
The thoracic surgeon mentioned in the article is a respected surgeon with many years of experience, and was selected in a tender to manage a thoracic surgery unit associated with the Department of Surgery at Wolfson Hospital.
&quot;According to Dr. Hagai Dekel, his quoted words are inaccurate and taken out of context.
It should be noted that this is a patient who was unfortunately in very serious condition.
&quot;The hospital is reviewing the details of the case transparently, and the Ministry of Health is aware of the details of the case.&quot;
Watch the guide: How to perform an antigen test independently?
Are the instructions on the packaging confusing you?
&quot;Israel Hayom&quot; and &quot;United Hatzalah&quot; present: This is how you can sample yourself and get an answer within minutes.
Are the instructions on the packaging confusing you?
Not sure how to perform the sampling?
That&#39;s what we&#39;re here for.
&quot;Israel Hayom&quot; and &quot;United Hatzalah&quot; present a short and concise guide to performing the home antigen test.
We wish everyone to be positive in life and negative in the Corona tests - and of course, complete recovery and lots of health.
A Model for Healing: Three Senior Doctors Talk About Their Mentors
Prof. Galia Rahav misses the wit and wisdom of the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, especially during the pandemic •
Dr. Shlomi Kodesh does not forget, even from the height of his position, the encouragement from the late Prof. Shaul Suknik •
And Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev thanks Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld for the lesson in empathizing with patients •
Three key people in hospitals write about those who inspired them and encouraged them to be better, both as caregivers and as people.
Three senior doctors, three teachers of life and the profession: On the occasion of Israeli Doctor&#39;s Day, &quot;Israel Hayom&quot; invited Prof. Galia Rahav, Dr. Shlomi Kodesh and Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev to remember the figures who accompanied them at the beginning of their journey - and helped them become who they are today.
Prof. Galia Rahav, Director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba |
About the late Prof. Marvin Shapira
The meeting that opened my eyes - and changed my life
If I hadn&#39;t met the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was the director of the infectious diseases unit at Hadassah Hospital, I would probably have remained a specialist in internal medicine.
He is the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to pursue it.
I met him in the corridors of Hadassah, back then in the 1980s.
I never thought for a moment that I would leave internism, as I loved the care of the patient himself; but Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also reflected in neurology, internism, and basically in every field.
I thank him for bringing me into this field.
Throughout, I loved his investigative approach, an approach that gets to the root of the problem.
The discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor with every fiber of his soul, who loved his patients and taught me not to take things for granted and to examine everything in depth.
He was a genuine and honest person, devoid of ego, qualities that I really liked about him.
Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me and influenced me the most, I intended to choose my father, the late Dr. Yosef Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.
He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go into medicine - but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapiro.
Both, for example, coined proverbs that doctors still use today - such as &quot;Tissue is the disease,&quot; meaning that taking a biopsy of tissue from the affected organ allows us to know which medications to give; or &quot;Once you use it, you lose it,&quot; which is intended to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to them.
The late Prof. Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked at Hadassah and had two daughters.
He passed away about a year ago, and when I visited his family on Shabbat, I cried.
He was something - a witty and smart epidemiologist, who volunteered for everything.
He never complained, not even during his serious illness.
He was one of the first doctors on the team to treat epidemics, and he is sorely missed during this period.
If he were with us today, I&#39;m sure I would consult with him, and I&#39;m sure he would be one of the leaders of the team handling epidemics.

Dr. Shlomi Kodesh, Director of Soroka Hospital |
About the late Prof. Shaul Suknik
A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors
.
I first met the late Prof. Shaul Suknik when I was a fourth-year medical student, and I came to a rotation in internal medicine in the fourth internal medicine department that he directed.
Later, I returned to the department for a rotation in my sixth year, and I did my medical school final thesis under his supervision, writing a computer simulation on a patient with polyarthritis (inflammation of multiple joints).
Shaul influenced every significant juncture in my professional life over the course of 20 years, and was the most significant person in shaping my image as a doctor; not only professionally, but also - and most importantly - from a personal and human perspective.
During my internship, I was debating between family medicine and internal medicine, and I consulted with him about choosing a specialization.
In the end, I chose to specialize in internal medicine with him in Soroka.
During my internship, he provided me with constant guidance, in a variety of ways - in scientific writing (sorry Shaul, I wasn&#39;t persistent enough), in communicating with patients, in working in a multidisciplinary team - an area in which the department excelled - and, in fact, in every aspect related to medicine.
To this day, I recognize in myself, as a doctor and as a manager, characteristics that come from Saul.
When I finished my internship and was debating whether to go for a period of training abroad, Shaul pushed and guided me, and helped me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to proceed.
The training period was a very important time for my professional development, and without Shaul&#39;s support and encouragement, it&#39;s not certain that it would have happened.
Upon my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital management, Shaul was again the one who supported and assisted.
Later, we successfully navigated complex periods together in the Internal Medicine Division.
Shaul knew how to wonderfully combine the roles of teacher, principal, friend, and teammate, without his various roles interfering with each other.
I strive to be as successful as he is in this special combination.
He raised generations of students, interns, and residents, who are currently throughout the Israeli medical system, and who perpetuate his memory and work through their excellent work.
I am honored to be included in this group.

Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev, Director of Schneider Children&#39;s Center |
About Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld
The man who taught me medicine, and especially listening.
Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld, founder and former director of the Intensive Care Unit at Schneider Children&#39;s Medical Center, taught me to be an intensive care physician, but more than that - he taught me to think.
The obvious thing I learned from him is to take care of the most complex, the sickest children.
The children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.
The obvious thing is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who never imagined they would find themselves in these complex situations in an intensive care unit with their children.
Sounds strange, but it&#39;s obvious.
But I learned even more significant and profound things from him.
Looking back, because I am a doctor who is a manager and a manager who is a doctor, it is clear to me today that the connection between the worlds is clear; the education I received from Dr. Sheinfeld connects them.
Dr. Sheinfeld taught me to listen attentively to many things: to listen to the children, to listen to the monitor, to listen to the nurses, to the teams caring for both young and old, and to listen to the parents.
All of this needs to be done not only to communicate more correctly and successfully, but also to constantly collect a wealth of information that can prevent the next deterioration.
Preventive processes in the care of children exist everywhere, and of course also in intensive care.
Listening and dialogue inspire deeper understanding, both on the part of the care team and on the part of the patients and their families.
My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true when looking at an entire system.
The deeper and more rigorous the understanding, which incorporates all the involved parties into the discourse, the more accurate the decision-making process will be, tailored to the situation, and most importantly - early enough to prevent future, immediate or distant damage.
This is why Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld is much more than an inspirational figure to me.
He is a man who taught me a lot about medicine, but mostly taught me to think quickly and accurately, to listen - and then to apply.

Medical malpractice during the various stages of childbirth
In order to win damages, plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that the damage was caused by that negligence.
Birth is one of the most joyful and exciting events in a family&#39;s life.
However, unfortunately, sometimes births end in serious harm to the mother or newborn as a result of negligence on the part of the medical team.
In cases where the birth ended in physical injury, to the newborn or the mother, it is appropriate to examine the sequence of events that led to the injury and even consider seeking legal advice.
A lawyer specializing in medical malpractice will examine whether there were any flaws in the conduct of the medical team during the various stages of childbirth that caused the damage, and if deemed appropriate, will seek advice from a medical expert in the relevant field.
It should be emphasized that not every error in treatment on the part of the medical team amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that its management was negligent.
When, then, is it negligence?
When the doctor&#39;s error resulted from a lack of skill or deviated from the reasonable level of caution, and the lack of skill and deviation from the accepted level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused if the doctor had not acted in this way.
In this article, we will examine the different stages of childbirth, explain the complications that may occur during each stage, and when they amount to medical malpractice.
The phase of the axes
The labor phase lasts on average between 8 and 14 hours.
At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (in order to allow the passage of the fetus during birth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.
Most cases of medical negligence during labor involve failure to identify fetal distress prior to birth, which caused harm to the newborn, sometimes manifesting as cerebral palsy.
Cerebral Palsy (CP):
Cerebral palsy may be caused by failure to recognize or delay in recognizing perinatal asphyxia, which is manifested by a failure to supply oxygen to the fetus&#39;s brain tissue.
In general, monitoring the condition of the mother and correctly interpreting the fetal heart monitor should lead to early identification of the development of fetal distress, allowing the medical team to act quickly and rescue the newborn before it is irreversibly damaged.
Cases in which the medical team ignores signs indicating that the fetus is suffering from a lack of oxygen, or the team does not correctly interpret the data in front of them, especially the fetal monitor, or responds late to distress expressed on the monitor, may constitute negligence.
Cerebral palsy may also be caused by umbilical cord prolapse and by a uterine rupture that was not detected in time.
Even in these difficult events, it is appropriate to inquire whether the medical team acted appropriately.
For example, Attorney Anna Reif Liganza, from the Caspi Sror &amp; Co. law firm, which specializes in representing victims of medical malpractice, says that her office handled a claim by a child who was injured during birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the fetus&#39;s head was too high, thereby leading to umbilical cord prolapse (when the umbilical cord precedes the fetus&#39;s head) and damage to the oxygen supply to the fetus&#39;s brain (as a result of pressure from the fetus&#39;s head on the umbilical cord), resulting in the child being born with severe neurological damage.
In another case, an attorney said that her office filed a lawsuit due to serious medical negligence by the staff of the maternity ward at a large hospital who, during the birth, did not recognize clear signs at the time that warranted a real suspicion that the woman in labor was suffering from a uterine rupture in the area of the surgical scar from her previous pregnancy.
The fetus, which was ejected through the tear in its mother&#39;s uterus into the abdominal cavity, suffered severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a late stage when it was on the verge of death.
Due to the severe fetal suffering during his birth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.
We emphasize that in order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal connection between the negligence of the medical team that led to the failure to identify the asphyxiation and the damage caused to the newborn, meaning that the damage was caused due to the aforementioned negligence and not by any other reason or factor.
The examination of the causal relationship will be carried out by examining medical indicators that, according to the medical literature, only when they are present does a causal relationship exist between the asphyxiation and the brain injury.
Among other things, the indicators of the acidity level in the fetus&#39;s blood, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic damage, and more are examined.
Fetal death
The active labor stage
The active labor stage begins when the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical phase.
Delaying birth and avoiding cesarean section
In some cases, dysfunctional labor develops, that is, a lack of progress in the active labor process.
In such situations, it is customary to perform a cesarean section, in order to prevent various damages that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in birth.
&quot;There are cases in which failure to perform a cesarean section on time may cause irreversible damage to the fetus,&quot; Attorney Reif-Liganze explained to us.
&quot;For example, we handled a medical malpractice claim involving the death of a newborn caused by a significant delay in performing a cesarean section.
Contrary to all recognized medical practice, the medical team failed to identify fetal distress and perform a cesarean section despite the extremely slow progress of labor.
The delay in performing the surgery caused multi-system damage to the newborn, which ultimately led to her death shortly after birth.&quot;
Vacuum birth negligence
In situations where the mother or fetus is in significant danger and requires an extremely rapid termination of labor, a vacuum delivery (empty suction) is sometimes performed.
In this process, a &quot;dome&quot; is attached to the fetus&#39;s head using a vacuum and the fetus is forcefully pulled out.
Naturally, this operation involves dangers and may cause damage to both the fetus and the mother, and therefore requires great caution, precision, and skill.
In these events, medical negligence may manifest itself in the doctor not adhering to the mandatory instructions and performing the procedure despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the fetal head is too high in the pelvis, or performing it for a longer time than permitted, or when, despite the failure of many attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the procedure more than the permitted number of attempts.
In these cases, if the negligent vacuum operation caused harm to the newborn - among other things, it may cause cranial damage and bleeding that may cause the development of brain damage - there is a case for filing a tort claim.
ERB paralysis
Erb&#39;s palsy is a congenital nerve injury to the brachial plexus (a nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder), and when it occurs during childbirth, it is appropriate to check whether the damage occurred as a result of negligence on the part of the obstetric team.
The injury manifests itself in weakness of the hand muscles and can lead to complete paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in delivering the newborn due to the occurrence of &#39;shoulder breech&#39; - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the fetus&#39;s shoulders become trapped inside the birth canal after its head has emerged.
When should you suspect that paralysis was caused by medical malpractice?
In cases where the assessment of the fetus&#39;s weight indicates that it is a macrosomic fetus, meaning that it is expected to be born weighing more than 4.5 kilograms, and in accordance with guidelines, it is preferable for the mother to deliver the baby by cesarean section.
When the newborn&#39;s weight is over 4 kilograms, a cesarean section should be considered in light of risk factors, including gestational diabetes and prolonged second stage of labor.
In the event that the medical team ignores an abnormal fetal weight assessment or additional risk factors and chooses to continue with a vaginal birth and the risk of shoulder dislocation and ERB paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical negligence.
Indeed, in AA 2694/90, the Supreme Court ruled that &quot;the risk that shoulder stenosis will occur during childbirth can be predicted in advance with some degree of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder stenosis, where there is a concern that it will occur, is to perform a cesarean section.&quot;
Placental abruption stage
The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its expulsion occurs due to uterine contractions after the birth of the newborn and is accompanied by bleeding.
In most cases, the process lasts up to half an hour from the moment the baby is born and most often occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical team.
After the placenta is delivered, the medical team will check whether it came out intact or whether parts of the placenta remain in the uterus.
During this stage, complications may occur that could cause serious harm to the mother.
One of the known complications resulting from placenta remnants remaining in the uterus is called &quot;Asherman&#39;s syndrome&quot;, scarring of the uterine wall as a result of inflammation caused by placenta remnants remaining in the uterus, a phenomenon that damages the uterine lining in a way that prevents pregnancy from implanting.
Therefore, in cases where the medical team did not recognize that there were remnants of the placenta remaining or did not take all measures to prevent damage to the uterine lining despite the suspicion of remnants of the placenta in the uterus, it may be a case of medical negligence and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer in the field.
Death of the mother
The death of a mother during childbirth is a fairly rare event.
In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy to the entire family unfortunately becomes the most tragic event for it.
In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the mother in time or responds too late to such bleeding.
&quot;For example...&quot;, Attorney Reif-Ligenze told us, &quot;our firm filed a lawsuit involving the death of a woman in labor, when in that case the medical team ignored and did not respond to the woman&#39;s worrying vital signs, waited for long hours, and delayed diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the underlying disease from which she suffered.&quot;
&quot;In another case...&quot;, said Attorney Reif-Liganza, &quot;our firm represented the relatives of a woman who died after giving birth to twins due to bleeding that originated from a cesarean section that was not sewn properly.
&quot;In that case, the woman in labor complained of severe pain and weakness after the surgery, but the medical team did not properly address her complaints and clinical condition, responding late only after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death.&quot;
Loss of uterus
In serious cases, medical malpractice during childbirth may lead to a hysterectomy, says Attorney Reif Lingze: &quot;Our firm handled a lawsuit against a hospital based on a hysterectomy due to medical malpractice after childbirth.
In that case, the woman giving birth, a 31-year-old woman, lost her uterus due to a lack of proper treatment for massive bleeding observed by the medical team after delivery, and yet no timely action was taken to prevent the damage.
What are the compensations awarded in claims for medical negligence during childbirth?
Newborn compensation for injury due to medical negligence during childbirth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being awarded for pain and suffering, nursing and paid care, loss of wages and pension for the injured person and even his parents, and additional damage components.
The compensation awarded to an injured minor for lost wages and pensions is calculated in most cases based on the average wage in the economy.
The compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation equipment, the cost of adapting housing to the baby&#39;s needs, mobility, and more.
&quot;The amount of compensation is determined in each case on its merits and according to its circumstances,&quot; says Attorney Reif-Liganze, adding that &quot;today, most claims based on medical negligence end in a compromise that weighs the chances and risks that each party has in conducting the procedure.&quot; However, the attorney added that &quot;there are cases in which the procedure ends only with a verdict, in which case, if the claim is not dismissed, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages. For example, in a lawsuit conducted by our firm, the District Court awarded compensation exceeding ten million shekels to a minor who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress.&quot;
In conclusion
Medical malpractice during childbirth is undoubtedly every family&#39;s nightmare.
In these cases, a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that caused the tragic outcome, by an attorney skilled in handling claims based on medical negligence, can help you win the compensation you deserve.
This is the reason for the prevalence of the eye disease keratoconus in the South
A study has shown that there is a link between the development of the disease and marriage between relatives •
The highest prevalence was found in the Bedouin sector •
Expert: &quot;It is possible that in any sector with many marriages between cousins, we will find a high incidence of the disease.&quot;
Keratoconus is an inherited eye disease that causes some vision impairment.
It is very important to diagnose it as soon as possible, and to find the right solutions to prevent the situation from worsening.
In recent years, several studies have been conducted that help understand how the disease develops, and innovative treatments have been developed.
The new studies provide research support for the suspicion that the eye disease keratoconus is a genetic disease.
A recent study, which dealt with changing the shape of the cornea from a dome to a cone, revealed that the cause of the disease and weakness of the cornea and its distortion of shape is related to an enzymatic imbalance, as a result of which free radicals may damage the proteins in the cornea - and its structure will change.
The source of this enzyme deficiency is genetic, a fact that strengthens the hypothesis that keratoconus is a hereditary disease.
According to Prof. Ariella Gordon-Shagg, head of the Department of Optometric Sciences at Hadassah Academic College, &quot;A study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa found a prevalence of keratoconus of 3.2%.
&quot;The highest prevalence was among students from the Bedouin sector - 20% had keratoconus, but it was a relatively small sample.&quot;
The researcher added that this is not a surprising finding: &quot;There is a high prevalence of keratoconus in the Bedouin sector.
In our studies, we found that consanguineous marriage is a risk factor for keratoconus.
&quot;So in any sector with a lot of marriages between cousins, we might find a high prevalence.&quot;
In this context, it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unequivocal conclusion: in cases where there is a family history of keratoconus, all family members should undergo an appropriate eye examination as soon as possible.
According to Erza Fruchter, a B.Sc. clinical optometrist, &quot;There are ten times more visits to the clinic from remote peripheral areas, mainly from the south, compared to the center.&quot;
Fruchter adds that &quot;In the last decade, I have noticed that most patients come from the periphery, especially from the Beer Sheva area.
&quot;This is mainly due to the high prevalence of marriages within the family (especially in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and a lack of awareness of how to properly treat the problem.&quot;
So how is the disease diagnosed?
Fruchter explains that keratoconus usually develops in adolescence or the late teens (ages 15-16 or 20).
The disease involves a decrease in vision, accompanied by an increase in the cylinder.
Keratoconus patients report distorted and/or blurred vision of figures and objects.
These signs worsen as the disease progresses, which usually develops slowly and gradually over years.
However, the disease may also develop rapidly and reach its peak within just a few months.
Many patients also report increased sensitivity to light.
About three years after the operation in Gaza - the IDF revealed the name of Lt. Col. M.; Bennett: &quot;Now, the people know the face of the hero of Israel&quot;
Mahmoud Khair ad-Din from the village of Hurfeish is a lieutenant colonel who was killed in the operation in Khan Yunis •
Head of Military Intelligence: &quot;The publicity is deserved by him, his family and his children&quot; •
The possibility of publishing the photo of Lt. Col. Emanuel Moreno from Sayeret Matkal will be examined later.
About three and a half years after the operation that went wrong in Khan Yunis, the IDF today allows publication that the person killed in the operation, Lt. Col. M., is the late Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khair ad-Din from the village of Hurfeish in the north.
He was 41 years old when he fell.
Prime Minister Bennett said after the publication: &quot;Three and a half years have passed since the late Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Hir al-Din fell in battle in a secret operation in Khan Yunis, and only now are we allowed to reveal his name and thank him for his contribution and dedication to the security of the state.&quot;
&quot;The late Mahmoud was a fighter in the Paratroopers&#39; Patrol and later rose through the ranks of the army to become a lieutenant colonel in the IDF&#39;s Special Operations Division.
&quot;A hero of Israel who was posthumously decorated with the Chief of Staff&#39;s Medal.&quot;
He added: &quot;I paid my respects to him at his funeral and now the people of Israel have the right to know him, the name and face of the hero of Israel, Lieutenant General Mahmoud Hir al-Din, openly.
The surroundings looked up at him.
Since the operation, the IDF has prohibited the publication of his name for security reasons, and today, after a discussion held by the head of the Intelligence Division, Major General Aharon Haliva, with representatives of the military censorship, and with the consent of his family, it was decided to publish his name and picture.
Mahmoud Khair ad-Din, Hero of Israel, was born on December 28, 1977, in the village of Hurfeish in the Upper Galilee, the eldest son of his parents Ahmed and Nazira, and he has seven brothers and sisters.
He is a member of the Druze community.
He was married to Nahed and had two sons.
He served as an officer, fighter, and commander in the Special Operations Division of the Intelligence Division.
Throughout his life, Khair ad-Din was a social leader, and those around him looked up to him.
He attended school in Kfar Hurfeish until the ninth grade, and then transferred to the military boarding school at the Reali School in Haifa.
In October 1997, he enlisted in the Paratrooper Patrol, and in 2000 he graduated from Officers&#39; School.
In 2002, he was located by the Special Operations Division of the Military Intelligence and transferred to serve there.
While serving, he completed a bachelor&#39;s degree in law from the College of Management and a master&#39;s degree in education and business administration from the University of Haifa.
In 2002, he met his wife, Nahed, and in 2004 they married.
Their first son was born in 2009, a year during which he and his friends founded an association that works to advance the status of the Druze community in Israel.
In 2010, he joined the &quot;Achrai&quot; association and began guiding a group in the village of Hurfeish, after ensuring that the association began operating in the Druze villages to encourage youth to enlist.
In 2013, his second son was born.
The head of the Intelligence Directorate, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: &quot;We have been debating for some time on the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Khair ad-Din, a Hero of Israel.
We completed work and came to the conclusion that there is no security reason to publish his name and picture.
&quot;He, his family and his children deserve it too,&quot; he noted.
&quot;An extraordinary educator and leader&quot;
&quot;Thanks to many operations, he is nothing less than a hero in my eyes,&quot; said Major General Haliva.
&quot;He has made a significant contribution, which includes courage and composure, to the State of Israel.
&quot;He deserves to get the place he deserves.&quot;
And he added: &quot;I didn&#39;t know him personally, but he was an extraordinary educator, mentor, and leader - not only on the operational side, but also in his values.&quot;
Major General Haliva noted that he will later also consider whether to publish the photo of another hero, Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno of the General Staff Patrol, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and whose photo was not permitted for publication.
The operation in Khan Yunis took place on November 11, 2018.
The operation was the culmination of months of meticulous preparations in which the intelligence community took part.
The operation&#39;s command team included the then Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, the then head of Military Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Tamir Heyman, and the then head of the Shin Bet, Nadav Argaman.
The purpose of the operation has not yet been made public, and the IDF emphasized that this was an operation carried out by invaluable intelligence.
But the Arab media subsequently showed communications equipment that the Palestinians said was left behind by the forces.
According to Hamas, the operation was intended to plant listening devices.
According to publications, on the day of the incident, the force traveled in two vehicles.
The fighters were stopped at a checkpoint deployed by Hamas members, and something about their behavior aroused the suspicion of Hamas operatives.
The activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.
The on-site investigation lasted about 45 minutes, during which it became increasingly aggressive.
When the force realized that it was in a problematic situation, Lt. Col. Khair al-Din managed to distract the Hamas men, and in a split second, the force commander, Lt. Col. A, was able to open fire.
The fire killed three Hamas members, and unfortunately also Lt. Col. Khair ad-Din.
Ten months after the difficult event, the Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Aviv Kochavi, decided to accept the recommendation of the Medal of Honor Committee and award the Chief of Staff Medal of Honor to three of the fighters in the incident deep in the Gaza Strip - including the late Lt. Col. Khair a-Din.
The commander of the fighting force and another fighter on the team also received medals.
The army statement said at the time that Lt. Col. M. received the medal for &quot;his activity in the operation with his team, in enemy territory, with determination, composure and courage, in defense of his comrades.&quot;
He subsequently acted with initiative and striving for contact, taking a leading role in taking control of the enemy and acting resourcefully to promote the takeover.
Consider moving from tweezers to a large-scale operation
Israel needs to ask itself, again, whether it is not right to change policy regarding the Jenin sector •
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing this, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set the West Bank ablaze in its wake, but the Jenin militants may leave it no choice.
The stormy weekend we just had shows that even though the month of Ramadan is behind us, the area is still more explosive than ever.
It will take great efforts and common sense to safely cross the two upcoming commemorations: Nakba Day, which falls today (Sunday), and Jerusalem Day, which will be observed in two weeks.
Quite a few factors will stand in the way in an attempt to torpedo a return to sanity.
At their head, as always, are the terrorist elements, who are focusing a special effort in an attempt to preserve the violent atmosphere of recent weeks.
Evidence of this was given during the arrest operation in which the late IDF fighter, Sergeant Major Noam Raz, was killed the day before yesterday.
Fighters who participated in the battle in Jenin testified that they do not remember such a scale of shooting and violence - evidence not only of the enormous amount of weapons in the area, but also of the willingness to use it.
This requires Israel to ask itself, once again, whether it is not right to change policy regarding the Jenin sector, and move from small, intelligence-based tweezers operations to a large-scale, mass-based operation.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing this, fearing that Jenin would ignite and ignite the West Bank and the entire region; even now, the security establishment prefers to act selectively, when necessary, to avoid incendiary attacks, but the Jenin militants may leave it no choice.
To draw lessons for future events.
Raz&#39;s death in battle is the best answer Israel can give to anyone who claims it intentionally killed Al-Jazeera journalist Shirin Abu Aqla.
Operational activity is a dangerous matter for those who participate in it, and for those present at the scene.
The IDF takes enormous risks for its forces to avoid harming innocent people as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it with the lives of fighters.
This indicates high morality, but it also has operational-intelligence value: a terrorist captured alive - as happened the other day in Jenin - is an excellent source of information about weapons, attacks, and other terrorists; this is information that usually cannot be obtained in any other way, and through which future attacks can be thwarted.
The IDF acted correctly when it published the interim investigation it conducted into the death of Abu Aqla on Tuesday, clarifying that it cannot be determined at this stage who caused her death.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful whether it will be possible to reach a clear bottom line in the affair.
In any case, it seems that nothing will convince the convinced: the world has already rushed to condemn Israel without bothering to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terrorism - the original pretext in whose name the IDF is constantly operating in Jenin.
As always, the nature of such stories is to die out.
Global public opinion is busy ripening and moving on, certainly while a much more intense war continues to rage in Ukraine.
Therefore, it is a shame that Israel insisted on giving the affair of Abu Aqla&#39;s death even more unnecessary moments of exposure, with the police&#39;s unsuccessful handling of her funeral.
Even if Abu Aqla&#39;s family did not live up to the initial conclusions, one should have expected a little more restraint from the police officers who accompanied the funeral procession, and certainly less excitement from the Palestinian flags that were flown there.
Responsibility requires: acting to calm the situation.
The Minister of Public Security and the Police Commissioner did well to order an investigation into the incident.
It seems that he lacked sufficient preparation and clear instructions, but it is disturbing that this is the second time this has happened to the police in a short time, and in two different districts.
In the Dizengoff attack, the police also failed in managing the incident, isolating the scene, and handling the media.
The investigative committee would do well not to be satisfied with merely analyzing the police officers&#39; conduct at the funeral itself, but also to draw lessons and conclusions that will enable more successful handling of similar events in the future.
Along with the internal handling of the police, it is also necessary to consider the conduct of elected officials who have lost their way and direction.
There are currently several members serving in the Israeli Knesset who pose a danger to democracy.
They are found on the left and the right, and exploit their immunity not to challenge the state, but to harm it.
MK Ofer Kassif is the latest example of this; if no steps are taken against him - including prosecution for assaulting a police officer - the state will implicitly encourage the next elected official to further radicalize his actions.
Such moves, which are a form of defensive democracy, are essential in the explosiveness of this period, with elements in the background seeking to exploit the situation for political purposes.
Anyone with common sense is expected to rise above all of this and act to calm the situation; otherwise, Israel could quickly slide into escalation against external enemies, and worse - against domestic rivals.
Senior police officer: &quot;Government policy and goal-setting are needed here&quot;
The Israel Police has launched an operation to eradicate the phenomenon of illegal residents, but there is still a long way to go.
&quot;Today, there is no single factor in the State of Israel that encompasses this entire issue.&quot;
&quot;If we want to address the phenomenon of illegal residents, a government policy is required, from which goals, tasks, and responsibilities must be derived.
&quot;Today, there is no single factor in the State of Israel that encompasses this entire issue,&quot; a senior police officer tells Israel Hayom.
Until a month and a half ago, before the escalation in the security situation, the phenomenon was expressed in about 20 to 30 thousand refugees entering daily through the breaches in the fence.
In addition, between 100,000 and 110,000 Palestinians with work permits enter Israel every day to work through 34 controlled crossings.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each sector is limited by a quota determined by the political echelon according to the security, economic, and political situation in the State of Israel.
Permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Administration.
In light of this, a Sheba is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is prohibited due to criminal involvement or connection to terrorist attacks, but in many cases these are Palestinians whose entry is prohibited because they do not meet the permitted permit quota.
It should be emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff, and Elad were considered members of the Israeli Security Service, but they were not monitored, because they had not previously committed any criminal offense that required security officials to monitor their movements.
&quot;Therefore, their entry through the breaches in the fence is meaningless,&quot; says a senior security official. &quot;Anyone who wants to carry out an attack can also enter the country through the controlled crossings, and there have been such cases in the past.&quot;
Thousands of arrests
Following the attack in Elad and in light of numerous warnings of attacks, the police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal residents.
By the end of the week, about 16,000 Shebahim had been arrested.
Of these, about 600 were investigated and criminal cases were opened against them, and about 200 were imprisoned.
According to police prosecution policy, proceedings against illegal residents are only carried out against habitual criminals or people who repeat the act repeatedly (recidivists).
An illegal resident arrested for the first time is interrogated, documented, and returned to the territories.
Sometimes this happens a second time, but only the third time is he arrested, imprisoned, and indicted for illegal residence.
According to the law, if an illegal resident is caught within 50 to 100 meters of either side of the separation fence, he is handled by the military prosecution.
Data received by &quot;Israel Hayom&quot; indicates that in 2021, 40,010 illegal residents, drivers, and overnighters were handled by the police.
7,405 illegal residents were arrested and criminal cases were opened against 19,533.
The number of employers, drivers, and carriers handled by the police in 2021 was 6,537.
469 were arrested, and criminal cases were opened against 5,640.
&quot;The foundations of the Shabachim phenomenon do not depend on the police, nor on the IDF, nor on Israeli society, nor on Palestinian society.&quot;
&quot;They depend on other factors,&quot; says a senior law enforcement official.
&quot;To address the phenomenon, their motivation to go to work in Israel must be eroded, and the Israeli side must charge them a price that will prevent them from crossing the fence.&quot;
Sources involved in the matter claim that the failure to collect the price stems, among other things, from a lack of prison space and the fact that arrests are only made when there are associated offenses or when the person is a recidivist.
Legal sources claim that the decision to charge a fee from the Israeli Security Service only starting from his third arrest was made, among other things, because the courts cannot cope with the number of arrests that are made every day.
&quot;Anyone who examines the punishment will discover that it is not a deterrent.&quot;
There is great complexity.
&quot;Sheba,&quot; says a police source, &quot;is a complex person.&quot;
He could be a father of a family who enters the country to work to earn a few shekels and return.
This is the basic platform, and it is used by many types of &quot;shamers&quot; who enter the country to commit criminal offenses or terrorist attacks.
A defendant can be an adult or a minor.
In the past, the police have caught illegal residents as young as 16, and even children as young as 8 and 10, who are sent by their parents to road junctions to earn a few shekels a day from driving.
&quot;It also makes the matter complicated, because in such cases we have to bring the parents and file charges against them for neglect,&quot; says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel in manual labor.
The most unusual are electrical work or advanced construction work.
In the past, there were also local authorities that employed garbage collectors to remove trash, mainly in the north.
Out of 34 crossings, there are about 18 main crossings.
There are crossings for vehicles and goods, there are crossings through which only people pass, and there are crossings that are both.
All crossings are supervised by the IDF and the Crossings Authority.
The Shabachim are usually driven into the country by private drivers, as it is easy money.
&quot;There are those who do this for a living, and there are gangs whose main occupation is transporting &quot;shabhim&quot;,&quot; says a senior police officer. &quot;Usually, most of them are Israeli Arabs, who speak the same language and correspond with them.&quot;
This can range from 100 shekels to 300 shekels per person.
&quot;Registered companies don&#39;t do this, because if the company gets caught, it&#39;s doomed to shut down.&quot;
The police emphasize that under certain conditions, transporting a stolen vehicle can be considered a crime.
&quot;A taxi driver who works with licenses in accordance with licensing and insurance, who picks up Palestinians at arranged points and at fixed times, including an arranged reservation, is not breaking the law,&quot; says a senior police officer. &quot;Anyone who knows he is transporting Palestinians usually picks them up in the dead of night at hidden points, including dropping them off at hidden points.&quot;
&quot;Most of these guys drive with a used car because they know their car will be confiscated, so they prefer to drive in an old car.&quot;

&quot;A criminal investigation should be opened against her&quot;: Haifa City Comptroller on serious allegations against Einat Kalisch Rotem
The city comptroller&#39;s report presents alleged concerns about criminal conduct by Dr. Einat Kalisch Rotem against former senior city officials and political opponents: surveillance of employees and inflated payment to an accounting firm for conducting investigations •
&quot;The difficult findings emerging from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation&quot; •
No response was provided from the Haifa Municipality.
Surveillance of municipal employees and political opponents and inflated payments to an accounting firm for conducting investigations, &quot;at the expense of the public purse.&quot;
Haifa Municipality Comptroller Ofer Tal&#39;s report, published yesterday (Tuesday), presents apparent concerns about criminal offenses by Mayor Dr. Einat Kalisch Rotem against former senior officials in the municipality, municipal employees, and political opponents.
According to suspicion, Kalish met with the accounting firm Barlev &amp; Co. and requested an investigative audit.
The investigations were conducted under names and codes given to the former city treasurer, and a code name given to council member Sophie Nakash, and examined whether the tenders between the city and a company owned by Nakash&#39;s family were strictly kosher.
The auditor&#39;s report also shows that there is complete disarray and lack of control over the work of the accountant with whom Klish met.
The municipal treasurer is the municipal official whose job it is to coordinate and synchronize the work of the accountant and the municipal departments, and the data collected by the accountant was not transferred to him.
This has resulted in no one in the municipality being aware of all the projects being carried out by the accountant, and the scope of work required in each of them.
Moreover, the time reports submitted by the accountant were in many cases not approved as required.
A situation arose in which the scope of issues in which the accountant was involved grew disproportionately, with great interference in the municipality&#39;s routine conduct, without any supervision or monitoring by the municipality.
In conclusion of the report, the audit recommended that the outstanding payments to the auditor be stopped until material detailing his work on each of the issues he examined is received.
In addition, invoices submitted to the Haifa Municipality were under codes such as &quot;gatekeepers&quot;, information store, fish store, investigative audit for the mayor, and procurement investigative audit report.
Shortly thereafter, the municipality&#39;s attorney, attorney Yamit Klein, noted that the mayor herself signed the payment authorization on her behalf.
&quot;It was not commissioned by any audit report and I have no idea what it is about,&quot; she wrote.
It was also learned that the cost of the investigative audit is approximately two million shekels, of which one and a half million shekels have been paid, leaving approximately half a million shekels to be paid, from the tax money of the Haifa public.
Former municipal treasurer, Jackie Wakim, responded: &quot;These despicable actions were carried out to tarnish my name and the name of elected officials at the expense of the public purse and the Haifa taxpayer, and are a criminal offense.&quot;
City Council member Sophie Nakash responded: &quot;The auditor&#39;s report and the committee&#39;s recommendations speak for themselves.&quot;
Response from lawyer Sarit Golan, member of the Haifa City Council: &quot;The testimonies and difficult findings emerging from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in using the consultant for investigative review to conduct investigations, some of which are questionable as to whether they are permitted by law in the manner in which they were conducted, and in particular the investigations concerning the council member from the opposition to the mayor and former senior employees.&quot;
Lior Detz&#39;s response from the &quot;Shomrei Hasaf&quot; association: &quot;It seems that all the red lines have been crossed that a public authority is sending investigators to collect information against lawyers representing an association that exposes corruption, while the association is conducting public proceedings against the Haifa municipality administration.&quot;
The Haifa Municipality did not respond.
The accounting firm of Yehuda Barlev is not interested in commenting.
Gantz revealed: &quot;Iran and Hezbollah worked together to harm UNIFIL&#39;s activities in Lebanon&quot;
The Defense Minister participated in the international cyber conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that &quot;Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their methods of operation&quot; •
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of al-Sayed in Hamas captivity: &quot;A video aimed at blackmail – on the back of a humanitarian issue&quot; •
Deputy Commander of Unit 8200 Reveals: &quot;We Thwarted the Attempt to Poison the Water Systems&quot;
Defense Minister Benny Gantz spoke this morning (Wednesday) at the International Cyber Conference of the Cyber Center at Tel Aviv University, where he revealed a joint attack by Iran and Hezbollah to harm UNIFIL forces in Lebanon, &quot;another attack by Iran and Hezbollah on the citizens of Lebanon and the stability of the country,&quot; Gantz said.
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of Hisham al-Sayed, a Hamas prisoner in Gaza, who was released by the terrorist organization&#39;s military wing: &quot;Yesterday, a video was published that aims to blackmail - on the back of a humanitarian issue.
Hamas is holding the four boys captive in violation of international law, in violation of morality.
&quot;Hamas is responsible for this and our expectation from the international community is to act against this criminal behavior by Hamas.&quot;
He added that &quot;the State of Israel is working with a variety of means, and continues to turn every stone in order to return the boys home.&quot;
As we have said before – this is a humanitarian issue, that is how we see it, and we will continue to act on this basis.
&quot;Extortion attempts and mind exercises will not affect our position and conduct.&quot;
He later revealed joint activity between Iran and Hezbollah: &quot;Iran also operates its proxies in the cyber dimension: I can reveal today that recently activity by Iranian security bodies in collaboration with Hezbollah was detected to harm the activities of UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.
This was done by implementing a cyber operation whose goal was to steal materials about UNIFIL&#39;s deployment in the region, and for their use by Hezbollah.
&quot;This is another attack by Iran and Hezbollah on the citizens of Lebanon and on the stability of Lebanon.&quot;
&quot;Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their methods of operation.
&quot;In recent years, we have seen a phenomenon of hacker groups on behalf of Iran, operating against Israel and other countries,&quot; Gantz continued.
&quot;The &#39;new proxies&#39; are terrorists with a keyboard who are treated like fighters from other terrorist organizations.
We know who they are, we harm them and their senders, and today they are still in our sights – and not just in the cyber dimension.
No attack against Israeli citizens will be on the agenda.
And the responsibility lies with the attackers and the state that finances and sends them.
&quot;A cyber attack can be responded to in a variety of ways in cyberspace and other spaces.&quot;
Gantz continued his attack on the nuclear power: &quot;Iran leads cyber terrorism - and makes moves aimed at influencing democratic processes and governments, as happened in the US presidential elections and in other attempts that Israel is aware of.
&quot;Operations like that of the &#39;Shahid Kawah&#39; unit, which collected information on ships, gas stations, and industrial plants in several countries, were carried out under direct directives from the Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards, as revealed in the investigations.&quot;
He added that &quot;in recent years we have thwarted many attempts to break into private and public companies, in Israel and abroad.&quot;
&quot;I also call on the public to demand &#39;cyber responsibility&#39; and to punish companies and entities that do not act in accordance with the guidelines.&quot;
Gantz continued by outlining Israel&#39;s next goals in the face of threats: &quot;Our supreme mission, in the army, in the industries and in the various security organizations, is to build the people, train them, and keep them.
The Chief of Staff and I have placed this issue as one of the central tasks in the relevant units.
We are constantly examining the construction of the force - both in terms of manpower, training, and missions.
&quot;In the coming years, we will also need to examine the form of organization, management, and operation of cyber warfare, with its offensive and defensive characteristics in the IDF and the entire defense system.&quot;
Finally, the Minister of Defense concluded and called for cooperation with the world: &quot;Our cooperation with the world against Iran is of great importance, also in the cyber dimension.
&quot;The same cooperation we are building in the region with Iran in aspects of defense against various threats - we are also expanding it to the cyber dimension.&quot;
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: &quot;We foiled the attempt to poison the water systems.&quot;
Uri, deputy commander of Unit 8200, said in the unit&#39;s first public appearance at conferences of this type, revealing that Israel had foiled an attack on the water systems.
&quot;Thwarting cyber threats is a central part of our activities.
&quot;Our goal is to gain superiority over the attacker, to be able to identify him and act to negate his capabilities,&quot; said the deputy commander of 8200, adding, &quot;This way, we sometimes also find victims outside of Israel, and then we establish contact with other agencies if necessary.&quot;
We do this both independently and by collaborating with industry and other agencies, through the implementation and use of tools we have developed.
&quot;8200 will not rest until the threat is removed.&quot;
As mentioned, this is how a threat to Israel&#39;s water systems and attempts to poison Israeli citizens were exposed: &quot;We foiled the attempt to take control of Israel&#39;s critical water systems and poison them several years ago.
In another case, we also identified that a certain adversary attacked Israel and in the process identified that the same attacker also attempted to target power plants in the US.
This was the first indication of this attack.
We were able to prevent this threat through close cooperation with our American partners.&quot;
Watch: This is how the police prepare to eliminate terrorists among the civilian population
Jerusalem Border Police inaugurates new &quot;Asaf&quot; facility that simulates shooting in a crowded crowd in response to the series of attacks that have occurred in recent months •
Border Police&#39;s anti-terrorism guide wraps around Jerusalem: &quot;The development provides a relevant response to the threats and simulates the reality on the ground&quot; •
A look at the &quot;Asaf&quot; facility
Preparing for the next attack: A series of terrorist attacks carried out in the spring by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, during which 19 people were murdered and about 70 civilians were injured, led the Border Guard to develop a unique technique that trains fighters to attack terrorists within a civilian population and carry out shooting in motion.
Israel Hayom unveiling: A look at the &quot;Asaf&quot; facility
Popular terrorism focuses on harming civilians and aims to undermine the sense of security necessary for a civilian population to lead a normal life.
The severe wave of attacks that occurred this year, with attacks in Be&#39;er Sheva, Hadera, Bnei Brak, Ariel, Elad, and especially the one that occurred in early April on busy Dizengoff Street in the heart of Tel Aviv, by a terrorist who blended into a crowd, led the police to think creatively to develop a tool that would allow them to train fighters to attack terrorists within a civilian population.
The thinking process was led by the Police and Border Guard Training Division.
These were entered into a competition in the various police districts under the title &quot;Commanders Lead Learning,&quot; in which each district was required to develop measures that would help improve the policing and combat skills of fighters, police officers, and commanders.
As part of the competition, and in response to the need to train Border Guard soldiers to fight in moving shooting training and in scenarios of this type, Assaf Ben David, a counter-terrorism instructor for the Jerusalem Border Guard, developed the &quot;Asaf Device,&quot; which consists of a dynamic target, which is attached to a telescopic rod on which a carrier is mounted that can be harnessed to the instructor.
Their servant who guides the bearer to our death, he can practice the warrior standing before him by controlling and moving the target to different sides and ranges.
It should be emphasized that in recent years, Border Guard soldiers have dealt with many terrorist attacks in which the attacker carries out shooting and poses a threat while moving in areas saturated with innocent civilians.
The &quot;Asaf Facility&quot;, in its current version, is based on components and parts that are used in various fields.
For example, the telescopic pole that was upgraded and integrated into the facility was taken from the field of maintenance and cleaning.
Using the facility, it is possible to simulate shooting on the move within a civilian population towards a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the object, handling a traffic stop, choosing a path of progress, and executing selective shooting, including practicing preventing harm to uninvolved people.
Sergeant Major Assaf Ben David, after whom the facility is named, says: &quot;The facility we developed is a breakthrough in the learning and training of soldiers and police officers.
The development provides a relevant response to the threats of attribution and simulates the reality on the ground.
&quot;The benefit of development compared to the relatively cheap production cost gives us a significant competitive advantage.&quot;
State Comptroller warns: &quot;The Central Elections Committee is not prepared for cyber threats&quot;
Matanyahu Engelman warned during International Cyber Week about Israel&#39;s lack of preparedness for hacker attacks •
&quot;World War III will be a war of hackers, but the world is not prepared for it.&quot;
State Comptroller Matanyahu Engelman participated today (Wednesday) in Tel Aviv University&#39;s annual cyber conference and expressed concern about cyber attacks on Israel.
&quot;We are exposed.&quot;
Our data is visible to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our health is exposed, our security is exposed.
&quot;World War III will be a cyber war, but the world is not ready for it.&quot;
Engelman said that as part of the cyber audits his office conducts, significant deficiencies were found: &quot;In the past year, we have conducted penetration tests at the Jerusalem Traffic Management Center, in hospitals, and in the Tax Authority&#39;s systems.
During the audits, we found significant deficiencies, including the fact that very few penetration tests were performed by public bodies and some only conducted penetration tests during the audit.
In addition, deficiencies emerged in the Central Elections Committee&#39;s preparedness for cyber threats.&quot;
&quot;We at the State Comptroller&#39;s Office are committed to continuing to address this significant issue with greater intensity, for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world,&quot; he concluded.
Aiming high: &quot;I came to Hapoel Jerusalem to win titles&quot;
The choice for the Reds: &quot;From the first moment they showed me that they wanted me, I am built to lead a great team&quot; •
Returning to the Israeli national team after four years: &quot;I felt I had a place, wanted to be on the EuroBasket squad&quot; •
And the time at Maccabi Tel Aviv: &quot;I learned to concentrate only on what was within my control&quot; •
Oz Blazer in an interview.
Oz Blazer will leave today with the Israeli national team players for Poland, where they will meet the local team in the 2023 World Cup qualifiers (Thursday, 9:30 PM Israel time).
Three days later, the team will host Estonia at the Shlomo Team Hall.
In parallel with the intensive training with the national team, Blazer also dealt with his future over the past week, until he signed a two-year contract with Hapoel Jerusalem.
&quot;I have a calm head now that I&#39;ve found a team,&quot; he tells Israel Hayom in his first and special interview since signing.
&quot;I have a little pressure now because I have to move with my family after we settled in the central area, and it&#39;s not easy, but there are no more phones and professionally I&#39;m much calmer.&quot;
You haven&#39;t been on the team for four years, how happy are you to be back, and how much do you want to play in the next two games?
&quot;First of all, I want to have fun on the team and I come with the attitude of contributing in whatever way I can, whether it&#39;s from my experience or on the field.
Of course I would love to play, but when you get to the team, everyone has to put their ego aside and do everything they can to make the team successful.
&quot;I&#39;m here for whatever they need from me.&quot;
Now you are 14 players, and for the European Championship, Danny Avdiya will join, Gabi Chachashvili will return, and there may be other changes.
Did you set a goal to be on the championship squad?
&quot;I would love to be on the field and contribute.&quot;
The 29-year-old Blazer (1.99 m) has played for Maccabi Tel Aviv for the past two years.
When the season ended, it was clear that he would not continue in yellow, and after a few weeks he moved to the capital, preferring the Jerusalem team over Hapoel Holon.
You had other offers, why did you choose Hapoel Jerusalem?
&quot;They showed great willingness to have me there, so negotiations were relatively easy.&quot;
As soon as I felt a connection with the management and the coach, I realized this was the right place for me.
The situation also seems good and appropriate to me.
I come to lead and be a significant part of the team.
I spoke with the coach and he has a mentality of hard work and winning, and that&#39;s exactly what I bring.
I&#39;ve always loved playing in the arena, because I get energy even when the crowd is against me, and now that they&#39;re on my side it&#39;ll be even better.
I&#39;m sure it will be a committed and fun group and I wanted to be a part of it.&quot;
Expand a little on your conversation with Coach Dzikic.
&quot;Professionally, he believes in a lot of movement without the ball, he plans to bring in good morale with a high basketball IQ and wants a very intense team.&quot;
He believes in high energy in defense and offense, and with the crowd in the arena, it can succeed.&quot;
I looked at your career and saw that you stayed with each team for at least two years, if not more.
Do you feel like you can stay in Jerusalem for a few years?
&quot;Everywhere I go I like to connect and give my all, and people appreciate that.
From the moment I signed in Jerusalem, my phone didn&#39;t stop ringing and beeping.
I have received many messages already waiting for me.
So I believe we have a good time ahead of us.&quot;
Do you think you could be a more significant player in Jerusalem than in Maccabi Tel Aviv?
How do you summarize your two years at Maccabi Tel Aviv?
&quot;Unfortunately, there were things that were out of my control last season.
Everyone saw that I remained a professional throughout, and no matter how much I received - I always gave it my all.
&quot;I&#39;m proud of the path I&#39;ve taken in the past year, and now everyone goes their own way.&quot;
If it were up to you, would you want to stay at Maccabi?
&quot;After the last year, it was clear to both parties that we were heading towards a separation, but that&#39;s part of the business.
Towards the end of the season, I was a bit hit by minutes and my status dropped, even though I had a great time in the middle of the year, but they decided to go in other directions.
After I understood the situation there, I realized that it was less of a place for me.
&quot;Hapoel Jerusalem is the best option for me, so I chose it.&quot;
Finally, what are your goals for the upcoming season?
&quot;There was a lot of talk about what happened in the semi-finals of the cup last season when I shouted to Ami Biton (the team manager at Maccabi Tel Aviv - Y.M.), &#39;This is what I&#39;m here for,&#39; so that&#39;s what I came to Jerusalem for - to win titles.&quot;
Wade Baldwin may join Maccabi Tel Aviv
The Yellows are in talks with last season&#39;s Baskonia star (26, 1.93 m) and hope to add him to complete the back line ahead of the 2022/23 season.
Is Maccabi Tel Aviv on its way to a glittering acquisition?
Guard Wade Baldwin may join the Yellows and complete Oded Katash&#39;s back line ahead of the 2022/2023 season.
Baldwin (26, 1.93 m) played last season for Baskonia and averaged impressive 14.1 points, 4.4 assists and 3.6 rebounds per game.
Before that, he played for Bayern Munich and Olympiacos, and also played in the NBA.
If signed, Baldwin would join Alex Poythers, Guy Panini, Darren Hilliard, Austin Hollins and Bonzie Colson who already signed earlier this summer.
Rafi Manko and Josh Nibo have also closed and are expected to officially sign soon.
First announcement: Will Adam Ariel move to Hapoel Tel Aviv?
The Reds are interested in signing the 27-year-old forward if he is released from Hapoel Jerusalem •
Raz Adam may be loaned to Ness Ziona Municipal •
In Jerusalem, they decided not to exercise Retin Obasanjo&#39;s option.
Hapoel Tel Aviv is exploring the possibility of signing Adam Ariel if he is released from Hapoel Jerusalem.
As you may recall, a few days ago we announced that the 27-year-old forward&#39;s future at the Jerusalem club is in doubt and the team may exercise the option to release him, with a final decision to be made in the coming days.
Now it turns out that if he does not continue in the capital, Hapoel Tel Aviv will try to sign him to its ranks.
And in Jerusalem, the club&#39;s leaders decided not to exercise the option in Retin Obasanjo&#39;s contract for another season and informed him of his release from the team.
Meanwhile, guard Raz Adam may be loaned to Ness Ziona after requesting to leave the Reds to receive more playing time.
Maccabi Tel Aviv announced: Novatus Miroshi sold to Belgian Zulte
The 19-year-old Tanzanian international midfielder, who joined the youth department in the 2020/21 season, will play next season for Zulte Waregem of the Belgian league.
Maccabi Tel Aviv announced this evening (Tuesday) that they have reached an agreement with Zulte Wargam of the Belgian league regarding the sale of Novatus Mirushi.
The 19-year-old Tanzanian international midfielder joined Maccabi Tel Aviv&#39;s youth department in the 2020/21 season and played 14 games for the youth team.
Last season, 2021/22, Mirushi was loaned to Beitar Tel Aviv Bat Yam in Media, scoring a goal in 26 appearances.
It should be noted that Mirushi is a member of the Tanzanian senior national team, scoring 2 goals in 8 international appearances.
The sparkling acquisition: Wade Baldwin signed with Maccabi Tel Aviv
The Yellows are getting closer to completing the roster: A star at Ascona last season (26, 1.93 m) is expected to officially sign soon and join Oded Katash&#39;s back line.
Maccabi Tel Aviv is on the way to a sparkling acquisition: Guard Wade Baldwin has finalized his terms and is expected to officially sign soon and complete Oded Katash&#39;s back line ahead of the 2022/2023 season.

All or nothing: 1:1 between Hapoel Jerusalem and Hapoel Hadera
Guy Hadida scored an own goal in the 33rd minute but managed to equalize 10 minutes later •
Later, the midfielder was sent off with a questionable red card (74) •
Hadera also remained with ten players following Edom thanks to Ido Levy (87)
Hapoel Jerusalem&#39;s professional team counted the number of foreigners on the field at Teddy Stadium this evening (Saturday), more than once, it should be noted, and at a certain point they even discovered one player less (Guy Hadida was sent off).
This time, fortunately for them, everything went well, and the 1:1 they achieved against Hapoel Hadera would not be taken away from them by the association&#39;s court.
Before Hadida received a red card, he managed to score an own goal and equalize to secure a valuable point for Ziv Aryeh.
Already in the 33rd minute, Guy Hadida&#39;s private show began.
Plenkoshchenko lifted the ball into the box, and the midfielder rose and hit it back, stopping the ball in his team&#39;s net.
0:1 to Hadera, who benefited from an own goal by the midfielder.
Ten minutes after the own goal, Hadida managed to make amends and it was huge - Levkovich caught his breath and this time the midfielder hit the right, open net.
1:1 in Teddy.
In the 74th minute, Hadida also managed to earn a second yellow and a red card, this time after sliding towards Marmantini.
Daniel Bar Nathan decided on a questionable red and sent the midfielder straight to an early shower.
In the 87th minute, Bar Natan also sent Ido Levy to the red card, balancing the balance of power on the pitch as well.
Recovery Department: Eilat defeated Holon
60:85
Ariel Beit Halachmi&#39;s team recorded a third consecutive victory, this time especially impressive •
Huber and Schuchman (15th) excelled
Hapoel Eilat&#39;s recovery journey continued tonight (Saturday) with an impressive 60:85 victory over Hapoel Holon on the way to a 3:0 record for the season in meetings between the two.
Since dropping to last place, Ariel Beit Halachmi&#39;s team has already won three consecutive games, and in fact this is a surprise only for those who did not predict the game.
We haven&#39;t seen Holon this bad in a long time.
All this before the series opener against Besiktas in the Champions Cup play-in: only 60 points, a first half without three-pointers and 11 percent from three in the entire game.
Bottom line, an unimpressive evening for all the team&#39;s players (except Murphy Manko, who scored Holon&#39;s 3 three-pointers), including the safe bet Chris Johnson.
On the other side, Eilat is in very good shape thanks to Roy Huber and Joaquin Schucman (15 points, 21).
The former has regained his composure recently, and the latter has returned to flourish and also stunned with a basket from three quarters of the field.
Give them a chance: Maccabi Tel Aviv&#39;s Israelis saved Sforopoulos
After a derby loss and an eighth in a row in Europe, a Clasico defeat against Jerusalem would likely end the long romance between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Greek coach.
So who does Giannis have to send a bouquet of flowers to tonight?
To his Israeli team, who was responsible for 42 critical points in the arena •
And also: Why the Yellow Club needs to change its &#39;Americanization strategy&#39; and take a living example from Ariel Beit Halachmi&#39;s model in Eilat
It&#39;s hard to remain cynical at the sight of the teary eyes and the warm and strong hugs that Yannis Sforopoulos gave his players at the end of tonight&#39;s game at the Arena, and especially in the face of the tight embrace and exchange of secrets with John DiBartholomew, who single-handedly saved the Greek coach&#39;s job, and perhaps the entire season.
Because after a home loss in the derby and an eighth consecutive loss in Europe, losing in the Clasico to Jerusalem and staying away from it for three wins in the table?
That would have ended the Israeli-Greek affair tonight.
So for now, he&#39;s with us, and he has a lot to learn from this game, also and actually mainly about the Euroleague.
First, Maccabi Tel Aviv arrived with a radical change in their attacking and ball-moving habits.
The ball moved with dedication, with a lot of movement and drills, and Scotty Wilbekin, in a demonstrative manner, left the job of concentration to Evans, dribbling very little, and mainly going over blocks and going for shots.
Despite shooting very poorly (2-9 from the field), Wilbekin contributed defensively, and most importantly, Maccabi suddenly looked like a team, and the other players scored.
However, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in the brain, the team returned to old habits, and the attacks reverted to dribbling and shelling, and in the most critical attack, with a 2-point lead and 40 seconds to go, Scotty dribbled himself into a half-corner and threw a floater on one leg that almost lost the game.
The trick is to continue playing drills and passing movements precisely in the clutch moments, and this must become part of the team&#39;s nature and DNA.
The important learning will be done by Giannis and the club regarding the use of Israelis.
Those who became water pumps and towel wavers at European games.
Tonight, they scored more than half of the team&#39;s points (42 out of 83) for the coach who stopped believing in them, and were the ones who kept the game alive at the end.
Four of Maccabi&#39;s top five scorers were Israelis.
And don&#39;t say Israel is not Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can also help in the Euroleague.
In the first half, it was mainly Oz Blazer, who the section has been crying out for a month that he needs to play more.
A scorer, a passer, a fighter under the basket (7 rebounds), 2 meters of defensive determination and game intelligence.
Isn&#39;t that enough?
The second half featured Jake Cohen, with excellent percentages from all ranges, composure from the line, and coverage for Zizic&#39;s injury, and especially John Dee, who, with Jerusalem up 70:63, changed the momentum with 5 consecutive points.
Giannis has a complex relationship with Yiftach Ziv, and it seems that sometimes he gives him too much credit and burdens him too much, to the point of risking loss.
It also happens in the Euroleague, and it happened tonight too.
But the important learning should be for the club, regarding its Americanization strategy.
Fact: Senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.
Tomer Ginat and Yam Madar went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Rafi Manko returned to Holon, and now Noam Dovrat is choosing Jerusalem, or perhaps he was rejected by Maccabi.
And this is happening because Maccabi is gradually leaving fewer places for Israelis, due to the club&#39;s informed and fundamental choice to base itself on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where there will be no Israelis who want to play for it, and then it will look for Jewish children to naturalize, and pressure the management/union to further increase the number of foreigners.
But this is a fatal mistake for the club.
And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that it is overdoing it with foreigners, largely because of the tax reduction.
Of course, we are not claiming that the Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.
So instead of spending the same money on one star and eight mediocre ones, you can have five excellent ones.
For example, this season, with the money of Williams, Nunnally, Evans, Reynolds, and Taylor, it was possible to bring in two stars (a star center and a super forward) who are effective and stable next to Scotty and Zizic.
It will be more effective, it will be more correct, it will be more Israeli, it will be more beautiful and interesting and will create identification.
It&#39;s true that there are two busy schedules and a long season - so you have to trust your Israelis.
And also because you are an Israeli group, which claims to represent Israel, and even receives tax breaks from the state for its supposed representation in Europe.
The Basketball Association/League Administration can help Maccabi, and return to sanity with a number of foreigners adapted to the Israeli league.
6 Brewsters, 4 in form, maximum three on the field at the same time.
Is it because of the ongoing failed achievements (for seven years in Europe), just for Maccabi, that the league is flooded with foreigners?
And the players&#39; organization, what about you?
Is that why you went on strike?
There were two Israelis on the field, and now there&#39;s one?
Like George Costanza in the Seinfeld pilot.
Bargain to get less?
The previous Russian law was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for Maccabi.
And if anyone needed reinforcement in the aforementioned direction, Hapoel Eilat came in the preliminary game and explained it so beautifully.
With 3 foreigners, and 4 more Israelis who were only second in the youth teams (Huber, Ben Moshe, Rowena and Shuchman the Warrior), they dismantled Holon (second in the table!) for the second time in the last two weeks.
It&#39;s a tradition in Eilat to play well with three strangers, because there was such a run even during the days of Dan Shamir and a lot during the days of Sharon Drucker.
The short Eilat is simply a more balanced and efficient team, and there is no one like Ariel Beit Halachmi, who started on the open courts in Givat Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everyone is at their peak, everyone is playing together, and all Israelis are learning and improving their game.
The foreigners are just complementing.
When Ben Carter and Casey Prather return from knee injuries, this will be a formidable team.
A song I dreamed about Eilat.
And Maccabi can learn from him about the right direction.
Yellow celebrations: &quot;There was a feeling that the whole world was against us&quot;
The Yellows are happy after the 78:83 win over Hapoel Jerusalem at the Arena: &quot;We are back to playing the way Maccabi Tel Aviv should play&quot; •
About Ami Biton&#39;s conversation in the locker room, the first optimistic diagnosis of Zizic&#39;s injury and the management&#39;s approval for the acquisition.
There is a great sense of relief this morning (Sunday) among the Maccabi Tel Aviv team after yesterday&#39;s important and prestigious 78:83 win over Hapoel Jerusalem in the Arena.
The team&#39;s players and management members hugged coach Yannis Sforopoulos, who seemed very excited at the end.
Yiftach Ziv and Oz Blazer enthusiastically poured water on Derrick Williams, who was outstanding in the game, and the rest of the club also smiled big smiles of happiness that showed how much pressure had been released after the recent losing streak.
They too feared defeat against the great rival, which would further undermine the system.
The fans also stayed in the stands for long minutes to celebrate.
&quot;There is an amazing connection between Giannis and me in the locker room,&quot; said Oz Blazer.
&quot;We know that the situation was not easy for him either, a lot of pressure was released.
We were really looking forward to it, even in the way we played.
We are back to playing the way Maccabi Tel Aviv should play, with heart and fighting, we stand behind it.
He gave us motivational talks and talked to us.&quot;
Before the game, team manager Ami Biton entered the locker room and delivered moving remarks to the players.
&quot;His words had a great influence on how we performed and how we played on the court,&quot; Maccabi players said.
Despite the great joy, Maccabi is already focusing on the important game against Baskonia on Thursday and wants to break the long losing streak in the Euroleague.
&quot;I believe this game will change the momentum for us,&quot; Blazer added.
&quot;We lost a lot of games at the end, and this time they led with a few minutes to go and we didn&#39;t break.&quot;
&quot;In the last few games we were under a lot of pressure, Giannis told us that if we were relaxed we would win these games.
I believe this victory will take us forward.
&quot;A lot of eyes were on us and it felt like the whole world was against us. I&#39;m proud to go to this war. We cut off everything around us and only look at ourselves.&quot;
Ante Zizic, who injured his right knee during the last quarter, was examined by the medical staff in the locker room and the initial diagnosis was not serious.
The doctors will check how the knee will react today and then it will be determined how many days of rest he will need to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will be fit for Baskonia.
In addition to the strong support given by management to Sforopoulos and the professional team, in a meeting held on Thursday, professional manager Nikola Vujicic was given the green light to bring in one or two players to strengthen the team, and the Yellows hope to add a quality acquisition soon.

About four months after signing with Hapoel Jerusalem, Anthony Bennett was released from the team&#39;s roster today (Sunday).
The forward (28, 2.03), who was selected first overall in the 2013 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, recorded 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five games in the Champions League as well as 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in eight games in the Premier League.
&quot;Hapoel Jerusalem and player Anthony Bennett announce that they have reached a joint decision to terminate the player&#39;s contract with the club,&quot; the club said. &quot;Anthony has entered the hearts of all of us and we would like to thank him for his time at Hapoel.
We wish him only good and success.&quot;
Research states: Zoom meetings harm creativity
About 2,100 engineers and academics around the world were asked to develop solutions to the problem – some in video meetings, some in face-to-face meetings •
The result: Virtual meetings hurt creativity and outside-the-box thinking •
Research leader at Columbia University: &quot;Visual focus on the screen impairs the idea generation process&quot; •
Nechama Forta: There is no harm to work productivity or critical thinking.
A large scientific study recently published in the scientific journal Nature examined the effect of meetings via video software on the creativity of participants, compared to meetings held face-to-face.
Unfortunately, it has been found that creativity is indeed compromised in virtual meetings via screens.
The research question - led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University - was whether remote meetings via computer preserve the creativity that exists in office brainstorming sessions, or whether the level of creativity and free thinking decreases as a result of the distance.
The research itself began in 2016 but received a major boost in the two years of the coronavirus, during which many employees moved to work from home.
&quot;People in an in-person meeting move around the room, use objects, and use them for creative thinking,&quot; says Brooks.
&quot;In a computer meeting, on the other hand, concentration on maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative activity in the brain.
Visual focus on the screen reduces cognition.
&quot;People are more focused on video when interacting, which hurts the broader, more expansive idea generation process.&quot;
Space is shrinking.
To examine the results of the experiment and ensure that they would be repeated, they were tested twice – once at Columbia University and once in real life – on engineers who knew each other from previous acquaintances.
At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty and students into two parts – in one, the subjects were asked to meet in person and develop solutions to the problem, and in the other, they were asked to do so via computer.
At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia were asked to divide themselves in a similar way and solve a problem presented to them in a new way.
In both cases, a decrease in creativity and outside-the-box thinking was found among those who met virtually via video.
Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher who studies ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.
In his opinion, in the context of a thinking activity, people often look at their surroundings to help generate ideas, whereas in a video meeting, thinking converges on the screen and does not expand in a way that allows for creativity.
&quot;When people are in the same room, they look around them and see the space, where there are objects and situations that can evoke new associations in them.
&quot;On the other hand, research shows that relationships through a computer change our attention so that we are more focused inward and on the screen, and this reduces innovation and the creation of ideas through looking at the environment and thinking outward.&quot;
There is no harm in critical thinking.
However, before managers rush employees back to the offices, the researchers note that &quot;working via computer did not harm productivity itself or people&#39;s critical thinking about innovative proposals, when they had to choose the best idea from a set of ideas.
&quot;That is, the damage is focused solely on creativity and not on other forms of computer work.&quot;
Prof. Ellen Langer, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, also doubts the findings.
According to her, &quot;There is a difference between just creativity, like new uses for a Frisbee (one of the research questions; AG) and working solutions.
It is also possible that when employees are more relaxed after getting to know each other, or when they work from home, creativity will improve.&quot;
Both Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson also suggested future research in which such meetings would be interrupted for thinking and wandering around the room to see how this activity would affect the final outcome.
Dr. Olson also suggested that following the study, employees should only return to work for brainstorming sessions, and as a general rule, he suggested not to be alarmed by one study but to conduct further investigation in the field.
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t want workers to be forcibly returned and not be happy. That would be a bigger blow,&quot; he says.
Musk awaits Trump&#39;s return: &quot;It was wrong to block him&quot;
Twitter&#39;s new buyer says it will reverse decision that led to former US president&#39;s account being blocked •
&quot;I think it was a mistake,&quot; he admitted.
The owner of Tesla and SpaceX, Elon Musk, who recently acquired Twitter in a deal valued at $44 billion, said today (Tuesday) that he intends to return Trump to the social network, which blocked him while he was president, after riots by his supporters on Capitol Hill after his election loss to Democratic candidate Joe Biden.
&quot;I do think it was wrong to ban Donald Trump.
&quot;I think it was a mistake,&quot; he said.
&quot;If there are wrong and bad tweets, they should be deleted or made invisible, and a suspension - a temporary suspension - is appropriate, but not a permanent ban,&quot; Musk clarified.
By 2050: The world will lose 80% of the water available for agriculture
New global study predicts significant decline in the next 25 years •
The solution: Proper management of water reservoirs
A disturbing new study recently published in the journal Earth&#39;s Future predicts that by 2050, the amount of water available for agriculture will decrease by about 80% if the rate of water consumption and world population growth remain at their current usage trends.
In the study, in which scientists from all scientific agencies in the world participated, the scientists summarized the total amount of rainwater, rivers, and freshwater sources in the world and compared it to humanity&#39;s need for agriculture.
The bleak conclusions of the study show that currently the rate of water consumption has been doubling repeatedly over the past 10 years, while at the same time global warming is causing the amount of rainfall to decrease in agricultural areas around the world.
According to the study&#39;s data, 84% of the world&#39;s agricultural land will experience severe shortages of rainwater.
One of the main conclusions from the study calls on farmers around the world to adapt agriculture to climate change and the seasons, and to switch to growing methods that will make it easier for water to penetrate the soil in order to prevent the process of water evaporation, which would lead to extensive waste of rainwater.
The researchers also recommend that farmers working near saltwater sources use rainwater harvesting technologies to prevent it from flowing into the sea.
Information about many Bar Ilan University students leaked online
Hackers who attacked Bar Ilan University&#39;s database a few weeks ago threatened to publish the information about students if they did not receive a ransom •
The threat was carried out and the information was published across the network.
Students at Bar Ilan University are under attack from hackers when their personal information was published online by a cyber attacker known as Darkrypt, who several weeks ago issued a ransom demand from university staff and threatened that if he was not paid an undisclosed amount of money, he would publish the information under his control.
Estimates regarding the amount of money the attacker demanded are that it started in the thousands of dollars and as the clock ticked, it increased, and before the information was published, it had already reached several million dollars.
Facebook groups of university students and faculty are filled with angry messages and chaos is brewing there, as students are unable to log into their personal information systems and cannot complete ongoing student assignments.
The university sent out an email message announcing the attack on the academic institution and that they are working intensively to minimize the damage, while detailing some of the information that was leaked online.
No special instructions were given to those whose information was hacked, and it was stated that the university had taken a series of actions to strengthen the security measures of the university&#39;s servers.
Good news for 40 communities: Optical fiber arrives in Binyamin
The trend of connecting the periphery with high-speed internet continues and now the optical fiber is reaching the Binyamin Council, which includes 40 localities.
The project, in collaboration with the council and the telecommunications companies Telran, X-Fiber, and Rimon Internet, will launch immediately after the holidays.
The Binyamin Council signed a broad agreement of its kind over the weekend to lay optical fibers in all of the council&#39;s localities.
The agreement with the Net-Fiber project in collaboration with Rimon Internet, Telran, and X-Fiber was signed after the completion of a large tender that the council has been working on in recent months.
The work will begin after the holidays, and residents from the council&#39;s 40 localities who are interested in connecting to the fiber-optic infrastructure will enjoy high speeds of up to 1 gigabit as well as advanced home terminal equipment that will enable strong WIFI reception, as required in these times.
Subscribers will be able to choose between high-speed fiber-optic internet or high-speed filtered fiber-optic internet, which will be provided by Rimon Internet.
The council ensured that the market remained open to competition in all situations.
Head of the Binyamin Regional Council, Yisrael Gantz: &quot;This is true Zionism.
This is great news for residents.
The living experience in Binyamin will improve, students will be able to study remotely if necessary, it will be possible to work from home and establish advanced businesses in communities that will have high-quality internet without delays.
I would like to wish the esteemed members success in their implementation tasks in the localities.
&quot;The residents are waiting for you.&quot;
Gantz added: &quot;Soon we will enjoy the best high-speed internet conditions in Israel.
We worked for many months to lay the foundation for the fiber installation, and now the vision is becoming a reality.
&quot;I thank Communications Minister Yoaz Hendel, who started the project with us during his previous term and now we are reaping the fruits of his labor, to the Communications Minister&#39;s team, the council members who were responsible for the details of the center, and to the CEOs of the companies that won the center for its professional quality, which is among the best in Israel.&quot;
Internet Rimon CEO Yariv Par: &quot;I thank Council Chairman Israel Gantz and his team who immediately took up the gauntlet to bring good news to thousands of council residents who will switch to high-speed internet that will upgrade the quality of life in the areas of education, the economy and, of course, leisure.&quot;
CEO of the &#39;Telran&#39; communications group, Shai Aslan: &quot;We are pleased with the Binyamin Council&#39;s decision to connect to fast and powerful internet infrastructure and I am confident that thanks to the group&#39;s extensive experience, we will be able to provide residents with fast internet just like in the center of the country.&quot;
X-Fiber CEO, Israel Elitzur: &quot;Establishing communications infrastructure in Binyamin is the Zionism of 2021. X-Fiber is proud to take part in establishing the state-of-the-art infrastructure in the biblical areas of Binyamin. I have no doubt that thanks to our familiarity with the Judea and Samaria areas in general and Binyamin in particular, we will meet every engineering challenge in order to bring high-speed internet to every home throughout the council.&quot;
We checked: What do the side effects after the Corona vaccine mean?
Many people who get vaccinated feel weak, feverish, and tired after receiving the shot, while others feel nothing.
Could this indicate a stronger immune system in those who do experience these symptoms, or is this a baseless rumor?
As more and more people get vaccinated, the lack of information about side effects continues to confuse and create rumors, most of which are untrue.
Are the immune systems of those who developed side effects stronger than those whose bodies reacted less severely to the vaccine, which could perhaps prove that their system is unable to fight off a foreign body that has entered the body?
&quot;There are several levels of reactions to the vaccine,&quot; says Dr. David Dvir, head of the Primary Medicine Department at Meuhedet and a member of the advisory committee for the TCM (Epidemic Treatment Team), and reassures: &quot;Headaches, fatigue, pain in the area, these are the immediate reactions of the immune system.
This is how the body reacts to the entry of a foreign body into the system.&quot;
Is there a relationship between the levels of antibodies that develop and the side effects?
&quot;There is no correlation between feelings and the development of antibodies against the virus.&quot;
About 50%-60% experience side effects, but about 90% develop protection against the virus.
&quot;It was not found that people who developed strong reactions were more protected.&quot;
&quot;The medical literature does not show a correlation between an immediate response and the level of immunity.
In some trials where people also received placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
This is also a mental component - how the person perceives the vaccine, whether they expect there to be side effects.
&quot;Many of the phenomena that occur could also occur normally, but because the public is immune, they attribute the reaction to the vaccine itself, and this is a bias that is seen regarding vaccines in general - attributing phenomena that occur near the vaccine and are attributed to it.&quot;
According to Dr. Dvir, the causes of the commonly reported symptoms, such as weakness and headaches, are not yet known.
Regarding inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis), opinions are divided.
&quot;There are all kinds of theories on the subject, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
&quot;One theory is that it&#39;s a strong immune system response.&quot;
Is it even possible to assess the strength of an immune system?
&quot;When students were exposed to the flu virus, it was shown that those who did not sleep or were under higher stress were more vulnerable to infection.
Apart from this, there are laboratory parameters that test the immune system or its components.
When there is a decline in the immune system, you see it immediately.
People get a lot of viral or infectious diseases.
It&#39;s not like someone is walking around with a weak immune system and isn&#39;t aware of it.
These are people who come for checkups because of repeated episodes of infectious diseases, and what affects the system are banal things: stress, nutrition, sleep.
&quot;By the way, we also don&#39;t want an immune system that is too strong, because it can cause autoimmune diseases.&quot;
MRNA vaccines will soon appear in additional contexts, thanks to the extensive knowledge that has accumulated about them in recent times.
&quot;There is no doubt that the door will be opened for other vaccines of this type.&quot;
This technology is being tested for many uses beyond vaccines - for treatments of oncological diseases, for example.
Their effectiveness is that the substance remains in the body for a very short time - it enters, does its job, and then breaks down.
This technology is not new, but it has received a serious boost due to the very great need for a rapid vaccine.
&quot;Now, for example, we know that a three-week interval between doses is too small, and some vaccine experts claim that after a third dose we may not need another vaccine in the near term, so it is unclear whether we are going to a situation where we need to vaccinate every six months or whether the third dose will provide a greater interval.&quot;
Thousands affected: Serious privacy breach on Highway 6
Route 6 customers?
Your private information, including your full name, addresses, payment amounts, and full details of your trips, may have been exposed.
According to the Privacy Protection Authority, Derech Eretz violated the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations.
Following a report submitted by Derech Eretz, the operator of Highway 6 in Israel, about a security incident that occurred at the company, the Privacy Protection Authority began an enforcement process.
As part of the event, security weaknesses were discovered on its payment website, which allowed the exposure of a large amount of information from the member&#39;s customer invoices, which were exposed to all eyes.
Among other things, customers&#39; payment invoices were exposed over a considerable period of time, and these invoices included personal information, including first and last name, payment amounts, vehicle location, travel dates and times.
In addition, because Derech Eretz did not document access to its systems as required by law, it is not possible to know exactly for what period unauthorized parties were able to access the company&#39;s systems.
In the violation letter, which the Privacy Protection Authority sent to the company, the Authority emphasized that most large companies and organizations in the economy are required to adopt a dynamic information security policy, and that as threats and risks develop, the organization has an obligation to rigorously examine the updated risks and act in accordance with the updated security measures that are acceptable under the circumstances, depending on the nature and quality of the database.
As a result, companies and organizations are required to update their systems and conduct risk surveys and penetration tests to examine the changing risks and prepare for them.
In addition, companies and organizations are required to use an automatic documentation mechanism and must conduct training for employees, in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Protection (Information Security) Regulations.
In accordance with the supervisory findings, the Authority determined that the company violated the provisions of the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations, and also required the company to take a number of corrective actions.
Derech Eretz, the operator of Highway 6, stated: &quot;The issue was handled in accordance with the most stringent requirements.&quot;
Istanbul travel warning: Surprising news for Israelis from Turkish airlines
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus will allow Israelis to change the destination or date of their flight
Good news for Israelis who booked tickets to Turkey before the travel warning: airlines will allow you to change flight dates.
Reminder: Earlier this week, the Counter-Terrorism Headquarters raised the severity of the travel warning for Istanbul to level four.
This is the highest level and means &quot;High threat level: Do not enter this country and if you do, leave the country as soon as possible.&quot;
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus announced that they will allow Israelis who booked their flights before the travel warning was issued, that is, before June 13, 22, to change their flight destination or date.
This is done by contacting the airline.
Tourism Minister Razvozov said: &quot;Israeli citizens should not pay an economic price because of terrorist threats.
&quot;I am happy that major airlines like Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have responded to our request, and I hope that other companies will provide a similar response to all Israeli citizens who canceled their vacation in Turkey due to the severe travel warning.&quot;

Saudi Arabia&#39;s skies are approaching: Israeli companies are preparing to strengthen routes to the East
The emerging agreement for expanded freedom of flight over Saudi Arabia: The airline is preparing to launch new flights to the Far East at the expense of destinations in Europe
Israel&#39;s largest airline is planning significant changes ahead of US President Joe Biden&#39;s arrival in Israel.
As we published in &quot;Israel Hayom,&quot; it is estimated that Biden will announce permission for El Al and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to destinations other than the United Arab Emirates.
The meaning of the emerging agreement is that El Al will be able to fly shorter routes to Far Eastern destinations and Australia.
To do this, the company will have to cancel flights to less profitable destinations in order to free up aircraft for new destinations.
The destinations to which flights will be canceled starting this November are Warsaw, Toronto, and Brussels.
These are three destinations where there is a sizable Jewish population, but at this stage they are less profitable for society.
On the other hand, the new destinations that El Al is considering are Tokyo in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.
This is how the move will be implemented: Dreamliners flying to Canada will be freed up for long-haul flights to the East.
The Boeing 737 aircraft flying to Warsaw and Brussels will be transferred to use for flights to destinations such as London and Paris, to which El Al operates flights using Dreamliner aircraft.
So in essence, the company will be able to release large aircraft to fly to additional destinations in the East.
At the same time, El Al expects talks to take place in the coming weeks regarding the possibility of Israeli airlines being able to return to flying to Turkey, where the company could operate flights using the airline&#39;s Boeing 737 aircraft.
Making order out of chaos: How much will you pay for a suitcase on each airline?
Get the detailed guide to baggage prices for various airlines •
Who offers 6 euros for an additional 10 kg, and where the price never includes luggage?
Prices have changed, baggage conditions are no longer the same, and many Israelis are surprised when they arrive at the airport and discover that they have to add large amounts for baggage they thought was included in the price.
How do you know what the airline&#39;s baggage conditions are?
That&#39;s what we&#39;re here for.
Lufthansa Group (Swiss, Austrian and Lufthansa) – The Lite ticket includes hand luggage only. If you want to add a suitcase, you will have to do it seven days in advance via the website at a cost of $70 one way, over the phone it will cost you $80 and at the airport $100.

Ordering an additional suitcase can cost between $90-150 one way if you do it at the airport; if you order in advance, the price is slightly cheaper.
Exemption from quarantine for vaccinated and recovering people from non-red countries, foreign tourists are returning.
Those landing in Israel received notifications from the Ministry of Health stating that they are exempt from the obligation to quarantine upon receiving a negative result from the coronavirus test •
Only later did the ministry issue an official statement stating that it only concerned travelers from orange countries, even though returnees from red countries also reported receiving the notice.
In addition: Tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter the country, and many red destinations are expected to be removed from the list.
At the height of the pandemic - the end of isolation for those returning from abroad?
The Ministry of Health sent notices to those returning to Israel this morning (Monday), stating that they are exempt from quarantine upon receiving a negative result from the coronavirus test they performed after landing in Israel.
These are also returnees from red countries.
Some of the messages sent informed the returnees that they could be released after receiving a negative response or after 24 hours at the latest, and some of them received the exemption after receiving the negative response.
Only after that was an official announcement issued by the Ministry of Health stating that starting at midnight, January 4, 2022, vaccinated or recovering people returning from orange countries will undergo a PCR test at Ben Gurion Airport and enter isolation for 24 hours or until a negative result is received (whichever comes first).
The decision will be enshrined in an order from the Director General of the Ministry of Health and will be submitted for approval to the Knesset Health Committee.
The ministry clarified that vaccinated or recovering individuals who have already returned to Israel from an orange country and received a negative result from the PCR test they performed upon entering Israel will end their isolation tonight at midnight and are not obligated to take a second test.
Despite this, travelers from red states reported that they also received the message.
Anyone who has not been vaccinated or has recovered and returns from an orange country will enter home quarantine for 14 days, with the option of shortening the quarantine upon receiving a negative result in a PCR test performed starting on the 7th day of landing in Israel (the day of landing is the first day).
The decision to lift most restrictions on flights, especially on the vaccinated, comes a day before the High Court hearing filed by the Travel Agencies Association, the Open Skies Headquarters, and the Hotel Association.
At the hearing to be held tomorrow, the petitioners are expected to demand that all other red countries be removed from the list, with Professor Itamar Grotto backing them in his opinion.
Foreigners will also be able to enter.
The Prime Minister and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Health, Interior, Tourism, and Transportation agreed that, starting Sunday, January 9, 2022, entry of vaccinated/recovering foreigners (as defined by the Ministry of Health) from orange countries will be permitted - subject to filling out an online form in advance, performing a PCR or antigen test before boarding the plane, performing a PCR test upon entering Israel, followed by entry into isolation for 24 hours, or receiving a negative test result (whichever comes first).
Foreigners who are not vaccinated/not recovering (as defined by the Ministry of Health) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from red countries, except for those whose entry has been approved by the Exceptions Committee, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
The group outline will not be renewed at this time.
And what about red states?
The Committee for Classification of Countries at the Ministry of Health recommends to the government that the following countries be removed from the list of red countries and transferred to the orange list: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, and Canada.
The remaining countries at this stage on the red list are: United Arab Emirates, USA, Ethiopia, United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey.
Another option being considered by the Health Ministry is to exempt vaccinated people returning from red countries from isolation.
It is currently unclear whether there is a connection between the notifications received this morning by those returning to Israel and the instructions that may be received by the Ministry of Health on this issue.
No response has yet been received from the Ministry of Health.
The skies are starting to open: The Ministry of Health changes the restrictions on the country&#39;s borders
Vaccinated individuals returning from orange countries will be required to quarantine for 24 hours •
The countries of the USA, Turkey, the UK and the UAE will be defined as red.
After long weeks in which it was very difficult to find a destination to which one could fly without restrictions, and after all those returning from abroad were required to quarantine, along with a ban on tourists entering Israel - yesterday it was decided to change the procedures and significantly ease the restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport.
The Ministry of Health has decided to recommend canceling the mandatory three-day quarantine for Israelis returning from orange countries.
So far, anyone vaccinated or recovering according to the Ministry of Health&#39;s definitions who returned from an orange country was required to quarantine for three days, subject to two coronavirus tests.
Now, the isolation that vaccinated and recovering people returning from orange countries will have to undergo is for a maximum of 24 hours, or until the results of the coronavirus tests performed after landing at Ben Gurion Airport are received (whichever comes first).
Anyone who is not defined as vaccinated or recovering will still be required to enter seven days of isolation subject to two coronavirus tests, or 14 days without the second test, whether they returned from an orange country or a red country.
A vaccinated or recovering person who has returned from a red state is also required to undergo full isolation.
The latest list of red countries recommended by the Ministry of Health, which still needs to be approved by the government, includes the US, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the UK, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
In all countries, except Turkey, the average number of positive cases entering the country in the last two weeks is more than 5% of all arrivals, which automatically puts them on the list of red countries.
The rate of increase among patients from Turkey is rapid, the rate of positive returnees from it is just over 4%, and therefore it was decided to include it on the list of red countries.
The prominent countries that will be removed from the red list are: France, Spain, Portugal, and Canada.
Meanwhile, starting January 9, tourists who are vaccinated according to the Ministry of Health&#39;s requirements will be able to enter Israel without the need for isolation, similar to the conditions for Israelis returning from an orange country.
In this case too, the decision is subject to government approval, which will discuss the issue in the coming days.
It is important to note that there are few cases in which the government does not approve the Ministry of Health&#39;s recommendations in this area.
Tourists against the restrictions.
The Travel Agencies Association, the Open Skies Headquarters, and the Hotel Association filed a petition with the High Court to lift the restrictions on flights.
The country lifted most restrictions yesterday, but as mentioned, left eight significant countries on the list of red countries.
At a hearing to be held this morning in Jerusalem, the petitioners are expected to demand that the state cancel the list of red countries.
The person who will support the petitioners&#39; position is Prof. Itamar Grotto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.
Tourism Minister Yoel Razvozov, who in recent weeks has supported easing restrictions on the entry of foreign tourists into Israel, said yesterday: &quot;The cancellation of quarantine for vaccinated people returning from abroad and the return of tourism to vaccinated people are the right and just thing to do during this period.&quot;
I thank my colleagues in the government, who understood the plight of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the harm outweighs the benefit.
&quot;The vaccine is the best response to the pandemic, and as such, the vaccinated public deserves to lead an enabling lifestyle alongside the coronavirus.&quot;
With an investment of 200 million shekels: The new resort to open near Arad
The desert is blooming: Another luxury hotel is expected to open in about three years •
Chef restaurants, private pools and 110 rooms are just a small part of what the hotel will offer •
All the details in the article
Fattal&#39;s 7MINDS and the real estate company White City Buildings have jointly purchased a plot of land covering an area of about 20 dunams in the Judean Desert, where they will build a luxurious resort with an investment of about 200 million shekels. The hotel will be built on the same land where the Masada Hotel was built, which was demolished about a year ago.
The resort will only open in about three years and will have 110 rooms, some of which will have private pools.
The hotel will also have three shared pools, a spa, chef restaurants, an entertainment complex, a gym, and more.
The person who will be responsible for the culinary side of the hotel is Chef Ran Shmueli from Claro Restaurant.
Chef Shmueli will be the one who will build the menu, which is expected to have a desert concept unique to the resort.
The Mayor of Arad, Attorney Nissan Ben Hamo, welcomed the project: &quot;The decision to build a new and prestigious hotel near Arad gives the official seal to the incredible leap that Arad has made in the field of tourism in recent years.
&quot;I am proud of the choice of the entrepreneurs and am convinced that it will be a shared success since Arad has enormous tourism potential.&quot;
El Al presents: Flights to all of Europe starting at $78
The skies are opening up and airlines are launching deals not seen in a long time •
Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Budapest, Berlin, Amsterdam and other destinations for less than $100 for round-trip flights
.
Israel&#39;s largest airline is reporting an increase in demand for flights abroad since yesterday&#39;s announcement of significant relief for passengers.
The company decided to announce a special offer this morning to mark the opening of the skies, and the prices it offers are considered particularly attractive.
As part of the new promotion, the company is offering flights to Berlin, Budapest, Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Athens, Amsterdam, Lisbon and other destinations at prices starting at about $60 for round-trip flights.
Following the easing of restrictions on flights, El Al is resuming flights to a number of destinations, including Canada, Italy, Germany, Hungary, Belgium and other countries.
It is important to remember that there is a limited number of tickets (approximately 4,000) and the price does not include luggage and seat selection.
The offer is valid for bookings made today and tomorrow and for flights departing until January 31, 2022.
Starting tonight at midnight, France, Spain, Portugal and other countries will be removed from the list of red countries.
The US, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and five other countries are still on the red list of countries and there is a ban on flying to them without permission from an exceptions committee.
Almost everyone these days has an &quot;old&quot; tablet or smartphone lying around in a closet unused.
Just because a slightly newer and more advanced model has been released, any device can be a Spotify player with a hotspot connection.
Old devices can be used as dashcams, remote controls for operating home appliances, and many other uses.

It was more interesting to hear how many people received stipends at the Israel Post, how much the real estate of the branches (located in the requested city centers) is worth, and how much the employees&#39; wages are (minimum).
Israel Post must not be privatized.
The question is, how many packages arrived and how many were distributed?
Because how many are they missing?
We order packages, and they disappear at the sorting center in Modiin...
There should be a 5 shekel package tax so they don&#39;t just order nonsense for shekels and burden the mail.
This is mainly indicative of the high cost of living in the country.
Thank you to the King of Pakim for making it better to buy everything from China.
We are a household and try not to go near the post office and hope that no letters will arrive from them, and our hatred of the post office has led us to give up everything related to the possibility of mail.
Have a good week.
Fire all postal workers, and start rebuilding the post office - through a private company.
Employers are arrogant and some are racist!
They speak differently on the phone, and when they arrive for the interview, their true face is revealed.
No wonder they can&#39;t find workers.
They are looking for slaves.
Slave jobs
Everyone is invited to experience true Judaism.
all due respect
Congratulations, you won.
He who endures trials and is found in holiness will see only light throughout his life.
Simply lovely
What nonsense.
No Tunisian is forced to hide their Jewish identity.
Historically this is not true.
An ugly, hairy monkey that was taken down from a tree, ahahahaha.
Waste from the market
Very nice article dear brother
Kobe, I wish many were like you.
Love you
My dear brother🔥💪❤️
There are no people like you 😍
king.
This is a person who sees what an amazing country we have.
There will always be problems.
This is life.
Great Kobe!!!
An admirable figure!!
You will succeed in everything you do!!!
Congratulations, you are on the right track ♥
There&#39;s nothing like keeping Shabbat.
More than we keep the Sabbath, the Sabbath keeps us.
Type in Google: Sabbath observance or Sabbath laws
And learn how to keep the Sabbath, good luck to everyone ♥
An amazing and very humble man!
I wish him all the success in the world and that he continues to be as magical and talented as he is.
Inhale - the great Kobi Shimoni - also known as Subliminal.
Congratulations to you - in all seriousness.
It&#39;s amazing that she&#39;s still receiving job offers, in her profession it&#39;s not something that&#39;s taken for granted...
There&#39;s nothing like walking the king&#39;s road♥
Amazing family♥
A few years ago I had a dream of throwing a cow on Esti Zakheim&#39;s head with her reddish hair.
Beautiful and talented!!
How did you win the Sabbath Keeper?
A man who is all about his wife and children.
Insanely talented.
Looking forward to her performances.
Perfection :-))
You are a world champion!
Amazingly talented Inbal, good luck
You are stunning!!! :-)
Congratulations
all due respect!!!!!
Love won!!!!
Congratulations!!!!
Don&#39;t worry, it won&#39;t be for long.
It is of no use at the moment.
How do you know it&#39;s true love?
They got back together after 20 years!!
And she&#39;s even older than him.
And he&#39;s handsome, rich and famous.
And in a few months he reported a separation of forces.
There are women who can wake up every morning with a new husband.
It&#39;s a shame he didn&#39;t participate in Eurovision.
Let&#39;s hope that maybe next year he will participate with his original song.
That&#39;s where the big breakthrough will come.
Instead of the egoist rising from the writer they brought, he only made shame.
Where did this idiot Greenberg come from, hahahaha!
Who is this?!
Why is it on a news site?
This is not Guy Pines or the Nonsense Moses newspaper.
Smells like a well-oiled, invited PR job disguised as an article by a 2-year-old shekel-sized beggar hiding behind the newspaper&#39;s editorial name.
The joke is on us, the readers, the captive audience who escaped the clutches of the venomous Moses and are looking for an alternative.
The song is not to my taste and the video is also mediocre.
Charming, charming, charming
What talent!!!!
Want more and more from him
Tamir Greenberg is a great singer on the level of an international star.
The State of Israel is small for him.
He will break out abroad in a big way.
Clinical optometrist?!
Come on, her &quot;degree&quot; doesn&#39;t apply in her country of origin...
Who is the next sector?
B.I.B.I.S.T.?
And corneal mapping was not mentioned.
Alec is a clinical optometrist.
Clinically on her own behalf.
Where will there be sirens?
We are preparing for a war that is coming.
And what will the battle-hardened ones do? What cruelty?
Bennett Lapid and Gantz at Biden&#39;s briefing: Get ready, friends, get ready....
Because they are the champions of champions!!
Hahahahaha but don&#39;t worry, even when managers are screwed up and stupid asses, we have abilities above and beyond what is expected!!
True, and besides, our dimensions, like most of them, are screwed up.
The Home Front Command plays &quot;as if&quot; games, because in time - we will never know...
Why only in Tel Aviv?
Everyone else is a right-winger.
Despite the nice talk - we haven&#39;t heard about the arrest of hackers, you brought legal proceedings against them
And in the last four election cycles, was the Elections Committee prepared for an attack?
Why not specify, for example...
How many attempts at infiltration and disruption have been made and how many have succeeded in penetrating the Elections Committee in the last 3 years?
Don&#39;t we deserve some data, facts and proportion?
One of Hapoel Jerusalem&#39;s most bizarre signings.
Good luck Oz.
You will always be part of the Maccabi dynasty...
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
I see all of you black people, only complaints and torture, classic armchair scum.
Baldwin is a social attack in the locker room, say players who played with him in both Greece and Spain!
Hollins was injured and did not play in Red Star&#39;s last games...
Hilliard was also injured and hasn&#39;t played for the last six months...
Heavy bets.
Maccabi is missing a star
What is Brown really about?
If he doesn&#39;t sign, Maccabi could be in trouble.
What about Lorenzo Brown?
Hahahahahaha how does a loser fit like a glove on a team of......
A great player, the coach must give him more minutes, don&#39;t give up on him, Hapoel needs a big squad, it&#39;s not allowed, it&#39;s not allowed to give up on him.
not.
Bring in Adrian Banks.
We need more strong Israelis on the roster.
Those who really play
Much more suitable than Wilbekin for the Maccabi that is being built.
You see that there are professionals at Maccabi - Blatt and Ketch.
Maybe personal abilities still don&#39;t compare to Scotty, but team player, and especially game intelligence, are much higher.
It&#39;s so sad that Maccabi Tel Aviv relies on foreigners and Israelis warm the bench.
By the way, Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes, not a collection of foreigners, so they won&#39;t succeed with all the stars they&#39;ve brought in from around the world.
Who is interested in this???
If you&#39;re watching a game with 6 American players and 3 Israelis for decoration, wouldn&#39;t it be better to watch a Golden State game????
Puzzle Until he connects, the league will be over.
Good luck
Good column.
I loved it.
Regarding the Israelis, he is absolutely right!!
And a note about Ziv - we saw last season that he is a good player who can also lead a team.
So in the Euroleague he can&#39;t be a leader, but the decline in his ability in the league also indicates that he has lost confidence (which is no wonder after the treatment he received after 2 bad games in the Euroleague, as if foreigners didn&#39;t have games like that) and his use may also be incorrect, and is a result of the coach&#39;s fixations and stereotypes.
Blazer is not a shooter with all due respect…
Yiftach Ziv shouldn&#39;t be in Maccabi Tel Aviv, he&#39;s ruining it for me.
Once upon a time there was not a good performance, but Sorkin and Blazer Dudi and Cohen today, well done.
Ido Eshed is a bum, a Holon fan who was given 500 shekels, so he writes nonsense.
Federman is not in the picture.
Blazer, Sorkin and Jack Cohen are much better than Colliaro and Taylor, who in Europe play for about twenty minutes and are unable to score a basket. Who needs foreigners at a level of nothing and nothing? It&#39;s much better for the Israelis to play.
It&#39;s good that there is a good spirit for everyone, coaches, players and management at the Hammontom office.
Depends on the internal reinforcement...
And the necessary disciplinary reinforcement of the coordinator and guard
And that&#39;s the management part.
wrong.
Direct human interaction is important in many ways.
The answer to this study is that social isolation is a bad thing from a professional perspective as well, and the truth is, what is surprising and disappointing here is the surprise.
So turn off the camera zoom and the problem is solved.
What happened, the researchers used Zoom and therefore their creativity was not enough for this solution?
How do you know what will happen in 30 years?
Someone here missed an important detail.
Scientists are not interested in global warming or rainwater.
They are only interested in the rate of population growth.
They are working on more and more vaccines and bastard methods to destroy the world&#39;s population, so they tell us bogus stories about global warming and other nonsense they make up.
There is no problem in desalinating water, in unlimited quantities.
They said that 50 years ago.
Meanwhile, there are more people.
The solution is birth control, especially in poor places and in the case of Bibi&#39;s baboons, the rest of their anti-state leftists, and in all religions that believe in gods - among the stupid, the ignorant, the idiots, the blind, or in short - among the herds.
There is an urgent need to reduce the world population.
Living things (including mammals) consume oxygen and emit carbon dioxide.
The solution: Sesmolens, commit suicide!
It&#39;s green.
Good for the world.
May it be better for you, and for the Earth and all of us.
Who are the scientists and how did they conduct the research?
I don&#39;t believe any research that talks about global warming because this thing doesn&#39;t exist.
It is biased in order to control us and rob us of our freedom and liberty.
It&#39;s all part of the new world order.
And reporters like Assaf Golan are on their side, as he did during the coronavirus.
I have never heard him present facts from both sides. He always brings the side that serves the globalists.
They are slandering us.
Just burning money on academic &quot;sketch&quot; research.
As usual, another sketch from the land of the sketches of psychopathic Sesmolens.
The situation is actually improving. Human knowledge is expanding, and with it new technologies and improvements.
For centuries, the world&#39;s population has been steadily growing at an exponential rate, and the situation is only getting better.
The Chinese, for example, launched a huge war project in the Gobi Desert, with amazing success.
The Saudis are doing the same thing and are also successful (with Israeli knowledge, by the way).
It&#39;s actually the Sesmolens&#39; stupid &quot;climate crisis&quot; (carbon dioxide emissions, which plants need) that&#39;s causing the Sahara to become greener, but hey, that doesn&#39;t fit the Sesmolens&#39; agenda, so you won&#39;t read about it in the newspapers...
Leftists don&#39;t care.
Their urine goes straight to their head, so they don&#39;t dry out.
Does proper management of water resources mean cutting at least 70% of the world&#39;s population?
It&#39;s amazing that COVID is coming, and it&#39;s amazing that most of the population is injected with an experimental substance whose consequences for those injected over a period of 5-25 years are not even known.
It&#39;s also amazing that Agenda 2030 is getting underway and now this?
The whole story is really strange!!!
Hahahaha what bullshit.
Tales of One Thousand and One Nights, all scaremongering and of course nonsense from the left that is trying to control the world through control of the media. Five years ago they announced that there would be no more rain in Australia and this year they have enough rain for two years.
They said that it wouldn&#39;t rain in Israel anymore and that the drought was permanent, and now there is rain.
They also said that Rabin did not murder Jews in Altalena and that Peres did not know that children of the Tenants were being stolen.
Moshe Dayan, of course, did not rob antiquities and Ezer Weizmann did not mess with his female soldiers.
It&#39;s clear that you are promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
Disgusting nonsense.
They will also take care of reception on the routes, handling power outages and voltage drops, and we will be on the wave.
&quot;This is true Zionism,&quot; just as opening a Rami Levy branch in Yeruham is Zionism.
Following the swindler Bennett, the other sleazy politicians will toe the line in this area.
Even if you give me free flights, I won&#39;t go near El Al, or rather &quot;El Al&quot;
It was very nice to say goodbye and not goodbye.
You won&#39;t see us even in your dreams.
Another great shame, we in Israel are held captive by Elal, all direct flights are in its hands, price gouging, it&#39;s better if it goes bankrupt already, it&#39;s time for truly open skies.4
Some are focusing on this issue of flights to the East.
Even if Saudi Arabia allows El Al to fly over its territory, it won&#39;t add more than a few tens of millions to the Israeli economy, not such a big game changer.
It is better to focus on more interesting achievements such as energy supply, the purchase of Israeli technology, transportation from the ports of Ashdod and Haifa through Jordan to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the Emirates, tourism, and enabling Israeli oil companies to work in Saudi Arabia.
This is much more interesting than 30 planes a week that will save an hour each.
It is more important that they allow the Air Force squadrons to be stationed in the Persian Gulf to strike Iran and that they organize the Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Egypt, and Morocco to drop weapons on Iran non-stop for a month until the complete destruction of all its military infrastructure.
And another Air Force squadron to be stationed in northern Saudi Arabia and strike Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq from the east from a less densely populated area.
After we are done with Iran, Saudi Arabia can push Oman, Kuwait, Djibouti, and the Comoros Islands into a peace agreement with Israel and get a majority of the Arab League countries to join in the peace process.
After the regime change in Iran, the end of the World Cup, the stabilization of the oil and gas market, and the replacement of Erdogan, it is also possible to help Saudi Arabia overthrow the government in Qatar and finally eliminate this country&#39;s subversion and its support for the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas.
When all these common interests end, it will be possible to talk about a few more Elal flights, if Elal survives until then.
El Al needs to close.
Selling tickets for flights that don&#39;t take place.
The worst part is that there is no way to get a representative.
&quot;No customer service.&quot;
Anyone who buys an El Al ticket and wants to change or cancel should forget about it, it&#39;s a sure loss.
See, you have been warned.
Air Canada is better
In any case, they prefer to fly abroad.
Arkakeh turned from a shithole of a company into a hell of a company
El Al also dropped in level.
It&#39;s best to order a taxi.
The driver will load the luggage for free.
And you took the train to the airport.
40 euros for a suitcase on Ryanair is much cheaper than Wizz.
You can bring a backpack weighing up to 8 kg.
Why are you misleading?
Wizz Air charges much more for luggage and a seat!!!
One big blunder
Just for example, I just got back, if I may.
The allowed weight is 30 kg.
And a 7 kg trolley
And every additional 1 kg is $30.
Go and get updated.
All companies steal the customer.
They advertise very cheap prices, but in the end it&#39;s a bag the size of a school bag.
A trolley already costs money and a suitcase is very, very expensive.
Luckily, the airlines don&#39;t ask us to come on the flight in underwear and a tank top so that there&#39;s no weight on the plane.
On El Al, the price is not cheaper, but 50% of the cost when booking up to 6 hours before the flight.
The Israelis are not surprised at all.
The Israelis were and remain combinators, using the Matsliach method.
A land that devours its inhabitants and eats them.
To this must be added genetic stinginess.
Shame on our country for allowing foreign airlines to exploit Israelis...
There is no government and everyone here does as they please.
So what did you learn today that it&#39;s not enough to pay for an expensive ticket..
Prepare a surprise for all of us..
You will pay extra for the airplane wheels, for the windows, for the luggage that doesn&#39;t arrive, for the food, for the drinks, and they will probably add to the toilets.
In short, leave it at home and the prices will go down.
Or big, you&#39;ll go out on ships
The journey will take several days.
Wait and then you&#39;ll probably come.
Bennett wants to see how much he can attack and harm Israel, and still win the support of his new fans.
Open now?
This is no coincidence.
It&#39;s precisely when the chaos begins that there is an exemption, it&#39;s simply bizarre what&#39;s happening here...
This is not the peak of the pandemic.
Simon, it&#39;s not right for you.
The number of confirmed cases is increasing, but the number of patients is not.
Stop getting tested for all sorts of nonsense, stay home if you don&#39;t feel well.
The story is over.
A government of lunatics
The government and Bennett are mainly bankrupt.
Loss of control.
And especially stupidity
And public confusion score 0
Only more harm than good
I suggest you open a new section: &quot;The daily and cumulative number of deaths since the beginning of the fifth wave.&quot;
&quot;The faces and images behind the failure.&quot;
Your ratings will plummet.
You don&#39;t understand the Minister of Finance for not paying compensation to tourism workers.
Bring them more infection
They don&#39;t care about the people.
8500 have died so far
Does anyone talk about this?
They bury us, especially the elderly.
We have become Russia/North Korea.
If we don&#39;t talk about it - it doesn&#39;t exist!!
The main thing is that citizens put money into the state coffers to make the ministers&#39; bellies and buttocks bigger!
It turns out that Doberman and Abbas are the Prime Minister!!
Very well, the Omicron delay was relevant for the first week, now - there is no reason to isolate half a nation, and there is no point in trying to stop the Omicron - which exists here more than in Israel.
When someone comes from an orange country, they are statistically less dangerous than someone who is already here.
This is the first time I&#39;ve seen logical steps by the Israeli government in the fight against Corona.
As if someone actually sat down and calculated the numbers, and not like Bibi - did what he thought would look better in the newspaper (and failed in all sections).
The dream government at its best:
Finance Minister tells teachers to find a new profession two weeks ago, rushing to open the skies to tourists.
The Minister of Education from Kishasha is chirping at the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health and setting her own policy, which is throwing all schools into complete chaos!
A foreign minister, a clown who arrives sick with Corona to a government meeting.
And the most clownish prime minister we&#39;ve ever had in the country, unable to control the situation and losing his temper like the last of the hooligans.
Simply a government without leadership, without direction, in which the entire Israeli people have lost trust.
Go home and be beautiful one hour earlier!!!
My opinion, maybe it comes from a bad place, but from a place of loss of control.
Now apartment prices there will jump to 50 million per apartment.
So where are all the forecasters?
They are building a bus stop and believe it will affect all the houses.
By the way, except for sponsorship money.
They will discover Arad&#39;s exorbitant property tax prices. The hotel will once again be a white elephant like its predecessor.
Looks amazing.
Good luck.
I feel like it.
What about the art of taking pictures completely naked?
Giving up the garbage
A serious fight for Sde Barir
From the Harbant Sixth, why are benefits not given to girls in the occupied Galilee by the Muslim Brotherhood of the Harbant Sixth?
Everyone is a fool.
In the current reality, is the South still ours?!
Need a passport?
Another luxury hotel!
Surely the members of Knesset will be there too!!
What about a popular hotel for a popular person?
Congratulations on investing in the [prospering] South.
Arad is developing and thriving, and all credit to the mayor, who since the beginning of his term has seen an explosion for the good and glory of the city of Arad.
Cultural life, society, education and more at altitude
Simply an excellent mayor who improved the city!
all due respect
I wonder how much sponsorship money the resort owner will pay to the Bedouins.
Have you prepared money for sponsorship fees?
Wow, sounds good.
Those who can only afford El Al - a company with the best service and security in the world.
When would it be possible to fly to Dubai? Does anyone know????
El Al is a tin company.
Neither social nor economic.
In recent weeks, it has canceled flights back from abroad, you see, sent messages to Israelis telling them that the flight was canceled, ruined the entire trip on the spot, informed passengers to leave a message on WhatsApp or Messenger and we&#39;ll be back, they came back after a day or two, even three.
The trip was ruined.
Besides, is it better to ground planes on the ground, instead of making the flights back to Israel, and also prevent economic damage?
Are there any other suckers flying to Alal?
I wouldn&#39;t fly with them even for free.
Have they already returned the millions of customers they took captive?
EasyJet to Geneva round trip 70 euros.
El Al one way $560.
I don&#39;t buy from the religious fraudster who controls society together with his fucked up son, even for $10, non-stop fraudsters...
And then the company will cancel the flights and offer vouchers that will be worthless.
Because their realization will be subject to a price change.
Anyone who buys tickets on Elal puts their money on the wing of the plane.
Tin company.
Low-cost company exercises.
No luggage, no seat selection, probably no taxes and no food.
Vacation and flights Corona...
To all members of the &quot;Guelitsia&quot;...Ali!
Nature breeds fools!!
