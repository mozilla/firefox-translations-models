Three cheetahs of ice: Three cheetah cubs were born in Iran
The world's fastest animal is victims of cruel hunts, forts and fatal road accidents across the Islamic Republic
As a result, their number dropped to less than 20 cheetahs.
Three Asian cheeps recently emerged into the world in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
It is a rare birth, which slightly improves the tragic condition of the endangered animal in the country due to the droughts, hunters and fatal road accidents.
This is the first birth of cheetah in cavity in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where cheetahs still live in the wild.
The Iranian news agency Irna reported that the veterinary team, which is responsible for the Turan National Park in the northern Samnan Province, decided on a Caesarean birth in captivity.
It was also noted that fewer than 20 cheetahs have been documented in seven different provinces in the country.
Due to the danger of their extinction, the UN carried out a defense plan for them back in 2001.
Now, Iran hopes that the new cubs will be able to bring about an increase in the population of the cheetah population in the future.
In January, the deputy minister of environmental affairs in Iran, Hassan Akbari, said that the population of the cheetahs in the country was dramatically reduced from 100 cheetahs in 2010 to only 12 cheetahs.
"Their situation is extremely serious," Akbari said, noting that the cheetahs fell victim to drought in their living areas, hunting and even road accidents.
The cheetah is considered the fastest animal in the world capable of reaching a speed of about 100 km/h.
The cheetahs can be found in different places across the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to upgrade your car: We checked the Car Thing
Quietly, Spotify began to try her luck in the world of hardware.
After years of development - Car Thing was exposed and launched as a small experiment in the US •
We put our hands on the first device in Israel •
Vision: Make your old cars smart
The Car Thing is Spotify’s first hardware product, and is built specifically to provide a solution for people with old cars.
A few weeks ago, I got an initial opportunity to try the new product, which is currently only available for individual experimenters in the US, here in Israel.
For me, the timing of the shipment was outstanding, since our home car broke down and we had to drive for a few days with an alternative vehicle with an old system.
After two weeks of entertaining, I understood how Car Thing can easily become an integral part of many people’s system.
And on the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty about global launch, I believe that many would already prefer to use other solutions.
From Idea to Reality
Somewhere in 2018, Spotify users began to receive an interesting offer in their email box - the possibility of purchasing a new device with voice control and fourth-generation connection, which will make any old car system smart.
The rumors slowly faded until a year later, when the Financial Times website revealed that the company is planning to soon introduce a new car product that simulates a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.
A few months later, these rumors returned to the headlines again after the music service was updated with the vehicle mode – the same one we know today from the app – which is activated once the smartphone detects a connection to the system in the car.
Two years have passed since.
After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify revealed “Car Thing” in April, its smart system for vehicles.
Spotify has chosen to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays when it comes to shipments.
So, of course, right after the press conference, I went to the site and signed up.
Two months later, the long-awaited announcement arrived.
Reconnecting to the site will buy me the option to purchase the device with a little surprise - it will cost me nothing.
After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.
The Car Thing
First and foremost, Spotify's device impressed me very much with the quality of its construction.
And a little smaller than my iPhone 11 and includes a large, bright and sharp touch screen in front of it.
You can also find a round button and a dial that you can rotate next to the screen to navigate between the interface screens.
And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to maintain a relatively thin profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.
Personally, I would prefer that the company allow the company to change the activity so that I could control the volume of the smartphone, since I can also navigate through the touch screen.
Maybe it'll be possible to update a future version.
The device comes in a small and minimalist cardboard box, which includes, among other things, a USB Type C cable and various adapters for its installation.
Many of you probably remember how in the past we used to disconnect the radios and hide them in the drawer after getting out of the car.
The Car Thing undoubtedly restores this feeling with its construction form.
All the adapters connected to the body of the device using a magnet that was very strong, which prevented it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.
In addition, along the entire top you can find small buttons, which can be easily set to run different playlists or podcasts.
By pressing one of the buttons while hearing, or by asking the voice assistant, I set up some playlists that I hear frequently and the radio program I listen to every morning on the road.
In doing so, the feature made me feel that Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.
From an old car to a smart car
After a fairly simple physical installation, I connected the Car Thing to electricity.
I was pleasantly surprised by the setup process.
The instructions were clear, the connection to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I arrived at the home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone through Bluetooth and controls the app like a remote control, and therefore can copy all the information about our account from it.
In other words, you still have to connect your smartphone to the car, either via Bluetooth or through an AUX cable to hear the music.
The home screen is familiar to all users of the app, since like the application on a smartphone, it emphasizes the photos of the albums and playlists.
Also, on the home screen, like the one in the app, you can find recommendations for music depending on your taste, your search screen and your personal library.
As mentioned above, you can navigate between the different screens using the touch screen or through the manual dial.
Moreover, at any given moment you can call the device's vocal assistant by saying "Hi Spotify".
Through it, you can run songs, playlists, albums and even search for podcasts.
From my experience, she recognized quite easily my voice even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner blew directly on the device.
This is probably thanks to the four microphones installed at the top.
It is important to note that at the moment the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time the article is published, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.
So is it worth waiting for him?
My experience of using the device was great, and it's a positive surprise to me considering it's still in the initial release phase.
Even in intensive use of long journeys, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
Still, occasionally a small stutter in the interface is recorded, but I believe Spotify will handle such bugs with future version updates.
It is clear that the Swedish company has worked on it a lot in recent years, and among the different versions that leaked on the Internet during this period, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.
Still, when I saw the Car Thing for the first time, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to designate it.
After all, his activity comes down to controlling the app on a smartphone, and not much more.
What is different from buying a car stand for a few shekels and connect it so that the smartphone is closer to us when driving?
This question is reinforced when considering that iPhones and Android devices are much stronger than Spotify, and most of the time will give the user much more functionality.
Despite all this, the more I used Car Thing, the more I realized how it could improve the driving experience.
The ability to see Waze on my smartphone screen and control music on a completely different screen, this is one I've learned to appreciate in the last two weeks.
One question remains - will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?
If so, will it be launched here in our small country as well?
Swedish company doesn't tell much right now.
She has not even shared how many experimenters to the device it is currently operating around the world, and how much she plans to add at the limited launch in the United States.
The only thing we know for sure is the price that is expected to be $79 (about NIS 255).
Meanwhile, the Car Thing provides an initial glimpse into the concept that Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Spotify Israel said there is currently no information about the device launch plan in Israel

Did you recruit a talent for the company?
That way, you keep the competition from "hijacking" it.
The economy is still in a labor market that is largely controlled by the workers, and this is sevenfold true when it comes to the most desirable workers - the talents •
Here are some tips to help you keep it in the workplace
.
Despite the increase recorded in the past month, the unemployment rate in Israel continues to be among the lowest in the world, and in the top ten of OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5% (150.6 thousand unemployed, according to the CBS).
In other words, the economy is still in a labor market that is largely controlled by the workers, and this is quite true when it comes to the most desirable workers – the talents.
When it comes to those professionals and managers who are proven knowledge centers, experience and ability – the trends in the labor market show that the competition for them, the talents as they are referred to by the employers, still exists in full force.
This means for employers that in the current working market situation they do not have the luxury of resting on the laurels even a minute after the recruitment of a coveted talent, since once he enters the company’s gates – another company will already try to kidnap him.
In other words, the competition for talent is so fierce that many, who, even after their enlistment, will continue to receive a variety of tempting job offers, with 30% of employees not leaving for only a month from the job receipt and the start of work.
This is why intelligent employers will immediately move from the stage of recruiting the talent to its preservation stage, when the road begins first and foremost with advance preparation and take creativity in its absorption process.
An efficient, structured and thoughtful absorption process will make the talent enthusiastic about his new place of work from the very first day and even expect to come.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and manage a proper absorption process that will help in the preservation of the new talent:
It's no secret - sharing and readiness of the organization |
Share with the factors that will work with him for his recruitment, explain to them why it is essential and important to society and the role, and how you see his contribution.
A new employee who comes to a place where he is expected and understands his value will feel welcome and will strive to prove the expectations that a son hangs.
Knowledge is power - Coordination of expectations |
On the first day, the Talent held a coordination call with expectations.
Get to know his professional background and see where he sees himself in the future, so you can show him the various and unique tools that you and the workplace can provide him to get there.
We are all people – personal acquaintance |
During the absorption days try to get to know the talent beyond his professional qualities and were interested in his hobbies and interests.
A new employee who is interested and allows him to realize and express himself beyond the boundaries of his job will appreciate it and want to keep it safe.
Curiosity Progress |
Already in the absorption stage you can create attractiveness that will make the talent want to fit in quickly.
Do this not necessarily by talking bonuses and benefits, but by exposing it to an exciting field or to interesting technology, as such stimuli for creativity lead to curiosity and growing interest in the workplace.
In addition, they encouraged the talent to voice his thoughts and opinions to the various projects in the company and made it clear to him that they were important to the organization.

Electricity in the pocket: the cost of not closing the coal stations in June - a billion shekels
Report of the Knesset Research and Information Center: Failure to close the coal stations on the date set in June 2022 is estimated at NIS 1 billion
• The Electric Company: "The policy of using fuels is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy"
.
The economic cost for non-closing of coal stations on the date set in June 2022 is estimated at NIS 1 billion for 2022, according to a report by the Knesset Research and Information Center.
According to the report, this cost is embodied in the consumer electricity tariff, which is expected to increase in the coming months due to the coal increase.
In addition, in 2023, another amount of surplus is expected to be used in coal by about 900 thousand tons, so that this will be reflected in an additional cost to the electricity sector due to the non-closing of coal stations, assuming that the price of natural gas will remain significantly lower than the price of coal.
The report said that the significance of reducing about NIS 1 billion in the 2021 electricity tariff was a reduction of about 4% in the electricity consumption tariff for the home consumer.
In other words, the economic cost of not closing the stations is about a billion shekels, and the total reduction that the home consumer could have had is about 4%.
It should be noted that in the framework of the reform in the electricity sector, it was decided, among other things, to establish a subsidiary of the IEC, which will establish units operated by natural gas, designed to replace the coal units 1-4 at the Orot Rabin site.
Following this decision, a government decision was made in July 2018, which states that the activity of the coal production units 4-1 in the Orot Rabin power plant must be stopped.
The decision set schedules, so that the establishment of the first unit in natural gas will begin in January 2020 and its operation will begin in June 2022, and accordingly the coal-only 4-1 units will also cease to operate on this date.
The IEC said in response: “The policy of using fuels is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy.
In accordance with the Ministry’s decisions, a policy of reducing the use of coal has been implemented in Israel for the minimum possible even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas.”
Paying the price: everything you need to know about the interest rate increase
Cuts incessantly: Next week interest rate on the shekel is expected to rise by half a percent •
How much will the mortgage payment cost?
What is recommended to do? •
All the answers
The escalating inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of more than 4% in the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise interest rates on the shekel as early as next week.
Analysts estimates speak of a raise rate ranging from 0.25 percent to 0.5%.
If the interest rate rises by half a percent, it will already be 1.25%, the highest level in nine years.
This is after years, the interest rate in the economy was close to zero.
The sharp increase in the interest rate increases by hundreds of shekels the mortgage repayments and drastically burdens the households.
With the help of Shai Tzror, a mortgage expert, we checked how much more we will pay and what is recommended to do right now.
If the interest rate rises by half a percent - how much will the monthly payment on the mortgage increase?
A mortgage in the amount of NIS 1.2 million, which is made up of 40% of the prime interest track, the monthly repayment will rise by NIS 125.
How much has the average mortgage been increased since the beginning of the year?
Since the beginning of the year, this has been a significantly sharper increase.
This is because the interest rates in the other tracks that make up a mortgage (and not just in the prime track) have also increased – in an index-linked track and in the fixed interest rate track.
If the interest rate does rise by half a percent, the increase will be NIS 620 in a mortgage of about NIS 1.2 million.
The prime track (40% in this track) will complete an increase of NIS 280, assuming there will be an increase of another 0.5% next month.
The variable interest rate track is linked to the index (26.7% in this track) will complete an increase of NIS 120.
The fixed interest rate track - not index-linked (33.3% in this track) will increase by NIS 220.
So what do you do today?
For those who have a mortgage that is mostly linked to the index, a bundle recommends considering recycling for tracks that are not linked.
For mortgage borrowers who have been significantly increased for them in a significant way and it is difficult for them to meet repayments - he recommends examining to refinance a mortgage and re-release it for a longer period.
This is to reduce payments despite the increase in interest rates, since it is always better to meet repayments and not be insolvency.
As for new mortgage takers - he highly recommends getting to know the different tracks and adjusting the mortgage to their economic capabilities.
The same is true in the future when interest rates fall, they will be able to refinance a mortgage with a minimum early repayment fee.
Regarding buyers of apartments from a contractor - Tzror recommends preceding payments to the contractor and taking out a mortgage now.
It should be taken into account that the "construction input index" significantly raises the price of the property even after the purchase contract has been signed.
The residential construction input price index rose by 6.6% in the past year.
Against the background of the increase in this index, the Banking Supervision Department announced that it was considering the creation of a mechanism that would allow the linkage to be included within the mortgages, but the final decision on the matter has not yet been made.
The price of fuel is increasing - and the Israelis will have to pay more than NIS 8 per liter in July
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price per liter of gasoline 95 octane will be NIS 8.08 •
At the same time, the reduction of half a NIS per liter will be extended by the end of 2022
A record of a decade: The price of gasoline will jump by 36 cents per liter - and will be more than NIS 8 per liter from July 1.
The new price per liter of gasoline 95 octane will be 8.08 and those who wish to enjoy full service will be required to pay another 21 cents per liter.
At the same time, the reduction of half a shekel per liter in the diesal tax will be extended by the end of 2022, the Tax Authority said.
As mentioned above, the price increase is due to the continued rise in oil prices, against the backdrop of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise in the dollar rate.
If it were not for the half-shekel discounted by the government since April, the price of fuel would have exceeded the all-time record – NIS 8.25 per liter.
The validity of the discount ends at the end of July and the Tax Authority and the Ministry of Finance are currently promoting a publication for public comments of an order extending the reduction in the tax on gasoline, which is about half a shekel per liter, until August 9.
In addition, starting on August 10, an additional reduction of another half shekels will be determined, so that only from this date the price of a liter of gasoline will be reduced by one shekel by November 15, 2022.
This was reported by the Tax Authority.
“We have reached a point where I do not remember for five months in a row of excess in the state’s revenue.
We started a few months ago with the issue of tax reduction on diesel fuel.
We are already working on an extension in four months of the Blue, Gasoline and Solizar tax – instead of half a shekel.
It's good for industry and citizen.
If we lower, it will affect inflation, reduce production and ease the cost of living.
As finance minister, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus first on this," Minister Lieberman said at the Horowitz Economics and Society conference of the Israel Democracy Institute.
To date, more than half of the price of fuel is the taxes charged by the government (Blee Tax and VAT) – and this is a high tax rate compared to most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic impact on the cost of living in the economy – because it affects both household expenses and business expenses, public transportation prices and flights, transportation costs, and more.
Third time in a row: Ashdod - the most friendly city for business
Petah Tikva came in second place in the Ministry of Economy's business work rankings •
After them: Rehovot, Ashkelon and Rishon LeZion •
Minister Barbibai: "The Corona emphasized the importance of local government in business development"
.
Ashdod is the most small and medium-sized business-friendly city.
For the third year in a row, the Business Industry Index in the local authorities of the Small and Medium Business Agency found in the Ministry of Economy and Industry, which ranked local authorities.
In second place is the city of Petah Tikva and in third place is Rehovot.
Followed by: Ashkelon, Rishon LeZion, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Beer Sheva, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, Netanya and Bnei Brak.
The agency is editing the local authorities index.
This is the fifth time and its goal is to serve as a tool for the local authority, as it allows each authority to compare its performance to other authorities in a variety of parameters, and to analyze its performance in the areas in which it is active.
The index is based on several parameters that are examined in each authority, which examine the level of the "friendliness" of the Business Authority in its field.
The index divides the authorities into three groups of size by number of residents, as a local authority of up to 50,000 residents is not like a local authority of more than 150 thousand residents.
Tel Aviv has jumped this year
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different rankings in each local authority: business satisfaction, accessibility to tenders, accessibility of information and municipal taxes.
The rating shows that Ramat Gan dropped from second place to eighth place, Bat Yam dropped from fourth place to 12th place and Netanya dropped from fifth place to 13th.
A decline in the ranking does not mean that the Authority’s business service has deteriorated, and in many cases it stems from the fact that the service of other authorities for business has improved more and they have risen in the ranking, while the Authority that has decreased in the ranking has less improved its services for businesses.
Among the immigrants in the ranking are Petah Tikva, who rose from sixth place to second place, and streets that rose from 12th place to third place.
Tel Aviv, which dropped from fourth place to 11th place in 2019, improved in 2021 and rose to sixth place.
“Business – A Growth Engine”
The ranking shows that Nof Hagalil is a leader in local authorities, which include between 50 and 150 thousand residents.
Following is Kiryat Motzkin, Mateh Binyamin, Modiin-Maccabim-Reut, Kfar Saba, Ra'anana, Nahariya, Karmiel, Afula and Hod HaSharon.
28th and last place is located in Tiberias.
“The index is intended to encourage local authorities to make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses, starting at the time of opening the business and throughout its activity with the authorities,” says Minister of Economy and Industry Orna Barbibai.
“Business is a significant growth engine for the Israeli economy and are responsible for about 50% of the business GDP and about 60% of those employed in the economy.
The development of small businesses is in the public interest of all of us, but the local authority has a direct impact on the businesses that are in it.
The coronavirus emphasized the importance of the local government and saw that authorities that operated and encouraged the advancement of small businesses and found creative solutions for them, became the first governmental interface for them.”
Ran Kuiti, director of the Small and Medium Business Agency at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: “Local authorities have a central and essential role in the ability of businesses in their field to thrive and flourish.
In the past two years, in which we are dealing with the Corona crisis, the authorities have greater weight in helping businesses to survive in their field and survive in general.”
2021 by mail: 20 packages per household - and a leap in weight
46.6 million packages arrived in Israel during 2021 - similar to 2020 •
The average weight per package is 435 grams - a 36% jump from 2020 •
The busiest month: December, when the average package weight was 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million mail packages arrived in Israel, almost 20 packages on average per household, according to Israel Post data obtained by Israel Hayom.
The number of packages that arrived in 2021 is similar to 2020, in which 46.5 million packages arrived in Israel, and low from 2019, with 61.6 million packages.
However, this year there was a jump of more than 36% per year in the weight of the packages that came from abroad.
In 2021, 20,253 tons of products from abroad arrived in Israel, a jump of 36%, compared to 14,860 tons in 2020, and 16,743 tons in 2019.
Changes in consumption habits
The average weight for the package jumped 60% in two years—from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
The surge in the weight of the packages is mainly influenced by two main trends, both on the seller and on the part of the buyer: the large shopping sites abroad combine items for one shipment and no longer send any product from the "shopping basket" in a separate package.
On the part of the Israeli consumer, the quick delivery of the shipments, within a few days of order, supports the purchase of more everyday products such as clothing and gifts, which the buyers wish to receive prior to the purchase.
Also in 2021, as in 2020 and 2019, the month when the most packages from abroad came at the highest weight and the highest number of items is December, with 4.2 million packages weighing 2,200 tons.
In December, the average weight per package was 524 grams, 20% higher than the annual average weight.
The Black Friday Effect
More packages came in December than any other month, probably following the November shopping holidays, such as Chinese Singles Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
The big orders start arriving in Israel between one and two weeks after the purchase.
Study: Most employees in the economy are unaware that tax refunds can be received
Many employees deserve money from the state, which can reach tens of thousands of shekels •
Have you changed jobs?
Are you on vacation?
Did you move from the city to the town?
You may be entitled to receive a considerable amount of money in a simple procedure •
All the details - inside
Most employees are unaware of the fact that they are entitled to tax refunds, which can accumulate to high amounts.
The State Comptroller noted in a report from two months ago that two million employees are entitled to tax refunds of NIS 3.6 billion, which means that you should also check whether you are entitled to receive tax refunds.
Many employees can receive a large amount, since four out of five employees are entitled to tax refunds.
In practice, on the other hand, a few tens of thousands of employees are served annually.
If you think that these funds will go down the drain anyway, think again: Employees can apply for income tax for reimbursement for six years back.
Tax:On carried out in-depth research among 4,000 of its customers regarding tax refunds during 2020.
The company has more than 30 thousand customers, so the sample reflects their dispersion in terms of groups in the population and gender, ages and geography.
The data show that during 2020, due to the outbreak of the Corona crisis and the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of workers per shared, there were a number of significant changes, including a 15% increase in the amount of the average return to a household, which was NIS 4,300 a year.
The reason is that the leave fee is lower than the salaries and therefore a gap is created between what the employee paid as a tax and what he actually needs.
By the way, the highest refund received in 2020 a customer of the company was NIS 121,054 for refunds for the past 6 years.
What can I get tax refunds for?
One of the reasons for receiving tax refunds is a change in the workplace.
81% of people who exchanged a workplace during the year generated a tax refund of NIS 2,943.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The data show that 74% of women who gave birth and spent on maternity leave for more than 16 weeks were entitled to an average refund of NIS 3,538 for the same year.
Another reason for the refund is donations.
100% of people who donate and pay taxes have been refunded.
Another cause of refund is not to register credit points for alimony. 63%
The ex-hustles did not update a credit point for alimony and therefore the tax refund for each year that no such credit point has been updated is NIS 2,616.
Due to unemployment - expenditure per NIS: 93% of those who are going on challah or unemployment and who earned over NIS 12,000 received a tax refund of NIS 4021 for that year.
Additional reasons for tax refunds are: repayment for life insurance payments, mortgage life insurance, refund of eligible settlement, refund for losses in securities, failure to register credit points for a man for childbirth and distribution of tax refunds according to geographical location.
- 94% of people who deposited into personal life insurance or for taking out a mortgage were entitled to a tax refund.
In an examination conducted for every million shekels from a mortgage for 25 years, the cumulative tax refund for the period is over NIS 20,000 for the entire mortgage period.
100% of those who move to a qualifying community received a tax refund for the transfer year since the approval of residency in the eligible community is given only after 12 months from the date of becoming an eligible resident and thus in fact the first year is paid full tax.
79% of customers holding securities were entitled to a refund of the said years tax.
However, anyone who owns securities is important to check every year since losses are not rolled from year to year but only through the submission of a report.
56% of men who have a child do not record credit points in the year of birth in the pay slip.
The refund rate can reach tens of thousands of shekels over 6 years.
This is a phenomenon that exists mainly in the Arab sector.
Tax Director:on, Tal Carmon: “The coronavirus crisis has caused the Israeli public to become much more active.
He's interested, checking and demanding what he deserves in income tax refunds.
It turns out that sitting at home, in the leave or after the dismissal, of hundreds of thousands of Israelis for many months, has caused many employees to examine in depth what they deserve from the state.
It is important to know that today all the procedures can be carried out to receive tax refunds digitally, easy and simple, without the bureaucracy that has deterred many in the past.”
Employment market: fewer candidates for the job, more salary
Oljobs Report to Summary 2021: Top of Demand - Jobs Without Experience •
The number of jobs offered increased by 50% •
“Looking for work, but don’t charge the market.”
In the year that just ended, there was a 15% decline in the number of resumes sent, and each position was run on average by only 23 candidates, compared to 41 candidates in the previous year, according to a report by the Oljobs website to summarize 2021, on the coronavirus crisis and its effects on the labor market in Israel.
According to the report, job seekers were mainly interested in job-saturated areas such as administration and sales, for which 1,738,485 resumes were sent.
However, the jobs without experience led to demand with more than 38,000 searches – probably following the return of young people with no professional experience to search for immediate work, at the end of the unpaid leave payments.
The number of sales and administrative searches was 35 thousand and 32 thousand (respectively), drivers and messengers had 11 thousand searches, and the preservation had slightly less than 9,000 searches.
On the other hand, despite the Corona crisis, wages in 2021 increased by 2% compared to 2020, and the average wage in Israel was NIS 11,675 gross.
The monthly salary in the software field was an average of NIS 17,915, and in the analysis of information systems it was NIS 17,140.
However, between the center and the periphery there was a salary gap of more than NIS 2,000: in the center of the country it was an average of NIS 12,500, compared to NIS 10,795 in the north and NIS 10,135 in the south.
From a gender point of view, the average wage gap between women and men, which can also be explained in the type of work and in the volume of hours, was maintained and stood at 36%.
Men earned NIS 13,295, compared to the women's salary of NIS 9,740.
Trying to get back to the line
On the side of the business, there was a cross-growth growth in almost all sectors of the economy, and businesses longed for working hands.
Thus, the job offerings increased by 50% and recorded a record of more than 40 thousand jobs in Aljubs.
A survey conducted by the site among employers found that 50% were optimistic about their economic status in 2022, 30% of them indicated their intention to increase the total funding but 72% understand that they would find it difficult this year.
The largest supply was for jobs without experience – and there were more than 58 thousand on the site.
Afterwards, there were customer service and administrative positions with about 44 thousand jobs in each field, sales and software with 41 thousand jobs each, teaching and education with 24 thousand vacancies, and vaccinators are still in demand in 19 thousand vacancies.
Einav Boymfeld, Director of Research and Content at Oljubs: “Work Seekers are trying to return to the line but do not charge the market, mainly due to the lack of attractive jobs in their eyes.
Also, the prolonged disconnection from the workforce makes it difficult for them to return, and some have found creative ways to make a living.”

"Not self-evident": Subliminal sanctifies the Sabbath - and prepares for independence
Celebrating the fact that "we can live as we want," is excited about meeting the audience and makes sure to spend time with the children •
Weekend and Independence Day of Kobi Shimoni, Subliminal
What does your typical Friday look like?
Weekends are the most important moments in life, for me.
Kiddush and tradition are a very deep root in my soul.
Fridays with me are dedicated to children, Or (10) and Jonathan (8).
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and ingredients for Kiddush, eat lunch and do something fun together, like playing soccer, riding horses or playing cars on a sign.
Sometimes you go to the sea, or even just wash the car, but always stop on the way to buy a gift at the toy store in the neighborhood – and there is always another excuse.
When you come home with a variety of gifts, the smell of cooking is greeted.”
What does your Friday dinner look like?
"I'm blessed with the cooks around me.
On my side is a Persian-Tunisian kitchen, full of salads and an atmosphere of laughs, music, singing and joy.
From my wife Inés side, who is also a great cook, come the Ukrainian dishes, which are deep and spicy, with a lot of meat.
When we get to my mother-in-law, amazing smells from her apartment already come up.
I usually do the Kiddush, along with the children, who know him by heart.
In the end, my fun after eating is to pass out on the carpet, and when the children jump on me like I’m some kind of inflatable.”
Do you have a special childhood memory from the weekends?
“As a child, I would wake up on Saturday to the sound of Israeli music on the network C and the pale tracker sketches, which we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in the Land of Israel, usually to the north.
Every remote corner of the country made him proud of his heart.
He died three months ago of a serious illness, and for him Kiddush and Shabbat were the Holy of Holies, mainly in the sense that the whole family should be together.
I recently published a poem in his memory called 'Keeptain', which I created with Osher Cohen.
I believe that he would be proud of this work, which sanctifies the connection between father and son.”
We will soon mark the 74th Independence Day. As an enthusiastic Zionist, what are your feelings about Christmas?
“Indence Day is a holy day for me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Persia and Tunisia, my parents had to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who is getting to live with his children in our country.
A week or two weeks before Independence Day, I would have climbed trees and tied to a house with Israeli flags.
Today my Independence Days are full of performances, and you always meet an insanely happy audience, celebrating the fact that we can live as we want.
We must keep that our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, have this option, and remember that nothing here is self-evident.”
Friday: Esti Zakheim welcomes the Sabbath
"My dream is to open a big table and invite all my dead loved ones": Friday dinner that Estée Zakheim dreams of, and how does she deal with the fact that her husband keeps Shabbat?
Tell me about your preparations for Shabbat
.
“Preparations begin on Thursday night, when I return from a show or a workshop and cook until three in the morning everything that requires long cooking such as a surfer, roast and sauces.
On Friday, in the first part of the day, I take the time to myself, to meeting friends and friends for coffee, play or movie, or I participate in rehearsals.
In the summer of Saturdays come in late, and I have plenty of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch the sunset or just a good series.
At Shabbat dinner, I usually host my mother, Varda, who celebrated 89, and friends.”
Can you share more cooking?
“I love shortcuts.
For example, instead of peeling 10 onions, cut and crying, I buy a frozen onion bag and fry it.
On my Shabbat table you can find meat dishes, vegan tofu dishes, potatoes and cauliflower in the oven.
Most of the cooking I make, and of course they heat up on the plate on Saturday.
Alejandro, my partner, makes chicken soup, vegetable salad and in winter - the cholent."
Your husband is a religious man and you are a secular home.
How does it work?
"Living with a Sabbath guard is an endless compromise.
"Love your neighbor as yourself," in practice.
For family trips he can't go out, so I've found myself packing up the kids and joining friends' family trips.
In addition, I am also the on-call leadership of the children, the one who returns them on Friday night from parties and meetings.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of his Shabbat, because usually I do not appear on Shabbat and receive a kind of ‘forced vacation’ – and that’s a good thing.”
Who would you like to host on Saturday?
“I’d open a big table and order my ‘deats.’
Sometimes I imagine what if my late brother Daniel were alive, or if my father, Schneor z"l, he would see my children: Uriel (23) and the twins Tamara and Naama (16 and a half).
We’ve probably been fighting about football and politics and we’re so far as each other.”
Do you have a special childhood memory from the weekends?
“We were a warm and unified family.
On Friday afternoon, Mom would make a pile of schnitzels, bring hummus and pita bread from the market and burn eggplant for a tahini salad.
Then we would go to Aunt Hannah in the hand of Elijah, or as she would say, ‘Yad Eliika’, and she would make blintzes.
Since only I didn't like raisins, she would make me some without raisins.
She saw me, the little one in the brothers, and worried about me.
On Saturdays we would take a tour with my father in the port of Jaffa, and he would show us where he and his twin brother, Grisha, came to Israel with nothing.”

.
One of his: Almost two decades after their first love story that ended in a breakup and a year after the high-profile comeback, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck close a romantic and engaged circle.
The happy news was shared last night (Friday) Lopez with her fans on her official website onethejlo.com
.
The news of the engagement comes after the week was documented Lopez was revolving with a huge diamond ring clearly visible on its engagement finger.
A representative on her behalf confirmed to Pipel magazine that Affleck and Lopez were indeed engaged.
Last time, the last time Affleck (49) pulled out a ring and suggested to Lopez (52) to be his forever it was in 2002, and then it was an eye-catching ring with a huge six-carat pink diamond, worth an estimated $2.5 million.
Despite the grandiose love gestures, the two separated in 2004, accusing the media of being obsessed with their lives.
Since then, Affleck has married actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, while Lopez, has been married three times before, including singer Mark Anthony, who together became twin parents.

The Kardashians: “You can’t invent what’s happening to us.”
"The Lant Chaos," Mother Kris Jenner insists on the new series starring the reality TV's first family, and receives backing from her daughters and the new producer •
In an article published in "Shavat" magazine, they talk about the big money, the PR mill, the brand factory and the change that Kim wants to do in the world: "I'm not the same one that thinks for hours about what bikini selfie should be uploaded"
This may surprise many, but the most sought-after brand in 2022 of the Disney Content Empire, which, among other things, also includes Marvel and Star Wars, is the Kardashian family.
The details of the contract of the reality TV and social media against Disney have not been revealed, but the estimates claim a minimum of one hundred million dollars transferred to the family's daughters, which are now also functioning as producers.
In a journalistic meeting with the stars, each accompanied by an entire Beauty team that takes care of makeup, hair and wrinkles in non-stop clothes, the family members insisted, as well as their new and sought-after producer, who this time it is not realistic, this time what is received on the screen is completely authentic.
“You can’t invent what’s happening to us,” the mother of the family Kris Jenner says, “the chaos is never-ending.”
“We’ve been showing how much we’ve grown since that series that came up in 2007,” says Chloe Kardashian.
“When we started, we were frightened, a lot happens to us in life and it is impossible to simply limit everything to a narrative of beginning, middle and end.
A lot of plots were strengled in editing, wrapped in a sweet color film and forgotten on the side.
This is not what life looks like in reality.
Now we are more exposed, turning directly to the camera naturally, not only reality TV, but an authentic documentary series.”
When confronted with their new involvement in the series, which actually gives them complete control over the content received on the screen, Chloe argues: "We are involved behind the scenes, see excerpts while editing and giving comments, but not from a place of defense but simply to give our opinion about what will make the series better.
It's a mirror of our lives and I personally feel that I've been through emotional growth from watching myself.
Kendall and Kaily were little girls when we started, so they more set boundaries.”
"I've grown up"
Kim Kardashian, for her part, continues with all its might to change her image, a cheap trash-reality lawyer with an agenda.
“I’ve grown up,” she says, “I’m raising four black children, that is, from a persecuted community that is discriminated against in this country.
I want to change reality so that my children and the children of all my friends will have a different future, in the hope that we can heal the crooked system.
That’s my motivation.”
“I’m not the same Kim who thinks for hours about what bikini selfie you should bring up,” she insists, “but it doesn’t completely disappear from my life either.
A person must be loyal to who he really is and take everything with fun.”
The reasons for the dismissal of the producer who was discovered by Ryan Sixrest and their new and very profitable way in the industry, the significance of the transition to Disney, the family's oiled PR machine and its impact on brand profitability and more, in the full article that will be published in the magazine "Shavvat".

Tamir Greenberg on his relationship with his father
The winner of the "Next Star" finds a second single and returns to the memories of his childhood and his father's significant presence in his life •
"The song tells about the way to keep the connection remotely," he says.
Tamir Greenberg is a second single named Into The Night after conquering the audience with his first single and featuring "The Next Star".
In recent months, Greenberg has continued many performances: Tel Aviv Culture Hall, Tel Aviv Opera House, Amphitheater of the Tel Aviv Opera, Amphitheater, Amphithear, Gang 11 and dozens of other performances.
The song "Into The Night" was produced and adapted by Greenberg with producer Autumn Beger.
The video, directed by Daria Geller, returns Tamir to memories of his childhood and his father's significant presence in his life.
“The song talks about the relationship between my father and me.
About the period I left the country for the United States and the way to keep the connection from afar," says Greenberg.
In the coming month, Greenberg will appear at the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah in Israel, and towards the new season of "The Next Star", the song he won on the show, Tell Me Where The Light Goes, was chosen as the audition song for the upcoming season.
Made in Blue and White: Yuval Shmal is the biggest winner of the season and the 16th ninja in the world
The Phenoman climbed Mount Doriama in 26 seconds and slapped the title "First Israeli Ninja" •
Yogev Malka climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but will not hold the title of ninja.
the
There is a winner: Yuval Shmal has conquered the Midoriyama, and is the winner of the fourth season of "Ninja Israel" and is now holding the world's first and 16th Israeli ninja title.
Who has been a participant in the show since her first season when he finished first, and in the second season he lost to Gil Marantz.
In the third season he won again and recently returned for the fourth season, and during filming he stated that it would be the last season.
Tonight he first climbed Mount Miduraya in 26 seconds and finished in first place, after defeating contestants Yogev Malka and Yishai Kalfon.
Malka managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds and finished second.
It should be noted that according to the rules of the program, each season can only be one ninja that managed to climb the midriama in time.
Therefore, despite the impressive achievement of the Queen, because Yuval who is full of victorious this season climbed the Midoria in 3 seconds faster, Malka does not win the World Title of Ninja.
He can compete for him again next season.
Well, we realized that full of superhero, Rotem Sela is perfect, and "Ninja Israel" is the most important sporting event in the world
.
Two Olympic medalists and a veteran sports broadcaster sat in the final of a reality show and acted as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
.
Rotem Sela represents for us such a perfect female ideal, it is twisted to portray it like this on TV.
She earns more about Wonder Woman campaigns, she's too pretty, she knows how to put Dana Weiss in place, and when necessary, to defend her business partner.
She is also a mother and a career woman who advertises banks and air conditioners, modeling and leading reality shows and programs, and serves for young girls an unattainable imitation model.
And maybe it makes sense that Rotem Rock is going through a too perfect screen, because in the show she's guiding, you have to be perfect, and there's no need to apologize for that.
In the world of the ninja, everyone is bigger than life, and the hosts first.
Assi Ezer was in trouble with an affair that was supposed to be deleted from the screen for a certain period of time, but since he is not an ordinary human being, he got out of it even before the first collection of advertisements.
Listen to the soundtrack of the event: Niv Raskin, who broadcast European trophies and world records in his life, but is excited about a mega-wall as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
In the final, two Olympic medalists sat alongside him (Jordan Jerbi and Linoy Ashram), as if to emphasize how rare and high-quality the conditions of entry into the superhuman world that has been presenting this reality show for four seasons.
"Ninja Israel" came out of proportion to market the season, which ended last night with Mount Midoriyama and Yuval Shmal who managed to climb it in 26 seconds and was finally crowned Ninja.
That was where he led an almost insurmountable path, which brought down all the superhuman figures that the program made sure to inflate their egos throughout the year.
Want to be a ninja turtle?
Not with us.
This is where you look for superheroes.
The emphasis was on searching for a successor to fill, the so-called "King of Kings and the One of the One," and other nicknames designed to clarify how perfect and one-time it was.
As a result, the level of difficulty was raised, the girls who tried to cope on the season's tracks crashed, and the boys competed among themselves for those who had more squares in the stomach and dict's charisma to get into the shoes of the retired stock.
They will say that this is a sporting program that encourages physical activity and presents overcoming difficulties and challenges, but in terms of the vast majority of spectators – medium-sized armchair sweet potatoes like us - "Ninja Israel" fosters an unattainable sport-achievement model for us.
Faster, stronger, higher, more perfect.
When Gil Sassover moves between punches and conversations about holiness
It's strange to see the comedian, an ex-Comedy Store, host of the "Kabbalah Shabbat" program on Channel 14, in which he tastes removers and gives a stage mainly to men
If we play an association game, we all have similar answers to the question, “What reminds you of the term ‘preparations for Shabbat’?”
Say: Sponge and cleaning, pots on the gas and smells in the stairwell, Yaron Ilan or Avi as a press on TV, but it would be strangest if someone suddenly said "age Sassover".
Because Gil Sasover is in the middle of the sponge and cooking is the most unrelated that TV can offer.
And indeed, "Receiving Shabbat," the new program that is hosted at Friday afternoon on Channel 14, is cut off in spirit from the time it is broadcast.
For half of it, Sassover stands.
He speaks quickly, holds a microphone in his hand even when he tastes doses, and tries to divide the dose between punches and conversations about holiness.
In his defense, it will be said that the lowness of the budget is felt, and this is probably the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.
However, what was also felt on the premiere program, which was broadcast two days ago from Binyamin headquarters, is a clear gender division.
The men sing, play, dance, speak Torah, market restaurants and factories - while the women were satisfied with a small item, in which they said excitedly about managing a sewing shop.
Happy Women's Day to have.
Shabbat reception with Gil Sassover, now 14
The Protected Housing Association vs. Ruti Russo: "To say 'it has a taste of assisted living' harms our activity"
Chairman Yuli Gat sent a letter expressing the union's complaint against an insulting statement, according to them, of the judge "The Next Restaurant" in one of the trailers for the program •
Ruthie Russo said, “It’s happy that there are places that invest more in the culinary of this population.”
The Association of Nursing and Protected Housing in Israel Against the “Next Restaurant”: In a letter sent by Chairman Yuli Gat and arrived at Israel Hayom, it was written: “In the precursor before the broadcast, which was distributed on all social networks and on television, it is described that the professional judge of the competition said ‘food has a taste of sheltered housing’, i.e. food of a closed institution with low-level food.”
“The tone chosen by the program’s judge, Ruthie Russo, to describe her disappointment with the food that the contestant has submitted immediately cancels our many years of activity to fight against the existing ignorance in the field, because the sheltered housing houses operate restaurants in the various homes for the benefit of the residents with chef dishes at the highest level.”
“The service teams and home managers are struggling for the image of the sheltered housing that offers solutions for quality housing for the elderly, including the relief of loneliness, abundant leisure activities, a high standard of living and more.”
In recent years, more and more families and older people have realized that loneliness is the worst illness in old age and see the community places as a proven solution to the disease.
“Food is one of the greatest pleasures in life, so we devote resources and efforts to serve the best food for residents.
Most of the shelters are assisted by professional chefs in order to build a menu.
We will be happy at any time to invite the jury to be impressed by the winning dishes submitted daily to tens of thousands of elderly people in Israel, and on behalf of the chefs and restaurant staff in the protected housing, we will ask for your apologies and clarification.
Come together, the media and Israeli society, to encourage community housing for the health of the elderly.”
Ruthie Russo said in response: “It is happy that there are places that invest more in the culinary of this population, which definitely deserve excellent food in the advanced period of life.
I respect the hard work of cooks, cooks, sanity and chefs everywhere, even in the sheltered housing.”
"Double morals: In Russia you cancel a show but in Israel you didn't cancel?"
Nick Cave responds to criticism
The singer referred to criticism at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of a double standard •
The singer: "The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
"
Nick Cave canceled a concert in Russia earlier this week due to the war and declared that he “is standing alongside Ukraine and praying that the madness will end soon.”
Thus, the esteemed Australian singer joined artists and bands such as Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who also canceled performances in the invading country.
But in Kiev's case, his cancellation notice took a slightly different turn.
A Turkish fan named Ahmet slammed the singer that he was a hypocritic, since in 2017 Kiev refused to cancel two performances that took place in Israel, despite the great criticism he suffered from pro-Palestinian organizations.
At the end of his visit to Israel, Kiev told the local media: “In the end, I’m here for two reasons: the first reason is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second reason is that I’m against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians.”
The same Ahmet remembered Kiev's statements well for music and against politicization.
The fan even posted on the singer's personal and uncensored website, "The Red Hand Files," a poignant post in which he claimed that Israel was also an occupying country, and therefore Palestine's situation is the same as the state of Ukraine.
"What's bothering me about your announcement about Ukraine," Ahmet wrote. “The one who did not support the Palestinians, who also suffer from a brutal police.
In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion, Israel is first and foremost the responsible factor for Palestinian suffering.
This makes me very sad, since you represent a double standard here,” concluded the Turkish fan.
But the story does not end here, as Kiev chose to reply to Ahmet in a long and detailed letter, in which he stressed that “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The first situation is an attack without a previous provocation of a single country in its neighbor, hoping to change the security order of the entire Europe.
The second situation is complex friction between two peoples.
The conflicts are similar in that innocent people, who share a tragic destiny, are forced to hide in shelters.
I feel great sympathy for all these communities – no matter where they are and who it is.”
Kiev added that although he is not interested in detailing his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he certainly also supports the Palestinians, and noted that in the past 20 years he has been involved in fundraising events for them.
"But this is not a time for arguments, Ahmet," the singer clarified, "it's time to unite and support Ukrainians, who are currently taking place on their soil.
I have great fans in Russia, and I know that many Russians are strongly opposed to Putin's regime.
If I could play for them, I would.
In light of the decline in morbidity: the coronavirus project will return to run Ziv Hospital
Prof. Salman Zarqa was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the policy of treatment of coronavirus in the third wave and fourth wave •
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue his role as Victor •
Prof. Zarqa: "I'm glad that the wave of the Omicron continues to fade, and it is still our duty to prepare for another wave"
.
Against the background of the decline in COVID-19, the Corona project, Prof. Salman Zarqa, will return to run the Ziv Hospital in Safed on Sunday.
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue his role as a victor.
“I am happy for the citizens of Israel that the wave of omicron continues to fade and that we have accepted our normal way of life back,” said Prof. Zarqa, adding: “It is still our duty to prepare for another wave of morbidity as a derivative because the virus is still here, in Israel and around the world.”
Prof. Zarka was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the policy of coronavirus treatment in the third wave and in the fourth wave.
Beginning on May 1, Israel has returned to a “between wave” situation, which includes reducing most of the coronavirus systems, while maintaining capabilities for carrying out sequencing tests and investigations, which will form the basis for action in case a new variant is discovered.
Hidden morbidity
The report of the National Information Center for the Corona Campaign, published this morning, noted that “there is a decrease in the average of new confirmed people below two thousand a day, on the weekly average, along with a decrease in the number of hospitalized patients and hospitalized patients in serious condition.”
However, they emphasized that “there is a hidden morbidity of significant scopes and in practice the number of infected is much higher.
The number of institutional tests carried out in the community (without weighing the return tests from abroad, M.I.) is low, and stands at less than 20 thousand tests on a weekly average.
The low scope of tests makes it difficult to identify the trends of morbidity and their understanding.”
State Comptroller's report: The actual budget in most years of activity The Medicines Basket Committee is less than the recommended budget
According to the report by Netanyahu Engelman, for more than 20 years of activity in the basket – the Ministry of Health did not supervise the activity of the committee •
The report also said that the conference meeting protocols are published significantly late, if any •
In addition, the auditor recommends increasing the transparency of the subcommittee's activity – and to update the procedures of the basket work •
Another defect that has been found to concern that since the committee began operations, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds for reports on the scope of the uses and the utilization of the drugs in the basket – which would have allowed to analyze and control the budget given to them.
The Medicines Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees in our daily lives and our health.
Every year, the committee decides on new drugs that will be given to the public free of charge through the HMOs – but a new report by the State Comptroller published on Tuesday warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without conducting control reports on its activities and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council monitoring and examining its activities.
A reporter "Israel Hayom," Ran Reznik, adds that the State Comptroller's investigation was conducted following the ongoing exposures in Israel Hayom on the failures of the basket of medicines.
According to Netanyahu Engelman’s report, he recommends “in the process of expanding the basket, repairs and improvements, which will lead to a higher quality exhaustion of the health basket budget that the public is entitled to.”
Throughout the years of the existence of the supplement mechanism for the medicine basket, in the years 1998 and NIS 8 billion of drugs were added to the state budget – with the addition moving annually in amounts ranging from NIS 0 to NIS 500 million.
In 2019, 2020 and 2021 applications were submitted to add about 800 new drugs and technologies to the healthcare basket, at an annual cost of more than two billion shekels.
In practice, the budget allocated to expand the basket was less than the scope of the applications.
In most years of the committee's operation (90% of the time), the amount of the budgetary supplement was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired supplement rate.
The auditor notes that it is necessary to examine and regulate the amount of the annual addition in order to enable certainty and long-term planning.
Engelman added that “the model of transparency in the work of the basket is lacking.”
Thus, for example, the procedure of the basket committee determines that the conference protocols, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the protocols are published with a delay of 160-109 days, when sometimes the final meetings protocols are not published at all.
“The delay in the publication of the protocols harms the transparency of the decisions; because of this, the ability of the bidders – the patient organizations and the pharmaceutical companies – may be impaired as soon as possible and relevant, after drawing lessons from rejecting their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and corrected their proposals and reassessed their acceptance of them in the next round,” the comptroller said.
“The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols in accordance with the schedules set out in the procedure.”
Out of thousands of submissions, only one financial comment was submitted
Another Engelman review concerns the preliminary process of assessing the technologies submitted to the medicine basket.
The comptroller found that about half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this phase, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the grounds for rejection.
Another impairment relates to the activity of the subcommittee of the basket of drugs that is closed to the media and the public, in which patients' numbers and drug costs are discussed.
The comptroller recommends attaching a public representative or examining the possibility of publishing the discussions to the public without confidential commercial details.
In the procedure according to which the Health Services Basket Committee is working, it was determined that “economic evaluation must be submitted” to the request to add a cure to the basket.
But in practice, over the years, only one economic assessment has been submitted out of thousands of submissions – and the committee makes its decisions without financial evaluation.
For example, for the 2021-2019 basket committee hearings, applications were submitted to add anti-obesity medicines to the basket.
The report found that no economic assessments were attached to the requests, including an estimate of the amount that could have been saved due to reducing damage from diseases originating in obesity or due to the ability to avoid gastric shortening surgery.
It also shows that the decisions of the Medicines Basket Committee are inconsistent with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
Thus, for example, the Ministry of Health defined in 2019 the preventive medicine and preparations for the treatment of tumors of chronic diseases as goals, but in the framework of the decisions regarding the expansion of the basket, there was no emphasis on the need to achieve these goals.
The comptroller also warns that since 2011, the medicines have also included services that are not under the responsibility of the health funds, including various rehabilitation and mobility and mobility devices and vaccines, which are provided by the Ministry of Health (the “third supplement”).
This is when the legal framework for this step is regulated only in retrospect.
In the past six years, NIS 74 million has been used from the addition to the basket of medicines for these services.
Engelman recommends that the Ministry of Health update the procedures of the basket work and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is needed for these services.
About a third of the new drugs that enter the medicine basket are defined as “drugs without additional cost”, the use of which does not cost the health plans for an additional amount because they replace existing treatment.
The auditor proposes to examine the possibility that these drugs will be discussed in a different and abbreviated track, so that the basket of drugs can be updated several times a year and not just once a year.
There is no supervision over the use of expensive medicines.
The audit also shows that since the work of the basket committee began 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health did not ask the health plans to report and did not supervise the scope of the uses and exploitation of the drugs in the basket, information that could have allowed the Ministry to analyze and control the budget given to the health plans.
Over the years, only two reports have been published that relate to the years 2009-2006, and these were also published significantly late (the latter was published this year and dealt with the use of the budget in 2009-2007).
“The delay in carrying out tests may lead to difficulty in collecting and analyzing the data, to the irrelevance of the conclusions that arise from the examination after such a long period, to the optimal pricing of the subcommittee and to make decisions based on non-final findings,” the report said.
In addition, the Ministry also does not criticize and supervise the use of particularly expensive drugs and has not made lessons learned.
This is 10 drugs that accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (NIS 1.7 billion in 2021-2016).
To this, the comptroller wrote: "It is recommended that the Ministry of Health conduct individual controls on these drugs and technologies and analyze the scope of their use compared to the estimates.
Controls and analysis will enable the conclusions of systemic conclusions about the work process of the basket committee and the subcommittee, and how to prepare the estimates during the pricing of the drugs and technologies and improve them.”
"Shocking and Incomprehensible": A heated discussion in the Health Committee on the poisoning in Beit Dafna
The indices of the first deceased attitude were normal ten minutes before her death •
The chairman of the committee, MK Silman: “If people cared there that the kitchen would be like at home, it wouldn’t look like it.”
Ten minutes before the first 40-year-old José from the "Beit Daphne" residence in Holon, she died of food poisoning, medical indicators were taken, according to a hearing on Tuesday at the Health Committee, the daycare center manager.
“We have night caregivers who check during the night and there’s a nurse who does rounds.
There were several reports of diarrhea cases and the same tenant, actually the last time she was taken indices were 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal.
She was under surveillance like the other diarrhea.
She's a nursing patient, we went to get a handout to assist in her transfer and then the same tenant did not respond.
We started CPR and called the clinic nurse," the director of the daycare center described what happened last Sunday morning at the daycare center.
This is an incident in which three residents died, six were hospitalized and in total about a quarter of the residents of the daycare center (33 out of 131) suffered from diarrhea to stop eating polluted surfing meat.
The daycare manager said the allegations against the backdrop of allegations that death from food poisoning indicates neglect and lack of follow-up on the part of the caregivers.
Dr. Naama Noss, head of the epidemiology of the Tel Aviv Health Bureau, said: “We cannot determine conclusively what the three residents died of.
Only blood tests were taken from them.”
It was also discussed that even from the residents hospital hospital, it was no longer possible to have a fecal sample because they did not have it and therefore it is not possible to determine with certainty the cause of death and morbidity.
The Ministry of Health also noted that “the Ministry of Health is examining a sanitary situation in kitchens in institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Welfare or for a renewal of a license.”
The Ministry of Social Affairs admitted that the commission of inquiry had not yet been appointed to this case and in a previous case of the increase in the shelters that occurred three months ago at the Bnei Zion Institute in the Sharon.
The chairman of the health committee, MK Idit Silman, said during the discussion: “If people cared there that the kitchen would be like at home, it wouldn’t look like it.
The residents of the welfare dorms need more.
They are sensitive to health and need supervision and care.
It's shocking and incomprehensible what's going on in there.
The terrible findings that were discovered are even after they knew that the Ministry of Health came to check.
Where is the inspection and responsibility of the offices?
How is it that a discussion is not present by the ministers and the directors of the firms who will give an explanation about what is happening here?”
Yigal Natumi, CEO of Beit Eckstein, who manages the daycare center and even managed the daycare center himself, said, "Hundreds and thousands of people in the entire array rise up only for one purpose: to do good for people.
The people who died are people I treated personally.
One of the tenants I put my hands to sleep.
It’s a shocking event for us.”
Smadar Oona, a former resident of the daycare center, burst into his past and said, “Enough with the lies and the beautiful words.
I was there.”
Gali Barami, parent representative in Akim Israel: “We have complained about the food in the past and did not receive the criticism.”
Oren Hellman, founder of the project, is an equal chance for integrating people with disabilities protested that the names of the deceased resented were not published: “Their names are not even known.
Are they worth less?
We underestimate the lives of our children.”
Suspicion of a Wolfson failure: the surgeon caused a tear in the heart - and the patient died.
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Pras Abu Akar as director of the hospital's breast surgery unit •
The chairman of the Medical Board complained that the director, Dr. Engel, was warned before his appointment •
Hospital: "He's valued and experienced"
First publication: A horrific error occurred at the Volfson Government Hospital in Holon, when during surgery the doctor performed a rupture in the patient's heart, which led to his tragic death.
The 83-year-old lung cancer patient was performed on April 19.
This was the first surgery performed by Dr. Pras Abu Akar at the hospital, after he was appointed director of the Wolfson Breast Surgery Unit.
During the operation, designed to drain the area surrounding the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large tear in the heart, which led to severe bleeding and caused the patient's death.
However, the unusual complication opened a Pandora's box, which raised difficult questions when it came to the hospital management.
The director of the oncology institute and the chairman of the Medical Board, Dr. Ronen Brenner, demanded an investigation of the affair in a letter he gave to the hospital director, Dr. Anat Engel.
The letter raised very serious allegations about Dr. Engel’s conduct and the appointment of Dr. Abu Akar, after the director of the previous unit, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, moved to Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer.
Huge hole in the heart
According to Dr. Brenner’s letter, the patient has been clear, functioning and treated by him for the past four years.
He recently had the spread of the disease, and an abnormal accumulation of fluids within the pectory membrane was discovered, in which the heart muscle was found.
Also, surgeon Dr. Abu Akar was impressed that he could perform the surgery.
According to the complaint, the surgery had a serious malfunction, and Dr. Hagai Dekel, director of the cardiac and chest surgery department at Wolfson, who was at the same time in the operation of a child in the next room, "was horribly called to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart."
According to him, the heart was depleted of blood, the blood pressure was zero, and the surgical approach was wrong.
In addition, Dr. Brenner said that Dr. Dekel approached him and told him that Dr. Abu Akar is not professionally and personally suitable for managing a breast surgery unit at Wolfson.
However, despite his explicit warnings and even though he was supposed to be the direct manager of the chest surgeon, Dr. Engel made a tender without sharing it and received Dr. Abu Akar for the position.
He added: “This is an uncomplicated process, which lasted a few minutes,” he added: “It is impossible not to address the flawed process of accepting Dr. Abu Akar for the position.
The question arises whether there is an English direct responsibility for the failure of the surgery and the death of the patient.”
Experienced surgeon
According to Israel Hayom, information and claims by other senior physicians who reinforce the questions raised in the affair Dr. Ronen Brenner.
Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, director of Surgistry A at Wolfson, responded to Brenner's complaint and wrote that Dr. Abu Akar is "one of the most experienced surgeons in the country, but a relatively young breast surgeon."
He added that he was chosen in a proper tender and Dr. Dekel did not take part in it, in accordance with his statements about his desire to "detach" from the chest unit.
He added: “I wasn’t a partner in the procedure either, and I may have been.
Dr. Shimonov wrote that Dr. Pras Abu Akar began working on April 10 and is entitled to 100 days of grace, "All hospital doctors were impressed by his professionalism and motivation and willingness to work.
He has already committed dozens of cases of similar procedure, and unfortunately the current case ended as it ended in an unfortunate way.
Wolfson Hospital said in response: “We share in the family’s grief.
This is an oncologist Dr. Ronen Brenner's patient.
The breast surgeon mentioned in the article is an esteemed surgeon with many years of experience, and was selected in the tender for the management of a breast surgery unit associated with the surgical department at Wolfson Hospital.
“According to Dr. Hagai Dekel, his words quoted are inaccurate and removed from their context.
It should be noted that this is a patient who was unfortunately in a very difficult situation.
The hospital examines the details of the case transparently, and the Ministry of Health is familiar with the details of the case.”

About Prof. Marvin Shapira z"l
The encounter that opened my eyes - and changed my life
If I had not met the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was the director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Hadassah Hospital, I would probably have remained an expert in internal medicine.
He's the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to deal with it.
I met him in the halls of Hadassah, then in the 80's of the last century.
For a moment I didn’t think I would leave my inner, for I loved the treatment of the patient himself; but Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases was also reflected in neurology, both internally, and in any area.
I thank him for bringing me into this field.
All along, I've loved his investigative approach, an approach that's going to the root of the problem.
The discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor in every fiber of his soul, who loved the sick and taught me not to accept things for granted and to examine everything in depth.
He was a real and honest, egoless person, qualities that I loved very much.
Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me and influenced me the most, I was going to choose my father, the late Dr. Joseph Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.
He was an amazing doctor who influenced me to go to medicine, but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapira.
Both, for example, have drowned proverbs that doctors use to date - for example "Tisho Iz de Ishio", that is, taking a biopsy of tissue from the infected organ makes it possible to know what drugs should be given; or "Won Yu Hughet, Huzel It", which is intended to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to the bacteria becoming resistant to it.
The late Prof. Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked in Hadassah and father of two daughters.
He died about a year ago, and when I visited his family at seven, I cried.
He was something - a witty, wise epidemiologist, who volunteered for everything.
He never complained, not even during his illness.
He was one of the first doctors on the programmat treatment team, and he was very lacking during this time.
If he were with us today, I'm sure I'd consult with him, and I'm sure he'd be one of the team leaders to treat the pandemics.

About Prof. Shaul Suknik
Teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors
.
I met the late Prof. Shaul Suknik for the first time when I was a student in the fourth year of medical studies, and I came to an internal medicine tour of the internal department D. which he managed.
Later I also returned to the department in the sixth year, and I did the thesis of the medical school under his guidance, writing a computerized simulation on a patient with polyertheritis (multivatitis in multiple joints).
Shaul influenced every significant crossroads in my professional life over the course of 20 years, and was the most significant man in shaping my image as a doctor; not only professionally, but also - and especially - personally and humanly.
During the internship, I debated family medicine and internal medicine, and I consulted with him about the choice of internship.
In the end, I chose to specialize in internal medicine with him in Soroka.
During the internship he provided me with constant guidance, in a variety of channels - in scientific writing (sorry Saul, I did not persevere enough), in contact with patients, working in a multidisciplinary team - a field in which the department excelled - and in fact, in every aspect related to medicine.
To this day, I see, as a doctor and as a manager, characteristics that come from Saul.
When I finished my internship and debated whether to travel for a period of training abroad, Shaul pushed and directed me, and helped me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to conduct myself.
The training period was a very important period for my professional development, and without Shaul’s support and push, it is not certain that this would have happened.
On my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital administration, again Shaul was the one who supported and assisted.
Later we crossed together complex periods in the Internal Medicine Division.
Shaul knew how to wonderfully integrate the teacher, principal, friend and teammate, without his various roles interfering with each other.
I strive to succeed like him in this special combination.
He has raised generations of students, interns and interns, who are currently in the Israeli medical system, and commemorate in their excellent work of his memory and work.
It is my honor to be among this group.

Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev, Director of the Schneider Children's Medical Center |
About Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld
The man who taught me medicine, especially listening.
Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld, the former founder and director of the Intensive Care Unit at the Schneider Children's Center, taught me to become an intensive care physician, but more than that - he taught me to think.
The obvious I learned from him is to take care of the most complex, the most sick.
The children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.
The obvious is to have very difficult, perhaps the most difficult conversations, with families who never imagined that they would get into these complex situations in an intensive care unit with their children.
Sounds weird, but that's obvious.
But I learned even more meaningful and deeper things from him.
Looking back, because I’m a doctor who is a director and a director who is a doctor, it is clear to me today the connection between the worlds; the education I received from Dr. Sheinfeld connects them.
Dr. Sheinfeld taught me to listen to many things: to listen to the children, to listen to the monitor, to listen to the nurses, the young and old caregivers teams, and listen to the parents.
All this needs to be done not only to communicate more correctly and more successfully, but to constantly gather a lot of information that can prevent the next deterioration.
The preventive processes in the care of children exist everywhere, and of course also in intensive care.
Listening and discourse inspire a deeper understanding, both on the part of the caregiver staff and on the part of the patients and their families.
My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true in looking at a whole system.
The more in-depth and meticulous understanding there is, which combines all the caregivers in the discourse, the more accurate decision-making process will be, adapted to the situation, and especially - early enough to prevent future, immediate or distant damages.
That's why Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld is much more than an inspirational character for me.
He is a person who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think quickly and accurately, to listen - and then apply.

Medical Malpractice in the Different Stages of Birth
In order to receive compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the negligence, that the damage was caused due to the same negligence
Birth is one of the most joyous and exciting events in a family’s life.
Unfortunately, however, births often end with serious damage caused by the mother or the newborn as a result of the negligence of the medical staff.
In cases where the birth ended with physical injury, newborn or mother, there is room to examine the sequence of events that have led to the injury and even consider seeking legal advice.
A lawyer specializing in the field of medical malpractice will examine whether there were defects in the conduct of the medical staff in the various stages of birth that caused the damage and if he saw fit he will turn to consult a medical expert in the relevant field.
It should be emphasized that not every mistake in treatment on the part of the medical staff arises in the malpractice (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that management was negligent.
When is it negligence?
When the doctor’s mistake was due to a lack of skill or veered from the reasonable level of caution, and the incompetence and deviation from the accepted level of caution caused damage to the patient who would not have been caused had it not been for the doctor’s driver.
In this article we will examine the different stages of birth, explain what are the complications that may occur in each of the stages and when they arise to medical malpractice.
Stage of contractions
The contraction phase lasts an average of 8 to 14 hours.
At this stage, the cervix is gradually opened (in order to allow the passage of the fetus at birth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.
Most medical malpractice cases in the contraction stage deal with the failure to identify fetal distress before birth, which caused damage to the newborn, which is sometimes manifested in cerebral palsy.
Cerebral palsy (CP):
Cerebral palsy may be caused by non-recognition or delay in identifying a sublivarian shaft, which is reflected in the failure of oxygen supply to the fetal brain tissue.
As a rule, monitoring the mother's condition and correctly deciphering the monitor that monitors the activity of the fetal heart should lead to early detection of the development of fetal distress, which allows the medical staff to act quickly and rescue the newborn before irreversibly injured.
Cases in which the medical team ignores signs indicating that the fetus suffers from a lack of oxygen or that the staff does not correctly interpret data in front of it, and especially the fetal monitor or responds late to the distress expressed in the monitor, may constitute negligence.
Cerebral palsy may also be caused by the prolapse of the umbilical cord and as a result of a uterine rupture that was not detected in the time.
Even in these difficult events, it is appropriate to find out whether the medical staff acted properly.
For example, Adv. Anna Reif Liegenza, from Caspi Saror & Co., who specializes in representing medical malpractice victims, said that her office handled the claim of a child who was injured during his birth after the midwife expired the amniotic sac when the fetal head was too high, thus leading to the navel rope prolapse (when the umbilical cord precedes the fetal head) and damage to the oxygen supply to the fetal brain (as a result of pressure on the umbil cord).
In another case, the lawyer said that her office filed a lawsuit due to serious medical malpractice of the staff of the maternity department in a large hospital that during childbirth did not identify at the time clear signs that required real suspicion that the mother suffers from a rupture of the uterine in the surgical scar area of her previous pregnancy.
The fetus that was ejected through the rupture in his mother's uterus into the abdominal cavity suffered severe fetal distress until it was delayed at a late stage when it was on the verge of death.
Due to the severe fetal suffering during his birth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.
It should be emphasized that in order to receive compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal connection between the negligence of the medical staff that led to the failure to identify the squirrel and the damage caused to the newborn, meaning that the damage was caused by such negligence and not from any other reason or factor.
The examination of the causal relationship will be carried out by examining medical indicators that according to the medical literature only in their existence there is a causal connection between the shanish and the brain injury.
Among other things, the indices of the level of acidity in the fetus's blood, its apgar scores, the existence of a neurological and systemic injury, and more.
Death of the Fetus
The active stage of birth
The active stage of birth begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 cm and ends at the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.
Deliference at birth and avoidance of performing a C-section
In some cases, dysfunctional birth develops, i.e., a lack of progression of the active birth process.
In such situations, it is customary to perform a C-section, in order to prevent various damages that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay at birth.
“There are cases in which failure to perform a cesarean section in a timely manner can cause irreparable damage to the fetus,” Rafe-Ligenza explained to us.
“For example, we conducted a medical malpractice claim for childbearing death caused by a significant delay in performing a C-section.
Unlike any recognized medical practice, medical staff members did not recognize the fetal distress and perform a C-section despite the particularly slow progress of the birth.
The delay in performing the operation caused extensive systemic damage to the birth, which eventually led to her death shortly after her birth.”
Negligence in vacuum birth
In situations where a mother or fetus is in a significant danger that requires a particularly quick termination of the birth, a vacuum birth is sometimes performed (a vacuum tuber).
In this process, a vacuum is attached to the petus' head and pull the fetus out by force.
Naturally, this action involves dangers and may cause damage to both the fetus and the mother and therefore requires great care, accuracy and skill.
In these events, medical malpractice may be expressed in the fact that the doctor does not adhere to the binding guidelines and performs the operation despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the head of the fetus is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for a longer time than permitted or when despite the failure of a large number of attempts, the doctor continues to repeat the procedure more than the number of attempts allowed.
In these cases, if the negligent vacuum action has caused the newborn damage – among other things, it can cause rudge damage and bleeding that may cause the development of brain damage – there is room for filing a tort claim.
ERB Paralysis
Arb paralysis is a congenital nerve injury to the brachial plexus (a nerve node that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is worth checking whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetric staff.
The injury is manifested by the weakness of the hands muscles and can reach up to complete paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of a 'should disorder' - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the fetus's shoulders are trapped in the face of the birth canal after its head is released.
When should you suspect that the paralysis is caused by medical malpractice?
In cases where the weight assessment of the fetus indicated that it is a macrosomy embryo, that is, it is expected to be born at a weight exceeding 4.5 kilograms and in accordance with the instructions, it is better to deliver the mother by cesarean section.
When the weight of the newborn is over 4 kg, a C-section should be considered in light of the risk factors, including gestational diabetes and the elongation of the second stage of birth.
In the event that the medical staff ignores an abnormal weight assessment of the fetus or from other risk factors and chooses to continue vaginal birth and the risk of ERB shoulder disorder and paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical malpractice.
Indeed, in CA 2694/90, the Supreme Court ruled that “the risk that during childbirth will occur shoulder stenosis can be predicted in advance to some degree of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder stenosis, where there is a concern for its occurrence is to conduct a C-section.”
Placenta exit stage
The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the newborn and is accompanied by bleeding.
The process takes up to half an hour in most cases from the moment of the baby's departure and according to a large part occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical staff.
After the placenta left, the medical team will check whether it left in its entirety or whether there are parts of the placenta left in the womb.
Within this stage, there may be complications that can cause serious damage to the mother.
One of the familiar complications from the remainder of placenta residue in the uterus is called "Asherman syndrome", the scarring of the uterine wall scarring the result of inflammation caused by the remaining placenta residue in the uterus, a phenomenon that damages the endometrium in a way that does not allow pregnancy rooting.
Therefore, in cases where the medical team did not identify that there were latile residue left or did not take all measures to prevent harm to the endometrium despite the suspicion of the leftovers in the uterus, it may be medical malpractice and the case is suitable for a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer in the field.
Death of the mother
The death of a mother during childbirth is a rather rare euro.
In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy to the whole family unfortunately becomes the most tragic event for it.
In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the mother on time or reacts late to such bleeding.
"For example,...", Attorney Reif-Lignaza said to us, "Our firm filed a lawsuit concerning the death of a mother, when in that case the medical staff ignored and did not respond to the mother's worrying vital bookmark, for long hours, and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the background disease from which she suffered."
"In another case...", Attorney Reif-Lignaza said, "Our firm represented the relatives of a mother who died after the birth of twins due to a bleeding originating in the section of the C-section that was not properly sewn.
In that case, the mother complained of severe pain and weakness after surgery, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and her clinical condition, reacted late only after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death.”
Loss of womb
In severe cases, medical malpractice may lead to a hysterectomy, says Adv. Rafe Lingza: "Our firm has conducted a claim against a hospital that is based on a hysterectomy due to medical malpractice after birth.
In the same case, the mother, a 31-year-old woman, lost her womb due to a lack of proper treatment for massive bleeding observed by the medical staff after birth and yet they were not taken during the actions that could prevent the damage.
What are the compensations awarded in claims for medical malpractice at birth?
Childhood compensation for injury due to medical malpractice at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant sums being given for pain and suffering, long-term care and caring for wages, salary losses and pensions for the injured person and even his parents and other damage components.
The compensation awarded to a damaged minor for salary and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the economy.
In addition, the compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical accessories and rehabilitation, the cost of adapting housing to the baby's needs, mobility and more.
"The amount of compensation is determined in each case and according to its circumstances," says Adv. Reif-Lignanza, and she adds, noting that "today most of the claims on the grounds of medical malpractice end in a compromise that considers the chance and risk that each party has in the conduct of the proceeding," the attorney added, adding that "there are cases in which the proceeding ends only in a judgment, so if the claim is not rejected, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages.Compensation exceeds ten million shekels.”
In conclusion
Medical malpractice at birth is undoubtedly the nightmare of every family.
In these cases, a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that caused the tragic result, by a skilled lawyer in managing claims on the grounds of medical malpractice, can help you win the compensation you deserve.
This is the reason for the incidence of eye disease keratoconus in the south
Research found that there is a link between the development of the disease and the marriage of relatives •
The highest incidence has been found in the Bedouin sector.
Expert: “It is possible that in every sector with many weddings between cousins, there is a high incidence of the disease.”
Keratoconus is an inherited eye disease that causes some visual impairments.
It is very important to diagnose it as soon as possible, and find the right solutions to prevent the worsening of the situation.
In recent years, several studies have been conducted that help to understand how the disease develops, and has developed innovative treatments.
The new studies give a research basis to the suspicion that the caratoconus eye disease is genetic disease.
A recent study, which dealt with turning the cornea form from a dome into a cone, has found that the cause of the disease and the weakness of the cornea and its form is deformed to be associated with an enzyme imbalance, which results in free radicals can damage the proteins in the cornea – and its structure will change.
The source of the same enzyme deficiency is genetic, a fact that strengthens the hypothesis that keratoconus is a hereditary disease.
According to Prof. Ariella Gordon-Shag, head of the Department of Optometry Sciences at Hadassah Academic College, “In a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa, a keratoconus of 3.2% was found.
The highest prevalence was with students from the Bedouin sector - 20% had keratoconus, but there was a small relative sample."
The researcher added that this was not surprising: “There is a great prevalence of keratoconus in the Bedouin sector.
In our studies, we found that marriages of relatives are a risk factor for keratoconus.
So in any sector with many weddings between cousins, we may find a high incidence.”
In this context, it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unequivocal conclusion: in cases where a family story of keratoconus disease appears, all family members must go for an appropriate eye exam as soon as possible.
According to Arza Fruchter, clinical optometrist B.Sc., “There is a tenfold appeal to the clinic from remote peripheral areas, mainly from the southern region, compared to the center.”
Fruchter adds that “in the last decade I have noticed that most patients are turning from the periphery, especially from the Beer Sheva area.
This is mainly due to the high incidence of marriage within the family (especially in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and a lack of awareness of the right treatment of the problem.”
How is the disease diagnosed?
Fruchter explains that keratoconus usually develops in adolescence or in the late teens (ages 16-15 or 20).
The disease includes a decrease in vision, in parallel with the increase in the cylinder.
Keratoconus patients testify to distorted and/or blurry vision of characters and objects.
These signs worsen with the development of the disease, which usually develops slowly and gradually over the years.
However, the disease may also develop at a rapid rate and peak within just a few months.
Many patients also indicate increased sensitivity to light.
About three years after the operation in Gaza, the IDF revealed the name of Lt. Col. M.; Bennett: "Now, the people are familiar with the face of the hero of Israel"
Mahmoud Khir al-Din from the village of Hurfeish is a lieutenant colonel who was killed in an operation in Khan Yunis •
Head of Military Intelligence: "The publication deserves him, his family and his children" •
Subsequently, the possibility of publishing the picture of Lt. Col. Emanuel Moreno from Sayeret Matkal
About three and a half years after the operation that became entangled in Khan Yunis, the IDF permits today to publish that the fatality in the operation, Lt. Col. M., is the late Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khair a-Din from the village of Hurfeish in the north.
41 years old was in the fall.
Prime Minister Bennett said after the publication: “It has been three and a half years since the late Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Hir Al-Din fell in battle in a secret operation in Khan Unis, and only now we are allowed to reveal his name and thank him for his contribution and dedication to the security of the state.
‏"The late Mahmoud was a fighter in a paratrooper patrol and then grew up in the army to be a lieutenant colonel in the IDF's special operations system.
The hero of Israel, who was decorated after his death in the Chief of Staff’s Unit.”
He added: “I eulogized him at his funeral and now there is a right for the people of Israel to know him, the name and the face of the hero of Israel, Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khir Al-Din, openly.
The environment looked up at him.
Since the operation, the IDF has banned the publication of its name for security reasons, and today, after a discussion held by the head of the Intelligence Division, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, with representatives of the military censorship, and with the consent of his family, it was decided to publish his name and picture.
Mahmoud Khir al-Din, the hero of Israel, was born on December 28, 1977 in the village of Hurfeish in the Upper Galilee, the firstborn son of his parents Ahmad and a nun, with seven brothers and sisters.
He's a Druze member.
He was married to Nahed and the father of two sons.
He served as an officer, fighter and commander in the Special Operations Division in the Intelligence Division.
Throughout his life, Khir al-Din was a social leader, and the environment looked up to him.
Until the ninth grade he studied at the school in Kfar Hurfeish, and then moved to the military boarding school at the Reali School in Haifa.
In October 1997 he enlisted in a paratrooper patrol, and in 2000 he graduated from the Officers' School.
In 2002 he was located by the AMAN Special Operations System and moved to the server.
During his service, he completed a bachelor's degree in law at the College of Management and a master's degree in education and business administration at the University of Haifa.
In 2002 he met his wife, Nahed, and in 2004 they married.
Their first son was born in 2009, a year during which he established an association with his friends who work to promote the status of the Druze community in Israel.
In 2010, he joined the "Aharei" association and began guiding a group in Kfar Hurfeish, after making sure that the association began operating in the Druze villages to encourage the youth to enlist.
In 2013 his second son was born.
The head of Military Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: “For now, we have been becoming the issue of exposing the name of Mahmoud Khair al-Din, the hero of Israel.
We finished work and concluded that there is no security impediment to publishing his name and picture.
He also deserves it, his family and his children," he said.
"Extraordinary educator and leader"
"Thanks to many operations, he's nothing short of a hero to me," said Maj. Gen. Haliva.
“He has a significant contribution, which has courage and coolness, to the State of Israel.
He should have the right place for him.”
He added: “I didn’t know him personally, but he was an educator, an educator and an exceptional leader – not only on the operational side, but also in my values.”
Maj. Gen. Haliva noted that he would later examine whether to publish the picture of another hero, Lt. Col. Emanuel Moreno of the General Staff patrol, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and his photo was not allowed to be published.
The operation took place in Khan Yunis on November 11, 2018.
The operation was a long-month culmural of meticulous preparations in which the intelligence community took part.
In the command squad of the operation, then Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, then-head of Military Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Tamir Heyman and the head of the Shin Bet at the time, Nadav Argaman.
The purpose of the action has not yet been allowed to be published, and the IDF emphasized that this is an action whose intelligence value is invaluable.
But in the Arab media, radio equipment was presented in retrospect that the Palestinians were left behind by the forces.
According to Hamas, the operation was intended to place listening devices.
According to reports, on the day of the incident, the force traveled in two vehicles.
The fighters were arrested at a checkpoint deployed by Hamas members, and something in their behavior provoked the suspicions of Hamas operatives.
The activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.
The investigation took about 45 minutes, during which it became more and more aggressive.
When the force realized that it was in a problematic situation, Lt. Col. Khir al-Din succeeded in distracting Hamas members, and in a split second, the commander of the force, Lt. Col. A, managed to open fire.
Three Hamas members were killed in the fire, and unfortunately also Lt. Col. Khir al-Din.
Ten months after the difficult event, Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, decided to accept the recommendation of the CV committee and to award a Chief of Staff's commendation to three of the fighters in the incident deep in the Gaza Strip, including the late Lt. Col. Khir al-Din.
The commander of the fighting force and another fighter on the team also received a commendation.
The military said in a statement that Lt. Col. M. received the commendation for "his activities in the operation with his crew, in enemy territory, with determination, coolness and courage, to protect his friends.
He later acted with initiative and striving for contact, taking a forward role in taking over the enemy and acting with the resourcefulness to promote the takeover.
Consider switching from tweezers to an extensive operation
Israel should ask itself, again, if it is not right to change policy in front of the Jenin sector.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would light up and ignite the West Bank, but it is possible that the gunmen of Jenin will leave her no choice.
The stormy weekend we went on shows that although the month of Ramadan is behind us, the area is still more disemplified than ever.
It will take a great deal of effort and a common sense to cross safely the next two mention dates: the day of the “Nakba” that is on Sunday, and Jerusalem Day, which will be marked in two weeks.
Quite a few factors will stand by trying to tredo to return to sanity.
First, as always, the terrorist elements, are setting up a special effort in an attempt to preserve the violent atmosphere of recent weeks.
Evidence of this was given during the arrest operation in which the late SWAT fighter, the late Rabbi Noam Raz, was killed.
Fighters who participated in the battle in Jenin testified that they do not remember such a scope of shooting and violence - a testament not only to the huge amount of weapons in the field, but also to the willingness to use it.
This requires Israel to ask itself, again, if it is not right to change policy with the Jenin sector, and to move from small intelligence-based tweezers operations to a large and mass-based operation.
During the Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would turn on and ignite the West Bank and the entire arena in its wake; even now, the defense establishment prefers to act selectively, when it is necessary, to avoid incarceration, but it is possible that the armed Jenin will not allow it to leave it with any choice.
To draw the lessons for future events.
Raz's death in battle is the best answer that Israel can give to anyone who claims that deliberately killed the journalist Al-Jazeera, Shirin Abu Akala.
Operational activity is a dangerous matter for those who participate in it, and for those who are present at the scene.
The IDF takes enormous risks to its forces in order to avoid harming innocents as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it in the lives of fighters.
This indicates high morality, but there is also an operational-indicative value: a terrorist caught alive – as happened in Jenin – is an excellent source of information about weapons, attacks and other terrorists; it is information that cannot usually be obtained in a different way, and through it it is possible to thwart the following attacks.
The IDF acted correctly when he published the interim investigation conducted in Abu Aqala’s death affair, and made it clear that it was impossible to determine at this stage who caused her death.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful whether it will be possible to reach a unequivocal bottom line in the affair.
In any case, it seems that nothing will convince those who are convinced: the world has already hurried to condemn Israel without bothering to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terror – the original grounds under which the IDF is constantly acting in Jenin.
As always, the nature of such stories perish.
World public opinion is busy with its ripe and moving on, certainly when Ukraine continues to run wild a long time more intense war.
Therefore, it is a pity that Israel insisted on giving Abu Aqala’s death another unnecessary moments of exposure, with the police’s unsuccessful treatment at her funeral.
Even if Abu Akala’s family did not meet the early summaries, a little more restraint had to be expected from the policemen who accompanied the funeral procession, and certainly to be less excited about the Palestinian flags that were raised in it.
The responsibility is required: to act to calm the situation.
The Minister of Public Security and the police commissioner did well that ordered the investigation of the incident.
It seems that it lacks sufficient preparation and clear instructions, but it is disturbing the fact that this is the second time it has happened to the police in a short time, and in two different districts.
In the attack in Dizengoff, the police also failed to manage the incident, isolation and media treatment.
The commission of inquiry will do well if it is not only satisfied with the analysis of the conduct of the policemen in the funeral itself, but also to draw conclusions that will enable more successful treatment of similar events in the future.
Alongside the internal police treatment, it is also committed to paying attention to the conduct of elected officials who have lost a way and direction.
There are currently several members in the Knesset who appear to be a danger to democracy.
They are on the left and right, and exploit their immunity not to challenge the country, but to harm it.
MK Ofer Kasif is the last example of this; if no steps are taken against him – including prosecution for assaulting a police officer – the state will encourage the next elected official to further exaggerate his actions.
Such moves, which are defensive democracy, are volatilely essential of this period, with elements seeking to exploit the situation for political purposes.
Anyone who has a common sense in his head is expected to rise above all this, and to act to calm the situation; otherwise, Israel may quickly slide in front of enemies from the outside, and worse – against domestic opponents.
Police official: "Government policy is required here and setting goals"
Although the Israel Police launched an operation to eradicate the phenomenon of illegal residents, the road is still long •
There is no one element in the State of Israel that is engrading this whole thing.”
“If you want to address the phenomenon of illegal aliens, government policy is required, and from it, goals, tasks and responsibility must be derived.
Today, there is not a single element in the State of Israel that is integrating this whole issue,” a senior police official told Israel Hayom.
Until a month and a half ago, before the escalation in the security situation, the phenomenon was expressed in about 20 to 30 thousand NIS that enters daily through the fence breaches.
In addition, between 100 and 110 thousand Palestinians with work permits enter work in Israel daily through 34 supervised crossings.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each industry is limited in the quota set by the political echelon in accordance with the security, economic and political situation in the State of Israel.
The permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liberation Administration.
In light of this, the IAU is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is prohibited due to criminal involvement or conspiracy to attacks, but in many cases, these are Palestinians whose entry is prohibited because they do not meet the permitted permit quota.
It should be emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Elad were indeed considered by the IDFs, but were not supervised, because they had not previously committed any criminal offense that required security officials to supervise their movements.
“Therefore, there is no significance to their entry through the breaches in the fence,” says a senior security official, “whoever wants to carry out an attack can enter the country even through the supervised crossings, and there have been such cases in the past.
Thousands of arrests
Following the attack in Elad and in light of a multitude of warnings for the attacks, the police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal aliens.
By the end of the week, about 16,000 IAH had been arrested.
Of these, about 600 were investigated and criminal cases were opened, and about 200 were imprisoned.
According to the police prosecution policy, proceedings against an illegal alien are carried out only against prone criminals or people who repeat the act over and over again (recidivists).
An illegal alien who was arrested for the first time was interrogated, documented and returned to the territories.
Sometimes it is repeated for the second time, but only for the third time he was arrested, imprisoned and indicted for illegal stay.
According to the law, if an illegal alien is perceived in the range of about 50 to 100 meters on each side of the separation fence, its treatment is carried out by the military prosecution.
Data obtained from Israel Hayom indicate that in 2021, 40,010 illegal aliens were treated by the police, transporters and complainants.
7,405 illegal aliens were arrested, and a criminal record was opened for 19,533.
The number of employers, transporters and milins treated by the police in 2021 was 6,537.
469 arrested, and 5,640 criminal cases were opened.
“The basics of the phenomenon of the IDF are not dependent on the police, not in the IDF, not in Israeli society, and not in Palestinian society.
They depend on other factors," says a senior law enforcement official.
“In order to address the phenomenon, they must be sterilized by their motivation to go out to work in Israel, and on the Israeli side, they must be charged a price that will prevent them from crossing the fence.
Sources involved in the matter claim that the failure to collect the price is due, among other things, to a lack of detention and the fact that the arrests are carried out only when there are related offenses or a recidibist.
Legal sources claim that the decision to exact a price from the Foreign Ministry only began with its third detention was also made, among other things, because the courts cannot deal with the number of arrests carried out every day.
Anyone who checks the punishment will find that it is not deterrent.”
There is great complexity
A police official says, "he's a complex person."
He could be a father to a family who entered the country to work to earn a few shekels and come back.
This is the basic platform, and many types of ISAs are dressed that enter the country to commit criminal offenses or attacks.”
You can be an adult or a minor.
In the past, police were caught illegally 16-year-olds and even children aged 8 and 10 were sent by their parents to road intersections, in order to earn a few shekels every day from customs.
“It also makes the matter complicated, because in such cases we need to bring the parents and indict them for neglect,” says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel in manual labor.
The most unusual are electrical work or advanced construction work.
In the past, there were also local authorities that employed garbage disposal, mainly in the north.
Of the 34 crossings, there are about 18 major crossings.
There are passageways of vehicles and commodities, there are passages that pass through only people and there are passages that are both.
All crossings are supervised by the IDF and the Crossing Authority.
The IPS is usually transported into the country by private drivers, since it is easy money.
“There are those who do this for a living and there are gangs whose main occupation is the transportation of the ISA,” says a senior police official, “usually most of them are Israeli Arabs, who speak the same language and correspond with them.
This can reach 100 shekels up to 300 shekels per person.
Registered companies don’t deal with it, because if the company is caught, it’s doomed to close.”
The police emphasize that under certain conditions, the transportation of the IAF can be considered an offense.
“A taxi driver who works with licenses according to licensing and insurance, which collects Palestinians at organized points and at regular hours, including an orderly order, does not break the law,” says a police official, “who knows that he is a transporter of the ISA, usually picks them up in the middle of the night at hiding points, including the reduction in hidden points.
Most of these guys drive a shroked car because they know they're engraved their car so they prefer to drive an old car."

"A criminal investigation should be opened against it": Haifa City Comptroller with serious accusations against Einat Kalish Rotem
The city comptroller's report presents an apparent concern about criminal conduct by Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former municipal officials and political rivals: surveillance of employees and inflated payment to an accountant's office for carrying out the investigations •
“The serious findings that arise from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation.”
The Haifa Municipality did not respond.
Monitoring municipal employees and political rivals and inflated payment to an accountant's office for carrying out the investigations, "at the expense of the public fund."
The Haifa Municipality Comptroller's report, Ofer Tal, published on Tuesday, presents an alleged concern for criminal offenses by Mayor Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former municipal officials, municipal employees, and political opponents.
Kalish allegedly met with the accounting firm of Barlev & Co. and asked to carry out an investigative audit.
The investigations were conducted under the names and codes given to the former treasurer of the municipality, and a code name given to the council member Sophie Nakesh, and examined whether the tenders that exist between the municipality and a company owned by Nakesh's family are strictly kosher.
The comptroller’s report also shows that there is disorder and a complete lack of control for the work of the accountant with whom Kalish met.
The Municipal Treasurer is the municipal entity whose job is to coordinate and synchronize between the accountant’s and municipal departments and the data collected by the accountant was not transferred to him.
This has caused no one in the municipality to be aware of all the projects carried out by the accountant, and what is the scope of work required in each of them.
Moreover, the hours submitted by the accountant were not approved in many cases as required.
A situation has arisen in which the scope of the issues in which the accountant was involved has increased in a disproportionate manner, with great intervention in the routine conduct of the municipality, without any supervision and follow-up on the part of the municipality.
In conclusion of the report, the audit recommended that the payments not yet paid to the accountant, until material detailing his work is received in each of the subjects he examined.
In addition, invoices submitted to the Haifa Municipality were under codes such as "gatekeepers," an information store, a fish store, an investigative audit to the mayor and a purchasing investigation audit report.
Shortly thereafter, the municipality’s attorney, Attorney Yamit Klein, noted that the mayor signed the payment for her own place.
“I wasn’t invited by any criticism report and I don’t know what it was about,” she wrote.
It was also learned that the cost of the investigative audit is about two million shekels, which were paid a million and a half shekels, and about half a million shekels were left to be paid, from the tax money of the Haifa public.
Former city treasurer Jackie Wakim responded: “These nasty actions that were carried out for the purpose of staining the name and name of elected officials at the expense of the public fund and the Haifa taxpayer and is a criminal offense.”
Sophie, a member of the city council, in her response, said: “The comptroller’s report and the committee’s recommendations speak for themselves.”
Attorney Sarit Golan, Haifa City Council member: The testimonies and difficult findings that arise from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the operation of the consultant for investigative audits to carry out investigations, which are doubtful about whether they are permitted by law in the manner in which the investigations relating to the opposition council member are carried out to the mayor and former senior employees.
Lior Datz's response from the "Skuim of the Gate" association: "It seems that all the red lines that a public authority sends details in order to gather information against lawyers representing an association that exposes corruption and while the association is conducting public proceedings against the Haifa Municipality's management."
The city of Haifa did not respond.
The accounting firm of Yehuda Barlev does not want to respond.
Gantz: "Iran and Hezbollah worked together to harm UNILF operations in Lebanon"
The Minister of Defense participated in the international cyber conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that "Israel is familiar with the cyber systems of its opponents and their modes of operation" •
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of Al-Sayed in Hamas captivity: "A video aimed at extortion – on the back of a humanitarian issue" •
Deputy Commander of Unit 8200: "We have thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems"
Defense Minister Benny Gantz spoke Wednesday at the cyber cyber conference of the Cyber Center at Tel Aviv University, where he exposed a joint attack by Iran and Hezbollah in order to hit UNIFIL forces in Lebanon, "another strike by Iran and Hezbollah on Lebanese citizens and stability," Gantz said.
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of the Hamas captive in Gaza, which the military wing of the terrorist organization released: "Yesterday a video was published with the purpose of extortion – on the back of a humanitarian issue.
Hamas is holding the four sons in prison in violation of international law, contrary to morality.
Hamas is responsible for this and our expectation from the international community is to act against this criminal conduct of Hamas.”
“The State of Israel is operating in a variety of means, and continues to turn every stone into their home.
As we have said in the past, this is a humanitarian issue, so we see it, and on this basis we will continue to act.
Attempts to extortion and mind exercises will not affect our position and conduct.”
“Iran is also operating its agents in the cyber dimension: I can reveal today that Iranian security bodies have recently been identified in cooperation with Hezbollah, in order to harm UNIFIL forces’ activity in Lebanon.
This is done by implementing an operation in cyber that was to steal materials on UNIFAL preparations in the region, and their use by Hezbollah.
This is another blow by Iran and Hezbollah to the citizens of Lebanon, and the stability of Lebanon.”
“Israel is familiar with the cyber systems of its rivals and their modes of operation.
We have seen in recent years a phenomenon of Iranian hacker groups operating with Israel and other countries," Gantz continued.
“The ‘new shluchim’ are terrorists with a keyboard that is like fighters of other terrorist organizations.
We know who they are, we hurt them and their senders, and even today they are in our sights – and not only in the cyber dimension.
No attack against the citizens of Israel will be on the agenda.
And the responsibility is that of the attackers and the state that finances and sends them.
A cyberattack can be responded in a variety of ways in cyberspace and other spaces.”
Gantz continued the attack on the nuclear power: “Iran is leading cyber terrorism – and is making moves aimed at influencing democratic processes and administrations, as happened in the U.S. presidential election and other attempts that Israel is aware of.
“Acts such as that of the Shahid Kava unit, which collected information about ships, gas stations and industrial plants in several countries, were carried out under a direct directive of the Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards as revealed in the investigations.”
“In recent years, he has suffered many attempts to break into private and public companies in Israel and abroad.
I also call on the public to demand cyber responsibility, and to punish companies and entities that do not act in accordance with the guidelines.”
Gantz went on to mark Israel’s next targets in the face of the threats: “Our supreme mission, in the army, in the various industries and in the defense organizations is to build the people, to train them, and to keep them.
I and the Chief of Staff have set this issue as one of the main tasks in the relevant units.
We examine the power building all the time – both in the scope of manpower, both on the subject of training and on the subject of tasks.
In the coming years, we will also need to examine the form of organization, management and operation of cyber warfare, its offensive and defensive characteristics in the IDF and the entire defense establishment.”
Finally, the defense minister concluded, calling for cooperation with the world: “There is great importance to our cooperation with the world with Iran even in the cyber dimension.
The same collaborations we are building in the region against Iran in terms of defense against various threats – we are also expanding in the cyber dimension.”
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: “We have thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems.”
Uri, deputy commander of Unit 8200, said at the unit’s first public appearance at such conferences, revealed that Israel had thwarted an attack on the water systems.
“Thwarting cyber threats is a key part of our operations.
Our goal is to achieve superiority over the attacker, to be able to identify him and act to deprive his abilities," said Deputy Commander 8200, adding, "So sometimes we also find victims outside of Israel, and then we contact other agencies if necessary.
We do this both independently and by cooperating with the industry and other agencies, through the implementation and use of the tools we have developed.
8200 will not rest until the threat is lifted.”
As stated, this is how a threat was revealed to Israel’s water systems and attempts to poison Israeli citizens: “We have thwarted the attempt to take over Israel’s critical water systems and poison them a few years ago.
In another case, we also identified that a particular opponent attacked Israel and while identifying that the same attacker also tried to target power plants in the United States.
This was the first indication of this attack.
We have succeeded in preventing this threat through close cooperation with our American partners.”
How the police are preparing to eliminate terrorists in civilian population
The Jerusalem Border Police is inaugurating a new "Assaf" facility that simulates crowd shooting in a crowd in response to the sequence of attacks that have taken place in recent months •
Border Police's Terrorism Guide: "The development, provides a relevant response to the threats of attribution and simulates the reality on the ground" •
A glimpse of the "Assaf" facility
Preparing for the next attack: A succession of terrorist attacks carried out in the spring by Israeli Palestinians and Arabs, during which 19 people were murdered and about 70 civilians were injured, led the Border Police to develop a unique technique that trains fighters to storm terrorists inside a civilian population and fire in traffic.
Israel Hayom Exposure: A Peek at the Assaf Facility
Popular terrorism focuses on harming civilians and its goal is to undermine the sense of security necessary to lead a normal life of the civilian population.
The wave of attacks that took place this year, with attacks in Be'er Sheva, Hadera, Bnei Brak, Ariel, Elad, and especially the one that took place in early April on the busy Dizengoff Street in the heart of Tel Aviv, by a terrorist who was assimilated into a crowd, led the police to think creatively for the purpose of developing a tool that could be trained by fighters to storm terrorists inside a civilian population.
The work of thinking was led by the police and Border Police training department.
These were launched in a competition in the various police districts under the heading "Leading Commanders," in which each district is required to develop means that will help improve the police and combat skills of the fighters, the policemen and the commanders.
As part of the competition, and in response to the need to practice Border Police fighters to fight in the training of shooting in traffic and outlines of this type, Assaf Ben-David, a terrorist war instructor of the Jerusalem enveloped Border Police, developed the "Assaf Facility", which is composed of a dynamic target, connected to a telescopic pole on which a carrier can be harnessed to the instructor.
The guide of the carrier for our death, he can practice the fighter standing in front of him by controlling and moving the target to different sides and ranges.
It should be emphasized that in recent years, Border Police fighters have faced many attacks in which the terrorist, is carrying out shooting and is a threat while moving through arenas saturated by innocent civilians.
The Assaf Facility, in its current version, is based on components and parts that are used in various fields.
For example, the telescopic rod, which was upgraded and integrated into the facility, was taken from the maintenance and cleanliness.
Using the facility, it is possible to simplify firing in movement within a civilian population towards a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the object, handling a traffic brake, selecting a path of progressing selective shooting including the practice of preventing harm to the uninvolved.
Major Assaf Ben David, whose facility is named after him, says: "The facility we developed is a breakthrough in learning and training fighters and police officers.
The development provides a relevant response to the threats of attribution and simulates the reality on the ground.
The benefit of developing versus the relatively cheap cost of production is a significant advantage for us in competition.”
State Comptroller warns: "The Central Elections Committee is not prepared for cyber threats"
Netanyahu Engelman warned at international cyber week about Israel's inadequacy for hacker attacks •
“World War III will be a hacker war, but the world is not prepared for it.”
State Comptroller Matanyahu Engelman participated in the annual cyber conference of Tel Aviv University on Wednesday and expressed concern about cyber attacks on Israel.
"We're exposed.
Our data is visible to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our health is exposed, our safety is exposed.
World War III will be a cyber war, but the world is not ready for it.”
Engelman said that as part of the cyber reviews that his office is conducting, significant deficiencies were found: “In the past year, we have carried out intrusion tests at the Traffic Management Center in Jerusalem, in hospitals and in the Tax Authority systems.
In the audits we found significant deficiencies, including the fact that very few penetration tests were carried out by public bodies and some conducted intrusion tests only during the inspection.
In addition, there were flaws in the readiness of the Central Elections Committee for Cyber Threats.”
“We at the State Comptroller’s Office are committed to continuing to address this significant issue even more so, for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world,” he concluded.

Oz Blazer in an interview.
Oz Blazer will leave today with the players of the Israel national team for Poland, where they will meet the local team in the 2023 World Championship qualifiers (Thursday, 21:30 Israel time).
Three days later, the team will host Estonia in the Shlomo Group Hall.
In addition to intensive training with the team, Blazer also dealt in the past week in its future, until he signed for two years in Hapoel Jerusalem.
“I have a quiet mind now that I have found a group,” he tells “Israel Hayom” in a first and special interview since the signing.
“I have a little pressure now because I have to move with the family after we settled in the central area and it’s not easy, but there are no phone calls anymore and professionally I’m much calmer.”
You haven't been on the team for four years, how happy you are to come back, and how much do you want to play in the next two games?
“First of all, I want to have fun on the team and I come with the approach of contributing in everything I can, whether it’s from my experience and whether it’s on the field.
Of course, I’d love to play, but when you come to the team, everyone has to put your ego aside and do everything to make the team successful.
I’m here for what they need from me.”
Now you're 14 players, and the European Championship will be joined by Danny Avdia, Gabi Chachashvili will return, and there may also be other changes.
Did you make your goal of being on the championship squad?
“I’d love to be on the field and donate.”
The 29-year-old Blazer (1.99 m) has played for the past two years in Maccabi Tel Aviv.
When the season ended, it was clear that he would not continue in yellow and after a few weeks he moved to the capital, preferring the Jerusalemites to Hapoel Holon.
You had other suggestions, why did you choose Hapoel Jerusalem?
“They showed a very great willingness to be there, so there was relatively easy negotiations.
Once I felt a connection with the management and the coach, I realized that this was the right place for me.
The situation also seems good and appropriate.
I come to lead and be a significant part of the team.
I talked to the coach and he has a hard work mentality and victories, and that's exactly what I bring.
I've always loved playing at Arena, because I get energy with the crowd is against me, and now that they'll be on my side it'll be even better.
I’m sure you’ll be a committed and fun team and I wanted to be a part of it.”
Expand a little bit about your conversation with Coach Dzikić.
“Professionally he believes in a lot of traffic without a ball, he plans to bring good morals with A.Q. High basketball and wants a very intense team.
He believes in high energy in defense and offense, and with the crowd in the Arena, it can succeed.”
I looked at your career and saw that each team was staying for at least two years, if not more.
Do you feel like you can stay in Jerusalem for a few years?
“Everywhere I go, I like to connect and give everything, and people appreciate it.
From the moment I signed in Jerusalem, my phone kept ringing and beeping.
I've received a lot of messages that are already waiting for me.
So I believe we have a good time waiting for us.”
Do you think that in Jerusalem you can be a more significant player than in Maccabi Tel Aviv?
How do you summarize the two years in Maccabi Tel Aviv?
“Unfortunately, there were things I didn’t have in my control last season.
Everyone saw that I stayed professional all the way, no matter how much I got, I always gave everything.
I’m proud of the way I’ve done in the last year, and now everyone is going our separate ways.”
If it were up to you, would you want to stay in Maccabi?
“After the past year, it was clear to both sides that we were going in the direction of a breakup, but that’s part of the business.
Towards the end of the season I was slightly hurt in minutes and my status declined, even though in the middle of the year I had a great time, but they decided to go in other directions.
After I realized the situation there, I realized that this is less the place for me.
Hapoel Jerusalem is the best option for me, and that’s why I chose it.”
What are your goals in the upcoming season?
“We talked a lot about what happened in the cup semi-final last season when I shouted to Ami Bitton (the team manager in Maccabi Tel Aviv – YM) ‘That’s why I’m here’, so that’s why I came to Jerusalem – to take titles.”

All or nothing: 1:1 between Hapoel Jerusalem and Hapoel Hadera
Guy Hadida scored a self-goal in the 33rd minute but managed to fix with a tie 10 minutes later •
Later, the connection was removed in questionable red (74) •
Her room also remained ten players following Red's duty to Ido Levy (87)
Hapoel Jerusalem's professional team booked the number of foreigners on the pitch in Teddy, much more than once, it should be noted, and at some point they even discovered one less player (Guy Hadida was expelled).
This time, to their delight, everything was right, and the 1:1 they obtained in front of Hapoel Hadera will not be taken from them by the union’s court.
Before the red that Hadida had absorbed, he had scored a self-goal and compare to arrange an expensive point for Ziv Aryeh.
Already in the 33rd minute, Guy Hadida's private show began.
Falkoshchenko collected wide, and the midfielder rose and headered back and the ball stopped in his team's net.
0:1 To her room that enjoyed a self-gate of the connection.
Ten minutes after the self-cover, Hadida managed to fix and hugely - Levkovich caught air and the connection this time he headered to the correct and exposed network.
1:1 Teddy.
In the 74th minute, Hadida also managed to write a second yellow and red, this time after surfing in the direction of Marmentini.
Daniel Bar-Natan decided on a shady red and sent the knot straight to the shower early.
In the 87th minute, Bar Natan also sent Ido Levy in red and balanced the power relations on the grass as well.
Recovery Department: Eilat defeated Holon
60:85
Ariel Bethlehem's team composed a third win in a row, this time especially impressive •
Hoover and Schuchman (15 each) excelled
Hapoel Eilat's recovery journey lasted this evening (Saturday) with an impressive victory 60:85 over Hapoel Holon on the way to a 0:3 seasonal balance in the two meetings.
Since it dropped to last place, Ariel Beit Helhemi’s team has already had three consecutive victories, and in fact this is a surprise only for those who did not predict the game.
We haven't seen Holon so bad in a long time.
All this before the opening of the series against the Bishktash in the Champions League Cup: only 60 points, first half without three and 11 percent for three in the entire game.
Bottom line, an unimpressive evening of all the team's players (except Murphy Manco, who scored the 3 three-pointers of Holon), including the safe stock Chris Johnson.
On the other side, Eilat is in good shape thanks to Roy Hoover and Joaquin Schuchman (15 points per p.
The first one has returned to itself in recent times and the second one returned to flourish and also stunned with a basket from three quarters of the lot.
Give them a chance: Maccabi Tel Aviv's Israelis saved Spropoulus
After a loss in the derby and eighth in a row in Europe, Clasico against Jerusalem - apparently, she would have ended the long romance between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Greek coach •
So who should Yanis send a bouquet of flowers tonight?
His Israeli team, who was in charge of 42 critical points in the Arena •
And also: Why should the yellow club change the 'Americanization strategy', and take a living example from the model of Ariel Bethlehemi in Eilat
It is difficult to remain cynical at the sight of the teary eyes and the warm and strong hugs given by Giannis Spropoulus to his players at the end of the game tonight at the Arena, and especially in the face of the tight grip and the secret change of the secret with John DiBartolameo, who with his own hands saved the Greek coach the job, and perhaps the entire season.
Because after a home loss in the Derby and eighth consecutive in Europe, to lose also in Clasico to Jerusalem and move away from it to three wins in the table?
It would have ended the Israeli-Greek affair tonight.
So in the meantime, he's with us, and he has a lot to learn from this game, too, and basically mainly about the Euroleague.
First, Maccabi Tel Aviv came with a radical change in the habits of attack and the ball drive.
The ball moved with passes, with a lot of movement and exercises, and Scottie Wilbekin, in a demonstrative manner, left the concentration for Evans, dribbled very little, and mostly went over blockages and went into shots.
Although he scored very badly (2-9 from the field), Wilbekin contributed on defense, and especially, Maccabi suddenly looked like a team, and the other players scored.
However, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in the brain, the team returned to the old habits, and the attacks went back to dribbles and shelling, and in the most critical attack, with a 2-and-40-second lead to the end, Scotty dribbled himself into half a corner and threw a flutter on one leg that almost lost the game.
The trick is to continue playing exercises and a gesture of dedication in the clutch moments, and it must enter nature and group DNA.
The important learning will be done by Yanis and the club regarding the use of Israelis.
Those who have become water cleaners and wave towels in European games.
Tonight they scored for the coach who stopped believing in them more than half of the team's points (42 out of 83), and some kept the game alive at the end.
Four of the top five scenes in Maccabi were its Israelis.
Don’t say Israel is not Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can also help in the Euroleague.
In the first half it was mostly Oz Blazer, which the section has been screaming for a month that it must play more.
Slingshot, moral, warrior under the baskets (7 rebounds), 2 meters of defensive determination and game wisdom.
Isn't that enough?
In the second half, Jake Cohen starred, with an excellent percentage of all ranges, cool from the line, and covered on the injury of Jégic, and especially John D., who in a 70:63 situation to Jerusalem changed the momentum with 5 consecutive points.
With Yiftach Ziv, Lianis has a complicated relationship, and sometimes he seems to give him too much credit, and overloads him, to the point of risk in losing.
It happens in the Euroleague, too, and it happened tonight.
But the important learning should be the club's, about its Americanization strategy.
Fact: The senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.
Tomer Ginat and Yam Madar went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Rafi Manko returned to Holon, and now Noam Dovrat chooses Jerusalem, or perhaps rejected by Maccabi.
And this happens that Maccabi gradually remain fewer places for Israelis, because of an informed and rooted choice of the club to be based on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where there will be no Israelis who will want to play it, and then it will look for Jewish children to become naturalized, and pressure the administration/union to further increase the number of foreigners.
But it's a fateful mistake for the club.
And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that she's overreacting with the foreigners, much because of the tax discount.
Certainly we will not claim that Israelis are alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.
So instead of spending the same money on one star plus eight mediocres, you can have five excellent.
For example, the season, with the money of Williams, Nanny, Evans, Reynolds and Tilor, two efficient and stable stars (star and forward pointer) could be brought in efficient and stable near Scotty and Gyzić.
It will be more efficient, it will be more true, it will be more Israeli, it will be more beautiful and interesting and creates identification.
It is true that there are two busy frames and a long season - so you have to trust your Israelis.
And also because you are an Israeli group, which purports to represent Israel, and even receive tax relief from the state for its as-representation in Europe.
The Basketball Association/League Manager can help Maccabi, and return to sanity with a number of foreigners adapted to the Israeli league.
6 Brewster, 4 on the form, a maximum of three on the pitch at the same time.
For the ongoing failed achievements (for seven years in Europe), just for Maccabi, the league is flooded with foreigners?
And the players' organization, what about you?
That's why you're down?
There were two Israelis on the field, and now there's one?
Like George Costanza in Seinfeld's pilot.
Haggle to get less?
The previous Russian law was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for Maccabi.
And if anyone needed reinforcement in the aforementioned direction, Hapoel Eilat came in the early game and explained it so beautifully.
With 3 foreigners, and 4 other Israelis who were only two in the young teams (Hoover, Ben Moshe, Roina and Shochman the Fighter), she disbanded Holon (second in the table!) The second time in the last two weeks.
It is a tradition in Eilat to play well with three strangers, because there was such a run even in the days of Dan Shamir and a lot in the days of Sharon Drucker.
The short Eilat is simply a more balanced and efficient team, and there is nothing like Ariel Bethlehemi, who started on the open courts in Givat Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us of what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everyone is at their peak, everyone is playing together, and all the Israelis are learning and improving their game.
The foreigners are only complementary.
When Ben Carter and Casey Prather return from knee injury, it will be a great team.
A song I dreamed of Eilat.
And that Maccabi can learn from him about the right direction.
Yellow celebrations: "There was a feeling that the whole world is against us"
The Yellows are happy after the 78:83 on Hapoel Jerusalem in the Arena: "We went back to play as Maccabi Tel Aviv should play" •
About Ami Bitton's conversation in the dressing room, the optimistic first diagnosis of the injury of Ňzyć and the approval of the management for procurement.
A great sense of relief was recorded this morning among the people of Maccabi Tel Aviv after the most important and prestigious 78:83 in the Arena on Hapoel Jerusalem.
The team's players and the management hugged coach Giannis Spropoulos, who seemed very excited at the end.
Yiftach Ziv and Oz Blazer poured water enthusiastically at the best Drerick Williams in the game, and the rest of the club also smiled a big smile of happiness that showed how much pressure was released after the last losing streak.
They, too, were afraid of defeat against the great rivalry that would further undermine the system.
The fans also stayed for a long time to celebrate in the stands.
"There's an amazing connection between us and Yanni in the dressing room," Oz Blazer said.
“We know things weren’t easy for him either, a lot of pressure was released.
We waited a lot for it, even in the way we played.
We went back to play in a way that Maccabi Tel Aviv should play with, with a heart and fight, we stand behind it.
He gave us motivational conversations and talked to us.”
Before the game, the team manager Ami Bitton entered the dressing room and carried exciting things to the players.
“His things had a great impact on how we got out and how we played on the court,” Maccabi players said.
Despite the great joy, Maccabi is already aiming for the important game against Basconia on Thursday and want to interrupt the long losing streak in the Euroleague.
"I believe this game will change the momentum for us," Blazer added.
“We lost a lot of games at the end and this time they led a few minutes to the end and we didn’t break.
“In the last few games, we were under a lot of pressure, Yannis told us that if we were released we would win those games.
I believe this victory will take us forward.
A lot of eyes on us and it was a feeling of the whole world against us, I’m proud to go to this war, we disconnect all around and look only at ourselves.”
Ante Ŗzyć, who was injured in his right knee during the last quarter, was examined by the medical staff in the dressing room and the initial diagnosis was not severe.
Doctors will check how the knee will react today and then it will become clear how many days of rest it will need to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will be fit to Basconia.
Apart from the firm backing given from the management to Sprupopolus and the professional team, in a meeting held on Thursday, professional manager Nicola Vujcic gave a green light to bring one or two players to strengthen the team, and the yellows hope to attach quality purchase soon.
Anthony Bennett Released from Jerusalem
The first-time forward in the NBA draft failed to acclimate to the team from the capital.
The club said goodbye: “Anathoni enters the heart of all of us, thank him for the period in Hapoel.”
About four months after signing with Hapoel Jerusalem, Anthony Bennett was released from the team’s staff on Sunday.
The 2013 NBA forward (28, 2.03) was first selected in the 2013 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers recorded 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five Champions League matches as well as 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in eight games in the Premier League.

Wishing him good and success.”
Study: Zoom Meetings Harm Creativity
About 2,100 engineers and academics around the world have been asked to develop solutions to the problem – some in video sessions, some in face-to-face meetings •
The result: a virtual meeting damages creativity and thinking outside the box •
Columbia University Research Leader: "The Visual Focus on the Screen Hurts the Process of Ideas"
Nechama Porta: There is no harm to the productivity of the work or critical thinking.
A large scientific study recently published in the scientific journal Nature examined the impact of meetings through video software on the creativity of their participants, compared to face-to-face sessions.
Unfortunately, creativity has been found to have been compromised in virtual meetings through screens.
The research question – led by Melanie Brooks, a professor’s assistant from Columbia University – was whether remote computer meetings preserve the creativity that exists in office brainstorming sessions, or whether the level of creativity and free thinking decreases as a result of the distance.
The study itself began in 2016 but received a big boost in the two years of the coronavirus, during which many employees moved to work from home.
“People in a personal meeting are pleasant in the room, use objects and use them for creative thinking,” Brooks says.
“In a computer meeting, however, the concentration in maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative activity in the brain.
The visual focus on the screen reduces the cognition.
People are more focused on video when interacting, which harms the broad and broad-expanding process of idea creation.”
Space is shrinking.
To examine the results of the experiment and verify whether to repeat themselves, they were tested twice – once at Columbia University and once again in real life – about engineers who knew each other from prior acquaintance.
The university distributed a group of 602 faculty members and students to two parts – in one the examinees were asked to meet personally and develop solutions to the problem, and in the other they were asked to do so through a computer.
At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to divide in a similar way and solve a new way a problem presented to them.
In both cases, there was a decrease in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking among those who met virtually in video.
Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher who deals with ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.
In his opinion, as part of a thinking activity, people often look at their environment to use the creation of ideas, while in a video session, the thinking converges into the screen and does not expand in a way that allows creativity.
“When people in the same room, they look around and see the space, where there are objects and situations that can trigger new associations in them.
On the other hand, research shows that relationships through a computer change our attention so that we are more focused inward and screen, and this way reduces innovation and creating ideas by looking at the environment and thinking outwards.”
There is no harm to critical thinking.
However, and before managers run employees back to the offices, the researchers note that “work through a computer did not harm productivity itself and not in people’s critical thinking about innovative offers, when they had to choose the best idea from a set of ideas.
In other words, the harm is focused on creativity only and not for the rest of the ways of working in front of a computer.”
Professor Alan Langer, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, also retires the findings.
“There’s a difference between just creativity, like new uses for the Frisbee (one of the research questions; EG) and work solutions.
It is also possible that when the employees are more relaxed after getting to know each other, or that they work from home, creativity will improve.”
Both Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson have also proposed future research in which such meetings will be discontinued into thinking and wandering situations in the room to see how this activity will affect the final result.
Dr. Olson also suggested that following the study only for brainstorming sessions, employees would return to work and in general he suggested not to be alarmed by one study but to carry out another investigation in the field.
“I wouldn’t want workers to be forcibly returned and not happy is a greater blow,” he says.
Musk is waiting for Trump’s return: ‘It was not right to block him’
Twitter's new buyer said he would make a decision that led to the blocking of the account of the former US president.
“I think it was a mistake,” he admitted.
Tesla and SpaceX's owner, Elon Musk, who recently acquired Twitter in a $44 billion deal, said on Tuesday that he intended to return Trump to the social network, which blocked him while he was president, after riots by his supporters in Capital Hill after the election loss against Democratic candidate Joe Biden.
“I don’t think it was right to ban Donald Trump.
I think it was a mistake," he said.
“If there are wrong and bad tweets, they must be erased or invisible, and a temporary suspension – is appropriate, but not a permanent prohibition,” Musk said.
By 2050: The world will lose 80% of the water available for agriculture
A new global study predicts a significant decline in the next 25 years
The Solution: Proper Management of Water Reservoirs
A recent new study published in Earth’s Future predicts that by 2050, the amount of water available to agriculture will decrease by about 80% if the rate of water consumption and the growth of the world’s population will remain in their current usage trends.
In the study, which was attended by scientists from all the world’s science agencies, scientists concluded the total amount of rainwater, rivers and freshwater sources in the world and compared it to humanity’s need in agriculture.
The grim conclusions of the study show that as of now the rate of water consumption doubles over and over again in the past 10 years, while at the same time global warming causes the amount of rainfall in agricultural areas around the world.
According to the study’s data, 84% of the land intended for agriculture around the world will experience a severe shortage of rainwater.
One of the main conclusions that emerged from the study calls on farmers around the world to adapt agriculture to climate change and the seasons, and to switch to growing methods that will make it easier for water to penetrate the soil in order to prevent the process of evaporating water that will lead to widespread waste of rainwater.
In addition, the researchers advise farmers working near saltwater sources to use rainwater collection technologies to prevent their flow to the sea.
Information about many students from Bar-Ilan University leaked online
Hackers who attacked Bar-Ilan University database a few weeks ago threatened to publish the information about students if they did not receive a ransom •
The threat was realized and the information was published across the network.
Students at Bar-Ilan University are under attack by hackers when their personal information was published across the network by the attacker known as the Darkrypt network and which published a ransom demand from university personnel a few weeks ago and threatened that if he does not pay an uncertain amount of money, he will publish the information under his control.
The estimates of the amount of money demanded by the attacker are that it was an amount that began with thousands of dollars and as the clock took it, it increased and before the information was published it had already reached several million dollars.
Facebook groups of students from the university and faculty are full of angry messages and the mess is celebrated there, when students fail to enter their personal information systems and cannot perform ongoing student assignments.

Line to 40 settlements: The optical fiber reaches Benjamin
The trend of the peripheral network on the Internet is continuing and now the optical fiber reaches the Binyamin Council, which includes 40 localities •
The project in cooperation with the Council and telecommunications companies Telran, X-Fiber and Internet Rimon will be underway immediately after the holidays.
The Binyamin Council signed a broad agreement of its kind to lay fiber optics in all the council's communities.
The agreement with the Net-Fiber project in cooperation with the Rimon, Telran and X-Fiber, was signed after the conclusion of a large tender they have worked on the council in recent months.
Work will begin after the holidays and residents from the 40 council communities who will be interested in connecting to the fiber optic infrastructure will enjoy high speeds of up to 1 gigabytes, as well as advanced end equipment for the home that will enable strong WIFI absorption, as required during these times.
Those who join can choose between high-speed Internet on fiber optics or fast filtered online on fiber optics that will be provided online by Rimon.
The council made sure that the market would remain open to competition in any situation.
The head of the Binyamin Regional Council, Israel Gantz: “This is true Zionism.
That's great news for the residents.
The experience of life in Binyamin will improve, students will be able to learn remotely if necessary, it will be possible to work from home and establish advanced businesses in communities that will receive quality Internet and without delays.
I want to wish success to the dear companies in the execution tasks in the communities.
The residents are waiting for you.”
Gantz added: “We will soon receive the appropriate conditions of the best high-speed Internet in Israel.
We have worked many months to bring a basis for the installation of fibers and now the vision is becoming a reality.
I thank Communications Minister Yoaz Hendel, who started the project with us in his previous term, and now we are reaping the fruits of labor, to the team of Minister of Communications, the council members who were in charge of the details of the center and the CEOs of the companies who won the center for professional quality among the best in Israel.”
I thank the head of the Council, Israel Gantz and his team, who immediately raised the gauntlet in order to bring news to the thousands of residents of the council who will move to the use of the Internet that will upgrade the quality of life in the fields of education, economy and, of course, leisure."
CEO of the Telran Communications Group, Shai Aslan: "We are pleased with the decision of the Binyamin Council to connect to fast and powerful Internet infrastructures, and I am sure that thanks to the Group's extensive experience, we will be able to provide the residents with fast Internet just like in the center of the country."
CEO of X-Fiber, Israel Elitzur: "The establishment of communication infrastructure in Binyamin is the Zionism of 2021, X-Fiber is proud to take part in the establishment of the new infrastructure in the Biblical regions of Benjamin, I have no doubt that thanks to our familiarity with the West Bank in general and Benjamin in particular, we will meet every engineering challenge in order to bring the fast Internet to every home throughout the council."
What do the side effects after the coronavirus vaccine say?
Many people who are vaccinated feel weakness, fever and fatigue after receiving the injection, while others do not feel anything •
Can it indicate a stronger immune system of those who do experience these phenomena, or is it a fundamentally deprived rumor?
While more and more people are vaccinated, the lack of information about side effects continues to confuse and create rumors, most of which are not true.
Is the immune system of those who have developed stronger side effects than those whose bodies reacted less severely to the vaccine, which may prove that their system fails to fight a foreign body that enters the body?
"There are several levels of immune responses," says Dr. David Dvir, head of the initial medicine department in Meuhedet and a member of the Advisory Committee for the IDF (Indemnists Therapy Team), and soothes: "Headaches, fatigue, pain in place, are the immediate reactions of the immune system.
This is how the body responds at the entrance of a foreign body to the system.”
Is there a connection between the levels of antibodies that develop the side effects?
“There is no correlation between the sensations and the development of antibodies against the virus.
About 60%-50% sense the side effects, but about 90% develop protection against the virus.
It was not found that people who have developed stronger responses are more protected.”
“In medical literature, there is no correlation between immediate response to the level of vaccination.
In some experiments where people also received placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
It is also a mental component - how the person perceives the vaccine, if he expects there to be side effects.
Many of the phenomena that have been happening could also happen normally, but since the public is vaccinated, it attributes the response to the vaccine itself, and this is bias seen regarding vaccines in general - attribution of phenomena that happen near the vaccine and are attributed to it.
According to Dr. Dvir, the causes of the reported common phenomena, such as weakness and headaches, are not yet known.
Regarding myocarditis, opinions are divided.
“There are all sorts of theories on the subject, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
One of the theories is that it’s a strong immune system’s response.”
Is it possible to assess the strength of the immune system?
“When students were exposed to the influenza virus, they showed that those who did not sleep or were under higher pressure were more vulnerable to infection.
Besides, there are laboratory parameters that check the immune system or its components.
When you have a decrease in the immune system, you see it immediately.
People get a lot of viral or infectious diseases.
It's not like anyone's hanging out with a weak immune system and not aware of it.
These are people who come to inquiries because of repeated events of infectious diseases, and what affects the system are banal things: stress, nutrition, sleep.
By the way, we also don’t want too strong an immune system, because it can cause autoimmune diseases.”
Soon MRNA vaccines will appear in other contexts, thanks to the extensive knowledge accumulated about them in recent times.
“There is no doubt that he will be paved for other vaccines of this type.
This technology is tested for many uses beyond vaccines - for oncological disease treatments, for example.
Their effectiveness is that the substance remains very little time in the body - enters, does its operation, and then breaks down.
This technology is not new, but it has received a serious boost due to the very great need for a quick vaccine.
Now, for example, we know that a three-week interval between a dose and a dose is too small, and some vaccine experts say that it is possible that after a third dose we will not need another vaccine in the near term, so it is not clear whether we are going to a vaccine situation every six months or that the third dose will give a greater margin.”
Thousands injured: serious privacy failure on Route 6
Road 6 customers?
Your private information, including full name, addresses, payment amounts and full details of the travel you have made, may have been disclosed •
According to the Privacy Protection Authority, Derech Eretz violated the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations.
After a report that Deret Eretz, the operator of Highway 6 in Israel, conducted a security incident that took place at the company, the Privacy Protection Authority began an enforcement process.
As part of the incident, security weaknesses were discovered on its payment site, which allowed the exposure of a lot of information from the invoices of the members' customers, which were exposed to all.
Among other things, customers' payment invoices were exposed over a short period of time and these invoices included personal information, including first and last name, payment amounts, vehicle location, travel dates and at what time.
In addition, since Derech Eretz has not legally documented access to its systems, it is not possible to know accurately for what period unauthorized parties could access the company’s systems.
In the letter of violation, which the Privacy Protection Authority submitted to the company, the Authority emphasized that most of the companies and large organizations in the economy are required to take a dynamic information security policy, and that with the development of threats and risks, the organization has an obligation to strictly examine the risks that are updated and to act in accordance with the update of the security measures accepted in the circumstances of the case, in accordance with the nature and nature of the database.
As a result, companies and organizations have an obligation to update their systems and conduct risk surveys and intrusion tests, in order to examine and prepare for the changing risks.
In addition, companies and organizations must use an automated documentation mechanism and should be conducted to conduct training for employees, in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Protection Regulations (Information Security).
In accordance with the findings of the Supervision Department, the Authority determined that the Company violated the provisions of the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations, and also demanded that the company carry out a number of corrective actions.
The company of Derech Eretz, the operator of Highway 6, said: "The issue was dealt with in accordance with the strictest requirements"
Istanbul Travel Warning: Surprising news for Israelis from Turkish airlines
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus will allow Israelis to change their destination or flight date
News for Israelis who booked tickets to Turkey before the travel warning: the airlines will allow the flight dates to be replaced.
Earlier this week, the Counter-Terrorism Headquarters raised the severity of the Istanbul campaign warning.
This is the highest level and means “high threat level: do not come to this country and in case of stay you have to leave the country as soon as possible.”
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus said they would allow the Israelis who had booked their flight before the departure of the journey, that is, before the date 13.6.22, to replace their destination or flight date.
This is by contacting the airline.
Tourism Minister Razbuzov said: “The citizens of Israel should not pay an economic price because of terror threats.
I am happy that large airlines such as Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have responded to our request, and I hope that more companies will provide a similar response to all Israeli citizens who canceled their vacation in Turkey because of the serious travel warning.”

Saudi Arabia's name approaching: Israeli companies prepare to reinforce lines to the East
The emerging summary of extended flight freedom over Saudi Arabia: The airline is preparing to launch new flights to the Far East at the expense of destinations in Europe
The largest airline in Israel is planning significant changes ahead of the arrival of U.S. President Joe Biden to Israel.
As we published in “Israel Hayom”, it is estimated that Biden will announce the granting of permission to EL AL and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to other destinations besides the UAE.
The agreement means that El Al can fly on shorter routes to the destinations of the Far East and Australia.
To do this, the company will have to cancel flights to less profitable destinations, in order to evacuate aircraft in favor of new destinations.
The destinations to which flights will be canceled starting this November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brissel.
These are three goals in which there is a small Jewish population, but at this stage they are less profitable for society.
On the other hand, the new destinations that are being reviewed in El Al are Tokyo in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.
This will be the move: the Dreamliner planes flying to Canada will be released for long flights to the East.
The Boeing 737 aircraft flying to Warsaw and Brussels will be transported to flights to destinations such as London and Paris, which EL AL operates flights via the Dreamliner aircraft.
So the company will actually be able to release large aircraft to fly to other destinations in the east.
At the same time, EL AL is expected to make talks that will take place in the coming weeks regarding the possibility that Israeli airlines will be able to return to flying to Turkey, where the company will be able to operate flights using the airline's Boeing 737 aircraft.

Exemption from isolation to vaccinated and recovering from non-red countries, foreign tourists return.
The landers in Israel received messages from the Ministry of Health that they are exempt from the duty of isolation upon receiving a negative response to the coronavirus test •
Only after that, the ministry issued an official announcement that it was only about travelers from orange countries, although repeaters from red countries also reported receiving the message •
In addition, tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter the country and also expect the removal of many red destinations from the list.
At the height of the pandemic - the end of isolation for those returning from abroad?
The Ministry of Health sent messages to returnees to Israel this morning, according to which they are exempt from isolation upon receiving a negative response to the COVID-19 test they carried out after landing in Israel.
It is also about captivity from red countries.
Some of the messages sent informed the returnees that they could be released after receiving a negative answer or after 24 hours at the latest, and some of them received the exemption after receiving the negative answer.
Only afterward did the Ministry of Health official announcements that starting at midnight, 4.1.2022, vaccinated or recovering, the returnees from orange countries will perform a PCR test at Ben Gurion Airport and enter isolation for 24 hours or until a negative result (whichever comes first).
The decision will be anchored in the order of the Director General of the Ministry of Health and will be brought to the approval of the Knesset Health Committee.
The ministry clarified that those who were vaccinated or recovering who had already returned to Israel from an orange country and received a negative result from the PCR test they carried out at the entrance to Israel, would end the isolation at midnight and they are not obligated to perform a second test.
However, passengers from red countries reported that they also received the message.
Those who have not been vaccinated or recovered from an orange country will enter into domestic isolation for 14 days, with the possibility of shortening isolation with a negative result in a pcr test performed starting from the 7th day of landing in Israel (landing day is the first day).
The decision to remove most of the restrictions on the passengers and especially the vaccinated persons comes the day before the High Court hearing submitted by the Association of Travel Offices, the Headquarters for Open Sky and the Hotel Association.
In a hearing that will take place tomorrow, the petitioners are expected to demand that all the other red states be removed from the list, with the person who backs them in his opinion by Professor Itamar Grotto.
Strangers can also enter.
The Prime Minister and Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Health, Interior, Tourism and Transportation agreed that starting on Sunday 9.1.2022, the entry of vaccinated/recident foreigners (according to the definition of the Ministry of Health) from orange countries will be allowed, subject to the fulfillment of an online form in advance, performing a PCR test before boarding the plane, performing a PCCR test at the entrance to Israel and after entering isolation for 24 hours or receiving a negative response in the test (whichever comes).
Unvaccinated foreigners/not recovering (according to the Ministry of Health definition) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from red countries, except those whose entry has been approved by the exceptions committee, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
The group outline will not be renewed at this time.
What about red countries?
The Committee for the Classification of States in the Ministry of Health recommends that the Government recommends removing from the list of red countries and forwarding the countries to the Orange List: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada.
The countries that remain at this stage on the list of red states: the UAE, the United States, Ethiopia, the United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey.
Another option that is examined by the Ministry of Health is to exempt the vaccinated people returning from red countries from isolation.
At the moment, it is unclear whether there is a connection between the messages received this morning that returned to Israel and the guidelines that may be received by the Ministry of Health on this issue.
The Ministry of Health has not yet received a response.
The Sky Begins to Open: The Ministry of Health Changes the Restrictions on the Gates of the Land
Recurring vaccinated from orange countries will be charged in 24-hour isolation •
The U.S., Turkey, the UK and the UAE will be defined as red.
After many weeks in which it was very difficult to find a destination to which you can fly without restrictions, and after all those returning from abroad were charged in isolation, along with the prohibition of tourist entry into Israel, yesterday it was decided to change the procedures and significantly ease the restrictions on Ben Gurion Airport.
The Ministry of Health decided to recommend abolishing the obligation to isolation for three days to Israelis returning from orange countries.
To date, any vaccinated or recovered according to the definitions of the Ministry of Health returning from an orange country - was charged with isolation for three days, subject to two COVID tests.
Now, the isolation that will be required to enter it, the vaccinated and recovering people who return from orange countries is a maximum of 24 hours, or until the results of the coronavirus tests performed after landing at Ben Gurion Airport (whichever comes first).
Those who are not defined as vaccinated or recovering will nevertheless be required to enter seven days of isolation, subject to two COVID-19 tests, or 14 days without the second test, even if he returned from an orange country and even if he returned from a red country.
Restricted or recovered from a red country must also be fully isolated.
The latest list of red countries recommended by the Ministry of Health, which still needs to pass the government’s approval, includes the United States, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the UAE.
In all countries, with the exception of Turkey, the positive average that has entered the country in the past two weeks is more than 5% of the total incoming, which automatically puts them on the list of red countries.
The rate of increase among patients from Turkey is rapid, the positive rate of repeats from it is a little more than 4%, so it was decided to put it on the list of red countries.
The most prominent countries that will be removed from the list of red states: France, Spain, Portugal and Canada.
At the same time, starting January 9, tourists who are vaccinated according to the requirements of the Ministry of Health will be able to enter Israel without the need for isolation, and similar to the conditions of Israelis returning from an orange country.
In this case, too, the decision is subject to government approval, which will discuss the issue in the coming days.
It is important to note that few cases in which the government does not approve the recommendations of the Ministry of Health in this field.
The tourists against the restrictions.
The Association of Travel Offices, the Headquarters for Open Sky and the Hotel Association filed a petition with the High Court of Justice to cancel the restrictions on the flights.
The state lifted most of the restrictions yesterday, but left eight significant countries on the list of red countries.
In a discussion held this morning in Jerusalem, the petitioners are expected to demand that the state cancel the list of red states.
The person who will support the petitioners' position is Prof. Itamar Grotto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.
Tourism Minister Yoel Razbuzov, who has supported in recent weeks all that it comes to the entry of foreign tourists into Israel, said yesterday: "The cancellation of isolation for those returning from abroad and the return of tourism to the vaccinated are the right and just thing during this period.
I thank my colleagues in the government, who understood the distress of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the damage exceeds the benefit.
The vaccine is the best response to the pandemic, and as such, the vaccinated public reaches the vaccinated public to lead an enabling routine for the coronavirus.”

It was more interesting to hear how many people received pensions in Israel Post, how much the real estate of the branches (located in the city centers are available), and how much the wages of the workers (minimum).

The question is how many packages have arrived and how many have been distributed?
Because how much do they disappear
Order packages, and they disappear at the emergency room in Modiin...
There should be a package tax 5 NIS that will not order just nonsense in the shekel and load the mail
This is mainly indicative of the cost of living in the country.
Thank you to King Pakim who made it better to buy everything from China.
We are a household and try not to approach the mail and hope that no letters will come from them and the hatred of the mail has led us to give up everything that belongs to the possibility of mail.
Good week.
Fire all postal employees and start re-establishing the mail - by a private company.

Hilliards was also injured and did not play for the last six months.
Heavy bets.
Missing Maccabi Star
What really with Brown
If he doesn't sign, Maccabi may be in trouble
What about Lorenzo Brown?
How does a glove like a glove next to a loser for a group of...
A great man a coach player must give him more minutes not to give up on him who the worker needs a large squad must not be given up.
No.
Bring Andrea Banks.
We need more strong Israelis in the squad.
Those who really play
Much more suitable than Wilbekin for Maccabi built.
You can see that there are professionals in Maccabi - Blatt and Ketash.
Perhaps personal abilities still match Scotty but a team player, especially a much higher game intelligence.
So sad that Maccabi Tel Aviv relies on foreigners and the Israelis warm up the bench
By the way, Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes and not a collection of foreigners and therefore will not succeed with all the stars who have scratched from around the world
Who is interested???
If you're already watching a game where 6 American players and 3 Israelis are for decoration, isn't it better to watch a Golden State game????
Puzzle until the league is finalized
Good luck
Good column.
I like it.
As for the Israelis, he is absolutely right!
And a note about Ziv - we saw last season that he is a good player who can also lead a team.
So in the Euroleague he can't be a leader, but the decline in his ability in the league also indicates that he's lost confidence (and it's no wonder after the attitude he got after 2 bad games in the Euroleague, as if foreigners didn't have such games) and its use may also be incorrect, and it's the result of the coach's fixations and stencils.
Blazer didn't score with all due respect...
Yiftach Ziv should not be in Maccabi Tel Aviv He destroys it too
Once there is no good game but Sorkin and Blazer Dodi and Cohen today are well done.
Ido Eshed is a bum fan who gave him 500 shekels, so he writes nonsense.
In the picture is not Federman.
Blazer, Surkin and Geek Cohen are much better than Coliero and Taylor, which in Europe play about twenty minutes and are unable to shoot a basket, who needs foreigners at the level of nothing and nothing, much more is better for the Israelis to play.
It's good to have a good spirit for everyone coaching players and management in the montanum
Depends on increasing the internal stew...
and disciplinary reinforcement and required of coordinator and guard
And that's the management part.
No, it's not.
The unmediated human interaction is important in many aspects.
The answer to this study is that social isolation is also a bad thing from the professional aspect and the truth, what is surprising and disappointing here is the surprise.
So turn off the camera on Zoom and the problem is solved.
What happened, the researchers used Zoom and therefore their creativity was not enough for this solution?
How do you know what will happen in 30 years
Someone here has missed an important detail
Scientists don't care about warming or rainwater
They are only interested in the rate of population growth
They're working on more and more vaccines and bastard methods to destroy the world population, so they tell us poggy stories about warming and other nonsense they invent.
There is no problem desalinating water, in unlimited quantities
They said that 50 years ago.
So far, there are more people.
The solution is the restriction of childbirth, especially in poor places and in the case of Bibi's baboons, the rest of their anti-state leftists, and all the religions that believe in the gods - among the fools, the ignorant, the fools, the blind, or in short - in the absence of the herds
It is urgent to reduce the world population.
Living organisms (also semolans) consume oxygen and emit carbon a report.
The solution: Semolans, kill yourself!
It's green.
Good for the world.
It will be better for you, and for sure the earth and all of us.
Who are the scientists and how to do the research
I don't believe any research that talks about climate warming because this thing doesn't exist.
He was trending to control us to take our freedom and our freedom.
It's all part of the new world order.
And writings like Assaf Golan are on their side like he did during COVID.
I have never heard from him a presentation of facts on both sides always bringing the side that serves the globalists.
We're bent.
Just burning money on "research" "academic" bullshit.
As usual, another squeak from the land of bullshit of the psychopathic semolans.
Things are getting better. Human knowledge is expanding with new technologies and improvements.
For centuries, the world’s population has been growing steadily at an exponential rate, and the situation is only getting better.
The Chinese, for example, started a huge project of war with Gobi’s desert, with incredible success.
The Saudis do the same and are also successful (with Israeli knowledge, by the way).
It is precisely the stupid "climate crisis" of the sembols (carbon dioxide emissions, which is needed for plants) that the camoul has become more green, but hey, it is not suitable for the semolonic agenda, so you will not read about it in the newspapers...
The leftists are not worried.
In them, the urine goes straight to the head and so they don't dry out.
Does proper management of the water reservoirs mean a cut of at least 70% of the world's population?
It is amazing that COVID comes and it is amazing that the majority of the population is injected with an experimental substance whose implications for the range of 5-25 years on the injected are not even known.
It's also amazing that Agenda 2030 is underway and now that?
The whole story is really strange!!!
- What bullshit.
The stories of a thousand and a night, all intimidation and of course nonsense by the left that tries to control the world through the media, five years ago they announced that there will be no more rain in Australia and this year they have enough rainfall for two years.
They said that even in the country it will not rain anymore and the drought is permanent and there is rain.
They also said Rabin did not murder Jews in Altalena and Peres did not know that Yemenite children were being slapped.
Moshe Dayan, of course, did not rob antiquities and Ezer Weizmann did not deal with his soldiers.
It is clear that you are promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
Disgust bullshit.
They will also take care of the absorption of the vintages, handling the power outages and the falls of the voltage and we are on the wave
"It's real Zionism" as the opening of the Rami Levy branch in Yeruham is Zionism.
Following the crook Bennett, the rest of the lick politicians will be lined up in the field.
Even if you give me free flights, I'm not anywhere near El Al, more like a "shoe on"
It was very pleasant. Hello and not goodbye.
You won't see us in dreams either.
One more big shame, we in Israel are captive by El Al. All direct flights in its hands are priced pigs. It is better that you go bankruptly already, it is time for the sky to really open.4
Some focus on this issue of flights to the East.
Even if Saudi Arabia allows Al to fly over its territory, then it will not add to the Israeli economy more than a few dozen million, not such a large game of Changer.
It is better to focus on more interesting achievements such as energy supply, the purchase of Israeli technology, transportation from the ports of Ashdod and Haifa via Jordan to Saudi Arabia Qatar and the Emirates, tourism, providing the possibility of Israeli drinking companies to work in Saudi Arabia.
It's much more interesting than 30 planes a week that will save an hour each.
It is more important that they let the Air Force squadrons settle in the Persian Gulf to beat Iran and organize the Emirates in Egyptian Bahrain and Morocco to drop Iran withdraw anarms non-stop for a month until the complete destruction of all its military infrastructure.
And another Air Force pilot to settle in northern Saudi Arabia and beat the Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq to the east from a less crowded area.
After we finish with Iran, Saudi Arabia can push Oman, Kuwait Djibouti and the Comoro Islands to a peace agreement with Israel and gain a majority of the Arab League countries that have joined peace.
After the regime's change in Iran, the end of the World Cup's stabilization of the oil and gas market, and the replacement of Erdoğan, it is also possible to help Saudi Arabia overthrow the regime in Qatar and finally eliminate the subversiency of this country, and its support for other Muslims and Hamas.
When all these joint interests are over, it will be possible to talk about a few more El Al flights if El Al will survive until then.
El Al needs to close.
Tickets are sold for flights that do not take place.
The worst is that there's no way to get a representative
“No customer service.”
Anyone who buys a ticket in EL AL and wants to change or cancel that will be forgotten about it, a loss is safe.
Be warned.
Air Canada is better
In any case, prefer to fly in the woolds
Arkka has gone from Har Society to a company hell
El Al also went down the level.
Best, order a taxi.
The driver will load the luggage for free.
And you sue the train for the field
40 euros a suitcase in Rinayer is much cheaper than Wiz.
You can get a 8 kg backpack.
Why are you misleading?
Wiz Air on cargo and seating take much more significant!!!
One big bullshit
Just for example I just came back if I'm glad
The permitted weight is 30 kg
7 kg and trolls
And each extra 1 kg 30 dollars
Go Update
All companies steal the client.
Publish very cheap prices, but in the end it is a bag the size of a school bag.
Trolley costs money and a suitcase costs very, very expensive.
It's a good thing the companies don't ask us to come for a flight with underwear and a tank to have no weight on the plane.
EL AL, the price is not cheaper, but 50% cost in booking up to 6 hours before the flight.
The Israelis are not surprised at all.
The Israelis were and remain combinations, using a successful method.
A country eats its inhabitants and eats.
This has to be added genetically stinginess.
Also a shame for our country that lets foreign airlines oppress Israelis...
There is no government and everyone here does as he pleases
So what did you learn today that it's not enough that you paid for an expensive ticket?
Prepare a surprise for all of us.
Pay extras on the wheels of the plane, on the windows, on the suitcases that do not arrive, for the food, on the drinking, and will surely add to the toilets
Leave at home and prices will drop.
Or big you'll go out on ships
A journey will take a few days
Take a shot and then you'll probably come too
Bennett wants to check how much he can attack and harm Israel, and still get to track down and support his new fans.
Open now?
That's not a coincidence.
Precisely when the mess begins there is an exemption, it's just delusional what's happening here...
This is not the peak of the plague
Shimon, not suitable for you
The number of verified is rising not means that the number of patients is rising
Stop checking out for all nonsense, sit at home if you don't feel good
The story is over
Government of the Crizy
The government and Bennett are mostly bankruptcy.
Loss of control.
And especially stupidity
Public Confusion Score 0
Only more harm than efficiency
Offers you to open a new corner: “The number of daily and cumulative deceased from the beginning of the fifth wave.
The face and images behind the default.”
Your ratings will soar.
You don't understand the Minister of Finance to not pay compensation to tourism workers
Brings more infection
They don't care about the people
8500 have died so far
Something about it?
We are buried, especially the elderly
We have become Russia/North Korea.
If you don’t talk about it, it doesn’t exist!
The main thing is that the citizens will put money in the state treasury to raise the ministers the belly and buttocks!
Apparently, Doberman and Abbas are the Prime Minister!
Very well, the Umicron delay was relevant for the first week, now - there is no reason to isolate half a people, and there is no point in trying to stop the eumicron - which exists here more than Israel.
When someone comes from an orange state, they're statistically less dangerous than someone who's already here.
This is the first time I have seen logical measures by the Israeli government in the fight against COVID.
As if someone was really sitting and thinking numbers, and not like Bibi - did what he thought would look better in the newspaper (and failed in all the sections).
The dream government at its best:
Minister of Finance who tells the guides to find a new profession two weeks ago, a day-to-day opening for tourists.
The Minister of Education from Kishaah beeps the prime minister and the Minister of Health and determines a policy of her own, which puts all the schools in total chaos!
Foreign minister, clown who comes in COVID-19 to a government meeting.
And the most clownish prime minister we've ever had in the country, doesn't control the situation and loses his temper like the last of the hooligans.
Simply a government without our leadership, without direction, that the entire nation of Israel has lost faith in it.
Go home and good one hour earlier!!!
My opinion, maybe it comes from a bad place but from a place of loss of control
Now the prices of the apartments there will jump to 50 million per apartment.
Where are all the weathermen?
Build a bus stop and believe it will affect all the houses.
Except for post-protection fees.
To discover the exorbitant property tax prices of Arad The hotel will return to being a white elephant like its predecessor
Looks amazing.
Good luck.
I want to.
What about art to be photographed completely naked?
Give up the garbage
Serious Payette to Dril Field

In the current reality, is the South still ours?
Need a passport?
More luxury hotel!
Members will be there too!
What about a popular hotel for a popular man?
Well done for investment in the South [blossoming]
Arad is developing and prosperous and well done to the mayor who since the beginning of his tenure has been an explosion for the better and the glory of the city of Arad
Cultural life, society, education and more about height
Just a great mayor who made the city better!
Well done
I wonder how many protection fees will pay the owner of the resort.
Did they make money for sponsorship fees?
Wow, sounds good
Those who can only afford EL AL-A company with service and security, the best in the world.
When was it possible to fly to Dubai???
El Al is a tin company.
Neither social nor financial.
In recent weeks, she canceled back flights from abroad, you see, sent messages to the Israelis and told them that the flight was null and void, ruined the entire trip, informed the passengers, left a message on W.App or in Messenger and we will return, returned after a day or three days.
The trip was ruined.
Besides, it is better to land planes on the ground, instead of carrying out the flights back to Israel, and to prevent economic damage?
Are there any other suckers flying El Al?
Free doesn't fly with them either.
Have you returned the millions of customers who took captivity yet?
EasyJet for Geneva back and forth 70 euros.
El on one direction $560.
From the cheating religious that controls the company with his fucking son, I don't even buy for $10, scammers non-stop...
And then the company will cancel the flights and offer vouchers that will be worthless.
Because their realization will be plus the price change.
Whoever purchases tickets put his money on the wing of the plane.
Tin company.
Low Coasts drills.
No luggage, no seat choice, probably no taxes and no food.
Vacation and Corona flights...
To all members of the "Gly"... Ali!
Nature is dropping fools!
