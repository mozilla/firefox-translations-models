Under the threat of extinction: three cheetah cubs were born in Iran
The fastest animal in the world falls victim to brutal hunting, droughts and fatal road accidents throughout the Islamic Republic •
As a result, their number dropped to less than 20 cheetahs.
Three Asiatic cheetah cubs recently emerged into the world in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This is a rare birth, which only slightly improves the tragic situation of the animal, which is in danger of extinction in the country due to droughts, hunters and fatal road accidents.
This is the first birth of cheetahs in captivity in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where cheetahs still live in the wild.
The Iranian news agency, "IRNA", reported that the veterinary team, in charge of the Turan National Park in the northern Samnan district, decided on a cesarean delivery in captivity.
It was also noted that less than 20 cheetahs were recorded in the last period in seven different districts of the country.
Following the danger of their extinction, the UN implemented a protection plan for them back in 2001.
Now, in Iran they hope that the new cubs can lead to an increase in the cheetah population in the future.
Last January, the Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs in Iran, Hassan Akbari, said that the population of cheetahs in the country has decreased dramatically from 100 cheetahs in 2010 to only 12 cheetahs.
"Their situation is extremely serious", Akbari said, noting that the cheetahs fell victim to drought in their living habitats, hunting and even road accidents.
The cheetah is considered the fastest animal in the world, capable of reaching a speed of about 100 km/h.
Cheetahs can be found in various places across the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to upgrade your car: we tested the Car Thing
Quietly, Spotify began trying to enter the hardware world as well •
After years of development—Car Thing was revealed and launched as a small experiment in the USA •
We got a hold on the first device in Israel •
The vision: to make your old vehicles smart
The Car Thing is Spotify’s first hardware product, and was built specifically to provide a solution for people with old cars.
A few weeks ago, I got an preliminary opportunity to try out the new product here in Israel, which is currently only available to individual testers in the US.
For me, the timing of the delivery was incredible, as our home vehicle broke down and we had to drive for several days with a replacement vehicle equipped with an old system.
After two weeks of trying it, I came to understand how Car Thing could easily become an integral part of many people’s systems.
On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty regarding a global launch, I believe that many will already prefer to use other solutions.
From idea to reality
Somewhere in 2018, Spotify users began to receive an interesting offer in their email inbox—an opportunity to purchase a new device with voice control and 4th generation connectivity, which will make any old car system smart.
The rumors slowly died down until a year later, when the Financial Times website revealed that the company was planning to soon introduce a new car product simulating a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.
A few months later, these rumors made headlines again after the music service was updated with the vehicle mode—the same one we know today from the app—which is activated as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the system in the car.
Two years have passed since then.
After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify revealed "Car Thing" in last April, its smart system for vehicles.
Spotify chose to release the new device in a very limited edition, with a long waiting list and many delays when it comes to shipments.
So of course, right after the press conference that took place, I entered the website and registered.
Two months later, the long-awaited announcement arrived.
Reconnecting to the website will give me the opportunity to purchase the device with a small surprise—it won’t cost me a thing.
After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.
The Car Thing
First and foremost, Spotify’s device impressed me greatly with its structure materials quality.
It is slightly smaller than my iPhone 11 and has a larger, brighter and sharper touch screen than I expected on its front
You will also find a round button and a dial next to the screen that allows you to navigate between the interface screens.
And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to keep a relatively thin profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.
Personally, I would have preferred the company to allow changing the dial activity so that I’ll be able to control the smartphone volume, since I can also navigate using the touch screen.
Maybe this will be enabled in a future version update.
The device comes in a small and minimalist cardboard box, which also includes, a USB Type C cable and various adapters for its installation.
Many of you probably remember how in the past we used to disconnect the radios and hide them in a drawer after leaving the car.
The Car Thing certainly brings back that feeling with its construction.
All the adapters connected to the device with a very strong magnet, which prevented it from falling even while driving on dirt roads.
In addition, along its entire upper part you can find small buttons, which can be easily configured to activate different playlists or podcasts.
By long-pressing one of the buttons while listening, or by asking the voice assistant, I set some playlists that I listen to frequently and the radio program that I listen to every morning on the go.
In doing so, the feature made me feel like the Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.
From an old car to a smart one
After a fairly simple physical setup, I plugged in the Car Thing.
I was pleasantly surprised by the setup process.
The instructions were clear, connecting to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and controls the application like a remote control, and therefore can copy all the information about our account from it.
Meaning, you will still have to connect your smartphone to the car, either via Bluetooth or via an AUX cable in order to hear the music.
The home screen is familiar to all users of the application, since like the smartphone application, it emphasizes the album images and playlists.
Also, on the home screen, like the one in the application, you can find music recommendations according to your liking, the search screen and your personal library.
As mentioned, you can navigate between the different screens using the touch screen or the manual dial.
Moreover, at any given moment, you can call the device’s voice assistant by saying "Hey Spotify".
Using it, you can play songs, playlists, albums and even search for podcasts.
In my experience, the voice assistant recognized my voice quite easily even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner was blowing directly on the device.
This is probably thanks to the four microphones installed in the upper part.
It is important to note that currently the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time of publishing the article, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.
So is it worth waiting for?
My user experience of the device was great, and this is quite a surprise for me considering that this is still in an initial release stage.
Even for intensive use on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting off my smartphone.
Still, every now and then a small glitch in the interface occurs, but I believe that Spotify will address such bugs in future version updates.
Evidently the Swedish company has labored on the device recent years, and this final design of the product is probably my favorite among the different versions that have leaked online during this period.
Still, when I first saw the Car Thing, I wondered to whom exactly was the company trying to target it to.
After all, its activity amounts to controlling the application on the smartphone, and not much else.
How is this different from buying a cheap car stand and connecting it so that the smartphone stands closer to us while driving?
This question gets crucial when considering that iPhone and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify’s device, and in most cases will supply the user with much more functionality.
Despite this, as I used Car Thing more frequently, I came to understand how it may improve the driving experience.
Being able to view the Waze app on my smartphone screen and control the music on a completely different screen is one feature I’ve come to appreciate in the last couple of weeks.
One question remains—will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?
And if so, will it also be launched here in our small country?
The Swedish company is not saying much at the moment.
It hasn’t even shared how many testers for the device it’s currently running around the world, and how many devices will Spotify add in to the limited launch in the United States.
The only thing we validate is the expected price of 79 dollars (about 255 NIS).
Meanwhile, the Car Thing provides a first look at a concept that Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Spotify Israel stated that there is currently no information about a plan to launch the device in Israel

Did you recruit a talent for the company?
That’s how you’ll keep your competitors from "hijacking" them from you.
The economy is still in the labor market that is largely controlled by the workers, and this is more true for the most desirable workers—the talents •
Here are some tips to help you keep the talent working for the company
.
Despite the increase registered in the last month, the unemployment rate in Israel continues to be one of the lowest in the world, and in the top ten among the OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5% (150.6 thousand unemployed, according to the CBS).
Meaning, the economy is still in the labor market that is largely controlled by the workers, and this is more true for the most desirable workers—the talents.
As far as those professionals and managers, the centers of proven knowledge, experience and ability, are concerned—the trends in the labor market show that the competition for the talents—as they are named by the employers, is still on.
The meaning of this for employers is that in the current state of the labor market, they do not have the luxury of resting on their laurels even a minute after the recruitment of a desirable talent, because as soon as they enter the company’s gates—another company will already try to kidnap them.
In other words, the competition for talent is so intense that many, even after being hired, will continue to receive a handful of tempting job offers, when 30% of employees actually leave only a month after accepting the position and starting work.
This is the reason why wise employers will immediately move from the phase of recruiting talent to the phase of retaining it, this begins first and foremost with preparation in advance and being creative early during the process of integration.
An efficient, structured and thoughtful integration process will make the talent enthusiastic about his/her new workplace from the very first day and even look forward to the future.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and manage a correct integration process that will help in retaining the new talent:
It’s not a secret—sharing and organization’s readiness |
Share the factors that will work with them on their recruitment, explain to them why they are essential and important to the company and the position, and how you see their contribution.
A new employee who arrives at a place where he is expected and understands his/her value, will feel welcome and strive to prove the expectations placed on him/her.
Knowledge is power—coordination of expectations |
Already on the first day, have a meeting with the talent to coordinate expectations.
Get to know their professional background and check where they see themselves in the future, so that you can show them the diverse and unique tools that you and the workplace can provide them to get there.
We are all people—personal acquaintance |
During the days of integration, try to get to know the talent beyond their professional qualities and take an interest in their hobbies and interests.
A new employee who is a focus of interest and is allowed to fulfil and express himself beyond the limits of his role will appreciate it and want to keep it.
Curiosity promotes |
within the integration phase you can create an appeal that will cause the talent to wish to integrate quickly.
Do this not necessarily by talking about bonuses and benefits, but by showing him an exciting field or an interesting technology, since this kind of stimulation for creativity leads to curiosity and increasing interest in the workplace.
In addition, encourage the talent to voice their thoughts and opinions on various projects in the company and make it clear to them that they are important to the organization.

Electrification is in your pocket: the cost of keeping the coal-based power stations open in June—one billion NIS
The Knesset’s Research and Information Center reports: The failure to shut down the coal-based power stations by the date set in June 2022, is estimated at about one billion NIS
• The Electricity Company: "The fuel usage policy is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy"
.
The economic cost of not closing the coal-based power stations by the date set in June 2022 is estimated at about one billion NIS for the year 2022, according to a report by the Knesset’s Research and Information Center.
According to the report, this cost is inclusive in the consumer’s electricity tariff, which as mentioned, is expected to increase in the coming months due to the increase in the price of coal.
In addition, during 2023 an additional excess amount of coal use of approximately 900 thousand tons is expected, consequently, an additional cost to the electricity sector for not closing the coal power stations is deemed necessary, assuming that the price of natural gas shall remain significantly lower than the price of coal.
The report states that reducing approximately one billion NIS of the electricity tariff in 2022, lead to a reduction of approximately 4% in the electricity consumption tariff for the home consumer.
That is, the economic cost of not closing the stations is about a billion NIS, and the total discount that could have been granted to the home consumer is about 4%.
It should be noted that as part of the reform in the electricity sector, it was decided to establish a subsidiary of the Electric Company, which will build natural gas powered units intended to substitute the coal-fired units 1–4 at the Orot Rabin site.
Further to this decision, a government decision was made in July 2018, stating that the activity of the coal-fired production units 1–4 at the Orot Rabin power plant must be stopped.
According to time-lines established as part of the decision, the construction of the first natural gas unit will begin in January 2020 and will be fully operational in June 2022, consequently the coal-fired production units 1–4 will cease to operate at the same time.
The electricity company responded: "The fuel usage policy is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy.
According to the ministry’s decisions, a policy of reducing the use of coal to the minimum possible has been implemented in Israel for several years, even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas".
Paying the price: everything you need to know ahead of the interest rate hike
Constant decrees: next week the interest rate on the NIS is expected to increase by half a percent •
How much more expensive will the mortgage payment be?
And what is recommended to do? •
all the answers
The worsening inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of more than 4% in the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise the interest rate on the NIS as early as next week.
The analysts’ estimates mention an increase rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%.
If the interest rate does rise by half a percent, it will already stand at 1.25%, the highest level in nine years.
This rise, after the interest rate in the economy has been registered as close to zero for years.
The sharp increase in the interest rate increases the mortgage repayments by hundreds of NIS and drastically burdens the households.
With the help of Shai Zror, a mortgage expert, we checked how much more we will pay and what is recommended to do right now.
If the interest rate increases by half a percent—how much more expensive will the monthly payment on the mortgage be?
For a mortgage in the amount of 1.2 million NIS, which consists of a 40% prime interest plan, the monthly repayment will increase by 125 NIS.
By how much has the average mortgage become more expensive since the beginning of this year?
Since the beginning of the year, there has been a significantly sharper increase.
This is due to the interest rates have also gone up on the other plans that comprise a mortgage (and not just the prime track)—of the index-linked track and the fixed interest plan.
If the interest rate does go up by half a percent, the increase in price will amount, according to Zror’s estimate, to about 620 NIS on a mortgage of about 1.2 million NIS.
The prime route (40% in this route) will complete a price increase of about 280 NIS, assuming there will be another 0.5% increase next month.
The index-linked variable interest rate (26.7% on this rate) will add up to a price increase of about 120 NIS.
The index-linked variable interest rate (33.3% on this rate) will add up to a price increase of about 220 NIS.
So what is recommended to do today?
For those who have an mostly index-linked mortgage, Zror recommends considering recycling to routes that are not index-linked.
For mortgage holders whose monthly repayments have increased significantly and it is difficult for them to meet the repayments—he recommends looking into recycling a mortgage and redeploying it for a longer period.
This may be done to reduce payments despite the increase in interest, since it is always better to meet the repayments and not be insolvent.
Regarding new mortgage takers—he strongly recommends getting to know the different plans and adapting the mortgage to their financial abilities.
This way in the future, when interest rates drop, they will be able to recycle a mortgage with minimal early repayment fees.
Regarding apartment purchasers from a contractor—Zror recommends to make early payments to the contractor in advance and to take out a mortgage now.
It should be taken into account that the "construction input index" raises the price of the property significantly even after the purchase contract has been signed.
The price index of residential construction inputs increased by 6.6% in the last year.
considering the price increase of this index, on the day before yesterday the bank supervision authority announced that it is considering ordering the creation of a plan that would allow to include index linked within the mortgages, but the final decision on the issue has not yet been made.
Fuel price is rising—and Israelis will have to pay more than 8 NIS per liter in July
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price per liter of 95 octane gasoline will be 8.08 NIS •
At the same time, the reduction of 0.5 NIS per liter in the diesel tax will be extended to the end of 2022
A record of a decade: the price of gasoline will jump by 36 agorot per liter—and will be more than 8 NIS per liter as of July 1.
The new price per liter of 95 octane gasoline will be 8.08 NIS and those who wish to enjoy full service, will be requested to pay an extra 21 agorot per liter.
At the same time, the reduction of 0.5 NIS per liter in the diesel fuel tax will be extended until the end of 2022—the Tax Authority said.
As mentioned, the price increase is due to the continuous rise in oil prices, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the increase of the dollar exchange rate.
If it weren’t for the half-shekel discount that the government has been subsidizing since April, the price of fuel would have exceeded the all-time high—8.25 shekels per liter.
The discount expires at the end of July and the Tax Authority and Treasury are currently promoting the publication for public comments upon a decree to extend the tax reduction on gasoline, which is 0.5 NIS per liter, to August 9.
Also, starting on August 10, another reduction of 0.5 NIS will be implemented, so that from this date the gasoline price per liter will be reduced by 1.0 NIS until November 15, 2022.
As was reported by the Tax Authority.
"We have reached a situation where I don’t remember having had excesses in state revenues, five consecutive months.
We started a few months ago to apply the issue of reducing the tax on diesel.
We have been working for a week on the extension of the excise, gasoline and diesel tax by four months—instead of 0.5 NIS to 1 NIS.
This is beneficiary for the industry as well as for the citizen.
If we lower it, it will impact inflation, lower production costs and lower the cost of living.
As the Minister of Finance, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus on this first", said Minister Lieberman at the Israel Democracy Institute’s Horvitz Conference on Economy and Society.
As of today, more than half of the price of fuel is the taxes collected by the government (excise tax and VAT)—and this is a high taxation rate compared to most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic effect on the cost of living in the economy—because it affects both household expenses and business expenses, as well as public transportation and flights prices, transport costs, and more.
For the third time in a row: Ashdod—the most business—friendly city
Petah Tikva came in second for the business conducting ranking supported by the Ministry of Economy •
After them: Rehovot, Ashkelon and Rishon Lezion •
Minister Barbivay: "The Corona Virus has emphasized the importance of local municipality to business development"
.
Ashdod is the friendliest city for small and medium businesses.
This is the third year in a row—these are the findings of the index of conducting business in the local authorities of The Agency, for Small and Medium Businesses in the Ministry of Economy and Industry, which ranked the local authorities.
The city of Petah Tikva was ranked in the second place and Rehovot in third place.
After these cities, ranked by order are: Ashkelon, Rishon Lezion, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Beer Sheva, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, Netanya and Bnei Brak.
The agency compiles the index of local authorities.
This index has been compiled for the fifth time and its purpose is to serve as a working tool for the local authority, as it allows each authority to compare its performance with the rest of authorities on a variety of parameters, as well as to analyze its performance in the areas of activity.
The index is based on several parameters that are tested in each authority, and examines the level of "friendliness" of the authority to the businesses in its region.
The index divides the authorities into three size groups according to the number of citizens, since a local authority of up to 50 thousand inhabitants is different from a local authority of more than 150 thousand citizens.
Tel Aviv leaped this year
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different ratings in each local authority: business satisfaction, accessibility to tenders, accessibility of information and property taxes.
The ranking shows that Ramat Gan dropped from second place to eighth place, Bat Yam dropped from fourth place to 12th place and Netanya dropped from fifth place to 13th place.
A drop in rating does not mean that the authority’s service to businesses has deteriorated, and in many cases it emanates from the fact that the service of other authorities to businesses has improved more and they have gone up in rating, while the authority that has dropped in rating has improved less in its services to businesses.
Among the improved in ranking, Petah Tikva maybe found, rising from sixth place to second place, and Rehovot, which rose from 12th place to third place.
Tel Aviv, which dropped from the fourth place to the 11th place in 2019, improved in 2021 and again improved to the sixth place this year.
"The business—engine of growth"
The ranking shows that Nof HaGalil leads the local authorities’ category, for city population of 50 to 150 thousand residents.
ranking after it are Kiryat Motzkin, Mateh Binyamin, Modi’in-Maccabim-Reut, Kfar Saba, Ra’anana, Nahariya, Karmiel, Afula and Hod Hasharon.
In the 28th and last place ranked, is Tiberias.
"The index is intended to encourage local authorities to make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses, starting from the time the business opens and during its active period with the authorities", says the Minister of Economy and Industry, Orna Barbivay.
"The businesses are a significant growth engine for the Israeli economy and are responsible for about 50% of the business output and about 60% of the economy employment.
The development of small businesses is the public interest for us all, but the local authority has a direct impact on the businesses located within local authority jurisdiction.
The Corona Virus emphasized the importance of local government and we saw that authorities that acted and encouraged promotion of small businesses and suggested creative solutions for them, became their primary governmental interface."
Ran Kivity, director of the Small and Medium Business Agency at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: "Local authorities play a central and essential part in the ability of businesses to thrive and succeed.
In the previous two years, while coping with the Corona Virus crisis, the authorities have a greater influence in helping businesses to survive within their field and in general".
2021 by mail: 20 packages per household—and a rise in their weight
46.6 million packages arrived in Israel during 2021—similar to 2020 •
The average weight per package is 435 grams—a rise of 36% compared to 2020 •
The busiest month: December, when the average package weight was 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million mail packages arrived to Israel, almost 20 packages on average per household—this is according to Israel Post data obtained by "Israel Hayom".
The amount of packages arriving in 2021 is similar to the amount in 2020, 46.5 million packages, and lower than 2019—61.6 million packages.
However, this year there was a jump of more than 36% per year in the weight of packages arriving from abroad.
In 2021, 20,253 tons of products from abroad arrived in Israel, a jump of 36% compared to 14,860 tons in 2020, and 16,743 tons in 2019.
Changes in consumption habits
The average weight per package jumped by 60% in two years—from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
The jump in package weight is mainly influenced by two major trends, both from the seller’s and the buyer’s side: the major shopping sites abroad combine items into one shipment and no longer send each product from the "shopping basket" in separate packaging.
On the part of the Israeli consumer, the fast delivery of the shipments, within a few days from the moment of the order, supports the purchase of more daily use products such as clothing and gifts, which those buyers wish to receive close to purchasing.
In 2021 as well as in 2020 and 2019, the month which the most packages arrived from abroad with the highest weight and the highest number of items, is December, 4.2 million packages of a total weight of 2,200 tons.
In December, the average weight per package was 524 grams, 20% higher than the annual average weight.
Black Friday effect
More packages arrived on December than any other month, probably following the November shopping holidays, such as Chinese Singles Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
The large orders start arriving in Israel between one and two weeks after the purchase.
Research: Most employees are unaware of the possibility to receive tax refunds
Many employees are entitled to receive funds from the state, that can reach tens of thousands of NIS •
Have you changed place of work?
Did you go on a leave of absence?
Did you move from the city to a settlement?
You may be entitled to receive a significant amount following a simple procedure •
All the details are enclosed
Most employees are unaware that they are entitled to tax refunds, which can add up to high sums.
The State Comptroller stated in a report published about two months ago, that two million employees are entitled to tax refunds of 3.6 billion NIS, meaning you should also check whether you are entitled to receive tax refunds.
Many employees can receive a high amount of money, considering that four out of five employees are entitled to tax refunds.
Actually, only several tens of thousands of employees per year apply for it.
If you think these funds are lost anyway, think again: employees can apply to the IRS for refunds for six years retroactively.
The Tax:On company has conducted an in-depth study among 4,000 of its customers regarding tax refunds during the year of 2020.
The company has over 30 thousand customers, so the sample reflects their dispersion in terms of groups in the population and in terms of gender, ages and geography.
The data shows that during the year 2020, due to the outbreak of the Corona Virus crisis and hundreds of thousands of workers taking unpaid vacation, a few significant changes took place, mainly a 15% increase of the amount of the average refund per family, which amounted to 4,300 NIS per year.
The reason is that the unpaid vacation dues are lower than the salaries, so there is a gap between the employee payments and what he actually needs.
By the way, the highest refund paid in 2020 to a client of the company was 121,054 NIS for refunds over the past 6 years.
What can you get tax refunds for?
One of the reasons for receiving tax refunds is changing jobs.
81% of the people who changed jobs during the year received a tax refund in the average amount of 2,943 NIS.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The data shows that 74% of the women who gave birth and were on maternity leave for more than 16 weeks were entitled to a refund in the average amount of 3,538 NIS for that year
Another reason for tax refund is donations.
100% of people donating and paying taxes got a refund.
Another factor for tax refund is not registering credit points for alimony. 63%
Of divorced people have not updated a credit point for alimony, thus the tax refund for each year of not updating a credit point is 2,616 NIS.
Due to unemployment—going on unpaid vacation: 93% of those who went for unpaid leave or unemployment and earned over 12,000 NIS received a tax refund of 4,021 NIS for that year.
Other reasons for tax refunds are: refund for life insurance payments, life insurance on a mortgage, refund for living in a settlement qualifying for refund, refund for losses in securities, failure to register credit points for a man due to a birth and tax refunds according to geographic location of residence.
- 94% of the people who deposited installments for personal life insurance or for taking out a mortgage were entitled to a tax refund.
In an inspection conducted on every million NIS of a 25-year mortgage, the cumulative tax refund for the period is over 20,000 NIS for the entire mortgage period
100% of those who move to a qualifying settlement received a tax refund for the year of the move since confirmation of residency in a qualifying settlement is given only after 12 months from the day the resident became a qualified resident, therefor effectively the first year full tax is paid.
79% of the customers holding securities were entitled to a tax refund for the aforementioned years.
However, it is important for those who hold securities to check every year since losses are not rolled over from year to year but only by submission of a report.
56% of the men who had a child do not record credit points in the year of birth on the payslip.
The refund can amount as high as tens of thousands of NIS over 6 years.
This phenomenon exists mainly in the Arab sector.
CEO of Tax:On, Tal Carmon: "The Corona Virus crisis has meant that the employed in Israel have become much more active.
They show interest, check and demand the refunds they deserve from the income tax.
It turns out that hundreds of thousands of Israelis sitting at home for many months, on an unpaid leave or after layoffs, caused many employees to inspect deeply at their rights and what they deserve from the state.
It is important to know that today all procedures for receiving tax refunds can be carried out digitally, easily and simply, without the bureaucracy that deterred many in the past."
The job market: fewer job applicants, more pay
AllJobs 2021 summary report: the top of demand—jobs without experience •
The scope of jobs offered increased by 50% •
"Looking for a job, but not storming the market"
During the year just ended, there was a 15% decrease in the number of resumes sent, and for each position only 23 candidates competed on average, compared to 41 candidates on the previous year—according to a report by AllJobs website summarizing the year 2021, on the Corona Virus crisis and its effects on the labor market in Israel.
According to the report, the job seekers were mainly interested in areas saturated with jobs such as administration and sales, for which 1,738,485 CVs were sent.
However, the jobs without experience led the demand with more than 38 thousand searches—probably due to the come back of young people with no professional experience looking for immediate work, at the end of the unpaid leave payments.
The number of searches for sales and administration was 35,000 and 32,000 (respectively), drivers and couriers had 11,000 searches, and guarding jobs had just under 9,000 searches.
On the other hand, despite the Corona Virus crisis, wages in 2021 increased by 2% compared to 2020, and the average gross salary in Israel was 11,675 NIS.
The average monthly salary in the software field was 17,915 NIS, and in information systems analysis it was 17,140 NIS.
However, between the center and the periphery there was a salary gap of more than 2,000 NIS: in the center of the country it was 12,500 NIS on average, compared to 10,795 NIS in the north and 10,135 NIS in the south.
From a gender perspective, the average wage gap between women and men, which can also be explained by the type of work and the number of hours, remained at 36%.
Men earned 13,295 NIS, compared to women’s wages of 9,740 NIS.
Trying to get back on track
As for the business aspect, horizontal growth was recorded in almost all branches of the economy, and businesses craved for working hands.
Thus, the offer of jobs increased by 50% and recorded a record of more than 40 thousand jobs in AllJobs.
A survey conducted by the site among employers revealed that 50% were optimistic about their economic status in 2022, 30% of them testified that they intend to increase the total number of hires, but 72% understand that they will have difficulty doing so this year.
The largest offer was for jobs without experience—more than 58 thousand of them were on the site.
the amount of customer service and administration positions followed with approximately 44,000 jobs in each field, sales and software with 41,000 jobs each, teaching and education with 24,000 vacancies, and warehouse workers still in demand with 19,000 vacancies.
Einav Boimfeld, director of research and content at AllJobs: "The job seekers are trying to get back on track but are not storming the market, mainly due to the lack of jobs that they find as attractive to them.
Also, the prolonged disconnection from the work circle makes it difficult for them to come back, and some have found creative ways to make a living".

"Not obvious": Subliminal sanctifies the Sabbath—and prepares for Independence Day
Celebrates the fact that "we can live the way we want", gets excited about meeting the audience and makes sure to spend time with the children •
The weekend and Independence Day of Kobi Shimoni, Subliminal
What does your typical Friday look like?
"Weekends are the most important moments in life, as far as I’m concerned.
Saturday’s sanctification and tradition are deeply rooted in my soul.
My Fridays are dedicated to the children, Orr (10) and Jonathan (8).
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and groceries for Saturday’s sanctification, have lunch and do something fun together, like play soccer, ride horses or play with toy motor cars.
Sometimes we go to the beach, or even just to wash the car, but we always stop on the way to buy a gift at the toy store in the neighborhood—and there is always different excuse for it.
When we return home with the multitude of gifts, the smells of cooking greet us".
How does your Friday’s dinner look like?
"I was blessed since I am surrounded by cooking women.
On my side of the family there is a Persian-Tunisian cuisine, lots of salads and an ambience of laughter, music, singing and joy.
on my wife’s side, who is also a great cook, are the Ukrainian dishes, which are profound and spicy, with a lot of meat.
When we arrive at my mother-in-law’s, from the lobby of the building, you can already smell the amazing aromas coming from her apartment.
I usually do the Saturday’s sanctification, together with the children, who know it by heart.
In the end, my fun after eating is passing out on the carpet, and having the kids jump on me like I’m some kind of an inflatable".
Do you have a special childhood memory from the weekends?
"As a child, I would wake up on Shabbat to the sounds of Israeli music on Channel C and the skits of ‘Hagashash Hakhiver’, which we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in Israel, mostly to the north part of the country.
Every remote location of the country made his heart proud.
He died three months ago from a serious illness, and for him Saturday’s sanctification and Shabbat were the holiest of holies, especially believing that the whole family should come together.
I recently released a song in his memory called 'Shomer Alecha', which I created with Osher Cohen.
I believe he would have been proud of this creation, which sanctifies the bond between father and son".
Soon we will celebrate Israel’s 74th Independence Day. As an avid Zionist, what are your feelings about the holiday?
"Independence Day is a sacred day for me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Persia and Tunisia my parents had to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who is privileged to live with his children in our country.
A week or two before Independence Day I already climbed trees and attached strings with Israeli flags to the house.
Today, my days of independence are packed with shows and performances, and I always meet an insanely happy crowd, celebrating the fact that we can live as we please.
We need to ensure that our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren also have this option, and remember that nothing here is taken for granted".
Her Friday: Esti Zakheim blesses the Shabbat
"My dream is to open a big table and invite all my dead loved ones": the Friday dinner Esti Zakheim dreams of, and how does she deal with the fact that her husband observes the Shabbat?
Tell me about your preparations for the Shabbat
.
"Preparations start already on Thursday night, when I return from a show or a workshop and cook until three in the morning everything that requires long cooking such as goulash, roasts and sauces.
On Friday, on the first part of the day, I dedicate the time to myself, meeting friends for coffee, a play or a movie, or I attend rehearsals.
In the summer, Saturdays start late, and I have a lot of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch the sunset or just watch a good series.
At Shabbat dinner, I usually host my mother, Varda, who just celebrated her 89th birthday, and also friends".
Can you share more about the cooking?
"I like shortcuts.
For example, instead of peeling 10 onions, cutting them and crying, I buy a bag of frozen onions and fry them.
On my Shabbat table you will have meat dishes, vegan tofu dishes, potatoes and cauliflower in the oven.
I prepare most of the dishes, and of course they heat up on the stove on Shabbat.
Alejandro, my partner, prepares chicken soup, vegetable salad and in the winter—the cholent".
Your husband is a religious person and you come from a secular home.
How does It work?
"Living with a Shabbat observant is an endless compromise.
'Love thy neighbor as thyself', practically.
He can’t go on family trips, so I often packed up the kids and joined friends’ family trips.
In addition, I am also the driver on duty for the children, the one who brings them back on Friday night from parties and gatherings.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of his Shabbat, because usually I don’t perform on Shabbat and get a sort of 'forced vacation'—and that’s a good thing".
Who would you like to invite for the Shabbat?
"I would set a big table and invite 'my dearly departed'.
Sometimes I imagine what would have happened if my brother, Daniel, God rest his soul, was alive, or if my father, the late Shneor, had seen my children: Uriel (23) and the twins, Tamara and Naama (16.5).
We would have probably argue about football and politics and be happy with each other".
Do you have a special childhood memory from the weekends?
"We were a warm and close family.
On Friday noon, my mother prepared a pile of schnitzels, bring hummus and pitas from the market and burn eggplants for a tahini salad.
Then we would go to Aunt Hana’s in Yad Eliyahu, or as she used to say, 'Yad Alyike', and she used to prepare blintzes.
Since I was the only one who didn’t like raisins, she made me some without raisins.
She saw me, the youngest of the siblings, and took care of me.
On Saturdays we would take a tour with my father in the port of Jaffa, and he would show us the place that he and his twin brother, Grisha, arrived to Israel without a thing".

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck got engaged
Almost two decades after their love story that ended in separation, Lopez and Affleck return to each other’s arms •
Lopez split up from baseball player, Alex Rodriguez, in April 2021
.
His one and only: almost two decades after their first love story that ended in separation and a year after the publicized comeback, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are closing a romantic circle and are engaged.
Lopez shared the happy news with her fans yesterday evening (Friday) on her official website onthejlo.com
.
News of the engagement came after Lopez was spotted this week walking around with a huge diamond ring clearly visible on her engagement finger.
A representative confirmed to People magazine that Affleck and Lopez are indeed engaged.
Remember, the last time Affleck (49) pulled out a ring and proposed to Lopez (52) to be his forever it was in 2002, and then it was an eye-popping ring with a huge pink diamond of six carats, with an estimated value of about 2.5 million dollars.
Despite the grandiose gesture of love, the two separated in 2004, accusing the media of excessive obsession and incessant prying into their lives.
Since then, Affleck managed to marry actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, while Lopez, as we know, has already been married 3 times in the past, including to singer Marc Anthony, who together became parents to twins.
Lopez’s last romantic relationship was with baseball player, Alex Rodriguez, from whom she split in April 2021 after a four-year relationship, including a two-year engagement.
The Kardashians speak: "You can’t make up what’s happening to us"
"The chaos never ends", mother Kris Jenner insists on the new series starring the first family of reality shows, and receives backing from her daughters and the new producer •
In the article that will be published in "Shishabat" magazine, they talk about big money, the PR mill, the brand factory and the change that Kim wants to make in the world: "I’m no longer the same one spending hours on end thinking of the bikini selfie I should post"
It may surprise many, but the most in-demand brand in 2022 for the Disney content empire, including Marvel movies and "Star Wars", is the Kardashian family.
The Disney contract details of the first family of reality show and of social networks were not disclosed, however estimates claim a minimum amount of one hundred million dollars that were transferred to the family daughters, now functioning as producers.
On press meeting with the stars, each of them accompanied by an entire beauty team that takes care of make-up touch-ups, hair and wrinkles in clothes non-stop, the daughters of the family, as well as their new and sought-after producer, insisted that this time it is not about reality, this time what is seen on the screen is completely authentic.
"You can’t make up what’s happening to us", the mother of the family, Kris Jenner, says firmly, "the chaos is never-ending".
"We show how much we’ve grown since that series that came out in 2007," says Cloe Kardashian.
"When we started we were terrified, a lot is happening to us in life and you can’t simply limit everything to a narrative of beginning, middle and end.
Many plots were rushed through the editing, wrapped in a ticking colorful film and forgotten to the side.
This is not what life looks like in reality.
Now we are more exposed, facing the camera directly, naturally, not just a reality show but an authentic documentary series".
When they are being confronted with their new involvement in the series production, which in fact gives them total control over the content that is shown on screen, Chloe claims: "We are involved behind the scenes, we see segments during editing and give comments, but not from a defensive position but simply to give our opinion about what will make the series better.
This is a mirror of our lives and I personally feel that I have undergone emotional growth from watching myself.
Kendall and Kylie were little girls when we started, so they are more boundary-setting".
"I grew up"
Kim Kardashian, from her part, continues with all her might to change her image, from cheap reality trash to a lawyer with an agenda.
"I grew up", she claims, "I am raising four black children, from a persecuted community that is discriminated in this country.
I want to change reality, so that my children and the children of all my friends have a different future, in the hope that we can heal the crooked system.
This is my motivation".
"I’m no longer the same Kim who spends hours thinking about which bikini selfie I should upload", she insists, "but it hasn’t completely disappeared from my life either.
A person must be loyal to who he really is and take everything in stride".
Read in the full article that will be published in "Shishabat" magazine about the reasons for the producer’s dismissals discovered by Ryan Seacrest and their new and very profitable way in the industry, the meaning of the move to Disney, the family’s well-oiled PR machine and its effect on the brand’s profitability and more.

The international festival in the capital, which has become a tradition and will be held in several centers, will present musical performances by leading local artists, and will combine circus shows and innovative and surprising artistic performances

Watch: Tamir Greenberg about the relationship with his father
The winner of "The Next Star" finds a second single and returns to his childhood memories and the significant presence of his father in his life •
"The song tells about the way to maintain the relationship from afar", he says
Tamir Greenberg in a second single called Into The Night after captivating the audience with his first single and his participation in "The Next Star".
In recent months, Greenberg continues to perform in many concerts: the Tel Aviv Cultural Center, the Tel Aviv Opera House, the Shuni Amphitheatre, the Yehoshua Park Amphitheatre, Hangar 11 and dozens of other shows.
The song Into The Night was produced and arranged by Greenberg together with the producer Stav Beger.
The video clip, directed by Daria Geller, brings Tamir back to childhood memories and the significant presence of his father in his life.
"The song talks about the relationship between my father and I.
About the time I left the country to go to the USA and the way to maintain the relationship from afar", says Greenberg.
In the upcoming month, Greenberg will appear at the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah in Israel, and before the start of the new season of "The Next Star", the song which he won the show with, Tell Me Where The Light Goes, was chosen as the best audition song for the upcoming season.
Made in Israel: Yuval Shamla is the big winner of the season and is ranked as the 16th ninja in the world
The phenomenon competitor climbed Mount Midoriyama in 26 seconds and won the title "The First Israeli Ninja" •
Yogev Malka climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but will not hold the Ninja title.
The
There is a winner: Yuval Shamla conquered Midoriyama, and is the winner of the fourth season of "Ninja Israel" and now holds the title of the first Israeli ninja and the 16th in the world.
Shamla has been participating in the show since its first season, then he finished in first place, and on the second season he lost to Gil Marantz.
In the third season he won again and recently returned for the fourth season, and during filming he stated that this would be his last season.
Tonight he climbed Mt. Midoriyama for the first time in 26 seconds and finished in first place, after beating the contestants Yogev Malka and Yshay Khalfon.
Malka managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds and finished in second place.
It should be noted that according to the rules of the program, in each season only one ninja who managed to climb Midoriyama in time can be crowned the winner.
Therefore, despite Malka’s impressive achievement, Yuval Shamla, the season’s winner, climbed Midoriyama 3 seconds faster, therefore Malka does not win the world ninja title.
He will be able to compete for it again next season.
Ok, we understand, Shamla is a superhero, Rotem Sela is perfect, and "Ninja Israel" is the most important sports event in the world
.
Two Olympic medalists and a veteran sports broadcaster were presenting the finale of a reality show and acted as if it is the most significant sporting achievement on the planet
.
Rotem Sela symbolizes to us the perfect female ideal, so much so that it is ”sick” to present it on television.
She earns more on campaigns than Wonder Woman, she is too beautiful, she knows how to put Dana Weiss in her place, and when necessary—also to defend her business partner.
She is a mother as well as a career woman who advertises banks and air conditioners, she models and leads reality series and shows, and serves as an unattainable role model for young girls.
And maybe it makes sense that Rotem Sela is too perfect for the screen, because in the show she hosts, you have to be perfect, and no apologies are needed.
In the world of the ninja, everyone is bigger than life, firstly the hosts.
After all, Assi Azar got involved in an affair that was supposed to eliminate him from the screen for a certain period of time, but since he is not an ordinary human being—he got out of it even before the first set of commercials.
Listen to the soundtrack of the event: Niv Raskin, who is experienced in broadcasting world records and European Cup finals, still gets excited by a mega-wall as if this is the most significant sporting achievement on earth.
In the final, two Olympic medalists (Yardan Jerbi and Linoi Ashram) sat next to him as commentators, as if to emphasize how rare and high-quality the conditions for entry into the superhuman world are, and that this reality show has been presenting for four seasons.
"Ninja Israel" exceeded any proportions in order to market the season, which ended last night with Mount Midoriyama and Yuval Shamla who managed to climb it in 26 seconds and was finally crowned a ninja.
An almost impassable route led there, which brought down all the superhuman characters one by one, while the show made sure to inflate their egos throughout the year.
Want to be a ninja turtle?
Not with us.
Here we are only looking for superheroes.
The emphasis was on the search for a successor to Shamla, who is known as "the king of kings and one of a kind", and other nicknames intended to showcase how perfect and unique he is.
As a result, the level of difficulty was raised, the girls who tried to compete in the season’s courses crashed, and the boys kept competing among themselves to see who had more packs on their stomachs and the charisma of ply wood in order to step into the shoes of retiring Shamla.
You might say that this is a sports program that encourages physical activity and shows how to overcome difficulties and challenges, however from a point of view of the majority of the viewers—mediocre couch potatoes like us—"Ninja Israel" cultivates for us an unattainable sports—achievement model.
Faster, stronger, higher, more perfect.
When Gil Sassover moves between punch lines and talks about sanctity
It’s weird to watch the comedian, ex "Comedy Store", hosting a show of "Kabbalat Shabbat" on Channel 14, as he tastes out of simmering pots and offers a platform mainly to men
If we play an association game, we will all have similar answers to the question "What does the term 'preparations for Shabbat' remind you of?".
You will say: floor mopping and cleaning, pots on the gas and smells in the stairwell, Yaron Ilan or Avi Kachon on TV, but the weirdest thing would be if someone suddenly says "Gil Sassover".
Because the character of Gil Sassover in mid cleaning and cooking for Shabbat is the most unrelated content for this time of day, the television can offer.
And really, "Kabbalat Shabbat", the new program he hosts on Friday afternoons on Channel 14, is disconnected in spirit from the hour it is broadcasted on.
Sassover stands during half of the program time.
He speaks quickly, holding a microphone in his hand even while tasting the dishes, and then tries to distribute his dose between punch lines and conversations about holiness.
It can be noted (for his defense) that the low budget restrictions are noticeable, and this is probably the best that can be produced under these conditions.
However, what was felt quite clearly from the premiere program, broadcasted the day before yesterday, from Mateh Binyamin, is that the program has gender division.
The men sang, played music, danced, spoke about the Torah, marketed restaurants and factories—while the women contented themselves with a small item, on which they talked about excitedly; running a sewing shop.
Happy Women’s Day to you.
Kabbalat Shabbat with Gil Sassover, now on channel 14
The Sheltered Housing Union against Ruthie Russo: "To say 'it has the taste of sheltered housing' harms our activity"
Chairman Yuli Gat sent a letter, in which she expressed the union’s complaint against an insulting statement, according to them, made by the judge of "The Next Restaurant" in one of the trailers for the show •
Ruthie Russo responded: "I’m glad there are places that invest more in the culinary and cuisine of this population".
The Nursing Homes and Sheltered Housing Union in Israel against the ״next restaurant״: In a letter sent by its chairman Yuli Gat and reached ״Israel Hayom״, it was written as follows: ״In the pre-broadcast trailer, distributed on all social networks and on television, the professional judge of the competition describes a dish and says: 'The food has the taste of sheltered housing', that is, 'it is low-level, tasteless and unappealing food from a closed institute״.
״The tone chosen by the judge of the program, Ruthie Russo, to describe her disappointment with the food that the contestant served, instantly cancels our many years of activity to fight against the ignorance that exists in the field, this is because the shelters operate restaurants in the various houses serving the highest level chef’s dishes for the benefit of the residents״.
It was also written: "The service teams and the managers of the homes are fighting for the image of the sheltered housing that offers solutions for quality housing for the elderly, including alleviating loneliness, abundant leisure activities, a high standard of living and more".
In recent years in Israel, more and more families and older people understand that loneliness is the most difficult disease in old age and regard community centers as a proven solution to this disease.
"Food is one of the greatest pleasures in life, so we dedicate resources and efforts to serve the tenants the finest food.
Most of the shelters use professional chefs to create a menu.
We will be happy to invite the team of judges any time to be impressed by the winning dishes that are served every day to tens of thousands of elderly people in Israel, and on behalf of the chefs and the restaurant staff at the shelters, we would like to receive your apology and clarification.
join us, the media and Israeli society, in encouraging community housing to benefit the health of the elderly".
Ruthie Russo said in response: "I’m glad that there are places that invest more in the cuisine of this population, which definitely deserves excellent food in this advanced period of their lives.
I respect the hard work of cooks everywhere, in sheltered housing as well".
"Double standards: in Russia you cancel a show but in Israel you didn’t?"
Nick Cave responds to criticism
The singer addressed the criticism thrown at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of having double standards •
The singer responded: "The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
“
Earlier this week, Nick Cave canceled a show in Russia due to the war and declared that he "stands by Ukraine and prays that the madness will end soon".
In doing so, the acclaimed Australian singer joined artists and bands such as Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who also canceled performances in the invading country.
But in Cave’s case his cancellation announcement took a slightly different turn.
A Turkish fan named Ahmet announced the singer to be a hypocrite, since in 2017 Cave refused to cancel two concerts that took place in Israel, despite the heavy criticism he received from pro-Palestinian organizations.
During his visit to Israel, Cave told the local media: "Ultimately, I am here for two reasons: the first reason is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians".
The same Ahmet remembered very well Cave’s statements in favor of music and against politicization.
The fan even published on the singer’s personal and uncensored website, "The Red Hand Files", a poignant post in which he claimed that Israel is also an occupying country, and therefore the situation of Palestine is the same as that of Ukraine.
"What bothers me about your message about Ukraine", Ahmet wrote. "Is the fact that you did not support the Palestinians the same way, since they also suffer from a brutal regime.
In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion, Israel is first and foremost the factor responsible for the Palestinian suffering.
It saddens me a lot, as you present double standard here", the Turkish fan concluded.
But the story does not end here, as Cave chose to reply to Ahmet in a long and detailed letter, in which he emphasized that "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The first situation is an unprovoked attack by one country on its neighbor, hoping to change the security order of Europe as a whole.
The second situation is a complex friction between two nations.
The conflicts are indeed similar in that innocent people, who share a tragic fate, are forced to hide in shelters.
I feel a lot of sympathy for all these communities—no matter where they are and who it is".
Cave added that although he is not interested in declaring his opinion regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he certainly also supports the Palestinians, noting that in the last 20 years he has often participated in fund-raising events for them.
"But this is not a time for arguments, Ahmet", the singer clarified, "this is a time to unite and support the Ukrainians, who are currently experiencing a catastrophe on their land.
I have great fans in Russia, and I know that many Russians strongly oppose the actions of Putin’s regime.
If I could play for them—I would".
In light of the decrease in morbidity: the Corona-virus Projector will return to manage Ziv Hospital
Prof. Salman Zarqa was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the policy of treating the third wave and the fourth wave of the Corona-virus •
At the request of the Minister of Health, Nitzan Horowitz, will simultaneously continue in his position as a projector •
Prof. Zarka: “I’m glad that the Omicron wave continues to fade, and it’s still our duty to prepare for another wave”
.
Against the background of the decrease in the incidence of the Corona-virus, the projector of the Corona-virus, Prof. Salman Zarka, will return to manage the Ziv Hospital in Safed on Sunday.
At the request of the Minister of Health, Nitzan Horowitz, he will simultaneously continue his position as a projector.
“I am happy for the sake of the citizens of Israel that the Omicron wave continues to fade and that we got our normal way of life back”, said Prof. Zarka, adding: “It is still our duty to prepare for another wave of morbidity as a result of the fact that the virus is still here, in Israel and around the world”.
Prof. Zarka was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the Corona-virus treatment policy in the third wave and the fourth wave.
As of May 1st, Israel returned to a “between waves” situation, which includes reducing most of the Corona-virus arrays, while maintaining the ability to perform sequence tests and investigations, which will form the basis for action in the event that a new variant is discovered.
Occult morbidity
In the report of the National Knowledge and Information Center for the Corona-Virus Campaign, which was published this morning, it was stated that “there is a decrease in the average of newly confirmed cases to below two thousand per day, on a weekly average, alongside a decrease in the number of hospitalized patients and those hospitalized in serious condition”.
Nonetheless, they emphasized that “occult morbidity exists in a significant scope and that the number of actual people who get infected is much higher.
The number of institutional tests being held in the community (not including the tests of those who return from abroad, M.Y.) – is low and consists of less than 20 thousand tests in average per week.
The low scope of tests makes it harder to identify morbidity trends and their understanding”.
The State Comptroller’s report: the actual budget in most years of activity of the Medicines Basket Committee is smaller than the recommended budget
According to the report by Matanyahu Engelman, for more than 20 years of activity of the Medicines Basket – the Ministry of Health did not supervise the activity of the committee •
The report also states that the protocols of the meetings are published at a significant delay, if at all •
Also, the comptroller recommends increasing the transparency of the subcommittee’s activity – and updating the procedures for the work of the basket •
Another discrepancy found relates to the fact that ever since the committee began its activities, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds for reports on the scope of uses and utilization of the medicines in the basket – which would have allowed for the analysis and control of the budget given to them.
The Medicines Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees on our daily lives and our health.
Every year, the committee decides on new medicines that will handed to the public free of charge through the health insurance funds – but a new report by the State Comptroller published today (Tuesday) warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without issuing any controlled reports on its activities and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council supervise and review its activities.
“Israel Hayom” correspondent, Ran Reznik, adds that the State Comptroller’s investigation was conducted following the ongoing expose in “Israel Hayom” about the failures of the medicine basket.
According to Matanyahu Engelman’s report, he recommends “to carry out corrections and improvements in the process of expanding the basket, which will lead to a better utilization of the health services basket budget that the public is entitled to”.
Throughout the years of the existence of the mechanism of the addition to the basket of medicines, in the years 1998–2021, medicines totaling eight billion shekels were added to the state budget – with the addition varying annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million shekels.
In 2019, 2020 and 2021, applications were submitted to add about 800 new medicines and technologies to the basket of health services, with a total annual cost of more than two billion shekels.
In practice, the budget allocated to expand the basket was smaller than the scope of the requests.
In most of the years of the commission’s operation (90% of the time), the amount of the budget supplement was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired supplement rate.
The comptroller points out that it is necessary to examine and regulate the amount of the annual supplement in order to enable certainty and long-term planning.
Engelman also noted that “the transparency model in the basket work is lacking”.
This is how, for example, the work procedure of the basket’s committee determines that the meetings’ protocols, which are closed to the public, will be published in 60 days, but in reality the protocols get published with a delay of 109–160 days, while the final meetings’ protocols sometimes don’t get published at all.
“The delay in publishing the protocols harms the transparency of the decisions; because of this, the ability of the bidders – patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies – to submit repeated applications as soon as possible and relevant, after they have learned from the rejection of their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and corrected their proposals and carried out a renewed assessment regarding the possibility of accepting them in the next round”, the comptroller noted in the report.
“The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols in accordance with the schedules established in the procedure”.
Out of thousands of submissions – only one financial comment was submitted
Another criticism of Engelman concerns the preliminary procedure of the evaluation of the technologies submitted to the medicine basket.
The comptroller found that about half (46%) of the submitted technologies did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for rejection.
Another shortcoming concerns the activity of the sub-committee of the medicine basket, which is closed to the media and the public, and where patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.
The comptroller recommends to add a representative of the public or to examine a possibility of publishing the discussions to the public without the commercial details that are confidential.
In the procedure according to which the health services basket committee operates, it is established that “an economic evaluation must be submitted” for a request to add a drug to the basket.
But in practice, over the years, only one economic evaluation was submitted out of thousands of submissions – and the committee makes its decisions without an economic evaluation.
For example, for the discussions of the basket committee for the years 2019–2021, requests were submitted to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.
What derived from the report was that the requests were not accompanied by economic assessments, including an assessment of the amount that could be saved due to reducing the damage caused by obesity-related diseases or due to the ability to avoid gastric bypass surgery.
It also appears that the decisions of the Medicines Basket Committee are not in line with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
Thus, for example, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparation for the treatment of the increase in chronic diseases as goals, but in the framework of the decisions regarding the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.
The comptroller also warns that since 2011, services that are not the responsibility of the health insurance funds, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccinations, provided by the Ministry of Health (“the third supplement”) have also been included in the medicine basket.
This, when the legal framework for this step is regulated only retrospectively.
In the last six years, 74 million NIS from the addition to the medicine basket were used for these services.
Engelman recommends that the Ministry of Health update the procedures for the work of the basket and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is necessary for these services.
About a third of the new drugs that enter the medicine basket are defined as “drugs without additional cost”, the use of which does not cost the health insurance funds an additional amount because they replace existing treatment.
The comptroller suggests examining the possibility that these drugs will be discussed in a different and shortened route, so that the basket of medicines can be updated several times a year and not just once a year.
There is no supervision of the use of particularly expensive drugs.
The comptroller also shows that since the basket committee’s work began 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health did not ask the health funds to report and did not monitor the scope of uses and utilization of the drugs in the basket, information that could have allowed the ministry to analyze and control the budget given to the funds.
Over the years, only two reports have been published that refer to the years 2006–2009, and these were also published considerably late (the last one was published this year and dealt with the utilization of the budget in 2007–2009).
“The delay in conducting tests may lead to difficulty in collecting the data and analyzing it, to the irrelevance of the conclusions emerging from the test after such a long period of time, to suboptimal pricing by the subcommittee and to making decisions based on inconclusive findings”, the report states.
Also, the ministry does not audit nor supervise the use of particularly expensive drugs and has not learned lessons.
These are 10 medicines that accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (1.7 billion NIS in 2016–2021).
On this, the comptroller wrote: “It is recommended that the Ministry of Health carry out individual controls on these drugs and technologies and analyze the scope of their use compared to the estimates.
Controls and analysis will make it possible to draw systemic conclusions about the work process of the basket committee and the sub-committee, and about how the estimates are prepared when pricing the drugs and technologies and improve them”.
“Horrifying and unimaginable”: a stormy discussion in the health committee about the poisoning in Beit Dafna
The parameters of the first patient who passed away were normal ten minutes before her death •
Chairman of the committee, MK Silman: “If the people there cared about the kitchen being like at home – it wouldn’t look like this”.
Ten minutes before the first 40-year-old patient from the “Beit Dafna” daycare center in Holon died of food poisoning, her medical parameters were taken which were normal, the director of the daycare center claimed today (Tuesday) at the hearing of the health committee.
“We have night nurses who check during the night and there is a nurse who makes rounds.
There were several reports of cases of diarrhea and the same tenant actually, last time her measurements were taken 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal.
She was monitored like the other daycare workers with diarrhea.
She is a nursing patient, we went to get a lever to help transfer her and then the same resident did not respond.
We started CPR and called the clinic nurse”, the director of the daycare center described what happened last Sunday morning at the daycare center.
This is an incident in which three residents died, six were hospitalized and in total about a quarter of the residents of the daycare center (33 out of 131) suffered from diarrhea after eating contaminated golesh meat.
The director of the daycare center said these things against the background of the claims that death from food poisoning indicates neglect and lack of follow-up on the part of the caregivers.
Dr. Naama Noss, head of epidemiology at the Tel Aviv Health Bureau, stated that “We cannot determine unequivocally what caused the three deaths.
Only blood tests were taken from them”.
It was also brought up in the discussion that even from the tenants admitted to the hospital it was no longer possible to collect a stool sample because they didn’t have diarrhea anymore and therefore it is not possible to determine with certainty the cause of death and morbidity.
An engineer from the Ministry of Health also stated that “the Ministry of Health checks the sanitary condition of kitchens in institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Welfare or at the request of a license renewal”.
The Ministry of Social Affairs admitted that the investigation committee has not yet been appointed for this case and for the previous case of patients’ abuse that happened three months ago at the “Bnei Zion” institution in the Sharon.
Chairman of the committee, MK Silman, said during the discussion: “If the people there cared about the kitchen being like at home – it wouldn’t look like this.
The residents in the welfare dormitories need more.
They are health sensitive and need extra supervision and care.
It is shocking and unimaginable what happened there.
The horrible findings that were discovered are even after they knew that the Ministry of Health was coming to check.
Where is the supervision and responsibility of the offices?
How come in such a discussion the ministers and the CEOs of the ministries are not present to give an explanation of what is happening here?”
Yigal Nahtumi, CEO of Beit Eckstein, who manages the daycare center and even ran the daycare center himself, said “Hundreds and thousands of people in the entire organization stand up with only one goal: to do good to people.
The people who passed away are people I personally cared for.
I anesthetized one of the tenants on my hands.
This is a shocking event for us”.
Samdar Ona, a former resident of an identical residence in Gilo, burst out at him and said that “enough with the lies and nice words.
I was there”.
Gali Barmi, parent representative at Akim Israel: “We have already complained about the food in the past and they did not accept the criticism”.
Oren Hellman, founder of an equal opportunity initiative for the integration of people with disabilities, protested that the names of the deceased guardians were not published: “We don’t know their names at all.
Are they worth less?
We underestimate the lives of our children.”
Suspicion of an omission in Wolfson: the surgeon caused a tear in the heart – and the patient died.
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Faras Abu Akar as the director of the thoracic surgery unit at the hospital •
The chairman of the doctors’ committee complained that the director, Dr. Engel, was warned before his appointment •
Hospital: “He is valued and experienced”
First publication: A horrifying mistake occurred at the Wolfson government hospital in Holon, when during surgery the doctor ruptured the patient’s heart, which led to his tragic death.
The surgery on an 83-year-old lung cancer patient was conducted on April 19.
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Faras Abu Akar as the director of the thoracic surgery unit at the hospital.
During the operation, which was intended to drain the area surrounding the patient’s heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large tear in the heart, which led to severe bleeding and caused the patient’s death.
But the unusual complication opened a Pandora’s box, which raised difficult questions regarding the management of the hospital.
The director of the oncology institute and chairman of the board of doctors, Dr. Ronen Brenner, demanded an investigation of the affair in a letter he sent to the director of the hospital, Dr. Anat Engel.
In the letter, he made very serious allegations about the conduct of Dr. Engel and the appointment of Dr. Abu Akar, this after the previous director of the unit, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, moved to Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer.
A huge hole in the heart
According to Dr. Brenner’s letter, the patient was lucid, functioning and had been treated by him for the past four years.
Recently, he had a spread of the disease, and an abnormal accumulation of fluid inside the pericardium, in which the heart muscle is located, was discovered.
Also, the surgeon, Dr. Abu Akar, believed that he could perform the surgery.
According to the complaint, a serious malfunction occurred during the operation, and Dr. Hagai Dekal, director of the heart and thoracic surgery department at Wolfson, who was at the time operating on a child in the adjacent room, “was hurriedly called to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart”.
According to him, the heart was drained of blood, the blood pressures were zero, and the surgical approach was wrong.
In addition to that, Dr. Brenner said that Dr. Dekal contacted him and told him that Dr. Abu Akar is not professionally and personally suitable for managing the thoracic surgery unit at Wolfson.
However, despite his explicit warnings, and even though he was supposed to be the direct manager of the thoracic surgeon, Dr. Engel made a tender without involving him and accepted Dr. Abu Akar for the position.
He further stated: “This is an uncomplicated procedure, which lasts a few minutes”, and added: “It is impossible not to refer to the poor process of accepting Dr. Abu Akar for the position.
The question arises whether there is direct responsibility of Engel for the failure of the operation and the death of the patient”.
An experienced surgeon
Information and claims of other senior doctors were presented to “Israel Hayom” that reinforce the questions raised in the case by Dr. Ronen Brenner.
Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, director of Surgery A at Wolfson, responded to Brenner’s complaint and wrote that Dr. Abu Akar is “one of the most experienced surgeons in Israel, but a relatively young thoracic surgeon”.
He also added that he was selected in a proper tender and Dr. Dekel did not take part in it, in accordance with his statements about his desire to “disassociate” himself from the chest unit.
He also stated: “I was not a party to the procedure either, and it is possible that I should have been.”
Dr. Shimonov wrote that Dr. Faras Abu Akar started working on April 10 and is entitled to 100 grace days, “All the doctors at the hospital were impressed by his professionalism and his motivation and willingness to work.
He has already performed dozens of cases of a similar procedure, and unfortunately the current case ended as it did in an unfortunate way”.
The Wolfson Hospital responded: “We share in the family’s grief”.
This is a patient of the oncologist, Dr. Ronen Brenner.
The thoracic surgeon mentioned in the article is a respected surgeon with many years of experience, and was selected in a tender to manage the thoracic surgery unit associated with the surgery department at Wolfson Hospital.
“According to Dr. Hagai Dekal, his quoted words are inaccurate and taken out of context.
It should be noted that this is a patient who unfortunately was in a very serious condition.
The hospital checks the details of the case transparently, and the Ministry of Health is familiar with the details of the case”.

A model for healing: three senior doctors tell about their mentors
Prof. Galia Rahav misses the wit and wisdom of the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, especially during the days of the Pandemic •
Dr. Shlomi Kodesh does not forget, even from the seniority of his position, the drive he got from the late Prof. Shaul Sokenik •
And Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev thanks Dr. Tommy Scheinfeld for the lesson in sympathy towards the patients •
Three key people in hospitals write about those who inspired them and encouraged them to be better, both as caregivers and as people.
Three senior doctors, three teachers for life and profession: on this occasion, of Israeli Doctor’s Day, "Israel Hayom" invited Prof. Galia Rahav, Dr. Shlomi Kodesh and Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev to remember the figures who accompanied them at the beginning—and helped them become who they are today.
Prof. Galia Rahav, Director of Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba |
About the late Prof. Marvin Shapira
The meeting that opened my eyes—and changed my life
If I hadn’t met the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was the director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Hadassah Hospital, I probably would have remained a specialist in internal medicine.
He is the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to pursue it.
I met him in the corridors of Hadassah, sometime in the 80s of the previous century.
For a moment I didn’t think I would leave internal medicine, as I liked the patient care itself; But Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also reflected in neurology, and in internal medicine, and practically in every kind of medicine.
I thank him for bringing me to this field.
I liked his investigative approach, an approach that gets to the root of the problem.
The discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor from every fiber of his being, who loved the patients and taught me not to take things for granted and to examine everything in depth.
He was a real and honest person, without ego, qualities that I really liked about him.
Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me and influenced me the most, I intended to choose my father, the late Dr. Yosef Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.
He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go into medicine—but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapira.
Both of them, for example, coined proverbs that doctors use to this day—for example "tissue is the issue", that is, taking a biopsy of tissue from the infected organ opens possibilities to know which drugs should be given; or "Once You Use It, You Lose It", which is intended to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to it.
The late Prof. Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked in Hadassah and was a father of two daughters.
He passed away about a year ago, and when I visited his family at the Sheevah, I cried.
He was unique—a witty and clever epidemiologist, who volunteered for everything.
He has never complained, not even while enduring his severe illness.
He was one of the first doctors on the team of epidemics treatment, and he is sorely missed at this time.
If he were with us today, I’m sure I would have consulted him, and I’m sure he was one of the leaders of the team for dealing with epidemics.

Dr. Shlomi Kodesh, director of Soroka Hospital |
About the late Prof. Shaul Sokenik
A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors
.
I met the late Prof. Shaul Sukenik for the first time when I was a student in the fourth year of medical studies, and I arrived to work rotation shifts in internal medicine at the 4th internal medicine department that he managed.
Later on I returned to the department in my sixth year rotation, and I did the final thesis of medical school under his guidance, writing a computer simulation about a patient with polyarthritis (inflammation of multiple joints).
Shaul influenced every significant juncture in my professional life over 20 years, and was the most significant person in shaping my character as a doctor; Not only professionally, but also—and above all—from a personal and humane point of view.
During the internship I couldn’t decide if I wanted family medicine or internal medicine, and I consulted him about the choice of specialization.
In the end I chose to specialize in internal medicine with him in Soroka.
During the internship, he provided me constant guidance, in a variety of routes—in scientific writing (sorry Shaul, I was not persistent enough), in communication with patients, working in a multi-professional team—an area in which the department excelled—and basically, in every aspect related to medicine.
To this day, I recognize within myself, as a doctor and as a manager, features that originate from Shaul.
When I finished my internship and was debating whether to go for a training period abroad, Shaul encouraged and guided me, and helped me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to conduct myself.
The training period was a very important period for my professional development, and without Shaul’s support and encouragement I am not sure this would have happened.
Upon my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital’s management, Shaul was once again the one who supported and helped.
Later we managed through complex periods together in the internal medicine division.
Shaul knew how to combine wonderfully being the teacher, the manager, the friend and the team partner, without his different roles interfering with each other.
I aspire to be as successful as him in this special combination.
He raised generations of students and interns, who are positioned today throughout the medical system in Israel, and perpetuate his memory and his work with their excellent work.
I am honored to be among this group.

Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev, director of the Schneider Pediatrics Center |
About Dr. Tommy Scheinfeld
The man who taught me medicine, and especially how to listen.
Dr. Tommy Scheinfeld, founder and former director of the Intensive Care Unit at the Schneider Pediatric Center, taught me to be an intensive care physician, but more than that—he taught me how to think.
The obvious thing I learned from him is to take care of the most complex and sickest children.
The children, which some were healthy just a moment ago, and are now between life and death.
The obvious thing is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who did not imagine that they would find themselves in these complex situations in the intensive care unit with their children.
Sounds strange, but it goes without saying.
But I learned significant and even deeper things from him.
Looking back, since I am a managing doctor and a medical manager, the connection between the worlds is clear to me today; The education I received from Dr. Scheinfeld connects them.
Dr. Scheinfeld taught me to listen attentively to many things: to listen to the children, to listen to the monitor, to listen to the attending nurses, to the nursing teams both young and old, and to listen to the parents.
All this should be done not only to communicate more correctly and more successfully, but to constantly collect a lot of information that can prevent the next deterioration.
The preventive processes in child care exist everywhere, and of course also in intensive care.
Listening and conversing stimulate a deeper understanding, both from the treating staff and as well as from the patients and their families.
My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true when looking at a system as a whole.
The more in-depth and rigorous understanding is, integrating all the treating crews in the discourse, the more accurate the decision-making process will be, adapted to the situation, and above all—early enough in order to prevent future, immediate or distant damages.
That’s the reason that Dr. Tommy Scheinfeld is much more than an inspirational figure to me.
He is a person who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think quickly and accurately, listen—and then apply.

Medical negligence in the various stages of childbirth
In order to be entitled to compensation, the plaintiffs must prove that in addition to the negligence, the damage was indeed caused by that very same act of negligence
A birth is one of the most joyful and exciting events in a family’s life.
However, unfortunately, births sometimes end with serious damage to the mother or the newborn due to negligence of the medical staff.
In cases of a birth that ended in physical injury to the newborn or the mother, examining the chain of events that led to the injury is required, as well as considering to appeal for legal counseling.
A lawyer specializing in the field of medical negligence will examine whether there were defects in the conduct of the medical staff during the various stages of birth that caused the damage and, as he deems appropriate, will consult a medical expert in the relevant field.
It must be emphasized that not every error in treatment by the medical staff amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that its management was negligent.
When is it regarded as negligence?
When the doctor’s mistake is a consequence of lack of skill or a deviation from the reasonable level of caution, and the lack of skill and deviation from the accepted level of caution, caused damage to the patient that would not have been caused if the doctor had not operated this way.
In this article we will examine the different stages of childbirth, we will explain the complications that may occur in each of the stages and when they amount to medical negligence.
The dilation stage
The dilation stage lasts on average between 8 and 14 hours.
At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (to allow the passage of the fetus during birth) and at the end of the process, should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.
Most of the cases of medical negligence during the labor stage deal with failure to recognize fetal distress before birth, which caused damage to the newborn, sometimes even manifesting itself as cerebral palsy.
Cerebral Palsy (CP):
Cerebral Palsy may be due to failure to recognize or delay in recognizing perinatal asphyxia, which is manifested as lack of oxygen supply to the brain of the fetus.
In general, monitoring the condition of the mother and correct interpretation of the monitor that follows fetal cardio activity heart should lead to early detection of fetal distress, allowing the medical team to act quickly and deliver the newborn before it is irreversibly impacted.
Cases of the medical team ignoring signs indicating that the fetus is suffering from lack of oxygen or of the team not interpreting the data correctly, of the fetal monitor in particular, or reacting too late to the distress expressed on the monitor – this may constitute negligence.
Cerebral palsy may also be caused by prolapse of the umbilical cord, as well as by a uterine rupture that was not detected on time.
Even in these difficult events, the appropriate mode of action is to find out whether the medical staff acted properly.
For example, attorney Anna Raif Liganza, from the office of Caspi Seror & Co., specializings in representing victims of medical negligence, says that her office handled the claim of a child who has sustained damage during his birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the fetus’s head was too high, thus causing the umbilical cord to prolapse (when the umbilical cord precedes the fetal head) and block the oxygen supply to the fetal brain (as a result of the pressure of the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and to be born with severe neurological damage.
In another case, the lawyer said that her office filed a lawsuit due to the serious medical negligence of the staff of the maternity ward at a large hospital who, during the birth, did not recognize clear signs at the time that implied a real possibility that the mother was suffering from a ruptured uterus in the area of a surgical scar since her previous pregnancy.
The fetus that was delivered through the rupture in his mother’s womb into her abdominal cavity suffered severe fetal distress before he extracted at a later stage as he was on the verge of death.
Due to this severe fetal distress during his birth, the child sustained a complex neurological disability.
We emphasize that in order to gain compensations, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence the existence of a causal connection between the negligence of the medical staff that led to the failure to identify the asphyxiation and the damage caused to the newborn, meaning that the damage was caused by said negligence and not by any other reason or factor.
The examination of the causal relationship will be carried out through the examination of medical indicators which, according to the medical literature, only if those exist there is a causal relationship between the asphyxiation and the brain injury.
Among other things, the indicators of the level of blood acidity of the fetus, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic damage and more are examined.
the death of the fetus
The expulsion (pushing out) stage
The active labor stage begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.
Delay in childbirth and avoidance of performing a caesarean section operation
In some cases, a dysfunctional birth occurs, that is lack of progress during the active birth process.
In such situations, it is customary to perform a caesarean section, in order to prevent various damages that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in delivery.
“There are cases in which failure to perform a caesarean section on time may cause irreversible damage to the fetus”, attorney Raif-Liganza explained to us.
“For example, we managed a medical malpractice claim for the death of a newborn child caused by a significant delay in performing a caesarean section.
Contrary to any known medical practice, the medical staff did not know how to recognize the fetal distress and perform a caesarean section despite the extremely slow progress of the birth.
The delay in performing the surgery caused a lot of systemic damage to the newborn, which finally led to her death shortly after her birth”.
Malpractice in vacuum delivery
In situations where the mother or the fetus is in significant danger that requires an extremely quick termination of the birth, a vacuum birth (vacuum extractor) is sometimes performed.
In this process, using a vacuum, a “cap” is attached to the fetus’s head and then the fetus is pulled out forcefully.
Naturally, this operation involves dangers and may cause damage to both the fetus and the mother and therefore requires great care, precision and skill.
In these events, medical negligence may manifest itself in the fact that the doctor does not adhere to the mandatory instructions and performs the operation despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the fetal head is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for a longer time than allowed or when, despite the failure of many attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the operation more of the number of attempts allowed.
In these cases, if the negligent operation of vacuum extraction caused damage to the newborn – including but not only, it could cause cranial damage and bleeding that could cause brain damage – it is possible to file a tort claim.
ERB Paralysis
ERB Paralysis, is a congenital nerve injury in the brachial plexus (nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is appropriate to check whether the damage occurred as a result of obstetrician crew negligence.
The injury manifests itself as a weakness of the hand muscles and in acute cases may reach complete paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis is often caused by a difficulty in removing the newborn due to “dislocated shoulders” – an obstetric emergency that occurs when the shoulders of the fetus are trapped in the birthing canal after its head has crowned.
When should you suspect that the paralysis was caused by medical negligence?
In cases where the weight evaluation the fetus indicated that it is a macrosomic fetus, this means the expected birth weight is more than 4.5 kilograms and according to guidelines, it is better to perform a caesarean section.
When the weight of the newborn is over 4 kilograms, a caesarean section should be considered in light of the risk factors, including gestational diabetes and the prolongation of the second stage of labor.
In the event that the medical team disregards the abnormal fetus weight assessment or other risk factors and chooses to continue with a vaginal birth, and shoulder dislocation and paralysis due to ERB occurs, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical negligence.
Indeed, in AA 2694/90, the Supreme Court stated that “A caesarean section should be performed when the risk that shoulder stenosis will occur during childbirth can be predicted in advance with certain accuracy, in order to prevent shoulder stenosis, when a risk of its occurrence is identified.”
Placenta stage
Separation of the placenta from the uterus and exiting occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the newborn expulsion and is followed by bleeding.
The process lasts in most cases up to half an hour from the moment the baby is born and often occurs spontaneously, without the medical intervention.
After the placenta comes out, the medical team will check whether it came out in its entirety or whether there are parts of the placenta left in the uterus.
During this stage, complications may occur that may cause serious harm to the mother.
One of the well-known complications resulting from placental remnants remaining in the uterus is called “Asherman’s syndrome”, the scarring of the uterine wall as a result of inflammation due to placental remnants left in the uterus, this phenomenon damages the endometrium so that it prevents rooting pregnancy.
Therefore, in cases where the medical staff didn’t detect placental remnants or didn’t act with all possible measures to prevent scarring of the uterine wall albeit the suspicion of placental remnants remaining in the uterus, this might be a case of medical negligence and an experienced lawyer in this field should check the details of the case in question.
Maternal death
Maternal death during childbirth is quite rare.
In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy of life to the whole family turns, unfortunately, into the most tragic event for it.
In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the woman giving birth on time or reacts late to said bleeding.
“For example...”, Attorney Reif-Liganza told us, “our office filed a claim concerning a maternal death, in that case the medical team ignored and did not respond to the worrisome vital signs of the woman giving birth, for many hours, and was late in diagnosing a massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a well known complication of the underlying disease from which she suffered.”
“In another case...”, said Attorney Reif-Liganza, “our office represented the relatives of a mother who died after giving birth to twins due to bleeding that originated from the caesarean section that was not properly sutured.
In that case, the woman in labor complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and clinical condition, reacting late only after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death”.
Uterine loss
In serious cases, medical negligence during childbirth can lead to a hysterectomy, says attorney Raif Lingza: “Our office filed a lawsuit against a hospital based on a hysterectomy due to medical negligence after the birth.
In that case, the mother, a 31-year-old woman, lost her uterus due to improper treatment for massive bleeding observed by the medical team after birth, and despite this factor, the actions that could have prevented the damage were not taken in time”.
What are the compensations awarded in lawsuits for medical negligence in childbirth?
Newborn compensation for damages due to medical negligence at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being given for pain and grief, nursing care and paid treatment, wage losses and pension for the victims and even their parents and additional damage components.
The compensation awarded to an injured minor for wage and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the economy.
In addition, the compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation accessories, the cost of adapting housing to the baby’s needs, mobility and more.
“The amount of compensation is determined in each case on a case-by-case basis and according to its circumstances”, says Attorney Reif-Liganza, and she adds and notes that “today, most lawsuits on the grounds of medical negligence end in a compromise that weighs the chances and risks that each party has in managing the procedure”, but the attorney added and said that “There are cases where the procedure ends only with a verdict, so if the lawsuit is not dismissed, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages and for example, in a lawsuit conducted by our office, the district court awarded a minor who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress compensation in excess of ten million shekels”.
In conclusion
Medical malpractice in childbirth is undoubtedly the nightmare of every family.
In these cases, a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that caused the tragic result, by an attorney skilled in managing medical malpractice claims, can help you win the compensation you deserve.
This is the reason for the prevalence of the eye disease Keratoconus in the south
A study revealed that there is a connection between the development of the disease and marriages between relatives •
The highest incidence was found in the Bedouin sector •
Expert: “It is possible that in any sector with many marriages between cousins, we will find a high incidence of the disease”.
Keratoconus is an inherited eye disease that causes some visual impairments.
It is very important to diagnose it as soon as possible, and find the right solutions to prevent the situation from worsening.
In recent years, several studies have been conducted that help to understand how the disease develops, and innovative treatments have been developed.
The new studies provide a research basis for the suspicion that the eye disease, Keratoconus, is a genetic disease.
A recent study, which was concerned with changing the shape of the cornea from a dome to a cone, revealed that the cause of the disease and the weakness of the cornea and the distortion of its shape is related to an enzymatic imbalance, as a result of which the free radicals may damage the proteins in the cornea – and its structure will change.
The source of that lack of enzymes is genetic, a fact that strengthens the hypothesis that Keratoconus is a hereditary disease.
According to Prof. Ariela Gordon-Shag, head of the department of Optometric Sciences at Hadassah Academic College, “in a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa, a prevalence of Keratoconus of 3.2% was found.
The highest incidence was in students from the Bedouin sector – 20% had Keratoconus, but it was a relatively small sample”.
The researcher added that this is not a surprising finding: “There is a high prevalence of Keratoconus in the Bedouin sector.
In our studies, we found that consanguineous marriages are a risk factor for Keratoconus.
Thus in any sector with many marriages between cousins, we may find a high incidence”.
In this context, it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unequivocal conclusion: in cases where there is a family history of Keratoconus disease, all family members must undergo an appropriate eye examination as soon as possible.
According to Erza Fruchter, a B.Sc clinical optometrist, “there are ten times more visits to the clinic from distant peripheral areas, mainly from the south, compared to the center”.
Fruchter adds that “In the last decade, I noticed that most of the patients apply from the outskirts, especially from the Beer Sheva area.
This is mainly due to a high incidence of marriages within the family (mainly in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and a lack of awareness of how to properly treat the problem”.
So how is the disease diagnosed?
Fruchter explains that Keratoconus usually develops during adolescence or in the late teens (ages 15–16 or 20).
The disease includes a decrease in vision, at the same time as an increase in the cylinder.
Keratoconus patients show distorted and/or blurred vision of figures and objects.
These signs worsen with the development of the disease, which usually develops slowly and gradually over years.
However, the disease may also develop at a rapid pace and reach its peak in just a few months.
Many of the patients even testify to increased sensitivity to light.
About three years after the operation in Gaza – the IDF revealed the name of Lt. Col. M.; Bennett: “Now, the people know the face of the hero of Israel”
Mahmoud Khair al-Din from the village of Horfish is a lieutenant colonel who was killed in the operation in Khan Yunis •
Head of Aman: “The publication deserves him, his family and his children” •
Later, the possibility of publishing the photo of Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno from a patrol of the General Staff will be examined
About three and a half years after the operation that became entangled in Khan Yunis, the IDF is today giving permission to publish that the person killed in the operation, Lt. Col. M., is the late Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khair al-Din from the village of Horfish in the north.
He was 41 years old when he passed away.
Prime Minister Bennett said after the publication: “It has been three and a half years since the late Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khir al-Din fell in battle in a secret operation in Khan Younis, and only now are we allowed to reveal his name and thank him for his contribution and dedication to the security of the country.
The late Mahmoud was a fighter in a paratrooper patrol and later rose through the ranks of the army to become a lieutenant colonel in the IDF’s special operations unit.
An Israeli hero who was posthumously decorated with the Commendation of the Chief of Staff”.
He also said: “I paid tribute to him at his funeral and now the people of Israel have the right to know him, the name and the face of the hero of Israel, Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khir al-Din, openly”.
The environment looked up to him.
Since the operation, the IDF has forbidden the publication of his name for security reasons, and today, after a discussion held by the head of the intelligence division, Major General Aharon Haliva, with representatives of the military censorship, and with the consent of his family members, it was decided to publish his name and picture.
Mahmoud Khair al-Din, the hero of Israel, was born on December 28, 1977 in the village of Horfish in the Upper Galilee, the eldest son of his parents Ahmed and Nazira, and he had seven brothers and sisters.
He is a member of the Druze community.
He was married to Nahad and father of two sons.
He served as an officer, fighter and commander in the special operations’ unit of the Intelligence Division.
Throughout his life, Khair al-Din was a social leader, and the environment looked up to him.
Until the 9th grade he studied at the school in Kfar Horfish, after which he transferred to the military boarding school at the Reali School in Haifa.
In October 1997 he enlisted in the paratrooper patrol, and in 2000 he graduated from officers’ school.
In 2002, he was located by the special operations unit in the Aman and moved to serve there.
While serving, he completed a bachelor’s degree in law at the College of Management and a master’s degree in education and business administration at the University of Haifa.
In 2002 he met his wife, Nahad, and in 2004 they got married.
Their first son was born in 2009, a year during which he and his friends founded an association that works to promote the status of the Druze community in Israel.
In 2010, he joined the “Acharai” association and started guiding a group in Kfar Horfish, after making sure that the association started operating in the Druze villages to encourage the youth to enlist.
In 2013, his second son was born.
The head of the Intelligence Division, Major General Aharon Haliva, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: “We have been turning for some time on the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Khair al-Din, a hero of Israel.
We finished work and came to the conclusion that there is no security obstacle to publish his name and picture.
He also deserves it, his family and his children”, he noted.
“Extraordinary educator and leader”
“Thanks to many operations, he is no less than a hero in my eyes”, said General Haliva.
“He has a significant contribution, which includes courage and composure, to the State of Israel.
He deserves to be given the place he deserves”.
And he added: “I didn’t know him personally, but he was an educator, an educator and an exceptional leader – not only on the operational side, but also in values”.
Major Haliva stated that later he will also consider whether to publish the photo of another hero, Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno from the Defense Forces patrol, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and whose photo was not allowed to be published.
The action in Khan Yunis took place on November 11, 2018.
The operation was the culmination of months of meticulous preparations in which the intelligence community took part.
In the command squad of the operation sat the Chief of Staff at the time, Lt. Col. Gadi Eisenkot, the head of the Aman at the time, Major General Tamir Hayman and the head of the Shin Bet at the time, Nadav Argaman.
The purpose of the operation has not yet been released, and the IDF stressed that it was an operation whose intelligence value was invaluable.
But the Arab media retrospectively presented communication equipment that the Palestinians say was left behind by the forces.
According to Hamas, the operation was aimed at burying listening devices.
According to publications, on the day of the incident, the force traveled in two vehicles.
The fighters were stopped at a checkpoint set up by Hamas personnel, and something in their behavior aroused the suspicion of Hamas operatives.
The activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.
The investigation in the field lasted about 45 minutes, during which it became more and more aggressive.
When the force realized that it was in a problematic situation, Lt. Col. Khair al-Din managed to distract the Hamas men, and in that split second, the commander of the force, Lt. Col. A, was able to open fire.
Three Hamas members were killed by the fire, and unfortunately also Lt. Col. Khair al-Din.
Ten months after the difficult incident, the Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Aviv Kochavi, decided to accept the recommendation of the Salvage Committee and award the Chief of Staff’s Salvage to three of the fighters in the incident deep in the Gaza Strip – among them the late Lt. Col. Khair al-Din.
The commander of the fighting force and another fighter in the team also received a Valor.
In the army’s statement at the time it was stated that Lt. Col. M received the valor for “his activity in the operation with his team, in enemy territory, with determination, composure and courage, in defense of his comrades”.
Later he acted out of initiative and striving for contact, took a front role in taking over the enemy and worked resourcefully to promote the takeover.
Consider switching from tweezers operations to an extensive operation
Israel should ask itself, once again, if it’s wrong to change policy regarding the Jenin zone •
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing this, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank in its wake, but Jenin’s militants may not leave it a choice.
The unsettling weekend we’ve just had, shows that even though the month of Ramadan passed, the area is still more explosive than ever.
It will take a lot of effort and common sense to safely cross the two upcoming commemoration dates: the “Nakba” day that is celebrated today (Sunday), and Jerusalem Day that will be celebrated in two weeks.
Quite a few parties will come forward in an attempt to jeopardize returning back to sanity.
Lead by, as always, elements of terrorism, concentrating on special efforts to try and maintain the violent atmosphere of the last few weeks.
Evidence of this has been given during the arrests operation in which the late YAMAM fighter, Sergeant Major Noam Raz was killed the other day.
Fighters who fought the battle in Jenin testified that they do not recall such a scope of shooting and violence—evidently not only there is an enormous amount of weapons in that region, but people are also willing to use them.
This situation forces Israel to ask once again, if it is not correct to change its policy towards the Jenin zone, thus to revert from small, intelligence-based tweezers operations to an extensive, mass-based operation.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite, set fire to the West Bank and the entire arena on its wake; Even now, the security system prefers to act selectively, when necessary, to avoid blow ups, but the Jenin militants may leave no choice.
Draw lessons for future events.
Raz’s death in combat is the best answer Israel could have given to those who claim to have intentionally killed Al Jazeera journalist, Shireen Abu Aquala.
Combat activity is dangerous for those who participate in it, and for those present in the area.
The IDF takes enormous risks for its forces in order to avoid harming innocents as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it with casualties among its fighters.
This indicates high morality, but it also has a combat-intelligence value: a terrorist captured alive—as happened the other day in Jenin—is an excellent source of information about weapons, terror attacks and other terrorists; this is information that usually cannot be obtained by any other means, and by obtaining it, it is possible to thwart the next attacks.
The IDF did the right thing when it released yesterday the interim investigation results of the case of Abu Aquala’s death, and made it clear that it is not possible to determine at this stage who caused her death.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful whether it will be possible to reach an unequivocal bottom line in the case.
In any case, it seems that nothing will convince the ones already convinced: the world has already rushed to condemn Israel without considering to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terrorism—the original reason the IDF continues to operate within Jenin.
As always, such stories tend to die out.
World public opinion is busy and moving on, obviously when a more intense war continues to rage in Ukraine.
Therefore, it is a shame that Israel insisted on giving the case of Abu Aquala’s death more unnecessary exposure, by showing the police’s unsuccessful handling of her funeral.
Even if Abu-Aquala’s family couldn’t withhold the early agreements, one would have expected the policemen to be slightly more restrained while accompanying the funeral procession, and certainly be less distraught by the Palestinian flags that were flown on it.
The responsibility is demanding: act to appease the situation.
The Minister of Internal Security and the Commissioner of Police acted well by initiating the investigation of the incident.
It seems it lacked adequate preparation and clear instructions, but the fact that this is the second time it has happened to the police in a short period, and in two different districts, is troubling.
Even in the Dizengoff terrorist attack, the police failed to manage the incident, isolate the scene and handle the media.
The investigative committee would do well if it will not settle for analyzing the police officers’ conduct at the funeral itself, but also draw lessons and conclusions that would enable a more successful handling of similar incidents in the future.
Along with the internal dealing with police issues, it is also required to consider the elected officials that have lost their just way of conduct.
The Israeli Knesset consists of a few Knesset members which are considered a danger to democracy.
They are found on the left and right wing, and exploit their Parliament immunity not for challenging the state, but rather to harm it.
Knesset member, Ofer Kassif, is the most recent example of this; if no action is taken against him—including prosecution for assaulting a police officer—the state will encourage the next elected official to extreme his actions even more.
Such moves, which are considered moves of defensive democracy, are essential in the explosiveness of this period, with factors in the background seeking to exploit the situation for political needs.
Anyone with common sense is expected to rise above all of these, and act to appease the situation; Otherwise, Israel could quickly be withdrawn into an escalation facing outer country enemies, and worse—against domestic ones.
A senior police officer: “Government policy and setting goals are required here”
The Israel Police has indeed initiated an operation to eradicate the phenomenon of illegal residents, but the road ahead is still long •
In the State of Israel, there is currently no single agency that encompasses this whole issue”.
“If you want to deal with the phenomenon of illegal residents, a government policy is required, from which goals, tasks and responsibilities must be derived.
A senior police officer told Israel Hayom, “in the State of Israel, there is currently no single agency that encompasses this whole issue”.
Up until a month and a half ago, before the escalation of the security situation severity, the phenomenon manifested itself in about 20 to 30 thousand Illegal residents who infiltrate daily through the loopholes in the fence.
Furthermore, 100 to 110 thousand Palestinians holding work permits enter Israel for work every day, passing through 34 controlled passages.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of The 1967 Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each sector is limited by the quota set by the political rank according to the security, economic and political situation in Israel.
The permits are issued by the IDF via the Coordination and Liaison Administration.
In light of this, an illegal resident is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is prohibited due to criminal involvement or relation to terrorist attacks, but in many cases it is Palestinians whose entry is prohibited because they do not meet the permitted permit quota.
It should be emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Elad were indeed considered illegal residents, but were not monitored, because they had not previously committed any criminal offense requiring security forces to monitor their movements.
“Therefore, their entry through the loopholes in the fence is meaningless”, says a senior security official, “those who want to carry out an attack can also enter the country through the controlled passages, and there have already been such cases in the past.
Thousands of arrests
Following the attack in Elad and considering the numerous warnings of attacks, the police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal residents.
By the end of the week, about 16,000 illegal residents have been arrested.
Of these, about 600 were investigated and criminal records were opened against them, and about 200 were imprisoned.
According to the police prosecution policy, proceedings against illegal residents are carried out only against habitual criminals or people who repeat the act over and over again (recidivists).
An illegal resident arrested for the first time is interrogated, documented and sent back to the occupied territories.
Sometimes this reoccurs, however the individual will only be arrested if this is the third incident. The resident is imprisoned and charged with illegal stay.
According to the law, if an illegal resident is caught within a range of about 50 to 100 meters from each side of the separation fence, military prosecution will take care of him.
Data received by Israel Hayom news shows that in 2021, the police handled 40,010 illegal residents, drivers and lodgers.
7,405 illegal residents were arrested and 19,533 got a criminal record opened against them.
In 2021 the police handled 6,537 employers, transporters and lodgers.
469 were arrested, and criminal records were opened against 5,640 of them.
“The foundations of the illegal resident phenomenon do not depend on the police, not on the IDF, not on the Israeli or Palestinian society.
That depend on other factors”, says a senior member of the law enforcement system.
“In order to address this phenomenon, their motivation to go to work in Israel must be sterilized, and on the Israeli side, they have to be charged highly to prevent them from passing the fence.
Sources involved claim that the failure to charge the right price is due to, among other things, a lack of prison space and the fact that arrests are only made when there are related offenses or when a recidivist is concerned.
Legal sources claim that deciding to collect a price off illegal residents starting from his third arrest, was made because the courts are unable to cope with the high number of arrests carried out every day.
Whoever examines the punishment as well, will find that it is not a deterrent”.
This is highly complex
A police official states that an illegal resident is typically a complex person”.
He can be a family father entering Israel to work and earn a few NIS and get back home.
This is the basic platform, and it is used by many types of illegal residents who enter the country to commit criminal offenses or terrorist attacks”.
An illegal resident may be an adult or a minor.
In the past, 16-year-old illegal residents were caught by the police, and even 8- and 10-year-old children were sent by their parents to road junctions, to earn a few NIS a day from drivers.
“It makes the matter even more complex, since in such cases we need to bring in the parents and charge them for child neglect”, says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel as manual laborer.
The most unusual are electrical workers or advanced construction workers.
In the past, there were also local authorities that employed illegal residents in garbage disposal, mainly in the north.
Out of 34 passes, there are about 18 major passes.
There are passages for vehicles and goods, there are passages through which only people pass, and there are passages which are both.
All crossings are supervised by the IDF and the Crossings Authority.
The illegal resident are usually driven into the country by private drivers, as this is easy money earned.
“There are those who do this for a living, and there are gangs whose main business is transporting illegal residents” says a senior police official, “usually most of them are Israeli Arabs, who speak the same language and correspond with them.
The price for transporting can reach as high as 100 NIS to 300 NIS per person.
Registered companies do not engage in this, because if the company is caught, it will be closed by law”.
The police emphasize that on certain conditions, driving an illegal resident might be a criminal act.
“A taxi driver who works with licenses in accordance with licensing and insurance, who picks up Palestinians at regular points and at regular times, including a regular order, is not breaking the law”, says a senior police officer, “whoever knows he is an illegal resident transporter, usually picks them up in the dead of night at hiding spots, including dropping them off in hidden spots.
Generally these guys drive an old car because they know that the car will be confiscated, therefore they prefer to use an old one”.

“A criminal investigation should be opened against her”: the Haifa City Comptroller makes serious accusations against Einat Kalish Rotem
The City Comptroller’s report shows apparent concern about criminal conduct by Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former senior officials in the municipality and political opponents: surveillance of employees and an inflated payment to an accountant’s office for conducting investigations •
“The difficult findings emerging from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation” •
No response was given from the Haifa municipality.
Surveillance of municipal employees and political opponents and an inflated payment to an accountant’s office for carrying out the investigations, “at the expense of the public purse”.
The Haifa Municipality Comptroller, Ofer Tal’s report published yesterday (Tuesday) presents an alleged fear of criminal offenses by Mayor Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former senior officials of the municipality, municipal employees, and political opponents.
According to the suspicion, Kalish met with the accountant’s office, Barlev & Co., and asked to perform an investigative audit.
The investigations were conducted under names and codes given to the former municipal treasurer, and a code name given to council member, Sofi Nakash, and it was checked whether the tenders between the municipality and a company owned by Nakash’s family are strictly kosher.
The Comptroller’s report also shows that there is disorder and a complete lack of control after the work of the accountant with whom Kalish met.
The municipal treasurer is the municipal entity whose role is to coordinate and synchronize the work of the accountant and the municipal departments, and the data collected by the accountant were not transferred to him.
This meant that no one in the municipality is aware of all the projects carried out by the accountant, and what is the scope of work required in each of them.
Moreover, the hours reports submitted by the accountant were not approved in many cases as required.
A situation arose in which the scope of the issues in which the accountant was involved grew disproportionately, with a great deal of interference in the routine conduct of the municipality, without any supervision and monitoring by the municipality.
At the conclusion of the report, the Comptroller recommended stopping the unpaid payments to the accountant, until material is received detailing his work in each of the issues he reviewed.
In addition to this, invoices submitted to the Haifa Municipality were under codes such as “gatekeepers”, information shop, fish shop, investigative audit for the mayor and procurement investigative audit report.
A short time later, the spokesperson for the municipality, lawyer Yamit Klein, stated that the mayor herself signed the approval of the payment in her place.
“It was not commissioned by any audit report and I do not know what it is about”, she wrote.
It was also learned that the cost of the investigative audit is about two million shekels of which one and a half million shekels were paid and about half a million shekels remain to be paid, from the tax money of Haifa’s public.
The former municipal treasurer, Jackie Vakim, responded: “These despicable actions that were done to tarnish my name and the name of elected officials at the expense of the public purse and the Haifa taxpayers are a criminal offense.”
City Council member, Sophie Nakash, in her response: “The Comptroller’s report and the committee’s recommendations speak for themselves.”
The response of lawyer, Sarit Golan, a member of the Haifa City Council: the evidence and the difficult findings emerging from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the use of the investigative audit consultant to carry out investigations, some of which are doubtful as to whether they are permitted by law in the manner in which they were carried out, and in particular the investigations concerning the council’s company from the opposition to the mayor and former senior employees”.
Lior Datz’s response from the “Shomeri HaSaf” association: “It seems that all the red lines have been crossed when a public authority sends private investigators to collect information against lawyers who represent an association that exposes corruption and at a time when the association is conducting public proceedings against the administration of Haifa’s Municipality”.
No response was given from Haifa’s Municipality.
The Yehuda Barlev CPA office does not wish to comment.
Gantz revealed: “Iran and Hezbollah worked together to harm the activities of UNIFIL in Lebanon”
The Minister of Defense participated in the international cyber conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that “Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their methods of operation” •
Gantz also referred to the documentation of al-Sayed in Hamas captivity: “A video aimed at extortion—on humanitarian issue’s expense” •
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: “We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems”
Defense Minister, Benny Gantz, spoke this morning (Wednesday) at the international cyber conference of the Cyber Center at Tel Aviv University where he revealed a joint attack by Iran and Hezbollah to harm UNIFIL forces in Lebanon, “another attack by Iran and Hezbollah aimed at the citizens of Lebanon and the destabilization of the country”, Gantz said.
Gantz also referred to the documentation of al-Sayed in Hamas captivity in Gaza, who was released by the military wing of the terror organization: “yesterday a video has been published aimed to extort—on humanitarian issue’s expense.
Hamas is holding the four soldiers captive in violation of international law, in violation of morality.
Hamas is responsible for this and we expect the international community to act against this criminal behavior of Hamas”.
He also added that “the State of Israel is working in a variety of ways, and will not leave any unturned stones in order to get the boys back home.
As we said before—this is a humanitarian issue, that’s how we see it, and on this basis we will continue to act.
Blackmail attempts and consciousness manipulations will not affect our position and conduct”.
He later revealed the joint activity of Iran and Hezbollah: “Iran also operates its agents in cyber space: I can reveal today that recently the activity of the Iranian security agencies in cooperation with Hezbollah has been detected, aiming to harm the activities of UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.
By carrying out a cyber operation aiming to steal materials on UNIFIL deployment in the area, to be used by Hezbollah.
This is an additional attack by Iran and Hezbollah on the citizens of Lebanon, and on the stability of Lebanon”.
“Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their methods of operation.
In recent years, we have observed a phenomenon of hacker groups on behalf of Iran, operating against Israel and additional countries”, Gantz continued and said.
“The ‘new couriers’ are terrorists with a keyboard who should be treated as soldiers of other terrorist organizations.
We know who they are, we hurt them and their senders, and even today they are our objective—and not only in the cyber space.
No attack against Israeli citizens will be dismissed and disregarded.
And the responsibility lies with the attackers and the country that finances and sends them.
Retaliating a cyber attack can be in a variety of ways in cyberspace as well as in other spaces”.
Gantz continued with attacking nuclear power: “Iran leads cyber terrorism—and makes moves aimed at impacting democratic processes and governments, as happened in the US presidential elections and in other attempts that Israel is aware of.
Actions such as that of the ‘Shahid Kawah’ unit, which collected information on ships, gas stations and industrial plants in several countries, were carried out under the direct directive of Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards, as revealed in the investigations”.
He also added that “in recent years we have thwarted many attempts to break into private and public companies, in Israel and abroad.
I also call on the public to demand ‘cyber responsibility’, and to punish companies and entities that do not act in accordance with the guidelines”.
Gantz went on to indicate Israel’s next goals in the face of the threats: “Our highest mission, in the army, in the industries and in the various security organizations, is to build the people, train them, and keep them.
The Chief of Staff and I have made this issue one of the main assignments of the relevant units.
We examine the construction of the force all the time—in terms of manpower, training and in terms of assignments.
In the coming years, we will have to examine the form of organization, management and operation of cyber warfare, considering its offensive and defensive characteristics within the IDF and the entire defense system”.
Finally, the Minister of Defense concluded and called for cooperation with the world: “Our cooperation with the world against Iran is of great importance, also in the cyber dimension.
We are also broadening into cyber space, establishing the very same cooperation we are maintaining in the region, against Iran, concerning the defense against various threats”.
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: “We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems”.
Uri, the deputy commander of Unit 8200, said in the unit’s first public appearance at this type of conferences, revealed that Israel had thwarted an attack on the water systems.
“Thwarting cyber threats is a principal part of our activity.
Our goal is to gain superiority over the attacker, to be able to identify him and to act to negate his capabilities”, said the deputy commander of 8200 and added “this is how we sometimes find victims outside of Israel and then we contact other agencies if necessary.
We do this both independently and while collaborating with the industry and other agencies, through the implementation and use of the tools we have developed.
8200 will not rest until the threat is removed”.
As mentioned, this is how a threat to Israel’s water systems and the attempts to poison Israel’s citizens was revealed: “We thwarted the attempt to take over Israel’s critical water systems and poison them several years ago.
In a second case we also identified that a certain adversary attacked Israel and in the process we identified that the same attacker also tried to target power plants in the USA.
This was the first indication of this attack.
We managed to prevent this threat through close cooperation with our American partners”.
Watch: This is how the police prepares to eliminate terrorists in a civilian population
The Jerusalem Police inaugurates a new facility, “Assaf”, that simulates a shooting in a huge mass of people in response to a series of attacks that have occurred in recent months •
An anti-terrorist guide of Border Police of Jerusalem surroundings states: “Development provides a relevant response to the attribution threats and simulates the reality of the area” •
A glimpse into the “Assaf” facility
Preparing for the next attack: A series of terrorist attacks performed in the spring by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, during which 19 people were murdered and about 70 civilians were injured, led the Border Police to develop a unique technique that trains fighters to attack terrorists within civil population and shoot while in motion.
“Israel Hayom” reveals: A glimpse into the “Assaf” facility
Popular terrorism focuses on harming civilians and aims to undermine the sense of security vital to leading a normal life of a civilian population.
The severe wave of attacks that occurred this year, with attacks in Beer Sheva, Hadera, Bnei Brak, Ariel, Elad, and especially the one that occurred at the beginning of April on the busy Dizengoff Street in the midst of Tel Aviv, by a terrorist who was assimilated into a mob, led the police to think creatively in order to develop a tool that would be used to train fighters to attack terrorists within a civil population.
The work was led by the training division of the police and the Border Police.
They announce of a competition among all the police districts with the title “Commanders leading learning”, by which each district is required to develop measures that will help improve the policing and fighting skills of the fighters, policemen and commanders.
As part of the competition, and as a response to the need for the Border Police fighters to practice combat in shooting on the move and in this type of descriptions, Assaf Ben David, a counter-terrorism instructor of the Jerusalem surroundings Border Police, developed the “Assaf facility”, which consists of a dynamic target, which is connected to a telescopic pole on which a carrier can be harnessed to a guide.
After harnessing the carrier onto his waist, the guide can then train the warrior in front of him by controlling and moving the target to various sides and ranges.
It should be emphasized that in recent years, Border Police soldiers have faced many attacks in which the perpetrator, is shooting and thus posing a threat while moving in arenas packed with innocent civilians.
“Assaf facility”, in its current version, is based on components and parts that are used in various fields.
For example, the telescopic rod that was upgraded and integrated into the device, was taken from maintenance and cleaning domain.
Using the device, it is possible to simulate shooting on the move within a civilian population towards a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the object, dealing with traffic stop, choosing a path of progress, carrying out selective shooting, including practicing preventing harm to bystanders.
Sergeant Major Assaf Ben David, whom the device has been named after, says: “The device we developed is a breakthrough in teaching and training soldiers and policemen.
The development provides a relevant response to the attribution threats and simulates the reality of the area.
The benefit in development in addition to the relatively cheap production cost is a significant competitive advantage for us”.
The State Comptroller warns: “The Central Election Commission is not prepared for cyber threats”
Matanyahu Englman warned during the International Cyber Week of Israel’s lack of readiness for hacker attacks •
“World War III will be a war of hackers, but the world is not prepared for it”.
State Comptroller, Matanyahu Englman, participated today (Wednesday) in the annual cyber conference of Tel Aviv University and expressed concern about cyber attacks on Israel.
“We are exposed.
Our data is visible to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our health is exposed, our security is exposed.
“World War III will be a Cyber war, but the world is not prepared for it”.
Englman said that as part of the cyber audits his office conducts, significant deficiencies were found: “Last year, we performed penetration tests at the Traffic Management Center in Jerusalem, hospitals and the Tax Authority’s systems.
In the audits we found significant deficiencies, including the fact that very few penetration tests were ever performed by public bodies and some conducted penetration tests only during the audit.
In addition, there were deficiencies in the Central Election Commission’s readiness for cyber threats”.
“We at the State Comptroller’s Office undertake to continue to address this significant issue more strongly, for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world”, he concluded.
Aiming to the best: “I came to Hapoel Jerusalem to win titles”
The choice of Reds: “From the first moment they showed me that they wanted me, I have been built to lead a great team” •
Returning to the Israeli national team after four years: “I felt I had a place, I want to be one the staff for EuroBasket” •
And the time at Maccabi Tel Aviv: “I learned to concentrate only on what was under my control” •
Oz Blazer on an interview.
Oz Blazer will leave today with the players of the Israeli team to Poland, where they will meet the local team in the qualifiers for the 2023 World Championship (Thursday, 21:30 Israel time).
Three days later, the team will host Estonia at the Shlomo Group Hall.
Parallel to the intense training with the national team, Blazer was also dealing with his future last week, until finally he signed a two-year contract with Hapoel Jerusalem.
“I achieved peace of mind now that I found a team”, he tells “Israel Hayom” in his first and special interview since signing.
“I am a bit stressed now because I have to relocate with my family after living in the central district and it isn’t easy, but there are no more phone calls and of a professional point of view I’m much calmer”.
You haven’t been in the national team for four years, how happy are you to be back, and how eager are you to play in the next two games?
“First of all, I want to have fun in the team and I come with a will to contribute however I can, either from my experience or on the court.
Of course I would love to play, but when you reach the team, everyone has to put their ego aside and do everything for the team to succeed.
I’m here for whatever they need from me”.
Now you are 14 players, and Dani Abadia will join the European Championship, Gabi Chachashvili will return, and maybe there will be other changes.
Have you set your goal to be on the staff for the championship?
“I would love to be on the field and contribute”.
The 29-year-old Blazer (1.99 m) played for the last two years in Maccabi Tel Aviv.
When the season ended it was clear that he would not continue in yellow and after a few weeks he moved to the capital, preferring the Jerusalem team over Hapoel Holon.
Did you have other offers, why have you chosen to join Hapoel Jerusalem?
“They exhibited great willingness for me to be there, so it was a relatively easy negotiation.
As soon as I felt connected to the management and the coach I realized that this was the right place for me.
The situation also seems good and suitable to me.
I come to be a leader and be a significant member of the team.
I talked to the coach and he believes in hard work and winning, and that’s exactly what I wish to bring.
I have always loved playing in Arena, because I get energized even if the crowd is against me, and now having them on my side it will be even better.
I’m sure this will be a dedicated and fun team and I wanted to be a part of that”.
Please elaborate a little on your conversation with coach Džikić.
“Professionally, he preaches for moving a lot without the ball, he plans to bring good players with high basketball IQ and wants a very intense team.
He believes in high energies in defense and attack and with the audience coming to Arena hall, it could be succeed”.
I looked at your career and saw that you stay at least two years in each team, sometimes more.
Do you feel that you can also stay with Jerusalem a few years?
“Everywhere I go I like to connect and give my all, and people appreciate that.
From the moment I signed with Jerusalem, my phone never stopped ringing and beeping.
I received many messages that they are waiting for me already.
So I believe that good times are coming”.
Do you think the playing with the Jerusalem group will let you be a more significant player than in Maccabi Tel Aviv?
How do you summarize those two years at Maccabi Tel Aviv?
“Unfortunately, there were things that were out of my control during the last season.
Everyone saw that I remained a professional all the way, and no matter how much I got—I always gave it my all.
I’m proud of the path I’ve taken in the past year, and now everyone goes their own way”.
If it was up to you, would you want to stay at Maccabi?
“After last year it was clear to both parties that our ways were going to part, but that is part of the business.
Towards the end of the season I played a few minutes less and my status dropped, in spite of having a great time during the middle of the year, they decided to go to other directions.
After I understood the situation there, I realized that actually it was less of a suitable place for me.
Hapoel Jerusalem is the best option for me and that’s why I chose it”.
Finally, what are your goals for the upcoming season?
“They talked a lot about what happened in the semi-finals of the cup last season when I shouted to Ami Biton (team manager at Maccabi Tel Aviv—YM) ‘That’s what I’m here for’, so that’s what I came to Jerusalem for—to win titles”.
Wade Baldwin may join Maccabi Tel Aviv
The Yellow Shirts are in talks with a past season Basconia star (26, 1.93 m) and hope to add him to complete the back line for the 2022/23 season.
Is Maccabi Tel Aviv about to get a shiny acquisition?
Guard, Wade Baldwin, may join the Yellow Shirts and complete Oded Katash’s back line for the 2022/2023 season.
Baldwin (26, 1.93 m) played last season in Basconia and averaged an impressive 14.1 points, 4.4 assists and 3.6 rebounds per game.
Before that he played for Bayern Munich in Olympiakos, and also played in the NBA.
If he signs, Baldwin will join Alex Poythers, Guy Pennini, Darren Hilliard, Austin Hollins and Bonzie Colson who already signed earlier this summer.
Rafi Manko and Josh Nibo have also closed deals and are expected to officially sign their contract soon.
First publication: Will Adam Ariel be transferred to Hapoel Tel Aviv?
The Red Shirts are interested in signing in the 27-year-old forward if he is released from Hapoel Jerusalem •
Raz Adam may be lent to Ironi Nes Ziona City •
In Jerusalem they decided not to continue with Ratin Obasohn’s option.
Hapoel Tel Aviv is looking into the possibility of adding Adam Ariel if he is dismissed from Hapoel Jerusalem.
As you may recall, a few days ago we published that the future of the 27-year-old forward in the Jerusalem club is in doubt and it is possible that the team will take advantage of the option to discontinue his contract, when a final decision will be made in the coming days.
Now it turns out that if he does not continue in the capital, Hapoel Tel Aviv will try to sign him to its ranks.
And in Jerusalem, the club leaders decided not to use the clause in Ratin Obasohn’s contract to play for another season and informed him of his release from the team.
In the meantime, the guard, Raz Adam, may be lent to Ironi Nes Ziona after he asked to leave the Reds in favor of more game minutes.

All or nothing: 1:1 between Hapoel Jerusalem and Hapoel Hadera
Guy Hadida scored an own goal in the 33rd minute but was able to make amends with an equalizer 10 minutes later •
Later, the contact was sent off with a questionable red (74) •
Hadera also remained with ten players following a red for the duty of Ido Levy (87)
Hapoel Jerusalem’s professional staff counted the number of foreigners on the field in Teddy tonight (Saturday night), much more than once, it should be noted, and at one point they even discovered one less player (Guy Hadida was sent off).
This time, to their happiness, everything was fine, and the 1:1 they achieved against Hapoel Hadera will not be taken away from them by the association’s court.
Before the red that Hadida received, he managed to score an own goal and equalize to arrange a precious point for Ziv Arie.
Already in the 33rd minute, Guy Hadida’s private show began.
Falkushchenko charged into the box, and the midfielder rose and hit back and the ball stopped in his team’s net.
0:1 to Hadera who benefited from an own goal by the midfielder.
Ten minutes after the own goal, Hadida managed to correct and in a big way – Levkovic caught air and this time the midfielder hit the correct and exposed net.
1:1 at Teddy.
In the 74th minute, Hadida also managed to register a second yellow and a red, this time after sliding in the direction of Marmentini.
Daniel Bar Natan decided on a dubious red and sent the midfielder straight to an early shower.
In the 87th minute, Bar Natan also sent Ido Levy in red and balanced the balance of power on the grass as well.
The Recovery Department: Eilat defeated Holon
60:85
Ariel Beit Ha-Lahmi’s team scored a third victory in a row, this time particularly impressive •
Huber and Shuchman (15 each one) excelled
Hapoel Eilat’s recovery journey continues tonight (Saturday night) with an impressive 60:85 victory over Hapoel Holon on the way to a 0:3 season balance in meetings between the two.
Since dropping to the last place, the team of Ariel Beit Ha-Lahmi already has three consecutive victories, and in fact it is a surprise only for those who did not see the game.
We haven’t seen Holon this bad in a long time.
All this before the opening of the series against Besiktas in the play-in in the Champions Cup: only 60 points, a first half without a three-pointer and 11 percent for three-pointers in the entire game.
Bottom line, an unimpressive evening for all the team’s players (with the exception of Murphy Manko, who scored Holon’s 3 three-pointers), including the safe share, Chris Johnson.
On the other side, Eilat is in much better shape thanks to Roy Huber and Joaquin Shuchman (15 points 21).
The first came back to himself in the last period and the second came back to bloom and also amazed with a basket from three quarters of the court.
Give them a chance: the Israelis of Maccabi Tel Aviv saved Sferopoulos
After a loss in the Derby and eighth in a row in Europe, a defeat in Clasico against Jerusalem—apparently, would have ended the long romance between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Greek coach •
So who does Yanis need to send a bouquet of flowers tonight?
to his Israeli crew, for achieving 42 critical points in the Arena hall •
And: why should the Yellow Club change the ‘Americanization strategy’, and take a living example from the Ariel Beit HaLhami model in Eilat
It’s hard to remain cynical at the sight of the tearful eyes and the warm and tight hugs Yanis Sferopoulos gave his players by the end of tonight’s game at the Arena, and especially in light of the tight hug and exchange of secrets with John DiBartolomeo, who saved the Greek coach his job with his bare hands, and possibly the entire season.
Because after a home loss of the Derby and the eighth in a row in Europe, to lose in Clasico to Jerusalem as well, causing a drop of three wins in the table?
This would have ended the Israeli-Greek romance this very night.
So in the meantime, he is with us, and he has a lot to learn from this game, also and in fact mainly about the Euroleague.
First, Maccabi Tel Aviv came with a radical change of their attack strategy and ball movement habits.
The ball moved with passing, with a lot of movement and drills, and Scottie Wilbekin, obviously left the work of point guarding to Evans, dribbled very little, and mostly went through blocks and out for shots.
Although he scored very poorly (2-9 from the field), Wilbekin contributed in defense, and most importantly, suddenly Maccabi looked like an actual team, and the other players scored.
Nevertheless, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in the brain, the team returned to its old habits, so the offense reverted to dribbling and shelling, and then in the most critical offense, with 2 points lead and 40 seconds to go, Scotty dribbled on his own to half a corner and threw a floater on one leg which almost lost the game.
The trick is to continue playing the drills and passing movements especially in the clutch moments, and this must be an integral part of the nature and DNA of the team.
The important learning will be done by Yanis and the club regarding the use of Israelis.
Those who became water-drawers and towel-wavers at European games.
Tonight they scored more than half of the team’s points (42 out of 83) for the coach who stopped believing in them, and they were the ones who kept the game alive at the end.
Four of Maccabi’s top five scorers were its Israelis.
And don’t say Israel is not Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can also help in the Euroleague.
In the first half it was mostly Oz Blazer, the section has been screaming for a month that he must play more.
Scorer, passer, fighter below the baskets (7 rebounds), 2 meters of defensive determination and game wisdom.
Isn’t that enough?
On the second half, Jake Cohen was a star, thanks to excellent percentages from all ranges, composure from the line, and covering for Žižić’s injury. John Dee, starred as well when he changed the momentum with 5 consecutive points in a 70:63 situation for Jerusalem.
Yanis has a complex relationship with Yiftah Ziv, and it seems that sometimes he gives him too much credit, and burdens him too much, up to the point of risking a loss.
It happens in the Euroleague, and it happened tonight as well.
But the important learning should be the club’s, regarding its Americanization strategy.
It is a fact: the senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.
Tomer Ginat and Yam Madar went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Rafi Manko returned to Holon, and now Noam Dovrat chooses Jerusalem, or perhaps he got rejected by Maccabi.
And this happens because there are gradually fewer places left for Israelis in Maccabi, following the club’s informed and deep-rooted choice to base itself on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach a dead end, there will be no Israelis wishing to play for Maccabi, and then Maccabi will look for Jewish children to naturalized, and will put pressure on the director/union to further increase the number of foreigners.
But this is a fatal mistake for the club.
And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that it is exaggerating with the foreigners, a lot because of the tax reduction.
We certainly won’t claim that the Israelis alone are enough, however they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.
So instead of spending money on one star and eight mediocre ones, you can have five excellent ones for the same price.
For example, this season, with the money of Williams, Nunley, Evans, Reynolds and Taylor, it would have been possible to bring in two efficient and stable stars (a star center and a super forward) next to Scotty and Žižić.
It will be more effective, it will be more correct, it will be more Israeli, it will be more beautiful and interesting and cause sympathy.
It is true that there are two busy frames and a long season—so you have to trust your Israelis.
And also because you are an Israeli group, which claims to represent Israel, and therefore receiving a tax relieves from the state for its quasi-representation in Europe.
The basketball association/league administration can help Maccabi, and stick to a more sane number of foreigners according to the Israeli league.
6 Brewster, 4 in a form, maximum three on the field simultaneously.
Is it because of the continuous failed achievements (for seven years in Europe), just for Maccabi, that the league is overwhelmed with foreigners?
And the players’ organization, what about you?
Is that what you went on strike for?
There were two Israelis on the field, and now there is just one?
Like George Costanza in the Seinfeld pilot.
Bargain for less?
The previous Russian law was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for Maccabi.
And if anyone needed reinforcement of the above, Hapoel Eilat came in the preliminary game and explained it so well.
With 3 foreigners, and 4 Israelis that are just secondary from the junior teams (Hoover, Ben Moshe, Royna and Shuchman the warrior), the team destroyed Holon (second in the table!) For the second time in the past fortnight.
Traditionally Eilat plays well with three foreigners, since there was such a rush in the days of Dan Shamir and more so in the days of Sharon Drucker.
The short Eilat is simply a more balanced and efficient team, and there is no one like Ariel Beit HaLhami, starting on open courts in Givat Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everyone is at their prime, everyone plays together, and all Israelis learn and improve their game.
The foreigners are just a replacement.
When Ben Carter and Casey Prather return back from their knee injuries, this will be a formidable team.
A song I dreamt of Eilat.
And Maccabi can learn from this song about the right direction.
Yellow celebrations: “There was a feeling that the whole world was against us”
The Yellows are happy after the 78:83 win over Hapoel Jerusalem at the Arena: “We are back to playing the way Maccabi Tel Aviv should play” •
About Ami Beaton’s conversation in the locker room, the first optimistic diagnosis of Žižić’s injury and the management’s approval of the acquisition.
A great sense of relief is registered this morning (Sunday) among Maccabi Tel Aviv people after the important and prestigious 78:83 score yesterday at the Arena against Hapoel Jerusalem.
The team’s players and management personnel hugged coach Yanis Sferopoulos who seemed very excited at the end.
Yiftah Ziv and Oz Blazer enthusiastically poured water on Derrick Williams, who excelled in the game, and the other members of the club also smiled a big smile of happiness that showed how much pressure was released after the last series of losses.
They too were afraid of defeat against the great rival that would further destabilize the system.
The fans also stayed for long minutes to celebrate in the stands.
“There is an amazing connection between us and Yanis in the locker room”, said Oz Blazer.
“We know that the situation was not easy for him either, a lot of pressure was released.
We were really looking forward to it, also in the way we played.
We are back to playing the way Maccabi Tel Aviv should play, with heart and fight, we stand behind it.
He gave us pep talks and talked to us”.
Before the game started, the team manager, Ami Biton, entered the locker room and gave the players an exciting speech.
“His words had a great impact on how we went out and how we played on the basketball court”, Maccabi players said.
Despite the great joy, Maccabi are already aiming for the important game against Basconia on Thursday and want to interrupt the long losing streak in the Euroleague.
“I believe this game will change the momentum for us”, Blazer added.
“We lost a lot of games at the end and this time they led a few minutes before the end and that didn’t discourage us.
“In recent games we were under a lot of stress, Yanis told us that if we are free, we will win these games.
I believe this victory will take us forward.
Many eyes were set on us and it felt like the whole world was against us, I am proud to go to this war, we cut off everything around us and only look at ourselves”.
Ante Žižić who injured his right knee during the last quarter was examined by the medical team in the locker room and the initial diagnosis was not grave.
The doctors will check how the knee will react today and then it will be clearer how many days of rest he will need to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will be fit for Basconia.
Apart from the firm support the management has given to Sferopoulos and the professional team, at the meeting held on Thursday, the professional manager, Nikola Vycic, got the green light to bring one or two players to strengthen the team, and the Yellows hope to add a quality acquisition soon.
Anthony Bennett was released from Hapoel Jerusalem
The first forward to be selected in the NBA draft was not able to adjust in a capital city team •
At the club they said farewell: “Anthony entered our hearts, we thank him for his period working in Hapoel”.
About four months after signing with Hapoel Jerusalem, Anthony Bennett was released today (Sunday) from the team’s roster.
The first forward (28, 2.03) to be selected in the NBA draft of 2013 by the Cleveland Cavaliers recorded 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five games in the Champions League, as well as 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in eight games in the Premier League.
“Hapoel Jerusalem and the player, Anthony Bennett, announce that they have reached a joint decision on the release of the player’s contract at the club”, the club said, “Anthony entered our hearts, and we would like to thank him for his time at Hapoel.
We wish him the best and lots of success”.
Research states: Zoom meetings harm creativity
About 2,100 engineers and academics all over the world were asked to develop solutions to the problem—some in video meetings, some in face-to-face meetings.
The result: a virtual meeting hurts creativity and thinking outside the box.
The leader of the research at Columbia University: “The visual focus on the screen harms the process of generating ideas.”
Nechama Porta: There is no harm to work productivity or to critical thinking.
A large scientific study recently published in the scientific journal, Nature, examined the effect of meetings through video software on the creativity of the participants in them, compared to meetings held face to face.
Unfortunately, it has been found that creativity does suffer in virtual meetings through screens.
The research question—led by Melanie Brooks, assistant professor from Columbia University—was whether remote meetings using a computer preserve the creativity that exists in office brainstorming sessions, or whether the level of creativity and free thinking decreases as a result of remoteness.
The research has already began in 2016 but it achieved a big boost during the two years of the Corona Virus, when many employees started working from home.
“People in a personal meeting mingling in the room, using objects as an aid for creative thinking,” says Brooks.
“In a remote computer meeting, on the other hand, the concentrating on maintaining eye contact with the others comes at the expense of the brain creative activity.
The visual focus on the screen reduces cognition.
People are more focused on video when interacting, which damages the broad and expansive idea generation process.”
The space is shrinking.
In order to examine the experimental results and ascertain whether those are repetitive, the results were tested twice—once at Columbia University and once again in real life—on engineers who knew each other from a prior acquaintance.
At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty members and students into two parts—in first group the subjects were required to meet in person and develop solutions to the problem, and in the second one they were required to do the same via computer.
At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five European countries, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to divide the groups in a similar manner and solve a problem presented to them in an innovative way.
In both cases, a decrease in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking was found among those who met virtually on video.
Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher who works on ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.
In his opinion, as part of a thinking activity, people often look at their surroundings to help them create ideas, whereas in a video meeting, thinking converges on the screen and does not expand in a way that allows creativity.
“When the people are in the same room, they look around and see the space, where there are objects and situations that can evoke new associations in them.
On the other hand, the research shows that relationships through a computer change our attention so that we are more focused inward and on the screen, and this way reduces innovation and the creation of ideas through looking at the environment and thinking outside.”
Critical thinking is not harmed.
However, before managers rush the employees back to the offices, the researchers point out that “working through a computer did not harm productivity itself nor the people’s critical thinking about innovative proposals, when they had to choose the best idea from a set of ideas.
In other words, the damage is focused only on creativity and not on the other forms of working in front of a computer.”
Prof. Ellen Langer, professor of psychology at Harvard University, also disclaims the findings.
According to her, “There is a difference between mere creativity, such as new uses for frisbees (one of the research questions; AG) and work solutions.
It is also possible that when the employees will be more relaxed after getting to know each other, or when working from home, their creativity will improve.”
Both Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson suggested future research in which such meetings would be recessed for thinking and mingling to inspect how this activity would affect the final outcome.
Dr. Olson also suggested that following the study, only for brainstorming meetings, employees would return to work and in general, he suggested not to be alarmed by one study, but to carry out more investigations in the field.
“I wouldn’t want workers to be forced back and not be happy, that’s more damaging”, he says.
Musk is waiting for Trump’s return: “It was wrong to block him”
The new buyer of Twitter said that he will reverse the decision, which led to blocking of the account of the former US president.
“I believe it was a mistake,” he admitted.
Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk, who recently bought Twitter in a deal valued at 44 billion dollars, said on today (Tuesday) that he intends to return Trump to the social network, from which he got blocked during his time as a president, following riots by his supporters on Capitol Hill after he lost the elections to the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.
“I do think it was wrong to ban Donald Trump.
I think it was a mistake,” he said.
“If there are wrong and bad tweets, they should be deleted or made invisible, and a suspension—a temporary suspension—is appropriate, but not a permanent ban,” Musk clarified.
By 2050: The world will lose 80% of the water available for agriculture
A new global study predicts a significant decrease in the next 25 years.
The solution: proper management of water reservoirs
A disturbing new study recently published in the journal Earth’s Future predicts that by 2050 the amount of water available for agriculture will decrease by about 80% if the rate of water consumption and world population growth remain at their current usage trends.
In a study, in which scientists of every science agencies in the world took part, the scientists summarized the total amount of rainwater, rivers and fresh water sources in the world and compared it to humanity’s need for agriculture.
The dismal research conclusions show that currently the rate of water consumption has doubled repeatedly in the last 10 years, while global warming causes a decrease in the amount of rainfall in agricultural areas around the world.
According to the analysis of research data, 84% of the global agricultural lands will suffer severe shortages of rainwater.
One of the main conclusions from the study advises farmers around the world to adapt the agriculture to climate and seasonal changes, and to switch to growing methods that will ease water to soil penetration, in order to prevent water from evaporating causing widespread waste of rainwater.
The researchers also recommend that farmers that work near saltwater resources apply rainwater collection technologies in order to prevent rain water from flowing into the sea.
Information about many students from Bar Ilan University was leaked to the web
Hackers who attacked the database of Bar Ilan University a few weeks ago threatened to publish the information about the students if they did not receive a financial ransom •
The threat was carried out and the information was published throughout the network.
Students at Bar Ilan University are under attack by hackers when their personal information was published across the web by a network attacker known as Darkrypt, who published a ransom demand from the university staff a few weeks ago and threatened that if he was not paid an unspecified amount of money, he would publish the information he had.
The estimated amount of money that the hacker demanded is unclear since the amount started in the thousands of dollars and as the clock ticked, it increased, so just before the information was published it had already reached several million of dollars.
Facebook groups of university students and faculty members are full of angry messages and it was total chaos there, while students are unable to log into their personal information systems and cannot perform routine student assignments.
The university sent out an e-mail message in which it was reported about the attack that the academic institution went through and that they are working intensively to reduce the damage, while specifying some of the information that was leaked to the network.
No special instructions were given to those whose information was hacked and it was said there that the university carried out a series of actions to strengthen the security measures of the university’s servers.
News for 40 settlements: the optical fiber is coming to Mateh Benjamin
The trend linking peripheries with high-speed Internet continues and nowadays the optical fiber has reached the Binyamin Council, that consists of 40 settlements.
This joint project of collaboration with the council and telecommunications companies Talran, X-Fiber and Internet Rimon will commence immediately after the holidays.
The Benyamin Council signed at the end of the week on a broad span agreement to lay optical fibers in all the council’s settlements.
The agreement with ‘Net-Fiber’ venture with Internet ‘Rimon’, ‘Telran’ and ‘X-Fiber’ was signed after the conclusion of a large tender that the council had been working on for the past few months.
The works will commence after the holidays and residents from the 40 council settlements who are interested to connect to the fiber optic infrastructure will benefit from high speeds of up to 1 gigabyteת as well as advanced home equipment that will enable strong WIFI reception, as required in these times.
Those who join will be able to choose between fast internet on fiber optics or fast filtered internet on fiber optics which will be provided by Rimon Internet.
The council made sure that the market remained open to competition as a rule.
The mayor of the Benjamin Regional Council, Israel Gantz: “This is real Zionism.
This is great news for residents.
Life in Mateh Binyamin will improve, students will be able to study remotely if necessary, it will be possible to work from home and establish advanced businesses in communities that will have high-quality internet without delays.
I would like to wish success to the precious companies in implementing tasks in settlements.
The residents are waiting.”
Gantz also added: “Soon we will have proper conditions for high-speed internet, the best in Israel.
We worked for many months to bring a foundation for the fiber installation and now the vision is becoming a reality.
I thank the Minister of Communications, Yoaz Hendel, who started the project with us on his previous term and now we reap together the fruits of our labor, the Minister of Communications’ team, the council members who were entrusted with the center details and the companies’ CEOs that won the center for professional quality, the best in Israel.”

We checked: what do the side effects of the Corona Virus vaccine mean?
Many people who get vaccinated feel weak, feverish and tired after receiving the shot, while others do not.
Could this indicate a stronger immune system of those who do experience these symptoms, or is this a baseless rumor?
While more and more people are getting vaccinated, the lack of information about the side effects continues to confuse and cause rumors, most are untrue.
Are the immune systems of those who developed side effects stronger than those whose bodies reacted less severely to the vaccine, which may prove that their systems are unable to fight a foreign elements entering the body?
“There are several grades of reactions to the vaccine,” says Dr. David Dvir, head of the Primary Medicine Department at Meuhedet and a member of the advisory committee of the Epidemic Treatment Team, and reassures: “Headaches, fatigue, local pain, these are the immediate reactions of the immune system.
This is how the body reacts to the entry of a foreign element.”
Is there a connection between the levels of antibodies that the body develops and the acuteness of the side effects?
“There is no correlation between the feelings and the development of antibodies against the virus.
About 50–60% feel the side effects, but about 90% develop protection against the virus.
It was not found that people who developed strong reactions were more protected.”
“In the medical literature, there is no correlation between an immediate reaction and the level of the vaccine.
In some trials where people also received placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
This is also a mental component—how the person perceives the vaccine, if he expects there to be side effects.
Many of the symptoms that happen could also happen normally, but since the public is vaccinated, they attribute the reaction to the vaccine itself, and this is a bias that you see regarding vaccines in general—the attribution of phenomena that happen near the vaccine and are attributed to it.”
According to Dr. Dvir, the reasons for the commonly reported symptoms, such as weakness and headaches, are not yet known.
Regarding myocarditis, opinions differ.
“There are all kinds of theoretical assumptions on the subject, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
One of the theories is that it is a strong reaction of the immune system.”
Is there a possibility to assess the strength of the immune system?
“When students were exposed to the flu virus, it was shown that those who didn’t sleep or were under higher stress were more vulnerable to infection.
Other than that, there are laboratory parameters that test the immune system or its components.
When there is a condition of compromised immune systems, you notice it immediately.
People catch lots of viral or infectious diseases.
It’s not like someone suffers from a weak immune system and isn’t aware of it.
These are people who come for inquiries because of repeated incidents of infectious diseases, and what affects the system are banal things: stress, nutrition, sleep.
By the way, we don’t prefer an immune system that is too strong, because it can cause autoimmune diseases.”
Soon mRNA vaccines will appear in additional contexts, thanks to the extensive knowledge that has been accumulated about them in recent times.
“There is no doubt that this is a precedence for other vaccines of this type will be initiated.
This technology is being tested for many uses other than vaccines—for the treatment of oncological diseases, for example.
Their efficiency is that the substance stays in the body for a very short period—it enters, acts, and then breaks down.
This technology is not new, but it received a serious boost following the very great need for a rapid vaccine.
Now, for example, we know that an interval of three weeks between doses is too early, and some vaccine experts claim that it is possible that after the third dose we will not need another vaccine in the near term, so it is not clear whether we are about to need a vaccination every six months or that the third dose will offer a larger interval.”
Thousands were injured: a serious breach of privacy on Route 6
Are you Route 6 customers?
It is possible that your private information, including full name, addresses, payment amounts and complete details about the trips you have made, has been disclosed.
According to the Privacy Protection Authority, Derech Eretz violated the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations.
After a report submitted by Derech Eretz, operator of Route 6 in Israel, about a security breach that occurred with the company, the Authority for Protection of Privacy began an enforcement procedure.
As part of the event, security weak spots were discovered within its payment site, which allowed disclosures of information from the company customers invoices, that were revealed to all.
The customers’ payment invoices were revealed during a considerable period of time and these invoices contained personal customer information, including name and surname, payment sums, location of the vehicles, dates and times of trips.
On top of that, since Derech Eretz did not document as legally required the access to its systems, it is impossible to know precisely the time period that unauthorized parties could access the company’s systems.
In the violation letter, which the Authority for the Protection of Privacy sent to the company, the Authority emphasized that most companies and large organizations in the economy are required to adopt a dynamic information security policy, and that with frequent threats and risks, the organization has an obligation to carefully examine the updated risks and act in accordance with the update security measures accepted according to the circumstances of the case, in compliance to the characteristics of the database and its quality.
As a result, companies and organizations have the obligation to update their systems and conduct risk surveys and penetration tests, in order to examine the changing risks and prepare for them.
Also, there is an obligation for companies and organizations to use an automatic documentation mechanism and training must be conducted for employees, in compliance with the provisions of the privacy protection (information security) regulations.
In compliance with the findings of the inspection, the authority determined that the company violated the provisions of the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations and also demanded that the company perform several corrective actions.
The Derech Eretz company, operator of Route 6 stated: “The matter was handled in accordance with the strictest requirements”
Travel warning to Istanbul: surprising news for Israelis from the Turkish airlines
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus will allow Israelis to change their destination or date of their flight
Good news for Israelis who booked tickets to Turkey prior to the issuing of the travel warning: the airlines will allow to change the flight dates.
Reminder: earlier this week, the Counter-Terrorism Headquarters elevated the severity of travel warning to Istanbul, to level four.
Four is the highest level of warning and means “high risk level: do not arrive to this country and in the case of a overstay you are required to leave the country as soon as possible.”
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus stated that they will allow Israelis who booked their flight before the travel warning was issued, i.e. before June 13, 2022, to change the destination or the date of the flight they have.
This can be done by contacting the airline.
The Tourism Minister, Razbozov, said: “Citizens of Israel should not pay a financial price for terrorist threats.
I am happy that major airlines such as Turkish Airlines and Pegasus responded to our request and I hope that more companies will provide a similar response to all Israeli citizens who canceled their vacation in Turkey due to the severe travel warning.”

The skies of Saudi Arabia are getting closer: the Israeli airlines intend to increase flights to the east
The emerging conclusion for extended flight freedom over Saudi Arabia: the airline is planning to launch new flights to the Far East instead of destinations to Europe
The largest airline in Israel is planning significant changes prior to the arrival of US President, Joe Biden, to Israel.
As we published in “Israel HaYom”, it is estimated that Biden will announce granting of permission to El Al and all Israeli airlines to fly above Saudi Arabia towards other destinations besides the United Arab Emirates.
The meaning of the emerging agreement is that El Al will be allowed to take shorter flight routes to destinations in the Far East and Australia.
To this end, the company will have to cancel flights of less profitable destinations, in order to use the planes to fly to these new destinations.
The destinations that the flights will be canceled to, as of November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.
The three destinations have sizable Jewish communities, however, at this stage, these are less profitable for the company.
On the other hand, the new destinations that El Al is considering are Tokyo in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.
This is how the move will be made: the Dreamliner planes that fly to Canada will be released in favor of long flights to the East.
The Boeing 737 planes that fly to Warsaw and Brussels will be transferred to be used for flights to destinations such as London and Paris, to which El Al operates flights using Dreamliner planes.
So basically the company will be able to release large planes to fly to more destinations in the East.
At the same time, El Al expects talks to take place in the coming weeks regarding the possibility that the Israeli airlines will be able to return to flying to Turkey, as the company will be able to operate flights using the airline’s Boeing 737 aircrafts.
Making order in the chaos: how much will you pay for a suitcase on any airline?
Get the detailed list of baggage prices in all airlines.
Who offers €6 for up to 10 kg additional luggage, and where do flight prices exclude luggage?

Exemption from isolation for the vaccinated and recovering people coming from non-red countries, the foreign tourists are returning.
People arriving to Israel received notices from the Ministry of Health saying they are exempt fro the obligation to isolate upon receiving a negative answer to the corona test.
Only then did the ministry issue an official announcement stating that only travelers from orange countries were included, although people returning from red countries also reported receiving the announcement.
In addition: tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter Israel, and the forecast is that many red destinations will be removed from the list.
At the midst of a pandemic—is this the end to isolation for those returning from abroad?
The Ministry of Health sent notices this morning (Monday) to people returning to Israel, saying they are exempt from isolation upon receiving a negative answer to the corona test they performed after landing in Israel.
This includes returnees from red countries.
Some of the messages sent informed returnees that they could be released after receiving a negative answer or after 24 hours at the latest, and some of them received the exemption after getting a negative answer.
Only then did an official announcement come from the Ministry of Health stating that as of tonight at midnight, January 4, 2022, whether vaccinated or recovering, the returnees from orange countries will undergo a PCR test in Israel and enter isolation for 24 hours or until receiving a negative result (whichever comes first).
The decision will be stated in a decree by the Ministry of Health Director General and will be submitted for approval to the Health Committee of the Knesset.
The ministry clarified that vaccinated or convalescents who have already returned to Israel from an orange state and received a negative result from the PCR test they performed upon entering Israel, will end the isolation tonight at midnight and are not obligated to perform a second test.
However, travelers from red states reported that they also received the message.
Those who have not been vaccinated or recovered and returned from an orange country, will enter home isolation for 14 days, with the possibility of shortening isolation upon receiving a negative result in a PCR test performed starting on the 7th day after landing in Israel (the day of landing is the first day).
The decision to remove most of the restrictions on flights and especially on those who are vaccinated comes a day before the High Court hearing submitted by the Association of Travel Ministries, the Headquarters for Open Skies and the Hotel Association.
At the hearing that will take place tomorrow, the petitioners are expected to demand that all other red states be removed from the list, while Professor Itamar Grotto backs them up with his professional opinion.
Foreigners will also be able to enter.
The Prime Minister and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Health, Internal affairs, Tourism and Transportation agreed that starting Sunday, January 9, 2022, the entry of vaccinated/recovered foreigners (as defined by the Ministry of Health) from orange countries will be allowed—subject to filling out an online form ahead of time, performing a PCR or antigen test before boarding the plane, performing a PCR test upon entering Israel followed by entering isolation for 24 hours or receiving a negative test result (whichever comes first).
Foreigners who are not vaccinated/non recovering patients (as defined by the Ministry of Health) will be banned from entering Israel.
Foreigners from red countries, with the exception of those whose entry has been approved by the Exceptions Committee, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
The group schedule will not be renewed at this stage.
And what about red states?
The committee for the classification of countries in the Ministry of Health recommended to the government to remove the following countries from the list of red countries and to transfer them to the orange list: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada.
The countries that remain at this point in the red list of countries are: the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Ethiopia, the United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey.
A second option is that the Ministry of Health will consider to exempt from isolation the vaccinated returning people from red countries.
At the moment it is not clear if there is a connection the messages sent this morning to those returning to Israel are related to the instructions that may be issued by the Ministry of Health on this issue.
The Ministry of Health has not yet issued a response.
The skies are beginning to open: the Ministry of Health is changing the restrictions on the gates of the country
Vaccinated persons returning from orange countries will be charged with 24-hour isolation.
The countries USA, Turkey, Great Britain and the United Arab Emirates will be defined as red.
After long weeks in which it was very difficult to find a destination to which one could fly without restrictions, and after all those returning from abroad were ordered to quarantine, along with a ban on the entry of tourists into Israel—yesterday it was decided to change the procedures and significantly ease the restrictions on traffic.
The Ministry of Health decided to recommend canceling the mandatory isolation for three days for Israelis returning from orange countries.
So far, anyone vaccinated or recovering according to the definitions of the Ministry of Health who returned from an orange state—was required to be isolated for three days, subject to two corona tests.
Now, the isolation that the vaccinated and convalescents returning from orange countries will have to go into is for 24 hours at most, or until the results of the corona tests are received after landing in Israel (whichever comes first).
Those who are not defined as vaccinated or recovering will still be required to enter seven days of isolation subject to two corona tests, or 14 days without the second test, even if they returned from an orange country and if they returned from a red country.
A vaccinated or convalescing person who has returned from a red state must also be in full isolation.
The latest list of red countries recommended by the Ministry of Health, which still needs to go through the government’s approval, includes the USA, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
In all countries, with the exception of Turkey, the average number of positives who entered the country in the last two weeks is more than 5% of the total number of entrants, which automatically puts them on the list of red countries.
The rate of increase among the patients from Turkey is fast, the rate of positive returns from Turkey is a little over 4%, so it was decided to include it also in the list of red countries.
The most prominent countries that will be removed from the list of red countries: France, Spain, Portugal and Canada.
Meanwhile, as of January 9, tourists who are vaccinated according to the requirements of the Ministry of Health will be able to enter Israel without the need for isolation, similar to the conditions for Israelis returning from an orange state.
Even in this case, the decision is subject to the approval of the government, which will discuss the issue in the coming days.
It is important to note that there are few cases in which the government does not approve the recommendations of the Ministry of Health in this area.
The tourists against the restrictions.
A petition was filed to the High Court by the Travel Agencies’ Association, the Open Skies Headquarters and the Hotels’ Association to cancel the restrictions on the travelers.
The country removed most of the restrictions yesterday, but as mentioned left eight significant countries on the list of red countries.
At the hearing that is to be held this morning in Jerusalem, the petitioners are expected to demand that the state cancel the list of red states.
The one who will support the position of the petitioners is Prof. Itamar Grotto, also expected to be present at the hearing.
Tourism Minister Yoel Razbozov, who in recent weeks has supported the easing of the restrictions concerning the entry of foreign tourists to Israel, said yesterday: “Abolishing isolation for those who have been vaccinated returning from abroad and the reinstating tourism for those who have been vaccinated is the right and just thing to do at this time.
I thank my colleagues in the government, who understood the plight of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the damage outweighs the benefit.
Vaccination is the best answer to a pandemic, and as such—the vaccinated public deserves to lead a routine lifestyle alongside Corona.”
With an investment of 200 million NIS: the new resort that will open near Arad
The desert is blooming: another luxury hotel is expected to open in about three years.
Chef restaurants, private pools and 110 rooms are just a small part of what the hotel will offer.
All the details in the article
The 7MINDS company from Beit Fatal and the real estate company Binyanei Ha’ir HaLevana, have jointly purchased a plot of land covering a plot of about 20 dunams in the Yehuda desert, where they will build a luxurious resort with an investment of about 200 million NIS. The hotel will be built on the same area where a Masada hotel was built that was destroyed about a year ago.
The resort will only open in about three years and will have 110 rooms, some of which will have private pools.
The hotel will also have three shared pools, a spa, chef restaurants, an entertainment complex, a gym and more.
The person who will be responsible for the hotel’s culinary side is Chef Ran Shmueli from Claro Restaurant.
Chef Shmueli will be the one to build the menu, which is expected to have a desert concept unique to the resort.
The mayor of Arad, attorney Nissan Ben Hamo, welcomed the project: “The decision to build a new and prestigious hotel near Arad gives the official seal to the incredible ascent that Arad has made in the field of tourism in recent years.
I am proud of the choice of the entrepreneurs and am convinced that it will be a joint success since Arad has a huge tourist potential.”

Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Budapest, Berlin, Amsterdam and other destinations for less than $100 for round-trip flights
.
Israel’s largest airline reports an increase in demand for flights abroad since yesterday’s announcement of the significant concessions for airline passengers.

The offer is valid for orders made today and tomorrow and for flights departing before January 31, 2022.
Starting from tonight at midnight, France, Spain, Portugal and other countries will be removed from the list of red countries.
The USA, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and five other countries are still included in the list of red countries and there is a ban on flying to them without the Exceptions Committee’s approval.
Almost every person these days, has an “old” tablet or smart-phone lying in a closet unused.
Only because a slightly newer and more sophisticated model was released, any device can be a Spotify player on a hotspot connection.
Old devices can be road cameras, remote control to operate devices at home and many other uses.
You don’t have to be victims of the consumer’s culture and you don’t always have to get the forefront technology, with yet another truly useless gadget.
Data collection without analysis.
Its a shame
It would have been more interesting to hear how many people received allowances at Israel Post, how much the real estate of the branches (located in the centers of the requested cities) is worth, and how much is the wages of the employees (minimal wages).
It is forbidden to privatize the Israel Post
The question is how many packages arrived and how many were distributed?
Because how blind they are
Packages are ordered, and they disappear at the sorting center in Modiin...
There should be a 5 NIS minimal value package tax so that people won’t just order trinkets for 1 NIS and overburden the mail service
This mainly indicates the cost of living in Israel.
Thanks to King Pakim for causing people to prefer buying everything from China.
We are a household and we try not to go near the post office and hope that no letters will arrive from them and the hatred for the post office has led us to give up everything related to the possibility of getting mail.
Have a good week.
Fire all postal workers, and start re-establishing the post office—by a private company.
Arrogant employers and some of them are racist!
They talk differently on the phone and when they get to the interview their true face is revealed.
No wonder they can’t find workers.
They are looking for slaves.
Slaves’ jobs
Everyone is invited to get to know real Judaism
Well done
Congratulations for winning
Those who stand trials and find holiness will only see light throughout their lives

what nonsense.
No Tunisian is forced to hide his Jewish identity.
Historically this is not true.

Very nice article, dear brother
Kobi, I wish many were like you
Love you
My dear brother🔥💪❤
There are no people like you 😍
king.
This is a person who sees what an amazing country we have.
There will always be problems.
That is life.
Great Kobi!!!
An appreciative character!!
You will succeed in everything you do!!!
Well done for being on the way to succeed ♥
There is nothing like to observe the Shabbat.
The Shabbat observes us more than we observe the Shabbat
Write in Google: Shabbat observance or Shabbat laws
And learn how to keep the Sabbath, good luck to everyone♥
An amazing and very humble man!
I wish him success and to stay charming and extremely talented.
Way to go—the great Kobi Shimoni—also known as Subliminal.
Seriously, well done.
It’s amazing that she’s still getting job offers, in her profession it’s not obvious...
There is nothing like walking on the royal road♥
Amazing family♥
A few years ago I had a dream to dangle on the red head of the cow, Esti Zakheim.
Beautiful and talented!!
How you got a Shabbat observer
A man devoted to his wife and children.
Extremely talented.
Looking forward to her shows
perfection :-))
You are a world champion!
Amazingly talented, Inbal, good luck
You are so amazing!!! :-)
Congratulation
Well done!!!!!
Love has won!!!!
Congratulation!!!!
Don’t worry, it is not for long.
Currently she is useless
How do you know it’s true love...
They get back to each other after 20 years!!
And she is even older than him
And he is a rich and famous hunk
And in a few months they will say there has been a separation.
There are women who are able to wake up every morning with a different husband.
It’s a shame he didn’t participate in the Eurovision contest
Let’s hope that maybe next year he will participate singing one of his original songs
That’s where the big break will be
Instead of the arrogant egotistic fag they brought from the supermarket and his act was shameful
Where does this Yemenite guy, Greenberg, come from hahahaha!
Who is he?!
Why does he appear on a news site??
This is not Guy Pines or the turd tabloid of Nonsense Moses
Smells like a well-oiled PR that is invited under the guise of an article by Kol 2 in a yard, 1 shekel worth, hiding behind the name of the newspaper editor.
The joke is on us readers, the captive audience that escaped from the clutches of the poisonous Moses and is looking for an alternative
The song is not to my liking and the video clip is also casual
lovely lovely lovely
What a talent!!!!
They want more and more of him
Tamir Greenberg is a great singer in the level of an international star.
The State of Israel is small for him.
He will eventually succeed abroad a big time.
A clinical optometrist?!
Well, really, her “degree” is not valid in her country of origin....
Which sector is next in line?
Bibiists?
And corneal mapping is the principal thing they didn’t mention.
Yeah right, a clinical optometrist.
Clinically on her own behalf.
Where will the sirens be?
War is coming, we are being prepared
And what will the shell-shocked do? such cruelty
Bennett, Lapid and Gantz guided by Biden: get ready, friends, get ready....
Because they are the champions of champions!!
hahahahaha but don’t worry, even when the managers are screwed up and stupid, we have superior abilities beyond expectations!!
True, and besides, our secure rooms are screwed up like most of them.
The Home Front Command plays “let’s pretend” games, because in real time—I dread to think about it...
Why just in Tel Aviv
All the others are just right-wing spam.
Despite the nice talk—we haven’t heard about the arrests of hackers, prosecuting them, judging them severly.
In the last four election campaigns, was the election committee prepared for an attack?
Why not specify for example...
How many infiltration and disruption attempts have been made and how many succeeded to infiltrate the Election Committee in the past 3 years.
Don’t we deserve some data, facts and proportion?
One of the more bizarre signings of Hapoel Jerusalem.
Good luck, Oz.
You will always be part of Maccabi’s dynasty...
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
You are all pessimists, always complaining, classic couch potatoes.
Baldwin is a social attack in the dressing room, so say players who played with him in Greece and Spain!
Hollins got injured and did not play in the last games of the Red Star...
Hilliard was also injured and did not play for the last six months...
Heavy gambling.
Maccabi lacks a star
What is it really about Brown?
If he doesn’t sign, Maccabi may be in trouble
What about Lorenzo Brown?
hahahahaha it fits like a glove to a loser’s hand for a group of......
Adam is a great player, the coach should give him more playing minutes, not to give him up, Hapoel needs a big team, you just must not give up on him
No.
Bring in Andrian Banks.
We need more strong Israelis on the staff.
The kind who really play
Much more suitable than Vilbkin for Maccabi that’s being established.
You see there are professionals in Maccabi—Blatt and Ketch.
Perhaps his personal abilities are not yet equal to the Scott player, but he is a team player, and particularilyly his game intelligence is much higher
So sad that Maccabi Tel Aviv relies on foreigners and the Israelis occupy the bench
By the way, Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes and not for a collection of foreigners, therefore they will not win using all those stars that have been gathered from all over the world
Who cares???
If you’re already watching a game of 6 American players and the 3 Israelis are just for decoration, you might as well watch a Golden State game, right????
It’s a puzzle, when all the pieces are connected, the league games will be over
Good luck
That was a good column.
I liked it.
Concerning the Israelis, he is absolutely right!!
A note about Ziv—we saw last season that he is a good player who can also lead a team.
So in the Euroleague he cannot lead, but his decline of ability during league games indicates that he has lost his confidence (that’s no wonder after the way he was treated after 2 bad games in the Euroleague, as if the foreigners didn’t play as badly) and using him might be wrong as well, and he is the consequence of the coach’s fixations and templates.
A non-scoring blazer, with all due respect...
Yiftah Ziv should not be in Maccabi Tel Aviv, he ruins it too much
Once there is to be a bad game, but Sorkin and Blazer Dudi and Cohen today, well done.
Ido Eshed is a Holon fan bum who received 500 NIS to write nonsense.
Federman is not relevant.
Blazer, Sorkin and Jack Cohen are much better than Colliaro and Taylor in Europe who play for about twenty minutes and are unable to score a basket, who needs incompetent foreigners, it is much better if the Israelis play.
It’s good that everybody is keeping up a good spirit, coach players and management in the momentum pull
Depends on the increase of the internal buffering...
and a significant and necessary strengthening of the center and guard
And that is the management responsibility.
Not true.
The immediate human interaction is important in many ways.
The answer to this research is that social isolation is a bad thing from the professional aspect as well, and the truth is, that what is surprising and disappointing here is the surprise.
So turn off the Zoom camera, the problem is solved.
What happened, the researchers used Zoom and therefore their creativity was not enough for this solution?
How do you know what will happen in 30 years?
Someone here missed an important detail
The scientists are not interested in global warming or rainwater
They are only interested in the rate of population growth
They are working on more and more vaccines and crappy methods to destroy the world’s population and then they tell us fake stories about global warming and such nonsense they invented
There is no problem to desalinate drinking water, in unlimited quantities
They said that 50 years ago.
Meanwhile there are more people.
The solution is birth control, especially in poor countries and in the case of Bibi’s baboons, the rest of the leftists are anti their own countries, and in all the polytheistic religions—among the stupid, the ignorant, the lame, the blind, in short—The herds
There is an urgent need to reduce the world’s population.
Living things (including leftists) consume oxygen and emit carbon dioxide.
The solution: leftists spam, go commit suicide!
it’s green.
Good for the world.
It will be better for you, and sure is for earth and us all.
Who are the scientists and how did they conduct the research?
I don’t believe any research of global climate warming, because this issue doesn’t even exist
It tends to control us and rob us of our liberty and freedom.
It’s all part of the new world order.
And reporters like Assaf Golan are on their side as he did during the Corona Virus.
I have never heard him present facts from both aspects, he always shows the side that serves the globalists best.
They are “Bennetizing” us.
Just squandering funds on academic “nonsensical” studies.
just as always, more nonsense from leftists psychopath of “Nonsensia.”
The situation is actually improving. Human knowledge is evolving and along with it, new technologies and improvements are achieved.
For hundreds of years the world’s population has been steadily growing exponentially, and the situation keeps improving.
The Chinese, for example, started a huge war project in the Gobi desert, with incredible success.
The Saudis are doing the same and are also successful (with Israeli know how, by the way).
It’s the leftists silly “climate crisis” (emissions of carbon dioxide, needed for plants) that is causing the Sahara to become greener, but hey, that doesn’t fit the leftists agenda, so you won’t read about it in the newspapers...
The leftists don’t care.
With them, the urine rises straight to the head and thus they do not dry out.
Does proper management of the water reservoirs mean a cut of at least 70% of the world’s population?
It’s surprising that COVID came and it’s surprising that the majority of the population is injected with an experimental substance whose consequences for a period of 5–25 years on those who are injected are not known at all.
It’s also surprising that Agenda 2030 is being launched and now this?
The whole story is really puzzling!!!
Hahaha what bullshit.
It is Tales of Arabian Nights, all of it is intimidations and, of course, nonsense of the left that tries to control the world by controlling the media, five years ago they announced that it will never rain in Australia and this year they have enough rain to last them for two years.
They said that it didn’t rain anymore in Israel and the drought is permanent and here it is raining.
They also said that Rabin did not murder Jews in Altalena and that Peres did not know that the children of Yemen were being stolen.
Moshe Dayan, of course, did not loot antiquities and Ezer Weizmann did not mess with his female soldiers.
It is clear that you are promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
Disgusting bullshit.
Let them also take care of cellular reception in the frontiers, handling the power outages and voltage drops and we will be doing great
“This is real Zionism” just like opening A Rami Levy branch in Yeruham is.
Following the swindler Bennett, the other crooked politicians will align accordingly.
Even if you offer me free flights, I’m not going anywhere near El Al, rather “No El Al”
It was very pleasant, hello and goodbye.
You won’t see us, not even in your dreams.
One more big shame, we in Israel are held captive by El Al, all direct flights are in its hands, elevated prices, it’s better that it goes bankrupt now, it’s time for truly open skies.4
There is too much focus on this flights to the East matter.
Even if Saudi Arabia allows El Al to fly over its territory, it will not add more than a few tens of millions to the Israeli economy, not such a big game changer.
It is better to focus on more interesting achievements such as energy supply, purchase of Israeli technology, transportation from Ashdod and Haifa ports through Jordan to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the Emirates, tourism, allowing Israeli infrastructure companies to work in Saudi Arabia.
It’s much more interesting than 30 planes a week that will save an hour each.
It is more important that they let the Air Force squadrons be stationed in the Persian Gulf to strike Iran and that they organize the Emirates of Bahrain, Oman, Egypt and Morocco to drop weapons on Iran non-stop for a month until all its military infrastructure is completely destroyed.
And to another air force squadron to be stationed in northern Saudi Arabia and strike the Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq from the east from a less populated area.
After we are done with Iran, Saudi Arabia can encourage Oman, Kuwait, Djibouti and the Comoro Islands to sign a peace agreement with Israel and get a majority of the Arab League countries that joined the peace.
After the regime change in Iran, the end of the World Cup, the stabilization of the oil and gas market, and the replacement of Erdoan, it is also possible to help Saudi Arabia overthrow the government in Qatar and finally eliminate this country’s subversion, and its support for the Muslim Brothers and Hamas.
When all these shared interests are over, it will be possible to talk about a few more El Al flights, if El Al will even stay in the market until then.
El Al should be shut down.
They are selling tickets for flights that do not fly.
The worst is that there is no way to get a representative
“No customer service.”
Anyone who buys a ticket at El Al and wants to change or cancel, forgets about it, it’s a definite loss.
you have been warned.
Air Canada is better
Anyway we prefer to fly with foreign airlines
Arkaka changed from a crappy company into a company from hell.
El Al also got worse.
The best thing to do is to order a taxi.
The driver will load the luggage for free.
And you will travel by train to the airport.
€40 for a suitcase in Ryanair is much cheaper than with Wiz.
You can carry an 8 kg backpack.
Why are you misleading?
Wiz Air charges much more for cargo and seats!!!
One big rant
Just an example, I just returned with Etihad
The allowed weight is 30 kg
and a 7 kg trolley
And every additional 1 kg is $30
Get updated
All companies steal the customer.
They advertise very cheap prices, but eventually the bag allowed is the size of a school bag.
A trolley costs money and a suitcase is very, very expensive.
Lucky that the companies don’t ask us to come to the flight with underwear and a tank top so that there is no weight on the plane.
In El Al, the price is not cheaper, rather 50% more when booking up to 6 hours before the flight.
The Israelis are not surprised at all.
The Israelis were and remain combination experts, taking lots of chances.
A land that devours its own inhabitants and it devours.
On top of this you need to add the inherited stinginess.
it is shameful that our country allows foreign airlines to exploit Israelis...
There is no government here and everyone does as they please
So what you learn today is that it’s not enough that you paid for an expensive ticket..
they prepared a surprise for all of us..
You will pay extras for the plane wheels, for its windows, for the luggage that does not arrive, for the food, for the drinks, and they will surely add on the toilets
In short, stay home and the prices will drop..
Or awesome, travel by ships
A journey that will take several days
you will vomit and then you probably arrive
Bennett wants to test how much he can attack and hurt Israel, and still win the recognition and support from his new fans.
To open now?
It’s not by chance.
Precisely when the rush starts there is an exemption, it’s just crazy what’s happening here...
This is not the apex of the pandemic
Shimon, this doesn’t befit you
If the number of confirmed cases increases it does not mean that the number of patients increases
Stop being tested for Corona because for all sort of nonsense, stay home if you don’t feel well
The story ends
A government of lunatics
The government and Bennet are mostly bankruptcy.
Loss of control.
And mostly stupidity
and public confusion score 0
Just more harm than good
I suggest you open a new column: “The daily and cumulative death toll since the beginning of the fifth wave.
The face and the pictures behind incompetence.”
your rating will soar.
You do not understand the Minister of Finance for not paying compensation to tourism workers
They bring on one more infection
They are not interested in the people
8,500 have died so far
Does anyone talk about it?
They bury us, especially the elderly
We have become Russia/North Korea.
If you don’t talk about it—it doesn’t exist!!
The main thing is that the citizens put money into the state treasury to make the ministers grow their stomachs and buttocks!
It turns out that Doberman and Abbas are the Prime Minister!!
Very well, the Omicron delay was relevant for the first week, now—there is no reason to isolate half a nation, and there is no point in trying to stop the Omicron—which exists here more than Israel.
When someone comes from an orange state, he is statistically less dangerous than someone who is already here.
This is the first time I see logical actions taken by the Israeli government in the fight against Corona.
As if someone really sat down and calculated numbers, and not like Bibi—did what he thought would look better on the newspaper (and failed in all sections).
Helem’s government, at its best:
Two weeks ago the Minister of Finance telling the tour guides to get themselves a new profession, now rushes to open the skies to tourists.
The Minister of Education Machishasha belittles the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health, and sets her own policy, causing schools to be in complete chaos!
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, a clown coming in sick with Corona Virus to a government meeting.
And the most clownish Prime Minister we have ever had in the country, does not dominate the situation and loses his temper like the king of hooligans.
Simply a government without leadership and without direction, in which the entire people of Israel have lost confidence
You all rush home quickly!!!
My opinion, maybe it doesn’t stem from a good place rather from a place of losing control
Now the apartment prices there will jump to 50 million per apartment.
Well, where are all the forecasters?
Build a bus station and believe that it will affect all the houses.
By the way, except for sponsorship fees after.
If they discover the exorbitant property tax prices of Arad, the hotel will once again be a white elephant like its predecessor
looks amazing.
Good luck.
I want.
What about the art of posing completely naked?
Giving up the garbage
A serious fight for Sde Berir
Memasheshet HaKharbanet Why are benefits not given to build in the occupied Galilee by the Muslim Brotherhood of Memasheshet HaKharbanet
Everyone are a suck up
In the current reality, is the south still ours?!
Do you need a passport?
Another luxury hotel!
Surely the members of the Knesset will be there too!!
What about a popular hotel for a popular person?
All the best for investments in the South [Haporeach]
Arad is developing and prospering, and kudos to the mayor who, since the beginning of his term, has experienced an explosion for the good and glory of the city of Arad
Cultural, society, education and more, on high end
Just an excellent mayor who improved the city!
Well done
I wonder how much sponsorship fees for the Bedouin will be paid by the resort owner.
Have they prepared money for sponsorship fees?
Wow, sounds good
Whoever can only afford it, El Al is a company with service and security, the best in the world.
When would it be possible to fly to Dubai, do you know????
El Al is a trashy Company.
Neither socially nor economically.
In recent weeks, it canceled return flights from abroad, you see, sent messages to the Israelis and told them that the flight has been canceled, ruined the entire trip on the spot, informed the passengers to leave a message on Whatsapp or Messenger and we will return, answered after a day or even three.
The trip was ruined.
Besides, is it better to land planes on the ground, instead of making the flights back to Israel, and also prevent economic damage?
Are there more suckers flying to El Al?
Won’t fly with them even for free.
Have they already returned the millions of customers they took captive?
easyJet to Geneva round trip €70.
El Al one way $560.
I won’t buy anything from the religious cheater who controls the company with his screwed up son, not even for 10 dollars, non-stop cheaters...
And then the company will cancel the flights and offer vouchers that will be worthless.
Because their realization will be plus the price change.
Those who buy tickets at El Al put their money on the plane wing.
El Al is a bin Company.
Low cost company tricks.
No luggage, no seat selection, certainly no taxes and no food.
Vacation and Corona flights...
To all the members of the “gross-olition”...my treat!
Nature dilutes fools!!
