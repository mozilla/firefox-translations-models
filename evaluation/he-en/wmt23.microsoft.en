In the shadow of the danger of extinction: Three cheetah cubs were born in Iran
The world's fastest animal falls victim to brutal poaching, droughts and deadly road accidents across the Islamic Republic
As a result, their number dropped to less than 20 cheetahs.
Three Asian cheetah cubs have recently emerged in the world in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This is a rare birth, which only slightly improves the tragic condition of the endangered animal in the country due to droughts, poachers and fatal road accidents.
This is the first birth of a cheetah in captivity in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where cheetahs still live in the wild.
The Iranian news agency IRNA reported that the veterinary team in charge of the Touran National Park in the northern province of Samnan decided to give birth by cesarean in captivity.
It was also noted that less than 20 cheetahs have recently been documented in seven different districts of the country.
Due to the danger of their extinction, the United Nations implemented a protection plan for them back in 2001.
Now, in Iran, it is hoped that the new cubs will be able to bring about an increase in the cheetah population in the future.
Last January, Iran's Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs, Hassan Akbari, said that the country's cheetah population had dropped dramatically from 100 cheetahs in 2010 to just 12.
"Their situation is extremely serious," Akbari said, noting that the cheetahs have fallen victim to drought in their habitats, hunting and even road accidents.
The cheetah is considered the fastest animal in the world, capable of reaching a speed of about 100 kilometers per hour.
Cheetahs can be found in different places around the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to upgrade your car: We tested the Car Thing
Quietly, quietly, Spotify has begun to try its luck in the world of hardware as well.
After years of development - Car Thing was unveiled and launched as a small experiment in the US
We got our hands on the first device in Israel •
The Vision: Making Your Old Cars Smart
The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, and it was built specifically to provide a solution for people who own old cars.
A few weeks ago, I got my first chance to try the new product, which is currently only available to a few testers in the US, here in Israel.
For me, the timing of the delivery was outstanding, as our home car broke down and we had to drive for a few days with a replacement vehicle with an old system.
After two weeks of playfulness, I realized how the Car Thing can easily become an integral part of many people's systems.
On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty regarding a global launch, I believe that many will prefer to use other solutions already.
From Idea to Reality
Somewhere in 2018, Spotify users began to receive an interesting offer in their email inbox - the possibility of purchasing a new device with voice control and 4G connectivity, which would make any old car system smart.
The rumors slowly faded until a year later, when the Financial Times revealed that the company was planning to introduce a new car product that simulates a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.
A few months later, these rumors made headlines again after the music service updated with the car's mode – the same one we now know from the app – which is activated as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the system in the car.
Two years have passed since then.
After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify unveiled "Car Thing" last April, its smart system for vehicles.
Spotify has chosen to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays when it comes to shipments.
So of course, right after the press conference she held, I went to the website and registered.
Two months later, the long-awaited announcement arrived.
Reconnecting to the site will give me the opportunity to purchase the device with a small surprise - it won't cost me anything.
After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.
The Car Thing
First and foremost, Spotify's device impressed me very much with its build quality.
And it's slightly smaller than my iPhone 11 and includes a large, bright and sharp touchscreen on the front of it.
You can also find a round button and a dial next to the screen that you can rotate to navigate between the interface screens.
And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the photos, the Car Thing manages to maintain a relatively thin profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.
Personally, I would prefer that the company allow you to change the dial activity so that I can control the volume of the smartphone, since I can also navigate using the touch screen.
Maybe this will be possible in a future version update.
The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, which includes, among other things, a USB Type C cable and various adapters for its installation.
Many of you probably remember how in the past we used to unplug the radios and hide them in a drawer after getting out of the car.
The Car Thing undoubtedly brings back this feeling with its way of construction.
All the adapters were connected to the body of the device using a magnet that was very strong, which prevented it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.
On top of that, you can find small buttons throughout the top, which you can easily set to play different playlists or podcasts.
By pressing and holding one of the buttons while listening, or by asking the voice assistant, I set up a few playlists that I listen to frequently and the radio show I listen to every morning on the go.
In doing so, the feature made me feel that Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.
From an old body to a smart car
After a fairly simple physical installation, I plugged in the Car Thing.
I was pleasantly surprised by the setup process.
The instructions were clear, connecting to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and controls the app like a remote, so it can copy all the information about our account from it.
This means that you will still have to connect your smartphone to the car, whether via Bluetooth or via an AUX cable in order to hear the music.
The home screen is familiar to all users of the app, since like the application on a smartphone, it emphasizes album photos and playlists.
Also, on the home screen, like the one in the app, you can find music recommendations according to your taste, the search screen, and your personal library.
As mentioned, you can navigate between the different screens using the touchscreen or using the hand dial.
What's more, you can call the device's voice assistant at any given moment by saying "Hey Spotify."
With it, you can play songs, playlists, albums, and even search for podcasts.
From my experience, she recognized my voice quite easily even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner was blowing directly on the device.
This is probably thanks to the four microphones installed at the top.
It is important to note that the voice assistant does not currently support Hebrew, and as of the time of publication of the article, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.
So is it worth waiting for him?
My experience of using the device was great, which is a positive surprise to me considering that it is still in the initial release stage.
Even with heavy use on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
Still, there is a little stuttering in the interface from time to time, but I believe Spotify will address such bugs with future version updates.
It is evident that the Swedish company has been working on it a lot in recent years, and among the various versions that have been leaked online during this period, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.
Still, when I saw the Car Thing for the first time, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to target it for.
After all, its activity is limited to controlling the app on a smartphone, and not much more than that.
What is different from buying a car stand for a few shekels and plugging it in so that the smartphone is closer to us when driving?
This question is reinforced when considering that iPhones and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify's, and most of the time will give the user much more functionality.
Despite all this, as I used Car Thing more and more, I realized how it could improve the driving experience.
The ability to see Waze on my smartphone screen and control music on a completely different screen is one I've come to appreciate in the last couple of weeks.
One question remains - will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?
And if so, will it be launched here in our small country as well?
Swedish society doesn't say much at the moment.
It didn't even share how many testers for the device it is currently running around the world, and how much it plans to add in the limited launch in the United States.
The only thing we know for sure is the price, which is expected to be $79 (about 255 shekels).
In the meantime, the Car Thing provides an initial glimpse of a concept that Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Spotify Israel said that there is currently no information about a plan to launch the device in Israel

Have you recruited talent for the company?
This way you will keep it from being "snatched" by your competitors.
The economy is still in a labor market that is mostly dominated by workers, and this is even more true when it comes to the most desirable workers – the talents.
Here are some tips to help you keep it in the workplace
.
Despite the increase in the past month, the unemployment rate in Israel continues to be one of the lowest in the world, and in the top ten of the OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5% (150,600 unemployed, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics).
In other words, the economy is still in a labor market that is mostly dominated by workers, and this is even more true when it comes to the most desirable workers – the talented ones.
When it comes to those professionals and managers who are centers of knowledge, experience, and proven ability, the trends in the labor market show that the competition for them, the talents as they are called by the employers, is still in full swing.
What this means for employers is that in the current state of the labor market, they don't have the luxury of resting on their laurels even a minute after recruiting a coveted talent, because as soon as he enters the company's gates, another company will already try to snatch him to it.
In other words, the competition for talent is so fierce that many will continue to receive a variety of tempting job offers even after being hired, with 30% of employees indeed leaving only about a month after receiving the job and starting work.
This is why wise employers will immediately move from the stage of recruiting talent to the stage of retaining it, with the path beginning first and foremost with preparation in advance and taking creativity already in the process of hiring him.
An efficient, structured and thoughtful onboarding process will make the talent excited about their new workplace from day one and even look forward to the future.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and manage the right onboarding process that will help retain the new talent:
It's Not a Secret - Sharing and Organizational Readiness |
Share with the parties who will work with him on his recruitment, explain to them why he is essential and important to the company and the position, and how you see his contribution.
A new employee who arrives at a place where he is expected and understands his value will feel welcome and will strive to prove the expectations that are planted in him.
Knowledge is Power - Setting Expectations |
On the first day, they had a conversation with the talent to coordinate expectations.
Get to know his professional background and check where he sees himself in the future, so that you can show him the diverse and unique tools that you and your workplace can provide him to get there.
We Are All People – Personal Acquaintance |
During the absorption days, try to get to know the talent beyond his professional qualities and be interested in his hobbies and interests.
A new employee who shows interest in him and allows him to realize and express himself beyond the boundaries of his job will appreciate this and will want to maintain it.
Curiosity Advances |
Already at the absorption stage, you can create an attractiveness that will make the talent want to integrate quickly.
Do this not necessarily through a discourse of bonuses and benefits, but by exposing him to an exciting field or interesting technology, as such stimuli for creativity lead to curiosity and increased interest in the workplace.
Also, encourage the talent to voice his thoughts and opinions on the various projects in the company and make it clear to him that they are important to the organization.

Pocket electrification: The cost of not closing the coal plants in June is NIS 1 billion
Report by the Knesset Research and Information Center: Failure to Close the Coal-fired Plants on the June 2022 Date Estimated at NIS 1 Billion
• IEC: "The policy on the use of fuels is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy"
.
The economic cost of not closing the coal plants on the June 2022 date is estimated at about NIS 1 billion for 2022, according to a report by the Knesset Research and Information Center.
According to the report, this cost is reflected in the consumer electricity tariff, which is expected to rise in the coming months due to the increase in the price of coal.
In addition, in 2023, an additional amount of coal use is expected to be about 900,000 tons, so that this will be reflected in an additional cost to the electricity sector due to the non-closure of the coal plants, assuming that the price of natural gas will remain significantly lower than the price of coal.
The report states that the significance of a reduction of about NIS 1 billion in the electricity tariff in 2022 was a reduction of about 4% in the tariff for electricity consumption for the domestic consumer.
In other words, the economic cost of not closing the stations is about NIS 1 billion, and the total reduction that could have been made for the domestic consumer is about 4%.
It should be noted that as part of the reform in the electricity sector, it was decided, among other things, to establish a subsidiary of the Israel Electric Corporation, which will establish units powered by natural gas, which are intended to replace the 1-4 coal-fired units at the Orot Rabin site.
Following this decision, a government decision was made in July 2018, stating that the activity of the 1-4 coal production units at the Orot Rabin power plant must be stopped.
The decision set timetables, so that the construction of the first natural gas unit will begin in January 2020 and its operation will begin in June 2022, and accordingly, the 1-4 coal production units will also cease operating on that date.
The IEC said in response: "The policy on the use of fuels is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy.
In accordance with the Ministry's decisions, a policy has been implemented in Israel for several years to reduce the use of coal to the minimum possible, even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas."
Paying the price: Everything you need to know ahead of the interest rate hike
Continuous Decrees: Next week the interest rate on the shekel is expected to rise by half a percentage point •
How much will the mortgage payment cost?
And what is recommended to do? •
All Answers
The worsening inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of more than 4 percent over the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise the interest rate on the shekel as early as next week.
Analysts' estimates speak of an increase rate of between 0.25 percent and 0.5 percent.
If the interest rate does increase by half a percent, it will already be 1.25 percent, the highest level in nine years.
This is after the interest rate in the economy was close to zero for years.
The sharp increase in the interest rate increases mortgage repayments by hundreds of shekels and drastically burdens households.
With the help of Shai Tzror, a mortgage expert, we examined how much more we will pay and what is recommended to do right now.
If the interest rate rises by half a percent, how much will the monthly payment on the mortgage be?
For a mortgage of NIS 1.2 million, which consists of a 40% prime interest track, the monthly repayment will increase by NIS 125.
How much has the average mortgage become more expensive since the beginning of the year?
Since the beginning of the year, this is a significantly sharper increase.
This is because interest rates in the other tracks that make up a mortgage (and not only in the prime track) also increased – in the index-linked track and in the fixed-rate track.
If the interest rate does increase by half a percent, the increase will amount, according to Tzror's estimate, to about 620 shekels in a mortgage of about 1.2 million shekels.
The prime track (40% in this track) will complete the increase in the price of about NIS 280, assuming that there will be an increase of another 0.5% next month.
The CPI-linked variable interest rate track (26.7% in this track) will complement the increase in the price of about NIS 120.
The fixed-interest track – not index-linked (33.3% in this track) will increase by NIS 220.
So what is recommended to do today?
For those who have a mortgage that is mostly linked to the index, Tzror recommends considering refinancing to non-indexed tracks.
For mortgage holders for whom the monthly repayment has increased significantly and it is difficult for them to meet the repayments - he recommends that they consider refinancing a mortgage and redeploy it for a longer period.
This is in order to reduce payments despite the increase in interest rates, since it is always better to meet the repayments and not be in default.
Regarding new mortgage borrowers - he highly recommends getting to know the different tracks and adapting the mortgage to their financial capabilities.
Similarly, in the future, when interest rates fall, they will be able to refinance a mortgage with minimal early repayment fees.
As for buyers of apartments from a contractor - Tzror recommends making payments to the contractor early and taking out a mortgage now.
It should be taken into account that the "construction input index" significantly increases the price of the property even after the purchase contract has been signed.
The price index of residential construction inputs increased by 6.6 percent in the past year.
Against the background of the increase in the cost of this index, the Banking Supervision Department announced yesterday that it is considering the creation of a mechanism that will enable the inclusion of linkages within mortgages, but a final decision on the matter has not yet been made.
The price of gasoline is becoming more expensive - and Israelis will have to pay more than 8 shekels per liter in July
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price per liter of 95-octane gasoline will be NIS 8.08 •
At the same time, the reduction of half NIS per liter in the tax on diesel will be extended until the end of 2022
A decade high: The price of gasoline will jump by 36 agorot per liter - and will stand at more than 8 shekels per liter as of July 1.
The new price per liter of 95-octane gasoline will be 8.08, and those who wish to enjoy full service will be required to pay an additional 21 agorot per liter.
At the same time, the reduction of half a shekel per liter in the diesel tax will be extended until the end of 2022, according to the Tax Authority.
As noted, the price increase stems from the continued rise in oil prices, against the background of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise in the dollar rate.
If it weren't for the half-shekel discount that the government has subsidized since April, the price of gasoline would have surpassed an all-time high of 8.25 shekels per liter.
The discount expires at the end of July, and the Tax Authority and the Ministry of Finance are currently promoting the publication for public comments of an order extending the reduction in the tax on gasoline, which stands at half a shekel per liter, until August 9.
In addition, as of August 10, an additional reduction of another half shekel will be set, so that only from that date will the price of a liter of gasoline be reduced by one shekel, until November 15, 2022.
This was reported by the Tax Authority.
"We have reached a situation where I don't remember five months in a row of surplus state revenues.
We started a few months ago with the issue of reducing the tax on diesel.
We have been working for a week on an extension of the excise, gasoline and diesel tax for another four months – instead of half a shekel per shekel.
It's good for industry and the citizen.
If we lower it, it will affect inflation, reduce production, and ease the cost of living.
As finance minister, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus first and foremost on this," Liberman said at the Israel Democracy Institute's Hurwitz Conference on Economics and Society.
Currently, more than half of the price of fuel is taxed by the government (excise duty and VAT) – and this is a high tax rate compared to most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic impact on the cost of living in the economy – because it affects both household and business expenses, the prices of public transportation and flights, transportation costs, and more.
For the third time in a row: Ashdod - the friendliest city for business
Petah Tikva came in second place in the Ministry of Economy's Doing Business ranking •
Afterwards: Rehovot, Ashkelon and Rishon Lezion •
Minister Barbivai: "The coronavirus has emphasized the importance of local government in business development"
.
Ashdod is the most friendly city for small and medium-sized businesses.
This is the third year in a row, according to the Doing Business in Local Authorities Index of the Small and Medium Businesses Agency at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, which ranked the local authorities.
In second place is the city of Petah Tikva and in third place is Rehovot.
They are followed in order: Ashkelon, Rishon LeZion, Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Be'er Sheva, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, Netanya and Bnei Brak.
The agency compiles the Local Authorities Index.
This is the fifth time and its purpose is to serve as a work tool for the local authority, as it allows each authority to compare its performance with other authorities in a variety of parameters, as well as to analyze its performance in the areas in which it is active.
The index is based on several parameters that are examined in each municipality, which examine the level of "friendliness" of the authority to businesses located in its area.
The index divides municipalities into three size groups according to the number of residents, since a local authority with up to 50,000 residents is not the same as a local authority with more than 150,000 residents.
Tel Aviv soared this year
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different rankings in each local authority: business satisfaction, accessibility to tenders, accessibility of information and municipal taxes.
The ranking shows that Ramat Gan dropped from second place to eighth place, Bat Yam dropped from fourth place to 12th place, and Netanya dropped from fifth place to 13th place.
A decrease in the ranking does not mean that the authority's service to businesses has deteriorated, and in many cases it is due to the fact that the service of other authorities to businesses has improved more and they have increased in the ranking, while the authority that declined in the ranking has improved its services to businesses less.
Among the top performers in the ranking are Petah Tikva, which rose from sixth place to second place, and Rehovot, which rose from 12th to third place.
Tel Aviv, which dropped from fourth place to 11th place in 2019, improved in 2021 and rose to sixth place.
"Business is a growth engine"
The ranking shows that Nof HaGalil leads in local authorities, which include between 50,000 and 150,000 residents.
It is followed by Kiryat Motzkin, Mateh Binyamin, Modi'in-Maccabim-Reut, Kfar Saba, Ra'anana, Nahariya, Karmiel, Afula and Hod Hasharon.
In 28th and last place is Tiberias.
"The index is intended to encourage local authorities to facilitate small and medium-sized businesses, starting from the date of opening the business and throughout its activity with the authorities," says Minister of Economy and Industry Orna Barbivai.
"Businesses are a significant growth engine for the Israeli economy and are responsible for about 50% of business output and about 60% of those employed in the economy.
The development of small businesses is in the public interest of all of us, but the local authority has a direct impact on the businesses in it.
The coronavirus has emphasized the importance of local government, and we have seen that authorities that have acted and encouraged the promotion of small businesses and found creative solutions for them, have become the first governmental interface for them."
Ran Kouti, Director of the Small and Medium Businesses Agency at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: "Local authorities play a central and essential role in the ability of businesses in their field to thrive and flourish.
In the past two years, during which we have been dealing with the coronavirus crisis, the authorities have had a greater weight in helping businesses survive in their area and survive in general."
2021 by Mail: 20 Packages Per Household - and Weight Gain
46.6 million parcels arrived in Israel in 2021 - similar to 2020 •
The average weight per package is 435 grams - a 36% jump compared to 2020 •
The busiest month: December, when the average package weight was 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million postal parcels arrived in Israel, an average of almost 20 parcels per household, according to Israel Postal data obtained by Israel Hayom.
The number of packages that arrived in 2021 is similar to 2020, when 46.5 million packages arrived in Israel, and lower than in 2019, when 61.6 million packages arrived.
However, this year there has been a jump of more than 36% per year in the weight of packages that arrived from abroad.
In 2021, 20,253 tons of products arrived in Israel from abroad, a 36% jump compared to 14,860 tons in 2020, and 16,743 tons in 2019.
Changes in consumption habits
The average weight per package has jumped by 60% in two years, from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
The increase in the weight of packages is mainly influenced by two main trends, both on the seller's side and on the buyer's side: the large shopping sites abroad consolidate items into one shipment and no longer ship each product from the "shopping basket" in a separate package.
On the Israeli consumer's side, the fast delivery of deliveries, within a few days of ordering, supports the purchase of more everyday products such as clothing and gifts, which buyers want to receive close to making the purchase.
In 2021, as in 2020 and 2019, the month in which the most packages arrived from abroad with the highest weight and the highest number of items was December, with 4.2 million packages weighing a total of 2,200 tons.
In December, the average weight per package was 524 grams, 20% higher than the annual average weight.
The Black Friday Effect
More packages arrived in December than in any other month, likely due to November's shopping holidays, such as Chinese Singles' Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
The large orders start arriving in Israel between one and two weeks after purchase.
Study: Most Employees in the Economy Are Not Aware of the Possibility of Receiving Tax Refunds
Many employees deserve money from the state, which can reach tens of thousands of shekels.
Have you changed jobs?
Have you gone on unpaid leave?
Did you move from the city to the settlement?
You may be entitled to receive a considerable amount of money in a simple procedure •
All the details - inside
Most employees are not aware of the fact that they are entitled to tax refunds, which can add up to large amounts.
The State Comptroller noted in a report from about two months ago that two million employees are entitled to tax refunds of NIS 3.6 billion, which means that you should also check whether you are eligible to receive tax refunds.
Many employees can receive a high amount, as four out of five employees are eligible for tax refunds.
In practice, on the other hand, several tens of thousands of employees are hired each year.
If you think that these funds will go down the drain anyway, think again: Employees can apply to the IRS for refunds for six years back.
Tax:On conducted an in-depth study of 4,000 of its customers regarding tax refunds during 2020.
The company has over 30,000 customers, so the sample reflects their distribution in terms of population groups and in terms of gender, age, and geography.
The data show that during 2020, due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis and the suspension of hundreds of thousands of workers on unpaid leave, there were a number of significant changes, most notably a 15% increase in the average reimbursement per household, which stood at NIS 4,300 per year.
The reason is that unpaid leave is lower than salaries, and therefore there is a gap between what the employee paid as tax and what he actually needs.
By the way, the highest refund received in 2020 by a customer of the company was NIS 121,054 for repayments over the past 6 years.
What can you get tax refunds for?
One of the reasons to receive tax refunds is a change in the workplace.
81% of people who changed jobs during the year received an average tax refund of NIS 2,943.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The data show that 74% of women who gave birth and were on maternity leave for more than 16 weeks were entitled to a reimbursement of an average of NIS 3,538 for that year
Another reason for a refund is donations.
100% of people who donate and pay taxes have received a refund.
Another factor in the reimbursement is the failure to register credit points for alimony. 63%
The divorcees did not update a credit point for alimony, so the tax refund for each year that such a credit point was not updated is NIS 2,616.
Due to unemployment - unpaid leave: 93% of those who went sick or unemployed and who earned more than NIS 12,000 received a tax refund of NIS 4,021 for that year.
Other reasons for tax refunds are: reimbursement for life insurance payments, life insurance on a mortgage, reimbursement of a qualifying settlement, reimbursement for losses in securities, non-registration of credit points for a man for birth, and distribution of tax refunds according to geographical location.
- 94% of people who deposited for personal life insurance or for taking out a mortgage were eligible for a tax refund.
In an examination conducted on every NIS 1 million on a 25-year mortgage, the cumulative tax refund for the period is over NIS 20,000 for the entire mortgage period
100% of those who move to a qualifying locality received a tax refund for the year of transition, since a certificate of residency in a qualifying locality is given only 12 months after the date the resident becomes a qualifying resident, and thus, in effect, the first year full tax is paid.
79% of the customers holding securities were entitled to a tax refund for the aforementioned years.
However, it is important for those who hold securities to check every year since losses are not rolled over from year to year, but only through the submission of a report.
56% of men who have a child do not write credit points in the year of birth on their paycheck.
The repayment rate can reach tens of thousands of shekels over 6 years.
This is a phenomenon that exists mainly in the Arab sector.
Tax:On CEO, Tal Carmon: "The coronavirus crisis has caused the salaried public in Israel to become much more active.
He is interested, checks and demands what he deserves in income tax refunds.
It turns out that sitting at home, on unpaid leave or after layoffs, for hundreds of thousands of Israelis for many months, has caused many salaried employees to take a closer look at what they are entitled to from the state.
It is important to know that today it is possible to carry out all the procedures for receiving tax refunds digitally, easily and simply, without the bureaucracy that deterred many in the past."
The Employment Market: Fewer Job Applicants, More Wages
AllJobs Report 2021 Summary: At the Top of Demand - Jobs without Experience •
• The number of jobs offered increased by 50%
"Looking for a job, but not storming the market"
In the year that just ended, there was a 15% decline in the number of resumes sent, and an average of only 23 candidates ran for each position, compared to 41 candidates in the previous year, according to a report by the AllJobs website summarizing 2021, on the COVID-19 crisis and its effects on the labor market in Israel.
According to the report, job seekers were mainly interested in jobs such as administration and sales, for which 1,738,485 resumes were sent.
However, jobs without experience led the top of the demand with more than 38,000 searches – apparently due to the return of young people with no professional experience to look for work immediately, at the end of unpaid leave payments.
The number of searches for sales and administration was 35,000 and 32,000 (respectively), drivers and couriers had 11,000 searches, and guarding had a little less than 9,000 searches.
On the other hand, despite the COVID-19 crisis, wages in 2021 increased by 2% compared to 2020, and the average wage in Israel was NIS 11,675 gross.
The average monthly salary in the software field was NIS 17,915, and in information systems analysis it was NIS 17,140.
However, there was a wage gap of more than NIS 2,000 between the center and the periphery: in the center of the country it was NIS 12,500 on average, compared to NIS 10,795 in the north and NIS 10,135 in the south.
In terms of gender, the average wage gap between women and men, which can also be explained by the type of work and the scope of hours, was maintained at 36%.
Men earned NIS 13,295, compared to NIS 9,740 for women.
Trying to get back to the groove
On the business side, there was lateral growth in almost all sectors of the economy, and businesses were eager for working hands.
Thus, the supply of jobs increased by 50% and recorded a record of more than 40,000 jobs at Alljobs.
A survey conducted by the website among employers found that 50% were optimistic about their economic status in 2022, 30% of them indicated their intention to increase total hiring, but 72% understand that they will have difficulty doing so this year.
The largest supply was for jobs with no experience – and there were more than 58,000 of them on the site.
They were followed by customer service and administration positions with about 44,000 jobs in each field, sales and software with 41,000 jobs each, teaching and education with 24,000 vacancies, and warehouse workers still in demand with 19,000 vacancies.
Einav Boimfeld, Director of Research and Content at Alljobs: "Job seekers are trying to get back on track but are not storming the market, mainly due to the lack of attractive jobs in their eyes.
In addition, the prolonged disconnection from the work cycle makes it difficult for them to return, and some have found creative ways to make a living."
Central Bureau of Statistics: The unemployment rate in Israel has risen to 6.3%
The Bureau's survey data shows that about 270,000 Israelis remained unemployed in December 2021 •
In November, there were about 262,000 unemployed
The percentage of the unemployed in the first half of December 2021 was 6.3%, about 270,000 Israelis, compared to 6.1% in the second half of November 2021 (about 262,000).
This is according to data from the Labor Force Survey for the first half of December 2021 of the Central Bureau of Statistics.
The percentage of the unemployed was 4.5% in the first half of December 2021, compared to 4.3% in the second half of November 2021.
In other words, this is 193,000 unemployed, compared to 180,300.
Based on the characteristics of the labor force in the first half of December 2021 among those aged 15 and over, it appears that this population included 6,607,500 residents in Israel, not including institutions and those living outside the localities.
Of these, 64.4%, i.e., 4,252,700 are in the labor force, and the remaining 2,354,800 are not in the labor force.
Of those in the labor force, 95.5% of the 4,059,700 are employed and the rest are unemployed.
Of those who are not in the labor force, 2.3% stopped working due to layoffs or job closures from March 2020.
The Labor Force Survey provides information about the labor force in Israel and is conducted on an ongoing basis by the Central Bureau of Statistics.
In the first half of December 2021, about 8,700 people aged 15 and over were interviewed on an ongoing basis.
In the second half of November 2021, about 8,900 people aged 15 and over were interviewed on an ongoing basis.
The survey population includes permanent residents of the State of Israel, tourists, and temporary residents who have been staying in Israel for more than a year in a row.
The survey enables monitoring of the development of the labor force, its size and characteristics, the extent of unemployment, and more.
"Not obvious": Subliminal sanctifies Shabbat - and prepares for independence
Celebrates the fact that "we can live as we want", is excited for the meeting with the audience and makes sure to spend time with the children •
Kobi Shimoni's Weekend and Independence Day, Subliminal
What does your typical Friday look like?
"The weekends are the most important moments in life, for me.
Kiddush and tradition are very deeply rooted in my soul.
Fridays at my place are dedicated to the children, Or (10) and Yonatan (8).
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and groceries for kiddush, eat lunch and do something fun together, like playing soccer, riding horses or playing in cars on a sign.
Sometimes you go to the beach, or even just wash the car, but you always stop on the way to buy a gift at the toy store in the neighborhood – and there's always another excuse.
When we return home with a variety of gifts, we are greeted by the smells of cooking."
What does your Friday dinner look like?
"I was blessed with the cooks around me.
On my side there is Persian-Tunisian cuisine, full of salads and an atmosphere of laughter, music, singing and joy.
On the side of my wife Ines, who is also a great cook, come the Ukrainian dishes, which are deep and spicy, with a lot of meat.
When we arrive at my mother-in-law, the lobby of the building already smells amazing from her apartment.
I usually do Kiddush, together with the children, who know him by heart.
In the end, my fun after eating is to faint on the carpet, and the kids jump on me like I'm some kind of inflatable."
Do you have a special childhood memory of the weekends?
"As a child, I used to wake up on Shabbat to the sounds of Israeli music on Reshet Gimel and the Pale Tracker sketches, which we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in the Land of Israel, usually to the north.
Every remote corner of the country made him proud in his heart.
He passed away three months ago from a serious illness, and for him Kiddush and Shabbat were the holy of holies, mainly in the sense that the whole family should be together.
Recently I released a song in his memory called 'Keeping You Safe', which I created with Osher Cohen.
I believe he was proud of this work, which sanctifies the bond between father and son."
We will soon mark the 74th Independence Day. As an ardent Zionist, how do you feel about the holiday?
"Independence Day is a holy day for me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Persia and Tunisia, my parents were forced to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who gets to live with his children in our country.
A week or two before Independence Day, I would already climb trees and tie strings with Israeli flags to a house.
Today my Independence Day is full of performances, and we always meet an insanely happy audience, celebrating that we can live the way we want.
We have to make sure that our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren have this option as well, and remember that nothing here is taken for granted."
Her Friday: Esti Zakheim blesses Shabbat
"My dream is to open a big table and invite all my dead loved ones": Friday dinner that Esti Zakheim dreams of, and how does she deal with the fact that her husband observes Shabbat?
Tell us about your preparations for Shabbat
.
"The preparations begin as early as Thursday night, when I come back from a play or workshop and cook until 3 a.m. everything that requires long cooking such as goulash, roasts and sauces.
On Fridays, in the first part of the day, I dedicate time to myself, to meeting friends for coffee, a play or a movie, or I participate in rehearsals.
In the summer, Saturdays come in late, and I have plenty of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch the sunset or just watch a good series.
At Shabbat dinner, I usually host my mother, Varda, who turned 89, and friends."
Can you share more about cooking?
"I like shortcuts.
For example, instead of peeling 10 onions, slicing and crying, I buy a bag of frozen onions and fry them.
On my Shabbat table you can find meat dishes, vegan tofu dishes, potatoes and cauliflower in the oven.
I prepare most of the cooking, and of course they are heated on the plate on Shabbat.
Alejandro, my partner, makes chicken soup, vegetable salad, and in the winter - the cholent."
Your husband is a religious man and you come from a secular home.
How does it work?
"Living with a Shabbat observant is an endless compromise.
"And you shall love your neighbor as yourself," in practice.
He can't go on family trips, so I often found myself packing the kids and joining family trips of friends.
In addition, I'm also the on-duty leader of the children, the one who brings them back on Friday nights from parties and meetings.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the advantages of Shabbat, because I usually don't perform on Shabbat and get a kind of 'forced vacation' – and that's a good thing."
Who would you like to host on Shabbat?
"I would open a big table and invite 'My Dead.'
Sometimes I imagine what would have happened if my brother Daniel z"l had been alive, or if my father, Shneur z"l, had seen my children: Uriel (23) and twins Tamara and Naama (16 and a half).
We must have been fighting over football and politics and rejoicing in each other."
Do you have a special childhood memory of the weekends?
"We were a warm and united family.
On Friday afternoons, my mother would make a pile of schnitzels, bring hummus and pita bread from the market, and burn eggplants for a tahini salad.
Afterwards, we would go to Aunt Hannah at Yad Eliyahu, or as she would say, 'Yad Eliake,' and she would make blintzes.
Since I wasn't the only one who didn't like raisins, she would make me some without raisins.
She saw me, the youngest of the siblings, and took care of me.
On Saturdays we would take a tour with my father at the Jaffa port, and he would show us where he and his twin brother, Grisha, came to Israel with nothing."

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck got engaged
Nearly two decades after their love story that ended in a breakup, Lopez and Affleck are back in each other's arms.
Lopez said goodbye to baseball player Alex Rodriguez in April 2021
.
His one: Almost two decades after their first love story that ended in a breakup and a year after their high-profile comeback, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are closing a romantic circle and are engaged.
Lopez shared the happy news yesterday evening (Friday) with her fans on her official website onthejlo.com
.
The news of the engagement comes after Lopez was filmed walking around this week with a huge diamond ring clearly visible on her engagement finger.
A representative for her confirmed to People magazine that Affleck and Lopez are indeed engaged.
As you may recall, the last time Affleck (49) pulled out a ring and offered Lopez (52) to be his forever was in 2002, and then it was an eye-popping ring with a huge six-carat pink diamond, worth an estimated $2.5 million.
Despite the grandiose gesture of love, the two broke up in 2004, accusing the media of being overly obsessed and constantly rummaging through their lives.
Since then, Affleck has managed to marry actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, while Lopez, as we know, has been married three times before, including singer Marc Anthony, who together became parents to twins.
Lopez's last romantic relationship was with baseball player Alex Rodriguez, whom she broke up with in April 2021 after a four-year relationship, including a two-year engagement.
The Kardashians speak: "We can't invent what happens to us"
"The chaos is endless", Kris Jenner's mother insists on the new series starring the reality show's first family, and receives backing from her daughters and the new producer •
In an article that will be published in "Shishabat" magazine, they talk about the big money, the PR grinder, the brand factory, and the change that Kim wants to make in the world: "I'm no longer the one who thinks for hours about which bikini selfie is worth posting"
This may surprise many, but the most sought-after brand in 2022 of Disney's content empire, which also includes the Marvel movies and "Star Wars", among others, is the Kardashian family.
Details of the reality show's and social media first family's contract with Disney have not been revealed, but estimates say a minimum of $100 million has been transferred to the family's daughters, who now also function as producers.
In a press meeting with the stars, each of whom is accompanied by an entire beauty team that takes care of makeup, hair and fine lines in clothes non-stop, the family members, as well as their new and sought-after producer, insisted that this time it is not a reality show, this time what is received on the screen is completely authentic.
"We can't make up what happens to us," says the family's mother, Kris Jenner, emphatically, "the chaos is endless."
"We're showing how much we've grown since that series that premiered in 2007," says Khloe Kardashian.
"When we started we were scared, a lot happens to us in life and you can't simply confine everything to a narrative of beginning, middle and end.
A lot of plots were rushed through editing, wrapped in a sweet color film and forgotten on the sidelines.
That's not what life looks like in reality.
Now we are more exposed, facing the camera directly, not just a reality show but an authentic documentary series."
When confronted with their new involvement in the production of the series, which actually gives them complete control over the content that is received on screen, Chloe claims: "We are involved behind the scenes, seeing segments while editing and giving comments, but not from a place of defensiveness but simply to give our opinion on what will make the series better.
It's a mirror of our lives and I personally feel that I've gone through emotional growth from watching myself.
Kendall and Kylie were little girls when we started, so they're more of a boundary."
"I've grown up"
Kim Kardashian, for her part, continues with all her might to change her image, from a cheap reality show to a lawyer with an agenda.
"I've grown up," she claims, "I'm raising four black children, that is, from a persecuted community that is discriminated against in this country.
I want to change reality, so that my children and the children of all my friends will have a different future, in the hope that we can heal the crooked system.
That's my motivation."
"I'm no longer the same Kim who thinks for hours about which bikini selfie to post," she insists, "but it hasn't completely disappeared from my life either.
A person must be loyal to who he really is and take it all for fun."
The reasons for the dismissal of the producer revealed by Ryan Seacrest and their new and very profitable path in the industry, the significance of the move to Disney, the family's well-oiled PR machine and its impact on the brand's profitability, and more, in the full article that will be published in "Shisbat" magazine.

Watch: Tamir Greenberg on his relationship with his father
The winner of "The Next Star" finds a second single and returns to his childhood memories and the significant presence of his father in his life •
"The song tells about how to keep in touch from a distance," he says
Tamir Greenberg in a second single called Into The Night after captivating the audience with his first single and his participation in "The Next Star".
In recent months, Greenberg has continued to perform in many performances: Tel Aviv Culture Hall, Tel Aviv Opera House, Shuni Amphitheater, Ganei Yehoshua Amphitheater, Hangar 11 and dozens of other shows.
The song Into The Night was produced and arranged by Greenberg together with producer Stav Beger.
The video, directed by Daria Geller, brings Tamir back to his childhood memories and his father's significant presence in his life.
"The song talks about the relationship between my father and me.
About the period when I left Israel for the United States and the way to keep in touch from afar," says Greenberg.
In the coming month, Greenberg will perform at the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah in Israel, and ahead of the new season of "The Next Star", the song with which he won on the show, "Tell Me Where The Light Goes", was chosen as the audition song for the upcoming season.
Made in Blue and White: Yuval Shmala is the big winner of the season and the 16th ninja in the world
The phenom climbed Mount Midoriyama in 26 seconds and won the title of "First Israeli Ninja" •
Yogev Malka climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but will not hold the title of nin.
the
There is a winner: Yuval Shmala conquered Midoriyama, and he is the winner of the fourth season of "Ninja Israel" and now holds the title of the first Israeli ninja and the 16th in the world.
Shmala has been a participant in the show since its first season, when he finished in first place, and in the second season he lost to Gil Marantz.
In the third season, he won again and recently returned for the fourth season, and during filming he declared that this would be the last season.
Tonight he climbed Mount Midoriyama for the first time in 26 seconds and finished in first place, after beating contestants Yogev Malka and Yishai Kalfon.
Malka managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds and finished in second place.
It should be noted that according to the rules of the show, only one ninja can be crowned each season who managed to climb Midoriyama in time.
Therefore, despite Malka's impressive achievement, because Yuval Shmala, the winner of this season, climbed Midoriyama by 3 seconds faster, Malka does not win the ninja world title.
He will be able to compete for it again next season.
Well, we understood, full of superheroes, Rotem Sela is perfect, and "Ninja Israel" is the most important sporting event in the world
.
Two Olympic medalists and a veteran sports broadcaster sat in the finals of a reality show and behaved as if it was the most significant sporting achievement on the planet
.
Rotem Sela represents for us such a perfect feminine ideal that it is distorted to present it that way on television.
She earns more on campaigns than Wonder Woman, she's too pretty, she knows how to put Dana Weiss in her place, and when necessary - also defend her business partner.
She is both a mother and a career woman who advertises banks and air conditioners, models and leads series and reality shows, and serves as an unattainable role model for young girls.
And maybe it makes sense that Rotem Sela is going through too perfect a screen, because in the show she hosts, you have to be perfect, and there's no need to apologize for that.
In the world of the ninja, everyone is larger than life, and the facilitators first.
After all, Assi Ezer got involved in an affair that was supposed to erase him from the screen for a while, but since he is not an ordinary human being, he got out of it even before the first batch of commercials.
Listen to the soundtrack of the event: Niv Raskin, who has won European Cups and world records in his lifetime, but is moved by a megawall as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
In the final, two Olympic medalists (Yarden Jerbi and Linoy Ashram) sat next to him as commentators, as if to emphasize how rare and high-quality the conditions for entering the superhuman world that this reality show has been presenting for four seasons are.
"Ninja Israel" went out of proportion to market the season, which ended last night with Mt. Midoriyama and Yuval Shmala who managed to climb it in 26 seconds and was finally crowned a ninja.
There, he led an almost insurmountable path, one after the other knocking down all the superhuman characters for whom the show made sure to inflate their egos throughout the year.
Want to be a Ninja Turtle?
Not with us.
This is where superheroes are sought.
The emphasis was on the search for an heir to Ishmala, the so-called "King of Kings and One of a Kind," and other epithets meant to clarify how perfect and one-of-a-kind he was.
As a result, the level of difficulty was raised, the girls who tried to compete in the season's tracks crashed, and the boys competed with each other to see who had more squares in their stomachs and the charisma of plywood to step into the shoes of the retired.
They will say that this is a sports program that encourages physical activity and presents overcoming difficulties and challenges, but from the perspective of the vast majority of viewers – mediocre armchair sweet potatoes like us – "Ninja Israel" fosters an unattainable model of sports-achievement.
Faster, stronger, higher, more perfect.
When Gil Sassover moves between punches and conversations about holiness
It's strange to see the comedian, ex "Comedy Store", the host of the "Kabbalat Shabbat" program on Channel 14, in which he tastes removals and gives a stage mainly to men
If we play a game of associations, we will all have similar answers to the question "What does the concept of 'preparations for Shabbat' remind you of?"
Say: Sponge and cleaning, pots on the gas and smells in the stairwell, Yaron Ilan or Avi Kachon on TV, but the strangest thing would be if someone suddenly said "Gil Sassover".
Because Gil Sassover is in the middle of the sponge and the cooking is the most unrelated thing that television can offer.
And indeed, "Kabbalat Shabbat," the new program he hosts on Friday afternoons on Channel 14, is detached from the time it airs.
Half of it - Sassover is standing.
He speaks quickly, holds a microphone in his hand even when tasting dishes, and tries to divide the dose between punches and conversations about holiness.
In his defense, it should be said that the lack of budget is felt, and this is probably the maximum that can be created under these conditions.
However, what was also felt in the premiere program, which was broadcast yesterday from Mateh Binyamin, is a clear gender divide.
The men sang, played, danced, spoke Torah, marketed restaurants and factories – while the women made do with a small item, in which they spoke excitedly about running a sewing shop.
Happy Women's Day to you.
Kabbalat Shabbat with Gil Sassover, now 14
The Assisted Living Association vs. Ruthie Russo: "Saying 'it tastes like assisted living' harms our activity"
Chairwoman Yuli Gat sent a letter in which she expressed the association's complaint against what they claimed was an insulting statement made by the judge of "The Next Restaurant" in one of the trailers for the show.
Ruthie Russo responded: "I'm glad that there are places that invest more in the culinary work of this population."
The Association of Nursing Homes and Assisted Living in Israel against "The Next Restaurant": In a letter sent by Chairwoman Yuli Gat and reached Israel Hayom, it was written as follows: "In the trailer before the broadcast, which was distributed on all social networks and on television, it is described that the professional judge of the competition said, 'The food tastes like sheltered housing,' that is, the food of a closed institution with low-level food."
"The tone chosen by the show's judge, Ruthie Russo, to describe her disappointment with the food served by the contestant immediately cancels our many years of activity to fight against the ignorance in the field, because the assisted living homes operate restaurants in the various homes for the benefit of the residents with chef dishes at the highest level."
The statement added: "Service staff and house managers are fighting for the image of assisted living that offers solutions for quality housing for the elderly, including alleviating loneliness, abundant leisure activities, a high standard of living, and more."
In Israel, in recent years, more and more families and older people have come to understand that loneliness is the most serious illness in old age, and they see community settings as a proven solution to the disease.
"Food is one of life's greatest pleasures, so we dedicate resources and efforts to serve the residents the finest food.
Most assisted living homes use professional chefs in order to build a menu.
We will be happy at any time to invite the judging team to be impressed by the winning dishes served daily to tens of thousands of elderly people in Israel, and on behalf of the chefs and restaurant staff in the assisted living homes, we would like your apologies and clarification.
Come together, the media and Israeli society, to encourage community housing for the health of the elderly."
Ruthie Russo said in response: "I'm glad that there are places that invest more in the culinary of this population, which definitely deserves excellent food in the advanced period of life.
I respect the hard work of cooks, cooks, chefs and chefs everywhere, even in assisted living facilities."
"Double morality: In Russia you cancel a show but in Israel you don't?"
Nick Cave reacts to criticism
The singer referred to the criticism leveled at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of double standards •
The singer responded: "The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
"
Earlier this week, Nick Kyiv canceled a concert in Russia due to the war, declaring that he "stands with Ukraine and prays that the madness will end soon."
In doing so, the acclaimed Australian singer joined artists and bands such as Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who also canceled performances in the invading country.
But in Kiev's case, his cancellation notice took a slightly different turn.
A Turkish fan named Ahmet accused the singer of being a hypocrite, as in 2017 Kiev refused to cancel two concerts in Israel, despite the criticism he received from pro-Palestinian organizations.
During his visit to Israel, Kyiv told local media: "In the end, I am here for two reasons: the first is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians."
The same Ahmet well remembered Kiev's statements in favor of music and against politicization.
The fan even published a poignant post on the singer's personal and uncensored website, "The Red Hand Files", in which he claimed that Israel is also an occupation state, and therefore the situation of Palestine is identical to the situation of Ukraine.
"What bothers me about your announcement about Ukraine," Ahmet wrote. "The fact that you didn't support the Palestinians in this way, who also suffer from a brutal regime.
In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion, Israel is first and foremost responsible for the Palestinian suffering.
It makes me very sad, because you represent a double standard here," the Turkish fan concluded.
But the story does not end here, as Kyiv chose to reply to Ahmet in a long and detailed letter, in which he emphasized that "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The first situation is an unprovoked attack by one country against its neighbor, in the hope of changing the security order of the whole of Europe.
The second situation is complex friction between two peoples.
The conflicts are similar in that innocent people, who share a tragic fate, are forced to hide in shelters.
I feel a lot of sympathy for all of these communities – no matter where they are and who they are."
Cave added that while he is not interested in elaborating on his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he certainly supports the Palestinians as well, noting that in the past 20 years he has participated in many fundraising events on their behalf.
"But this is not the time for arguments, Ahmet," the singer clarified, "this is a time to unite and support the Ukrainians, whose land is currently having a catastrophe.
I have great fans in Russia, and I know that many Russians are strongly opposed to the actions of the Putin regime.
If I could play for them, I would do it."
In light of the decline in morbidity: The Corona Project Coordinator will return to managing Ziv Hospital
Prof. Salman Zarka was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the policy of treating COVID-19 in the third and fourth waves.
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue in his role as a project manager at the same time.
Prof. Zarka: "I am happy that the Omicron wave continues to fade, and it is still our duty to prepare for another wave"
.
Against the backdrop of the decline in COVID-19 morbidity, the COVID-19 project coordinator, Prof. Salman Zarka, will return to managing Ziv Hospital in Safed on Sunday.
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue in his role as project manager at the same time.
"I am happy for the citizens of Israel that the Omicron wave continues to wane and that we have returned to our normal way of life," said Prof. Zarka, adding: "We still have a duty to prepare for another wave of morbidity as a result of the fact that the virus is still here, in Israel and around the world."
Prof. Zarka was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the policy for the treatment of COVID-19 in the third and fourth waves.
As of May 1, Israel has returned to a state of "between waves," which includes reducing most of the coronavirus systems, while maintaining the ability to conduct sequencing tests and investigations, which will serve as a basis for action in the event that a new variant is discovered.
Latent morbidity
The report of the National Knowledge and Information Center for the Coronavirus Campaign, published this morning, noted that "there is a decline in the average number of new confirmed cases to below 2,000 per day, on the weekly average, alongside a decline in the number of hospitalized and hospitalized in serious condition."
However, they emphasized that "there is a significant amount of latent morbidity, and in practice the number of infections is much higher.
The number of institutional tests carried out in the community (not taking into account the tests of those returning from abroad) is low, and stands at less than 20,000 tests on a weekly average only.
The low volume of tests makes it difficult to identify and understand morbidity trends."
State Comptroller's Report: The Actual Budget for Most of the Drug Basket Committee's Years of Activity – Less Than the Recommended Budget
According to Matanyahu Engelman's report, for more than 20 years of the basket's activity, the Ministry of Health has not supervised the committee's activities.
The report also states that the minutes of the meetings are published with a significant delay, if at all.
In addition, the Comptroller recommends increasing the transparency of the subcommittee's activities – and updating the procedures for the basket's work.
Another flaw that was found relates to the fact that since the committee began its activity, the Ministry of Health has not asked the HMOs for reports on the scope of use and utilization of the medications in the basket – which would have made it possible to analyze and audit the budget given to them.
The Drug Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees in our daily lives and our health.
Every year, the committee decides on new drugs that will be given to the public free of charge through the health funds, but a new report by the State Comptroller published today (Tuesday) warns that the committee has been operating for more than 20 years without monitoring its activities and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council supervising and examining its activity.
Israel Hayom correspondent Ran Reznik adds that the State Comptroller's investigation was conducted following the ongoing revelations in Israel Hayom about the failures of the drug basket.
According to Matanyahu Engelman's report, he recommends "making amendments and improvements in the process of expanding the basket, which will lead to a higher quality utilization of the budget for the health services basket to which the public is entitled."
Throughout the years of the mechanism of addition to the drug basket, in the years 1998-2021, NIS 8 billion was added to the state budget – with the addition ranging from NIS 0 to NIS 500 million each year.
In 2019, 2020, and 2021, requests were submitted to add about 800 new drugs and technologies to the healthcare basket, at a total annual cost of more than NIS 2 billion.
In practice, the budget allocated for the expansion of the basket was smaller than the scope of the requests.
In most of the committee's years of activity (90% of the time), the amount of the budget supplement was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired additional rate.
The Comptroller notes that it is necessary to examine and regulate the amount of the annual supplement in order to allow for certainty and long-term planning.
Engelman also noted that "the transparency model in the basket's work is deficient."
Thus, for example, the Basket Committee's work procedure stipulates that the minutes of the meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published with a delay of 109-160 days, while sometimes the minutes of the final meetings are not published at all.
"The delay in the publication of the minutes harms the transparency of the decisions; As a result, the ability of the bidders – patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies – to submit reapplications as soon as possible and relevant, may be impaired, after they have learned lessons from the rejection of their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and revised their proposals, and re-evaluated the feasibility of accepting them in the next round," the comptroller noted in the report.
"The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols in accordance with the timetables set out in the procedure."
Out of thousands of submissions, only one economic comment was submitted
Another criticism by Engelman relates to a preliminary process of evaluating the technologies submitted to the drug basket.
The State Comptroller found that about half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the postponement.
Another flaw concerns the activities of the Drug Basket Subcommittee, which is closed to the media and the public, and in which patient numbers and the costs of medications are discussed.
The Comptroller recommends adding a public representative or examining the possibility of publishing the discussions to the public without confidential commercial details.
The procedure according to which the Health Services Basket Committee operates stipulates that "an economic assessment must be submitted" to a request to add a drug to the basket.
But in practice, over the years, only one economic assessment has been submitted out of thousands of submissions – and the committee makes its decisions without an economic assessment.
For example, requests were submitted to the Basket Committee's deliberations for the years 2019-2021 to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.
The report found that the requests did not include economic estimates, including an estimate of the amount that could have been saved due to reducing the damage caused by diseases caused by obesity or due to the ability to avoid gastric bypass surgeries.
It also appears that the decisions of the Drug Basket Committee are not in line with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
Thus, for example, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparedness for the treatment of tumors in chronic diseases as goals, but in the framework of the decisions regarding the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.
The Comptroller also warns that since 2011, the basket includes services that are not the responsibility of the HMOs, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines, which are provided by the Ministry of Health (the "Third Addendum").
This is when the legal framework for this step is regulated only retroactively.
In the past six years, NIS 74 million of the addition to the drug basket has been used for these services.
Engelman recommends that the Ministry of Health update the procedures for the basket work and also determine whether there is a need for a separate financial supplement for these services.
About a third of the new drugs that are included in the drug basket are defined as "drugs at no additional cost", the use of which does not cost the HMOs an additional amount because they replace an existing treatment.
The Comptroller proposes to examine the possibility of these medications being discussed in a different and shortened track, so that it will be possible to update the medication basket several times a year and not just once a year.
There is no supervision of the use of extremely expensive drugs.
The audit also shows that since the work of the basket committee began 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health plans to report and has not supervised the scope of uses and utilization of the medications in the basket, information that could have allowed the ministry to analyze and audit the budget given to the health plans.
Over the years, only two reports have been published relating to the years 2006-2009, and these too were published considerably late (the last was published this year and dealt with the use of the budget in the years 2007-2009).
"The delay in conducting tests may lead to difficulty in collecting and analyzing the data, irrelevance of the conclusions that arise from the examination after such a long period, to the subcommittee's sub-optimal pricing and to making decisions based on inconclusive findings," the report states.
In addition, the Ministry does not audit and supervise the use of particularly expensive drugs and has not learned any lessons.
These are 10 drugs that accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (NIS 1.7 billion in 2016-2021).
The comptroller wrote: "It is recommended that the Ministry of Health conduct individual controls on these drugs and technologies and analyze the scope of their use against the estimates.
Controls and analysis will make it possible to draw systemic conclusions about the work process of the basket committee and the subcommittee, and on the manner in which estimates are prepared when pricing drugs and technologies and improve them."
"Shocking and unimaginable": Heated discussion in the Health Committee on the poisoning in Beit Dafna
The measurements of the first woman who died were normal ten minutes before her death.
Committee Chairman, MK Silman: "If the people there cared that the kitchen would be like home, it wouldn't look like this."
Ten minutes before the first nurse, a 40-year-old woman from the Beit Dafna daycare center in Holon, died of food poisoning, she was taken for medical measures that were normal, she claimed today (Tuesday) in a discussion at the health committee of the daycare center's director.
"We have night therapists who check during the night and there is a nurse who does the rounds.
There were a number of reports of cases of diarrhea and the last time the resident was taken indicators, it was 10 minutes before she stopped responding, and they were normal.
She was monitored like the other dyers with diarrhea.
She is a nursing patient, we went to bring her to help with her transfer and then the same tenant did not respond.
We started resuscitation and called the clinic nurse," the daycare director described what happened last Sunday morning at the daycare.
This is an incident in which three residents died, six were hospitalized, and a total of about a quarter of the daycare residents (33 out of 131) suffered from diarrhea to host eating contaminated goulad meat.
The director of the daycare center made the remarks against the backdrop of claims that a death from food poisoning indicates neglect and lack of follow-up on the part of the caregivers.
Dr. Naama Nouss, head of epidemiology at the Tel Aviv Health Bureau, noted that "we cannot determine unequivocally what the three residents died from.
Only blood tests were taken from them."
The hearing also revealed that even from the residents who were hospitalized, it was no longer possible to take a stool sample because they did not have diarrhea, and therefore it is not possible to determine with certainty the cause of death and morbidity.
An engineer on behalf of the Ministry of Health also noted that "the Ministry of Health checks the sanitary condition of the kitchens in the institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Welfare or for the renewal of a license."
The Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Affairs admitted that a committee of inquiry had not yet been appointed to investigate this case and to a previous case of abuse of inmates that occurred three months ago at the Bnei Zion institution in the Sharon.
The chair of the Health Committee, MK Idit Silman, said during the discussion: "If the people there cared that the kitchen would be like home, it wouldn't look like this.
The residents in the welfare dormitories need more.
They are sensitive to health and need extra supervision and care.
It's shocking and unimaginable what happened there.
The horrific findings that were discovered were even after they knew that the Ministry of Health had come to investigate.
Where is the supervision and responsibility of the ministries?
How come the ministers and directors general of the ministries are not present in such a discussion, who will give an explanation of what is happening here?"
Yigal Nachtomi, CEO of Beit Eckstein, who manages the daycare center and even managed the daycare center himself, said, "Hundreds and thousands of people throughout the system are rising up with only one goal: to do good for people.
The people who have passed away are people whom I have personally cared for.
I put one of the residents to sleep on my arms.
This is a shocking event as far as we are concerned."
Smadar Ona, a former resident of the same daycare center of her age, lashed out at him and said, "Enough of the lies and the beautiful words.
I was there."
Gali Barmi, the parents' representative at Akim Israel: "We have already complained about the food in the past and did not accept the criticism."
Oren Hellman, founder of the Equal Chance Initiative for the Integration of People with Disabilities, protested that the names of the deceased shelters were not published: "Their names are not known at all.
Are they worth less?
They are underestimating the lives of our children."
Suspicion of Wolfson's failure: The surgeon caused a rupture in the heart - and the patient died.
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Firas Abu Aker as the director of the Thoracic Surgery Unit at the hospital.
The chairman of the doctors' committee complained that the director, Dr. Engel, had been warned before his appointment
Hospital: "He is valued and experienced"
First publication: A horrific mistake occurred at the Wolfson Government Hospital in Holon, when during the operation the doctor made a tear in the patient's heart, which led to his tragic death.
The surgery on an 83-year-old lung cancer patient was performed on April 19.
This was the first surgery performed by Dr. Firas Abu Aker at the hospital, after he was appointed director of the Thoracic Surgery Unit at Wolfson.
During the surgery, which was intended to drain the area surrounding the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large rupture in the heart, which led to severe bleeding and caused the patient's death.
However, the unusual complication opened a Pandora's box, which raised difficult questions regarding the management of the hospital.
The director of the Oncology Institute and chairman of the doctors' committee, Dr. Ronen Brenner, demanded an investigation into the affair in a letter he sent to the hospital's director, Dr. Anat Engel.
In the letter, he raised very serious allegations about Dr. Engel's conduct and the appointment of Dr. Abu Aker, after the previous director of the unit, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, moved to Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer.
A huge hole in the heart
According to Dr. Brenner's letter, the patient was lucid, functioning and had been treated by him for the past four years.
Recently, he has had an outbreak of the disease, and an abnormal accumulation of fluid has been discovered within the heart membrane, which contains the heart muscle.
Also, the surgeon, Dr. Abu Aker, was under the impression that he could perform the surgery.
According to the complaint, there was a serious malfunction in the operation, and Dr. Hagai Dekel, director of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Wolfson, who was operating on a child in the next room at the time, "was rushed to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart."
According to him, the heart was drained of blood, the blood pressures were negligible, and the surgical approach was wrong.
In addition, Dr. Brenner said that Dr. Dekel contacted him and told him that Dr. Abu Aker was not professionally and personally suitable to manage the Wolfson Thoracic Surgery Unit.
However, despite his explicit warnings and despite the fact that he was supposed to be the direct manager of the breast surgeon, Dr. Engel executed a tender without involving him and accepted Dr. Abu Aker for the position.
He added: "This is an uncomplicated process, which lasted a few minutes," and added: "It is impossible not to relate to the flawed process of accepting Dr. Abu Aker to the position.
The question arises as to whether Engel is directly responsible for the failure of the operation and the patient's death."
Experienced Surgeon
Information and claims by other senior doctors were presented to Israel Hayom, which corroborate the questions raised by Dr. Ronen Brenner.
Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, director of Surgery A at Wolfson, responded to Brenner's complaint, writing that Dr. Abu Aker is "one of the most experienced surgeons in the country, but a relatively young thoracic surgeon."
He added that he was selected in a proper tender and that Dr. Dekel did not take part in it, in accordance with his declarations of his desire to "disconnect" from the chest unit.
He added: "I was not a party to the process either, and I may have been supposed to.
Dr. Shimonov wrote that Dr. Firas Abu Aker began working on April 10 and is entitled to 100 days of grace, "All the doctors at the hospital were impressed by his professionalism and his motivation and willingness to work.
He has already performed dozens of similar procedures, and unfortunately the current case ended as it did in an unfortunate way.
Wolfson Hospital said in response: "We share the family's grief.
This is a patient of the oncologist Dr. Ronen Brenner.
The thoracic surgeon mentioned in the article is a respected surgeon with many years of experience, and was selected in a tender to manage a thoracic surgery unit affiliated with the surgery department at Wolfson Hospital.
"According to Dr. Hagai Dekel, his words that were quoted are inaccurate and were taken out of context.
It should be noted that this is a patient who was unfortunately in a very serious condition.
The hospital is examining the details of the case transparently, and the Ministry of Health is familiar with the details of the case."

About Prof. Marvin Shapira z"l
The encounter that opened my eyes - and changed my life
If I hadn't met the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was the director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Hadassah Hospital, I probably would have remained a physician specializing in internal medicine.
He is the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to work in it.
I met him in the corridors of Hadassah, back in the 1980s.
I didn't think for a moment that I would leave the internal medicine, as I loved the treatment of the patient himself; But Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also expressed in neurology, in internal medicine, and in virtually every field.
I thank him for bringing me to this field.
All along, I liked his investigative approach, an approach that gets to the root of the problem.
The discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor with all his soul, who loved the patients and taught me not to take things for granted and to examine everything in depth.
He was a real and honest person, devoid of ego, qualities that I liked very much about him.
Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me and influenced me the most, I intended to choose my father, the late Dr. Yosef Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.
He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go to medicine – but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapira.
Both, for example, coined proverbs that doctors use to this day – for example, "tissue is de Ichio", that is, taking a biopsy of tissue from the affected organ makes it possible to know which medications should be given; Or "Won Yo Huz It, Yo Luz It," which is meant to explain that antibiotic overuse leads to bacteria becoming resistant to it.
The late Prof. Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked at Hadassah and was the father of two daughters.
He passed away about a year ago, and when I visited his family at Shiva, I cried.
He was something – a witty and clever epidemiologist who volunteered for everything.
He never complained, not even during his serious illness.
He was one of the first doctors on the team to deal with epidemics, and he was sorely missed during this period.
Had he been with us today, I am sure I would have consulted with him, and I am sure that he would have been one of the leaders of the team dealing with epidemics.

Dr. Shlomi Kodesh, Director of Soroka Hospital |
About Prof. Shaul Sukenik z"l
A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors
.
I first met the late Prof. Shaul Sukenik when I was a fourth-year medical student, and I came to a round of internal medicine in the internal medicine department that he directed.
Later, I returned to the department in my sixth year, and I did my medical school thesis under his supervision, writing a computer simulation of a patient with polyarthritis (inflammation of multiple joints).
Shaul influenced every significant juncture in my professional life over the course of 20 years, and was the most significant man in shaping my image as a doctor; Not only professionally, but also – and especially – from a personal and human point of view.
During my internship, I debated between family medicine and internal medicine, and I consulted with him about choosing a specialty.
In the end, I chose to specialize in internal medicine with him at Soroka.
During my internship, he provided me with constant guidance, in a variety of avenues – in scientific writing (sorry Shaul, I wasn't persistent enough), in communication with patients, in working in a multidisciplinary team – a field in which the department excelled – and in fact, in every aspect related to medicine.
To this day, I recognize in me, as a doctor and as a manager, characteristics that come from Shaul.
When I finished my internship and was debating whether to go for a period of study abroad, Shaul pushed and directed me, and helped me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to proceed.
The training period was a very important period for my professional development, and without Shaul's support and push, it is not certain that this would have happened.
When I returned, when I received an offer to join the hospital's management, Shaul was again the one who supported and assisted.
Later on, we passed through complex periods together in the Division of Internal Medicine.
Shaul knew how to integrate the teacher, principal, friend and teammate in a wonderful way, without his various roles interfering with each other.
I aspire to succeed like him in this special combination.
He raised generations of students, interns and interns, who are now throughout the medical system in Israel, and whose excellent work commemorates his memory and work.
I am honored to be part of this group.

Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev, Director of Schneider Children's Medical Center |
About Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld
The man who taught me medicine, and especially listening.
Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld, founder and former director of the Intensive Care Unit at Schneider Children's Medical Center, taught me to be an ICU, but more than that, he taught me to think.
The obvious thing I learned from him is to take care of the most complex, the sickest children.
The children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.
The obvious is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who never imagined they would find themselves in these complex situations in the intensive care unit with their children.
Sounds strange, but it's the obvious.
But I learned even more significant and profound things from him.
Looking back, since I'm a doctor who runs and a manager who is a doctor, it's clear to me today that the connection between the worlds is clear; The education I received from Dr. Sheinfeld connects them.
Dr. Sheinfeld taught me to listen attentively to many things: to listen to the children, to listen to the monitor, to listen to the nurses, to the care teams, both young and old, and to listen to the parents.
All of this needs to be done not only to communicate more correctly and more successfully, but to constantly gather a lot of information that can prevent the next deterioration.
Preventive processes in the treatment of children exist everywhere, and of course also in intensive care.
Listening and dialogue stimulate a deeper understanding, both on the part of the treating staff and on the part of the patients and their families.
My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true when looking at an entire system.
The deeper and more rigorous an understanding exists, which incorporates all the parties involved in the discourse, the more precise the decision-making process will be, adapted to the situation, and most importantly – early enough to prevent future damage, immediate or distant.
That's why Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld is so much more than an inspiring character for me.
He's a person who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think fast and precisely, to listen – and then to apply.

Medical Malpractice in the Different Stages of Labor
In order to receive compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the negligence, that the damage was caused by that negligence
Childbirth is one of the happiest and most exciting events in a family's life.
Unfortunately, however, sometimes births end in severe damage caused to the mother or newborn as a result of the negligence of the medical staff.
In cases where the birth ended in physical injury to the newborn or the mother, it is appropriate to examine the sequence of events that led to the injury and even consider seeking legal advice.
A lawyer specializing in the field of medical malpractice will examine whether there were defects in the conduct of the medical staff during the various stages of labor that caused the damage, and if he sees fit, he will consult with a medical expert in the relevant field.
It should be emphasized that not every mistake in treatment on the part of the medical staff amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during the birth do not necessarily indicate that the management was negligent.
When, then, is it negligence?
When the doctor's mistake stemmed from a lack of skill or deviated from the reasonable level of care, and the lack of skill and deviation from the accepted level of care caused damage to the patient that would not have been caused had the doctor not acted in this way.
In this article, we will examine the different stages of labor, explain what complications may occur in each of the stages, and when they amount to medical malpractice.
The contraction stage
The contraction phase lasts an average of 8 to 14 hours.
At this stage, the cervix is gradually opened (in order to allow the passage of the fetus during birth) and at the end of the process it should reach a diameter of about 10 centimeters.
Most cases of medical negligence during the labor stage deal with the failure to identify fetal distress prior to birth, which caused damage to the newborn, which sometimes even manifests itself in cerebral palsy.
Cerebral palsy (CP):
Cerebral palsy may be caused by failure to identify or delay in identifying prenatal asphyxiation, which is expressed in a failure to supply oxygen to the fetus's brain tissue.
In general, monitoring the mother's condition and correctly interpreting the monitor that monitors the fetal heart activity should lead to early identification of the development of fetal distress, which allows the medical staff to act quickly and rescue the newborn before it is irreversibly damaged.
Cases in which the medical staff ignores signs that indicate that the fetus is suffering from a lack of oxygen, or that the staff does not correctly interpret the data before it, especially the fetal monitor, or responds late to the distress expressed in the monitor – may constitute negligence.
Cerebral palsy may also be caused by the prolapse of the umbilical cord as well as as by a rupture in the uterus that was not identified in time.
Even in these difficult events, it is worth clarifying whether the medical staff acted properly.
For example, Adv. Anna Reif Liganza, of Caspi Sror & Co., which specializes in representing victims of medical malpractice, says that her firm handled a claim by a child who was injured during childbirth after the midwife rupture the amniotic sac when the fetus's head was too high, thus causing the umbilical cord to prolapse (when the umbilical cord precedes the fetus's head) and impairing the oxygen supply to the fetal brain (as a result of the pressure of the fetus's head on the umbilical cord) and causing it to be born with severe neurological damage.
In another case, the attorney said that her office filed a lawsuit due to severe medical negligence on the part of the staff of the maternity ward at a large hospital, which during the birth did not identify clear signs at the time that necessitated a real suspicion that the mother was suffering from a rupture of the uterus in the area of the surgical scar of her previous pregnancy.
The fetus, which was expelled through the tear in its mother's uterus into the abdominal cavity, suffered from severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a late stage when it was on the verge of death.
Due to the severe fetal suffering during his birth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.
It should be emphasized that in order to be entitled to compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal connection between the negligence of the medical staff that led to the failure to identify the asphyxiation and the damage caused to the newborn, i.e., that the damage was caused by such negligence and not by any other reason or cause.
The examination of the causal relationship will be carried out by examining medical indices, which, according to the medical literature, only if they exist does there exist a causal link between asphyxia and brain injury.
Among other things, measures of the pH level in the fetus's blood, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic damage, and more are examined.
Death of the fetus
The stage of active labor
The active birth stage begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.
Delay in Delivery and Avoidance of Cesarean Sections
In some cases, dysfunctional birth develops, i.e., a lack of progress in the active birth process.
In such situations, it is customary to perform a cesarean section, in order to prevent various damages that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in birth.
"There are cases in which failure to perform a cesarean section on time may cause irreversible damage to the fetus," Adv. Reif-Leganza explained to us.
"For example, we conducted a medical malpractice claim for the death of a child caused by a significant delay in performing a cesarean section.
Contrary to any known medical practice, the medical staff were not able to identify the fetal distress and perform a cesarean section despite the extremely slow progress of the birth.
The delay in performing the surgery caused multi-system damage to the newborn, which ultimately led to her death shortly after her birth."
Negligence in a vacuum birth
In situations where the mother or the fetus is in significant danger that requires a particularly quick termination of labor, a vacuum birth is sometimes performed.
In this process, a "dome" is attached to the fetus's head using a vacuum and the fetus is pulled out by force.
Naturally, this action involves dangers and may cause damage to both the fetus and the mother, and therefore requires great caution, precision and skill.
In these events, medical negligence may manifest itself in the fact that the doctor does not adhere to the mandatory instructions and performs the operation despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the fetus's head is too high in the pelvis, or when it is performed for a longer time than allowed, or when despite the failure of a large number of attempts, the doctor continues to repeat the operation more than the permitted number of attempts.
In these cases, if the negligent vacuum action caused damage to the newborn – among other things, it may cause cranial damage and bleeding that may cause the development of brain damage – there is room to file a tort claim.
ERB paralysis
Ambush paralysis is a congenital nerve injury to the brachial plexus (a nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth, it is worth checking whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetric staff.
The injury manifests itself in the weakness of the muscles of the hand and can reach complete paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of 'shoulder spraxia' – a midwifery emergency that occurs when the fetus's shoulders are trapped inside the birth canal after its head has come out.
When should you suspect that the paralysis was caused by medical negligence?
In cases where the fetus's weight assessment indicated that it was a macrosomal fetus, meaning that it is expected to be born weighing more than 4.5 kilograms, and in accordance with the guidelines, it is preferable to deliver the mother by cesarean section.
When the weight of the newborn is over 4 kilograms, a cesarean section should be considered in light of the risk factors, including gestational diabetes and prolongation of the second stage of labor.
In the event that the medical staff ignores an abnormal weight assessment of the fetus or other risk factors and chooses to continue with a vaginal birth and the risk of shoulder dislocation and ERB paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that it is medical negligence.
Indeed, in CA 2694/90, the Supreme Court ruled that "the risk that shoulder stenosis will occur during childbirth can be predicted in advance with one degree or another of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder stenosis, where there is concern about its occurrence, is to perform a cesarean section."
Placental exit stage
The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the birth of the newborn and is accompanied by bleeding.
In most cases, the process lasts up to half an hour from the moment the baby comes out and usually occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical staff.
After the placenta comes out, the medical team will check whether it has come out intact or whether parts of the placenta remain in the uterus.
As part of this stage, complications may occur that may cause serious damage to the mother.
One of the well-known complications as a result of placental residues in the uterus is called "Asherman's syndrome", scarring of the uterine wall as a result of inflammation caused by the residue of the placenta in the uterus, a phenomenon that damages the uterine lining in a way that does not allow the pregnancy to be implanted.
Therefore, in cases where the medical staff did not identify that placental remnants were left or did not take all measures to prevent damage to the uterine lining, despite the suspicion of placental remnants in the uterus, it may be medical negligence and the case deserves an in-depth examination by an experienced lawyer in the field.
Death of the mother
The death of a woman during childbirth is quite rare.
In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy of life to the whole family becomes, unfortunately, the most tragic event for her.
In some cases, the medical staff does not detect bleeding in the mother on time or reacts late to such bleeding.
"For example...", Adv. Reif-Liganza told us, "Our firm filed a lawsuit concerning the death of a mother, when in that case the medical staff ignored and did not respond to the mother's worrying vital signs, for many hours, and delayed diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the underlying disease from which she suffered."
"In another case...", said Adv. Reif-Liganza, "our firm represented the relatives of a woman who gave birth after giving birth to twins due to bleeding that originated from the incision of the cesarean section that was not suture properly.
In that case, the mother complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and her clinical condition, reacting late only after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death."
Uterine loss
In severe cases, medical negligence in childbirth may lead to a hysterectomy, says Adv. Rafe Lingza: "Our firm has conducted a lawsuit against a hospital based on hysterectomy due to medical negligence after birth.
In that case, the mother, a 31-year-old woman, lost her uterus due to a lack of proper treatment for the massive bleeding observed by the medical staff after the birth, and despite this, no measures were taken during the time that could have prevented the damage."
What are the compensation awarded in claims for medical negligence in childbirth?
Compensation for a newborn for injury due to medical negligence in childbirth includes many components of damage, with the most significant amounts being given for pain and suffering, nursing and paid care, loss of wages and pensions for the victim and even to his parents, and other damage components.
The compensation awarded to an injured minor for wage and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the economy.
In addition, the compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation equipment, the cost of adapting housing to the baby's needs, mobility, and more.
"The amount of compensation is determined in each case on its own merits and according to its circumstances," says Adv. Reif-Liganza, and she adds that "today most claims on the grounds of medical malpractice end in a compromise that weighs the chance and risk that each party has in conducting the proceeding," but the attorney added that "there are cases in which the proceeding ends only with a judgment, and then if the claim is not rejected, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages, for example,  As part of a lawsuit conducted by our firm, the District Court awarded compensation to a minor who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress in excess of NIS 10 million."
In conclusion
Medical malpractice in childbirth is undoubtedly the nightmare of every family.
In these cases, a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that caused the tragic outcome, by an attorney skilled in managing claims on the grounds of medical malpractice, can help you win the compensation you deserve.
This is the reason for the prevalence of keratoconus eye disease in the south
Research has shown that there is a link between the development of the disease and intimate marriage.
• The highest prevalence was found in the Bedouin sector.
Expert: "It is possible that in any sector with a lot of weddings between cousins, a high incidence of the disease has been found."
Keratoconus is an inherited eye disease that causes several visual impairments.
It is very important to diagnose it as soon as possible, and to find the right solutions to prevent the situation from getting worse.
In recent years, several studies have been conducted to help understand how the disease develops, and innovative treatments have been developed.
The new studies provide a research basis for the suspicion that keratoconus eye disease is a genetic disease.
A recent study on the transformation of the shape of the cornea from a dome to a cone, revealed that the cause of the disease, the weakness of the cornea and its deformity is related to an enzymatic imbalance, as a result of which free radicals can damage the proteins in the cornea - and its structure will change.
The source of this lack of enzymes is genetic, a fact that strengthens the hypothesis that keratocanus is an inherited disease.
According to Prof. Ariella Gordon-Shag, head of the Department of Optometry Sciences at Hadassah Academic College, "In a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa, the prevalence of keratoconus was found to be 3.2%.
The highest prevalence was among students from the Bedouin sector – 20% had keratoconus, but there was a relatively small sample."
The researcher added that this is not a surprising finding: "There is a high prevalence of keratoconus in the Bedouin sector.
In our studies, we found that close marriage is a risk factor for keratoconus disease.
Thus, in any sector with a lot of weddings between cousins, we may find a high incidence."
In this context, it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unequivocal conclusion: in cases where a family history of keratoconus disease appears, all family members should go for an appropriate eye exam as soon as possible.
According to Arza Fruchter, a B.Sc clinical optometrist, "There are ten times more visits to the clinic from remote peripheral areas, especially from the south, compared to the center."
Fruchter adds, "In the past decade, I have noticed that most of the patients come from the periphery, especially from the Be'er Sheva area.
This is mainly due to the high prevalence of marriages within the family (especially in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and a lack of awareness of the proper treatment of the problem."
So how is the disease diagnosed?
Fruchter explains that keratoconus usually develops in adolescence or in the late teens (ages 15-16 or 20).
The disease includes a decrease in vision, in parallel with an increase in the cylinder.
Keratoconus patients attest to distorted and/or blurred vision of figures and objects.
These signs worsen with the development of the disease, which usually develops slowly and gradually over the years.
However, the disease may also develop at a rapid pace and reach its peak in just a few months.
Many patients even report increased sensitivity to light.
About three years after the operation in Gaza, the IDF revealed the name of Lt. Col. M.; Bennett: "Now, the people know the face of Israel's hero"
Mahmoud Khairuddin from the village of Hurfeish is a lieutenant colonel killed in an operation in Khan Yunis
Head of Military Intelligence: "He deserves the publicity, his family and his children" •
Later on, the possibility of publishing a photo of Lt. Col. Emanuel Moreno from Sayeret Matkal will be examined
About three and a half years after the operation that became entangled in Khan Yunis, the IDF today allows the publication that the person killed in the operation, Lt. Col. M., is the late Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khair-ud-Din from the village of Hurfeish in the north.
He was 41 years old when he fell.
Prime Minister Bennett said after the publication: "Three and a half years have passed since the late Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Khair al-Din fell in battle in a secret operation in Khan Yunis, and only now are we allowed to reveal his name and thank him for his contribution and dedication to the security of the state.
"The late Mahmoud z"l was a fighter in a paratrooper unit and later rose through the ranks of the army to become a lieutenant colonel in the IDF's special operations division.
An Israeli hero who was posthumously decorated with the IDF Chief of Staff's Commendation."
He added: "I eulogized him at his funeral and now the people of Israel have the right to know him, the name and face of Israel's hero, Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Khir al-Din, openly.
The surroundings looked up to him.
Since the operation, the IDF has banned the publication of his name for security reasons, and today, after a discussion held by the head of the Intelligence Directorate, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, with representatives of the military censorship, and with the consent of his family, it was decided to publish his name and photo.
Mahmoud Khaireddin, a hero of Israel, was born on December 28, 1977 in the village of Hurfeish in the Upper Galilee, the eldest son of his parents Ahmad and a nun, and has seven brothers and sisters.
He is a member of the Druze community.
He was married to Nahad and had two sons.
He served as an officer, fighter and commander in the Special Operations Directorate of the Intelligence Directorate.
Throughout his life, Khairuddin was a social leader, and the environment looked up to him.
Until the ninth grade, he studied at the school in Kfar Hurfeish, and then moved to the military boarding school at the Reali School in Haifa.
In October 1997 he enlisted in the Paratroopers Unit, and in 2000 he graduated from the Officers' School.
In 2002, he was located by the Special Operations Directorate of the Military Intelligence and moved to serve there.
During his service, he completed a bachelor's degree in law from the College of Management and a master's degree in education and business administration from the University of Haifa.
In 2002 he met his wife, Nahid, and in 2004 they married.
Their first son was born in 2009, a year during which he and his friends founded an association that works to promote the status of the Druze community in Israel.
In 2010, he joined the "Acharai" association and began guiding a group in Kfar Hurfeish, after he made sure that the association began to operate in the Druze villages in order to encourage the youth to enlist.
In 2013, his second son was born.
The head of Military Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliwa, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: "For some time now we have been turning the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Khairuddin, a hero of Israel.
We finished our work and came to the conclusion that there was no security impediment to publishing his name and photo.
He also deserves it, his family and his children," he noted.
"Exceptional educator and leader"
"Thanks to many operations, he is no less than a hero in my eyes," said Maj. Gen. Haliwa.
"He has made a significant contribution, which has courage and composure, to the State of Israel.
He deserves to be given the right place for him."
He added: "I didn't know him personally, but he was an exceptional educator, educator and leader – not only on the operational side, but also in his values."
Maj. Gen. Haliva noted that later he would also consider whether to publish a photo of another hero, Lt. Col. Emanuel Moreno of Sayeret Matkal, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and whose photo was not allowed to be published.
The attack in Khan Yunis took place on November 11, 2018.
The operation was the culmination of many months of meticulous preparations in which the intelligence community took part.
The command squad of the operation included then-Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, the head of Military Intelligence at the time, Maj. Gen. Tamir Heiman, and the head of the Shin Bet at the time, Nadav Argaman.
The purpose of the operation has not yet been made public, and the IDF stressed that it was an invaluable intelligence operation.
However, in the Arab media, communication equipment was presented in retrospect that the Palestinians said was left behind by the forces.
According to Hamas, the operation was intended to bury listening devices.
According to reports, on the day of the incident, the force was traveling in two vehicles.
The fighters were arrested at a checkpoint set up by Hamas operatives, and something in their behavior aroused the suspicion of Hamas operatives.
The activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.
The interrogation in the field lasted about 45 minutes, during which it became increasingly aggressive.
When the force realized that it was in a problematic situation, Lt. Col. Khair a-Din managed to distract the Hamas members, and in a split second, the force's commander, Lt. Col. A., managed to open fire.
Three Hamas members were killed in the fire, and unfortunately also Lt. Col. Khair a-Din.
Ten months after the terrible incident, the Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, decided to accept the recommendation of the Commendation Committee and award the Chief of Staff Commendation to three of the fighters in the incident deep inside the Gaza Strip – including the late Lt. Col. Khair al-Din.
The commander of the combat force and another soldier on the team also received commendations.
The army said in a statement at the time that Lt. Col. M. received the commendation for "his activity in the operation with his team, in enemy territory, with determination, composure and courage, to protect his comrades.
Later, he acted out of initiative and striving for contact, took a forward role in the takeover of the enemy, and acted resourcefully to promote the takeover.
Consider Switching from Tweezer Promotions to Large-Scale Operations
Israel must ask itself, once again, whether it is wrong to change policy vis-à-vis the Jenin sector.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set the West Bank on fire, but it is possible that the armed men of Jenin would leave it with no choice.
The stormy weekend we went through shows that even though the month of Ramadan is behind us, the terrain is still more volatile than ever.
It will take a lot of effort and common sense to safely cross the two upcoming memorial dates: Nakba Day, which falls today (Sunday), and Jerusalem Day, which will be marked in two weeks.
Quite a few parties will stand by in an attempt to torpedo a return to sanity.
Above all, as always, are the terrorist elements, who are concentrating a special effort in an attempt to maintain the violent atmosphere of the past few weeks.
Evidence of this was given during the arrest operation in which a Special Operations Unit fighter, the late Sgt. Noam Raz, was killed the day before.
Fighters who participated in the battle in Jenin testified that they do not recall such a scale of shooting and violence – evidence not only of the enormous amount of weapons available on the ground, but also of the willingness to use them.
This requires Israel to ask itself, once again, whether it is wrong to change policy vis-à-vis the Jenin sector, and move from small, intelligence-based tweezer operations to a large-scale, mass-based operation.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank and the entire arena. Even now, the security establishment prefers to act selectively, when necessary, in order to avoid a conflagration, but it is possible that the armed men of Jenin will leave it no choice.
Draw the lessons for future events.
Raz's death in battle is the best answer Israel can give to anyone who claims to have deliberately killed Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.
Operational activity is a dangerous matter for those who participate in it, and for those who are present in the arena.
The IDF takes enormous risks to its forces in order to avoid harming innocent people as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it with the lives of combatants.
This indicates high morality, but it also has operational-intelligence value: a terrorist caught alive – as happened yesterday in Jenin – is an excellent source of information about weapons, terror attacks and other terrorists. This is information that cannot usually be obtained in any other way, and can be used to thwart future attacks.
The IDF acted correctly when it published its interim investigation into Abu Akleh's death on Tuesday, and clarified that it was not possible to determine at this stage who caused her death.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful that it will be possible to reach an unequivocal bottom line in the affair.
In any case, it seems that nothing will convince those who are convinced: the world has already rushed to condemn Israel without bothering to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terror – the original pretext on whose behalf the IDF is constantly operating in Jenin.
As always, it's the nature of such stories to die.
World public opinion is busy and moving on, certainly as the war in Ukraine continues to rage many times more intensely.
Therefore, it is a shame that Israel insisted on giving the affair of Abu Akleh's death more unnecessary moments of exposure, with the police's unsuccessful handling of her funeral.
Even if Abu Akleh's family did not meet the preliminary agreements, one should have expected a little more restraint from the policemen who accompanied the funeral procession, and certainly less excited by the Palestinian flags that were waved there.
The responsibility requires: to act to calm the situation.
The Minister of Public Security and the Police Commissioner did well to order an investigation into the incident.
It seems that it lacked sufficient preparation and clear instructions, but it is disturbing that this is the second time this has happened to the police in a short time, and in two different districts.
In the Dizengoff attack, too, the police failed to manage the incident, isolate the scene and handle the media.
The commission of inquiry would do well not only to analyze the conduct of the police at the funeral itself, but also to draw lessons and conclusions that will enable a more successful handling of similar incidents in the future.
Alongside the internal handling of the police, it is also necessary to take into account the conduct of elected officials who have lost their way and direction.
The Israeli Knesset currently has a number of members who appear to be a danger to democracy.
They are on the left and the right, and they are exploiting their immunity not to challenge the state, but to harm it.
Knesset member Ofer Kassif is the latest example of this; If no measures are taken against him – including prosecution for assaulting a police officer – the state will implicitly encourage the next elected official to further radicalize his actions.
Such moves, which are defensive democracy, are essential in the volatility of this period, with elements seeking to exploit the situation for political purposes in the background.
Anyone with common sense is expected to rise above all of these and act to calm the situation; Otherwise, Israel could quickly descend into escalation with enemies from the outside, and worse still, with rivals at home.
Senior police official: "What is needed here is a government policy and setting goals"
The Israel Police has launched an operation to eradicate the phenomenon of illegal aliens, but there is still a long way to go.
There is no single entity in the State of Israel today that integrates this whole issue."
"If we want to deal with the phenomenon of illegal aliens, a government policy is required, from which goals, tasks and responsibilities must be derived.
Today, there is not a single entity in the State of Israel that integrates this whole issue," a senior police official told Israel Hayom.
Until a month and a half ago, before the escalation of the security situation, the phenomenon was manifested in about 20,000 to 30,000 undocumented immigrants entering the fence every day.
In addition, between 100,000 and 110,000 Palestinians with work permits enter Israel every day through 34 supervised crossings.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each industry is limited by the quota set by the political echelon in accordance with the security, economic, and political situation in the State of Israel.
The permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Administration.
In light of this, undocumented immigrants are not necessarily Palestinians whose entry is prohibited due to criminal involvement or connection to attacks, but in many cases they are Palestinians whose entry is prohibited because they do not meet the permitted permit quota.
It should be emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Elad were considered undocumented terrorists, but they were not supervised, because they had not previously committed any criminal offense that required the security forces to supervise their movements.
"Therefore, there is no significance for them to enter through breaches in the fence," says a senior security source, "Anyone who wants to carry out an attack can also enter the country through the supervised crossings, and there have been such cases in the past.
Thousands of arrests
Following the attack in Elad and in light of the numerous warnings of terror attacks, the police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal aliens.
By the end of the week, about 16,000 undocumented immigrants had been arrested.
Of these, about 600 were interrogated and criminal cases were opened, and about 200 were imprisoned.
According to police prosecution policy, proceedings against an illegal alien are carried out only against repeat offenders or people who repeat the act repeatedly (recidivists).
An illegal alien who was arrested for the first time is interrogated, documented and returned to the Occupied Territories.
Sometimes this is repeated the second time, but only the third time is he arrested, imprisoned, and indicted for illegal presence.
According to the law, if an illegal alien is caught within a range of about 50 to 100 meters from each side of the separation fence, he is dealt with by the military prosecution.
Data obtained by Israel Hayom shows that in 2021, the police dealt with 40,010 illegal aliens, transporters and lodgers.
7,405 illegal aliens were arrested and 19,533 criminal cases were opened.
The number of employers, transporters and complainers handled by the police in 2021 was 6,537.
469 were arrested, and 5,640 criminal cases were opened.
"The foundations of the undocumented phenomenon do not depend on the police, not on the IDF, not on Israeli society and on Palestinian society.
They depend on other factors," says a senior law enforcement official.
"In order to deal with the phenomenon, their motivation to go out to work in Israel must be uprooted, and the Israeli side must exact a price from them that will prevent them from crossing the fence.
Sources involved in the matter claim that the non-collection of the price is due, among other things, to a lack of places of detention and to the fact that arrests are made only when there are accompanying offenses or when there are recidivists.
Legal sources claim that the decision to charge the price of the unpaid security bond was made, among other things, because the courts cannot cope with the number of arrests made every day.
Anyone who examines the punishment will find that it is not deterrent."
There is great complexity
"He is a complex person," says a police source.
He could be the father of a family who came to Israel to work in order to earn a few shekels and come back.
This is the basic platform, on which many types of undocumented persons who enter the country to commit criminal offenses or carry out terror attacks are dressed."
The undocumented person can be an adult or a minor.
In the past, 16-year-olds were caught by the police illegally, and even children aged 8 and 10 were sent by their parents to intersections on the roads, in order to earn a few shekels a day from drivers.
"It also makes the matter complicated, because in such cases we have to bring the parents and indict them for neglect," says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel as manual laborers.
The most unusual are electrical work or advanced construction work.
In the past, there were also local authorities that employed undocumented people in garbage disposal, mainly in the north.
Out of 34 crossings, there are about 18 main crossings.
There are crossings of vehicles and goods, there are crossings through which only people pass, and there are crossings that are both.
All crossings are supervised by the IDF and the Crossings Authority.
The undocumented people are usually transported into the country by private drivers, as they are easy money.
"There are those who do this for a living and there are gangs whose main occupation is transporting undocumented people," says a senior police official, "Usually most of them are Israeli Arabs, who speak the same language and correspond with them.
It can reach 100 shekels to 300 shekels per person.
Registered companies don't deal with this, because if the company is caught, it is doomed to close."
The police emphasize that under certain conditions, transporting undocumented vehicles can be considered an offense.
"A taxi driver who works with licenses in accordance with licenses and insurances, who collects Palestinians at designated points and at fixed hours, including an orderly reservation, is not breaking the law," says a senior police official, "Anyone who knows that he is transporting illegal aliens usually picks them up in the middle of the night at hiding points, including dropping off at hidden spots.
Most of these guys drive a car from Chokmak because they know that their car is being stolen, so they prefer to drive in an old car."

IDF, Shin Bet and Border Police forces arrested 13 wanted persons throughout Judea and Samaria on Wednesday night.
The forces operated in a number of locations throughout the Judea and Samaria Division to arrest wanted persons, including in the village of Rashida and in the city of Nablus.
In the activity of the combatants in the city of Jenin in the area of the Menashe Regional Brigade, two wanted persons suspected of terrorist activity were detained.
In addition, during the operation, an IDF force fired at a number of suspects who were throwing IEDs at them, and gunfire was heard in the area.
A hit was identified.
The director of the hospital in Jenin where the terrorist was evacuated, Maher Mar'i, 25, from the Jenin refugee camp, reports that he was shot by IDF fire, which led to his death.

In addition, arrests were also made in the village of Silwad, east of Ramallah, and three students from the Western Wall al-Islamiya, a Hamas-affiliated list at Anjah University in Nablus, which has recently been the scene of violent clashes with Fatah students and members of the security forces on campus.
"We need to open a criminal investigation against her": Haifa city comptroller on serious allegations against Einat Kalish Rotem
The city comptroller's report presents an alleged concern about the criminal conduct of Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former senior municipal officials and political rivals: surveillance of employees and inflated payment to an accountant firm for conducting investigations •
"The harsh findings that emerge from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation"
The Haifa Municipality did not respond.
Surveillance of municipal employees and political opponents and inflated payment to an accountant's office for conducting investigations, "at the expense of the public coffers."
Haifa Municipality Comptroller Ofer Tal's report, published yesterday (Tuesday), presents an alleged concern about criminal offenses committed by Mayor Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former senior municipal officials, municipal employees, and political opponents.
Kalish is suspected of meeting with the accounting firm Barlev & Co. and asked for an investigative audit.
The investigations were conducted under names and codes given to the former treasurer of the municipality, and a code name given to council member Sophie Nakash, and it was examined whether the tenders between the municipality and a company owned by Nakash's family were strictly kosher.
The comptroller's report also shows that there is disorder and a complete lack of control over the work of the accountant with whom Kalish met.
The municipal treasurer is the municipal entity whose role is to coordinate and synchronize the work of the accountant and the municipal departments, and the data collected by the accountant has not been transferred to him.
This has caused no one in the municipality to be aware of all the projects being carried out by the accountant, and what is the scope of work required in each of them.
Moreover, the hours reports submitted by the accountant were not approved in many cases as required.
A situation was created in which the scope of the issues in which the accountant was involved increased disproportionately, with a great deal of interference in the routine conduct of the municipality, without any supervision and follow-up by the municipality.
In conclusion of the report, the audit recommended that the unpaid payments to the accountant be halted, until material is received detailing his work on each of the issues he examined.
In addition, invoices submitted to the Haifa Municipality were under codes such as "gatekeepers", an information store, a fish shop, an investigative audit of the mayor and a procurement investigative audit report.
Shortly afterwards, the municipality's legal advisor, attorney Yamit Klein, noted that the mayor herself had signed the approval of the payment in her place.
"I have not been invited by any audit report and I do not know what it is about," she wrote.
It was also learned that the cost of the investigative audit is about NIS 2 million, of which NIS 1.5 million was paid, and about NIS 500,000 remains to be paid, from the tax money of the Haifa public.
Former Treasurer of the Municipality, Jacky Wakim, responded: "These despicable actions that were carried out for the purpose of tarnishing the name and name of elected officials at the expense of the public coffers and the Haifa taxpayer are a criminal offense."
Sophie Nakash, a member of the city council, said in her response: "The comptroller's report and the committee's recommendations speak for themselves."
Response of Attorney Sarit Golan, member of the Haifa City Council: The testimonies and the harsh findings that emerge from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in employing the consultant for investigative review to conduct investigations, some of which are doubtful whether they are permitted by law in the manner in which they were carried out, and in particular the investigations concerning the opposition council member to the mayor and former senior employees."
Lior Datz of the "Gatekeepers" association: "It seems that all the red lines that a public authority sends private investigators in order to collect information have been crossed against lawyers who represent an association that exposes corruption and while the association is conducting public proceedings against the Haifa Municipality administration."
The Haifa Municipality did not respond.
The firm of accountant Yehuda Barlev is not interested in commenting.
Gantz revealed: "Iran and Hezbollah worked together to harm UNIFIL activity in Lebanon"
The Minister of Defense participated in the International Cyber Conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that "Israel is familiar with the cyber systems of its adversaries and their modus operandi"
Gantz referred, among other things, to the footage of Al-Sayed in Hamas captivity: "A video aimed at extortion – on the back of a humanitarian issue" •
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: "We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems"
Defense Minister Benny Gantz spoke Wednesday morning at the International Cyber Conference of the Cyber Center at Tel Aviv University, where he revealed a joint attack by Iran and Hezbollah to attack UNIFIL forces in Lebanon, "another attack by Iran and Hezbollah on the citizens of Lebanon and the stability of the country," Gantz said.
Gantz referred to, among other things, the footage of Hisham Al-Sayed, a Hamas prisoner in Gaza, released by the terror organization's military wing: "Yesterday, a video was published aimed at extortion – on the back of a humanitarian issue.
Hamas is holding the four sons captive in violation of international law, in violation of morality.
Hamas is responsible for this, and our expectation from the international community is to act against this criminal conduct by Hamas."
He added, "The State of Israel is acting through a variety of means, and continues to turn over every stone in order to bring the boys home.
As we have said in the past – this is a humanitarian issue, this is how we see it, and we will continue to act on this basis.
Attempts at extortion and cognitive exercises will not affect our position and conduct."
Later, he revealed joint activity by Iran and Hezbollah: "Iran is also operating its proxies in the cyber dimension: I can reveal today that activity by Iranian security agencies in cooperation with Hezbollah has recently been detected in order to harm the activity of UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.
This was done by carrying out a cyber operation aimed at stealing materials about UNIFIL deployment in the area, and using them by Hezbollah.
This is another blow by Iran and Hezbollah to the Lebanese people and to Lebanon's stability."
"Israel is familiar with the cyber systems of its adversaries and their modus operandi.
In recent years, we have seen a phenomenon of hacker groups on behalf of Iran, which are operating against Israel and other countries," Gantz continued.
"The 'new shluchim' are terrorists with a keyboard who are doomed like fighters of other terrorist organizations.
We know who they are, we are harming them and their senders, and even today they are in our sights – and not just in the cyber dimension.
No attack against the citizens of Israel will be on the agenda.
And the responsibility lies with the attackers and with the state that finances and sends them.
Cyber attacks can be responded to in a variety of ways in cyberspace and in other areas."
Gantz continued his attack on the nuclear power: "Iran is leading cyber terrorism – and is taking steps aimed at influencing democratic processes and governments, as happened in the US presidential elections and other attempts that Israel is aware of.
Operations such as that of the Shahid Kava unit, which collected information on ships, gas stations, and industrial plants in a number of countries, were carried out under the direct direction of the Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards, as revealed in the investigations."
He added, "In recent years, we have stopped many attempts to hack into private and public companies, in Israel and abroad.
I also call on the public to demand 'cyber responsibility,' and to punish companies and entities that do not act in accordance with the guidelines."
Gantz went on to outline Israel's following goals in the face of the threats: "Our supreme mission, in the army, in the industries and in the various security organizations is to build the people, train them, and keep them.
The Chief of Staff and I have set this issue as one of the main tasks in the relevant units.
We are constantly examining force buildup – both in terms of manpower, training and missions.
In the coming years, we will also have to examine the way cyber warfare is organized, managed, and operated, with its offensive and defensive characteristics in the IDF and the entire defense establishment."
Finally, the defense minister concluded and called for cooperation with the world: "Our cooperation with the world vis-à-vis Iran is of great importance in the cyber dimension as well.
The same cooperation that we are building in the region with Iran in terms of defense against various threats – we are also expanding in the cyber dimension."
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: "We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems."
Uri, deputy commander of Unit 8200, said at the unit's first public appearance at such conferences, revealing that Israel had thwarted an attack on the water systems.
"Neutralizing cyber threats is a central part of our activity.
Our goal is to achieve superiority over the attacker, to succeed in identifying him and to act to negate his capabilities," said the deputy commander of 8200, adding, "This is how sometimes we also find victims outside of Israel, and then we contact other agencies if necessary.
We do this both independently and by collaborating with industry and other agencies, through the implementation and use of the tools we have developed.
8200 will not rest until the threat is removed."
As mentioned, this is how the threat to Israel's water systems and the attempts to poison Israel's citizens were exposed: "We thwarted the attempt to take over Israel's critical water systems and poison them a few years ago.
In another case, we also identified that a certain adversary had attacked Israel, and in the process, we identified that the attacker was also trying to target power plants in the United States.
This was the first indication of this attack.
We have been able to prevent this threat through close cooperation with our American partners."
Watch: This is how the police are preparing to eliminate terrorists in the civilian population
The Jerusalem Border Police inaugurates a new "Assaf" facility that simulates shooting in a crowded crowd in response to the series of attacks that have taken place in recent months •
Border Police's Counter-Terrorism Guide to the Jerusalem Envelope: "The development provides a relevant response to the reference threats and simulates the reality on the ground"
A glimpse of the "Assaf" facility
Preparing for the next attack: A series of terror attacks carried out in the spring by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, during which 19 people were murdered and about 70 civilians were injured, led the Border Police to develop a unique technique that trains fighters to attack terrorists within a civilian population and shoot at traffic.
Israel Hayom Exposed: A Glimpse of the Assaf Facility
Popular terrorism focuses on harming civilians and aims to undermine the sense of security necessary for the proper conduct of the civilian population.
The severe wave of terror attacks that took place this year, with attacks in Beersheba, Hadera, Bnei Brak, Ariel and Elad, and especially the one that took place in early April on the busy Dizengoff Street in the heart of Tel Aviv, by a terrorist who was assimilated into the crowd, led the police to think creatively in order to develop a tool that could be used to train fighters to attack terrorists within the civilian population.
The work of thinking was led by the Training Division of the Police and the Border Police.
They participated in a competition in the various police districts under the title "Commanders Leading Learning", in which each district was required to develop measures that would help improve the policing and combat skills of the fighters, policemen and commanders.
As part of the competition, and in response to the need for Border Police fighters to practice combat in traffic shooting training and in such scenarios, Assaf Ben David, a counter-terrorism instructor of the Jerusalem Envelope Border Police, developed the "Assaf Facility", which consists of a dynamic target, which is attached to a telescopic pole on which a carrier is mounted that can be harnessed to the instructor.
Their servant guides the carrier to death, he can practice the warrior standing in front of him by controlling and moving the target to different sides and ranges.
It should be emphasized that in recent years, Border Police fighters have dealt with many terror attacks, in which the assailant shoots and poses a threat while moving in arenas saturated with innocent civilians.
The "Assaf Facility", in its current version, is based on components and parts that are used in various fields.
For example, the telescopic rod that was upgraded and integrated into the facility was taken from the field of maintenance and cleaning.
Using the device, it is possible to simulate shooting in motion within a civilian population towards a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the object, handling traffic impairments, choosing a path of progress, selective firing, including practicing preventing harm to non-combatants.
Sgt. Assaf Ben David, after whom the facility is named, says: "The facility we developed is a breakthrough in the study and training of fighters and policemen.
The development provides a relevant response to the reference threats and simulates the reality on the ground.
The benefit of development compared to the relatively cheap cost of production gives us a significant advantage in the competition."
The State Comptroller warns: "The Central Elections Committee is not prepared for cyber threats"
At the International Cyber Week, Matanyahu Engelman warned of Israel's lack of preparedness for attacks by hackers
"World War III will be a hacker war, but the world is not prepared for it."
State Comptroller Matanyahu Engelman participated today (Wednesday) in Tel Aviv University's annual cyber conference and expressed concern about cyber attacks on Israel.
"We are exposed.
Our data is visible to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our health is exposed, our security is exposed.
World War III will be a cyber war, but the world is not prepared for it."
Engelman said that as part of the cyber audits conducted by his firm, significant deficiencies were found: "Over the past year, we have conducted penetration tests at the Traffic Management Center in Jerusalem, hospitals and the Tax Authority's systems.
In the audits, we found significant deficiencies, including the fact that very few penetration tests were carried out by public bodies, and some of them conducted penetration tests only during the audit.
In addition, deficiencies arose in the Central Elections Committee's preparedness for cyber threats."
"We in the State Comptroller's Office are committed to continuing to address this significant issue more vigorously, for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world," he concluded.
High aim: "I came to Hapoel Jerusalem to win titles"
The choice of the Reds: "From the first moment they showed me that they want me, I am built to lead a big team" •
Returning to the Israeli national team after four years: "I felt I had a place, I want to be on the EuroBasket squad"
And the time at Maccabi Tel Aviv: "I learned to concentrate only on what I control" •
Oz Blazer in an interview.
Oz Blazer will travel today with the players of the Israeli national team to Poland, where they will meet the local team in the qualifiers for the 2023 World Championship (Thursday, 21:30 Israel time).
Three days later, the team will host Estonia at the Shlomo Group Arena.
In parallel with the intensive training with the national team, Blazer also dealt with his future last week, until he signed a two-year contract with Hapoel Jerusalem.
"I have peace of mind now that I found a team," he told Israel Hayom in his first special interview since the signing.
"I'm a little stressed now because I have to move with my family after we settled in the central region and it's not easy, but there are no more phones and professionally I'm much more relaxed."
You haven't been on the national team for four years, how happy are you to be back, and how much do you want to play in the next two games?
"First of all, I want to have fun in the national team and I come with the attitude of contributing as much as I can, whether it's from my experience or on the field.
Of course I'd love to play, but when you get to the national team, everyone has to put their egos aside and do everything for the team to succeed.
I'm here for what they will need from me."
Now you are 14 players, and Danny Avdija will join the European Championship, Gabi Chachashvili will return, and maybe there will be more changes.
Have you made it a goal to be on the squad for the championship?
"I'd love to be on the field and contribute."
The 29-year-old Blazer (1.99m) has played for Maccabi Tel Aviv for the past two years.
When the season ended, it was clear that he would not continue in yellow, and after a few weeks he moved to the capital, preferring the Jerusalemites to Hapoel Holon.
You had other offers, why did you choose Hapoel Jerusalem?
"They showed a very great willingness for me to be there, so there were relatively easy negotiations.
As soon as I felt a connection with the management and with the coach, I realized that this was the right place for me.
The situation also seems good and suitable to me.
I come to lead and be a significant part of the team.
I've talked to the coach and he has a mentality of hard work and winning, and that's exactly what I'm bringing.
I've always loved playing at the Arena, because I get energized even when the crowd is against me, and now they're on my side it's going to be even better.
I'm sure there will be a committed and fun team and I wanted to be a part of it."
Elaborate a bit on your conversation with coach Dzikic.
"Professionally, he believes in a lot of movement without the ball, he plans to bring good morals with a high basketball IQ and wants a very intense team.
He believes in high energy in defense and offense and with the crowd at the Arena it can succeed."
I looked at your career and saw that you stay in every team for at least two years, if not more.
Do you feel that you can stay in Jerusalem for a few years as well?
"Everywhere I go, I like to connect and give everything, and people appreciate that.
From the moment I signed in Jerusalem, my phone kept ringing and beeping.
I've received a lot of messages that are already waiting for me.
So I believe that a good period awaits us."
Do you think Jerusalem can be a more significant player than Maccabi Tel Aviv?
How do you sum up your two years at Maccabi Tel Aviv?
"Unfortunately, there were things that were out of my control last season.
Everyone saw that I remained a professional all along, no matter how much I received - I always gave everything.
I'm proud of the path I've taken over the past year, and now everyone is going their own way."
If it were up to you, would you like to stay at Maccabi?
"After the past year, it was clear to both sides that we were heading in the direction of separation, but that's part of the business.
Towards the end of the season I was a little hurt in minutes and my status dropped, even though I had a great time in the middle of the year, but they decided to go in other directions.
After I understood the situation there, I realized that it was less of the place for me.
Hapoel Jerusalem is the best option for me, so I chose it."
Finally, what are your goals for the upcoming season?
"There was a lot of talk about what happened in the cup semi-finals last season when I shouted to Ami Biton (Maccabi Tel Aviv's team manager) 'That's what I'm here for,' so that's why I came to Jerusalem – to win titles."

All or nothing: 1:1 between Hapoel Jerusalem and Hapoel Hadera
Guy Hadida scored an own goal in the 33rd minute but managed to make amends with an equalizer 10 minutes later •
Later, the midfielder was sent off with a questionable red (74) •
Hadera also remained with 10 players following a red for Ido Levy (87)
The professional staff of Hapoel Jerusalem Sefer tonight (Saturday night) has done well the number of foreigners on the grass at Teddy's, much more than once, it should be noted, and at a certain point they even discovered one less player (Guy Hadida was sent off).
This time, to their delight, everything was fine, and the 1:1 they achieved against Hapoel Hadera will not be taken away from them by the Association's court.
Before the red that Hadida conceded, he managed to score an own goal and equalize to arrange a precious point for Ziv Aryeh.
Already in the 33rd minute, Guy Hadida's private show began.
Falkoschenko raised his head to the wide, and the midfielder rose and slammed backwards and the ball was stopped in his team's net.
0:1 to Hadera which benefited from an own goal by the midfielder.
Ten minutes after the own goal, Hadida managed to correct and in a huge way - Levkovich caught the air and this time the midfielder hit the right net and exposed.
1:1 at Teddy.
In the 74th minute, Hadida also managed to register a second yellow and a red, this time after sliding in the direction of Mermantini.
Daniel Bar-Natan decided on a questionable red and sent the midfielder straight for an early shower.
In the 87th minute, Bar Natan also sent Ido Levy red and balanced the balance of power on the grass as well.
Recovery Department: Eilat defeated Holon
60:85
Ariel Beit Halahmi's team compiled a third win in a row, this time especially impressive •
Huber and Schuchman (15 each) excelled
Hapoel Eilat's recovery journey continued tonight (Saturday) with an impressive 85:60 victory over Hapoel Holon on the way to a season 3:0 record in the meetings between the two.
Since dropping to last place, Ariel Beit Halahmi's team has already won three in a row, and in fact, this is only a surprise for those who did not witness the game.
We haven't seen Holon so bad in a long time.
All this before the series opener against Besiktas in the Champions Cup playoffs: only 60 points, a first half without a three-pointer and 11 percent for three in the entire game.
The bottom line is that not an impressive night for all the team's players (except for Murphy Manco, who scored Holon's 3 three-pointers), including the safe stock Chris Johnson.
On the other side, Eilat is in very good shape thanks to Roy Huber and Joaquin Schuchman (15 pts each).
The first has returned to itself in recent times and the second has returned to bloom and also stunned with a basket from three quarters of the court.
Give them a chance: Maccabi Tel Aviv's Israelis saved Sfairopoulos
After losing in the derby and an eighth in a row in Europe, a defeat in the Clásico against Jerusalem - apparently, would have ended the long romance between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Greek coach •
So who does Giannis have to send a bouquet of flowers tonight?
To his Israeli team, which was responsible for 42 critical points at the Arena •
Also: Why the Yellow Club needs to change its 'Americanization strategy' and take a living example from the model of Ariel Beit Halahmi in Eilat
It's hard to stay cynical at the sight of the teary eyes and the warm, strong hugs that Giannis Sfairopoulos gave to his players at the end of tonight's game at the Arena, and especially in the face of the tight grip and the exchange of secrets with John DiBartolomeo, who with his own hands saved the Greek coach's job, and perhaps the entire season.
Because after losing at home in the derby and an eighth in a row in Europe, to lose the Clásico to Jerusalem and move away from it to three wins in the table?
That would have ended the Israeli-Greek affair tonight.
So in the meantime, he's with us, and he has a lot to learn from this game, also, and in fact, mainly about the Euroleague.
First, Maccabi Tel Aviv came with a radical change in their attacking habits and moving the ball.
The ball moved passively, with a lot of movement and drills, and Scottie Wilbekin, demonstratively, left the task of concentration to Evans, dribbled very little, and mostly went over blocks and went out for shots.
Despite scoring very badly (2-9 FG), Wilbekin contributed on defense, and most of all, Maccabi suddenly looked like a team, and the other players scored.
However, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in the brain, the team returned to old habits, and the attacks went back to dribbling and shelling, and in the most critical attack, with a lead of 2 and 40 seconds to go, Scotty dribbled himself into a half corner and threw a floater on one foot that almost lost the game.
The trick is to keep playing drills and passing movements in the clutch moments, and this must enter nature and the team's DNA.
The important learning will be made by Giannis and the club regarding the use of Israelis.
Those who became water pumpers and towel waving at games in Europe.
Tonight they scored for the coach who stopped believing in them for more than half of the team's points (42 out of 83), and they were the ones who kept the game alive at the end.
Four of Maccabi's top five scorers were its Israelis.
And don't say that Israel is not Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can help in the Euroleague as well.
In the first half it was mainly Oz Blazer, who has been screaming for a month that he has to play more.
Scorer, passer, fighter under the basket (7 rebounds), 2 meters of defensive determination and game wisdom.
Isn't that enough?
In the second half, Jake Cohen starred, with excellent percentages from all ranges, composure from the line, and cover for the injury of Žižić, and especially John Dee, who changed the momentum with 5 consecutive points in a 70:63 situation for Jerusalem.
Yiftach Ziv has a complex relationship, and it seems that sometimes he gives him too much credit, and puts too much pressure on him, to the point of risking losing.
It happens in the Euroleague as well, and it happened tonight as well.
But the important learning should be that of the club, regarding its strategy of Americanization.
Fact: The senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.
Tomer Ginat and Yam Madar went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Rafi Manco returned to Holon, and now Noam Dovrat is choosing Jerusalem, or maybe he was rejected by Maccabi.
And this is happening because Maccabi is gradually leaving fewer places for Israelis, because of the club's informed and deep-rooted choice to be based on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where there will be no Israelis who want to play in it, and then it will look for Jewish children to become citizens, and will put pressure on the administration/union to increase the number of foreigners even more.
But this is a fateful mistake on the part of the club.
And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that it is exaggerating with the foreigners, a lot because of the tax discount.
It is certainly not claimed that the Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.
So instead of spending the same money on one star and eight other mediocre ones, you can have five excellent ones.
For example, this season, with the money of Williams, Nunnally, Evans, Reynolds and Taylor, it was possible to bring in two efficient and stable stars (star point guard and super forward) next to Scotty and Zizic.
It will be more efficient, it will be more correct, it will be more Israeli, it will be more beautiful and interesting and it will generate identification.
It's true that there are two busy frameworks and a long season - so you have to trust your Israelis.
And also because you are an Israeli group, which claims to represent Israel, and even receives tax breaks from the state for its so-called representation in Europe.
The Basketball Association/League Administration can help Maccabi, and return to sanity with a number of foreigners adapted to the Israeli league.
6 on the roster, 4 on the form, a maximum of three on the pitch at the same time.
Is it for the ongoing failed achievements (for seven years in Europe), only for Maccabi, that the league is flooded with foreigners?
And the players' union, what about you?
That's why you shut down?
There were two Israelis on the field, and now there is one?
Like George Costanza in the Seinfeld pilot.
Bargain to get less?
The previous Russian law was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for Maccabi.
And if anyone needed reinforcement in the aforementioned direction, Hapoel Eilat came in the early game and explained it so well.
With 3 foreigners, and 4 other Israelis who were only two in the junior teams (Huber, Ben Moshe, Roina and Schuchman the fighter), they dismantled Holon (second in the table!) for the second time in the last two weeks.
It's a tradition in Eilat to play well with three foreigners, because there was a run like this in the days of Dan Shamir and a lot in the days of Sharon Drucker.
Short Eilat is simply a more balanced and efficient team, and there is no one like Ariel Beit Halahmi, who started in the open courts in Givat Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us of what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everyone is at the peak of their fitness, everyone plays together, and all Israelis are learning and improving their game.
The foreigners are just making up.
When Ben Carter and Casey Prather return from knee injuries, it will be a great team.
A song I dreamed of about Eilat.
And that Maccabi can learn from him about the right direction.
Yellow celebrations: "There was a feeling that the whole world was against us"
The Yellows are happy after the 83-78 win over Hapoel Jerusalem at the Arena: "We are back to playing the way Maccabi Tel Aviv should play" •
About Ami Biton's conversation in the dressing room, the first optimistic diagnosis of Žižić's injury and the management's approval of the acquisition.
A great sense of relief was recorded this morning (Sunday) among the Maccabi Tel Aviv staff after yesterday's important and prestigious 78:83 win over Hapoel Jerusalem.
The team's players and management members hugged coach Giannis Sfairopoulos, who looked very excited at the end.
Yiftach Ziv and Oz Blazer poured water with enthusiasm on Derrick Williams, who excelled in the game, and the rest of the club also smiled a big smile of happiness that showed how much pressure was released after the recent losing streak.
They, too, were afraid of defeat against the great rival that would further undermine the system.
The fans also stayed for long minutes to celebrate in the stands.
"There is an amazing connection between us and Giannis in the locker room," said Oz Blazer.
"We know that the situation was not easy for him either, a lot of pressure was released.
We waited a lot for it, even the way we played.
We are back to playing the way Maccabi Tel Aviv should play, with a heart and fighting, we stand behind it.
He gave us motivational conversations and talked to us."
Before the game, team manager Ami Biton entered the dressing room and gave moving words to the players.
"His words had a great impact on how we came out and how we played on the floor," Maccabi players said.
Despite the great joy, Maccabi is already aiming for the important game against Baskonia on Thursday and wants to break the long losing streak in the Euroleague.
"I believe this game will change the momentum for us," Blazer added.
"We lost a lot of games at the end and this time they led a few minutes to the end and we didn't break.
"In the last games we were under a lot of pressure, Giannis told us that if we were released we would win these games.
I believe that this victory will take us forward.
A lot of eyes were on us and it was the feeling of the whole world against us, I'm proud to go out to this war, we're cutting off everything around us and looking only at ourselves."
Ante Žižić, who injured his right knee during the last quarter, was examined by the medical staff in the locker room and the initial diagnosis was not serious.
Doctors will check how the knee will react today and then find out how many days of rest it will need to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will be fit for Baskonia.
In addition to the strong backing given by the management to Sfairopoulos and the professional staff, in a meeting held on Thursday, professional manager Nikola Vujcic was given the green light to bring in one or two players to strengthen the team, and the Yellows hope to add quality acquisitions soon.
Anthony Bennett was released from Hapoel Jerusalem
The forward, who was selected first in the NBA Draft, was unable to acclimatize to a team from the capital.
The club said goodbye: "Anthony entered the hearts of all of us, we thank him for his time at Hapoel."
About four months after signing with Hapoel Jerusalem, Anthony Bennett was released today (Sunday) from the team's roster.
The forward (28, 2.03), who was selected first in the 2013 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, averaged 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five Champions League games, as well as 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in eight games in the Premier League.
"Hapoel Jerusalem and player Anthony Bennett announce that they have reached a joint decision to terminate the player's contract at the club," the club said, "Anthony has entered the hearts of all of us and we would like to thank him for his time at Hapoel.
We wish him nothing but good luck."
Study determines: Zoom meetings hurt creativity
About 2,100 engineers and academics around the world were asked to develop solutions to the problem – some in video meetings, some in face-to-face meetings.
The result: a virtual meeting harms creativity and out-of-the-box thinking.
Columbia University Research Leader: "The visual focus on the screen impairs the idea generation process" •
Nechama Porta: There is no harm to work productivity or critical thinking.
A large scientific study recently published in the scientific journal Nature examined the effect of video meetings on the creativity of their participants, compared to face-to-face meetings.
Unfortunately, creativity has been found to be impaired in virtual meetings through screens.
The research question, led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University, was whether remote computer-assisted meetings preserve the creativity that exists in office brainstorming sessions, or whether the level of creativity and free thinking decreases as a result of distance.
The study itself began in 2016 but received a major boost during the two years of COVID-19, during which many employees switched to working from home.
"People in an in-person meeting move around the room, use objects and use them to think creatively," Brooks says.
"In a computer session, on the other hand, the concentration in maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative activity in the brain.
The visual focus on the screen reduces cognition.
People are more focused on video when interacting, which hurts the broader and expansive idea generation process."
The space is reduced.
To test the results of the experiment and see if they would be repeated, they were tested twice—once at Columbia University and once in real life—on engineers who knew each other from an early acquaintance.
At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty members and students into two parts – in one the subjects were asked to meet in person and develop solutions to the problem, and in the second, they were asked to do so through a computer.
At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to share a similar pattern and solve a problem presented to them in a new way.
In both cases, a decrease in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking was found among those who met virtually.
Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher who deals with ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.
In his opinion, as part of a thinking activity, people usually look at their surroundings to help generate ideas, whereas in a video meeting, the thinking converges on the screen and does not expand in a way that allows for creativity.
"When the people are in the same room, they look around them and see the space, where there are objects and situations that can evoke new associations in them.
On the other hand, research shows that computer-generated relationships change our attention so that we are more focused inward and on the screen, and this way reduces innovation and the generation of ideas by looking at the environment and thinking outward."
There is no harm to critical thinking.
However, before managers run employees back into the office, the researchers note that "working through a computer did not harm productivity itself or people's critical thinking about innovative proposals, when they had to choose the best idea from a set of ideas.
In other words, the damage is focused only on creativity and not on other forms of working in front of a computer."
Prof. Alan Langer, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, also qualifies the findings.
According to her, "There's a difference between just creativity, like new uses for Frisbee (one of the research questions; A.G.) and solutions of work.
It's also possible that when employees are more relaxed after getting to know each other, or when they're working from home, creativity will improve."
Both Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson have also proposed future research in which such meetings would be interrupted into thinking states and wandering around the room to see how this activity would affect the final outcome.
Dr. Olson also suggested that following the study, employees would return to work only for brainstorming sessions, and as a rule, he suggested not to panic from one study, but to conduct another investigation in the field.
"I wouldn't want workers to be forcibly reinstated and not happy, it's a bigger harm," he says.
Musk awaits Trump's return: "It was not right to block him"
Twitter's new buyer said he would reverse the decision that led to the banning of the former US president's account •
"I think it was a mistake," he admitted.
Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk, who recently bought Twitter in a deal valued at $44 billion, said Tuesday that he intends to bring Trump back to the social network, which blocked him while he was president, after riots by his supporters on Capitol Hill after losing the election to Democratic candidate Joe Biden.
"I do think it was wrong to arrest Donald Trump.
I think it was a mistake," he said.
"If there are wrong and bad tweets, they should be deleted or made invisible, and a suspension — a temporary suspension — is appropriate, but not permanent," Musk clarified.
By 2050: The world will lose 80% of the water available for agriculture
A new global study predicts a significant decline in the next 25 years.
The Solution: Proper Management of Water Reservoirs
A new and disturbing study recently published in the journal Earth's Future predicts that by 2050, the amount of water available for agriculture will decrease by about 80% if the rate of water consumption and the growth of the world's population remain at their current usage trends.
In the study, in which scientists from all the world's science agencies participated, the scientists summarized the total amount of rainwater, rivers, and freshwater sources in the world and compared it to humanity's need for agriculture.
The dismal conclusions of the study show that the rate of water consumption has now doubled again and again over the past 10 years, while at the same time global warming is causing a decrease in the amount of rainfall in agricultural areas around the world.
According to the refinement of the research data, 84% of the land designated for agriculture in the world will experience a severe shortage of rainwater.
One of the main conclusions that emerged from the study calls on farmers around the world to adapt agriculture to climate change and the seasons, and to switch to growing methods that will make it easier for water to penetrate the soil in order to prevent the process of water evaporation, which will lead to extensive waste of rainwater.
The researchers also recommend that farmers working near saltwater sources use rainwater harvesting technologies to prevent it from flowing into the sea.
Information about many students from Bar-Ilan University has been leaked to the Internet
Hackers who attacked Bar-Ilan University's database a few weeks ago threatened to publish the information about the students if they did not receive a ransom.
The threat was realized and the information was published throughout the network.
Students at Bar-Ilan University are under attack by hackers when their personal information was published across the web by a network attacker known as Darkrypt, who a few weeks ago published a ransom demand from university officials and threatened that if he was not paid an unclear sum of money, he would publish the information under his control.
Estimates regarding the amount of money demanded by the attacker are that it started at thousands of dollars, and as the clock ticked down, it increased, and before the information was published, it had already reached several million dollars.
Facebook groups of university students and faculty members are full of angry messages, and chaos reigns there, with students unable to access their personal information systems and unable to perform regular student assignments.
The university sent an e-mail announcing the attack on the academic institution and that they were working intensively to minimize the damage, while detailing some of the information that was leaked to the Internet.
No special instructions were given to those whose data was compromised, and it was said that the university had taken a series of actions to strengthen the security measures of the university's servers.
Good news for 40 localities: Fiber optics arrive in Binyamin
The trend of high-speed internet networking in the periphery continues, and now the optical fiber is reaching the Binyamin Council, which includes 40 localities.
The project, in cooperation with the council and the telecommunications companies Telran, X-Fiber and Rimon Internet, will be launched immediately after the holidays.
Over the weekend, the Binyamin Council signed a broad agreement of its kind for the installation of optical fibers in all the council's localities.
The agreement with the Net-Fiber project in cooperation with Rimon Internet, Telran and X-Fiber was signed after the conclusion of a large tender on which the council has been working in recent months.
The work will begin after the holidays, and residents from the 40 localities of the council who are interested in connecting to the fiber optic infrastructure will enjoy high speeds of up to 1 gigabyte, as well as advanced home end equipment that will enable strong WIFI reception, as is required at these times.
Subscribers will be able to choose between high-speed internet on fiber optics or high-speed filtered internet on fiber optics, which they will provide on the Rimon Internet.
The council made sure that the market remained open to competition in any situation.
The head of the Binyamin Regional Council, Yisrael Gantz: "This is true Zionism.
This is great news for the residents.
The experience of living in Binyamin will improve, students will be able to learn remotely if necessary, it will be possible to work from home and establish advanced businesses in localities that will have quality internet access and without delays.
I would like to wish the dear companies success in their execution tasks in the localities.
The residents are waiting for you."
Gantz added: "Soon we will receive proper conditions of high-speed internet among the best in Israel.
We worked for many months to bring a foundation for the installation of the fibers, and now the vision is becoming a reality.
I thank the Minister of Communications, Yoaz Hendel, who started the project with us in his previous term, and now we are reaping the fruits of our labor, the staff of the Minister of Communications, the members of the Council who were in charge of the details of the Center, and the CEOs of the companies that won the Center for one of the best professional quality in Israel."
Rimon Internet CEO, Yariv Peer: "I thank the head of the council, Yisrael Gantz, and his team who immediately picked up the gauntlet in order to bring good news to the thousands of residents of the council who will switch to high-speed internet that will upgrade the quality of life in the fields of education, the economy and of course leisure."
The CEO of the Telran Communications Group, Shai Aslan: "We are pleased with the decision of the Binyamin Council to connect to high-speed and powerful internet infrastructure, and I am sure that thanks to the group's extensive experience, we will be able to provide the residents with high-speed internet just like in the center of the country."
X-Fiber CEO, Israel Elitzur: "The establishment of communications infrastructures in Binyamin is the Zionism of 2021, X-Fiber is proud to take part in the construction of the modern infrastructure in the biblical areas of Binyamin, I have no doubt that thanks to our familiarity with the areas of Judea and Samaria in general and Binyamin in particular, we will meet any engineering challenge in order to bring high-speed internet to every home throughout the council."
We checked: What do the side effects after the COVID-19 vaccine mean?
Many people who get vaccinated feel weak, fever and fatigue after receiving the shot, while others do not feel anything.
Could this indicate a stronger immune system of those who do experience these symptoms, or is it a baseless rumor?
As more and more people get vaccinated, the lack of information about the side effects continues to confuse and create rumors, most of which are untrue.
Is the immune system of those who developed side effects stronger than those whose bodies responded less harshly to the vaccine, which may prove that their system is unable to fight off a foreign body that enters the body?
"There are several levels of reactions to the vaccine," says Dr. David Dvir, head of the Primary Medicine Division at Meuhedet and a member of the Advisory Committee for Epidemic Response Team, and reassuring: "Headaches, fatigue, pain in the spot, these are the immediate reactions of the immune system.
This is how the body reacts when a foreign entity enters the system."
Is there a connection between the levels of antibodies developed and the side effects?
"There is no correlation between the feelings and the development of antibodies against the virus.
About 50-60% feel the side effects, but about 90% develop protection against the virus.
It was not found that people who developed strong responses were more protected."
"In the medical literature, there is no correlation between immediate response and the level of vaccination.
In some of the trials in which people were also given placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
It is also a mental component – how the person perceives the vaccine, if he expects there to be side effects.
Many of the phenomena that happen could have happened normally, but since the public has been vaccinated, it attributes the response to the vaccine itself, and this is a bias that we see regarding vaccines in general – attributing phenomena that happen close to the vaccine and are attributed to it."
According to Dr. Dvir, the causes of the commonly reported symptoms, such as weakness and headaches, are not yet known.
Regarding myocarditis, opinions are divided.
"There are all kinds of theories on the subject, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
One of the theories is that it's a strong immune response."
Is it even possible to assess the strength of an immune system?
"When students were exposed to the flu virus, they showed that those who didn't sleep or were under higher stress were more vulnerable to infection.
Apart from that, there are laboratory parameters that test the immune system or its components.
When there is a decrease in the immune system, you see it immediately.
People get a lot of viral or infectious diseases.
It's not like someone walks around with a weakened immune system and isn't aware of it.
These are people who come to inquiries because of recurring events of infectious diseases, and what affects the system are banal things: stress, diet, sleep.
By the way, we also don't want an overly strong immune system, because it can cause autoimmune diseases."
MRNA vaccines will soon appear in additional contexts, thanks to the vast knowledge that has accumulated about them in recent times.
"There is no doubt that it will pave the way for other vaccines of this type.
This technology is being tested for many uses beyond vaccines – for treatments for oncological diseases, for example.
Their effectiveness is that the substance remains in the body for a very short time – enters, does its action, and then breaks down.
This technology is not new, but it has received a serious boost due to the very great need for a rapid vaccine.
Now, for example, we know that the three-week interval between doses is too small, and some vaccine experts claim that it is possible that after the third dose we will no longer need the vaccine in the near term, so it is not clear whether we are going to a situation of vaccination every six months or whether the third dose will provide a larger interval."
Thousands were injured: A serious privacy lapse on Route 6
Highway 6 customers?
• Your private information, including your full name, addresses, payment amounts, and full details about your trips, may be exposed.
According to the Privacy Protection Authority, Derech Eretz violated the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations.
Following a report by Derech Eretz, the operator of Highway 6 in Israel, about a security incident that took place at the company, the Privacy Protection Authority began enforcement proceedings.
As part of the incident, security weaknesses were discovered on its payment site, which enabled the disclosure of a lot of information from the member's customers' invoices, which were exposed to all eyes.
Among other things, the customers' payment invoices were exposed over a short period of time, and these invoices included personal information, including first and last name, payment amounts, the location of the vehicle, the dates of the trips and at what hours.
In addition, since Derech Eretz did not document access to its systems as required by law, it is not possible to know precisely for what period unauthorized parties could access the company's systems.
In the breach letter, which the Privacy Protection Authority sent to the company, the Authority emphasized that most of the largest companies and organizations in the economy are required to adopt a dynamic information security policy, and that with the development of threats and risks, the organization is obligated to carefully examine the updated risks and act in accordance with the update of the accepted security measures in the circumstances, in accordance with the nature and nature of the database.
As a result, companies and organizations are obligated to update their systems and conduct risk surveys and penetration tests, in order to examine and prepare for the changing risks.
In addition, companies and organizations are obligated to use an automated documentation mechanism and employee training must be conducted, in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Protection Regulations (Information Security).
In accordance with the Supervision Department's findings, the ISA determined that the company had violated the provisions of the Protection of Privacy Law and its regulations, and also demanded that the company take a number of corrective actions.
Derech Eretz, the operator of Highway 6, said: "The issue was dealt with in accordance with the strictest requirements"
Travel warning to Istanbul: Surprising news for Israelis from Turkish airlines
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus will allow Israelis to change the destination or time of their flight
Good news for Israelis who booked tickets to Turkey before the travel warning: Airlines will allow them to change flight dates.
Reminder: Earlier this week, the Counter-Terrorism Bureau raised the severity of the travel warning to Istanbul to level four.
This is the highest level and means "high level of threat: do not reach this country and in case of stay, leave the country as soon as possible."
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus said that they would allow Israelis who booked their flight before the travel warning was issued, i.e., before June 13, 2022, to change the destination or time of their flight.
This is done by contacting the airline.
Tourism Minister Razvozov said: "The citizens of Israel do not have to pay an economic price because of terror threats.
I am happy that large airlines such as Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have responded to our request, and I hope that other companies will provide a similar response to all Israeli citizens who canceled their vacation in Turkey because of the severe travel warning."

Saudi skies are approaching: Israeli companies are preparing to reinforce routes to the east
Summary Formulated for Extended Freedom of Flight Over Saudi Arabia: The airline is preparing to launch new flights to the Far East at the expense of destinations in Europe
Israel's largest airline is planning significant changes ahead of US President Joe Biden's arrival in Israel.
As we reported in Israel Hayom, it is believed that Biden will announce approval for El Al and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to destinations other than the United Arab Emirates.
The significance of the agreement is that El Al will be able to fly on shorter routes to destinations in the Far East and Australia.
To do so, the airline will have to cancel flights to less profitable destinations, in order to free up planes for new destinations.
The destinations to which flights will be canceled starting this November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.
These are three destinations with a considerable Jewish population, but at this stage they are less profitable for society.
On the other hand, the new destinations that El Al is considering are Tokyo in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.
This is how the move will be carried out: The Dreamliner planes flying to Canada will be released for long flights to the East.
The Boeing 737 planes flying to Warsaw and Brussels will be used for flights to destinations such as London and Paris, to which EL AL operates flights using Dreamliner planes.
So the company will be able to release large planes to fly to other destinations in the east.
At the same time, El Al expects talks in the coming weeks regarding the possibility that Israeli airlines will be able to fly back to Turkey, where the company will be able to operate flights using the airline's Boeing 737 planes.

Exemption from quarantine for vaccinated and recovered people from non-red countries, foreign tourists are returning.
Those who landed in Israel received notices from the Ministry of Health stating that they are exempt from the obligation to quarantine upon receiving a negative result for the Corona test.
Only afterwards did the Ministry issue an official announcement stating that only passengers from orange countries were involved, although those returning from red countries also reported receiving the notice.
In addition, tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter Israel, and many red destinations are expected to be removed from the list.
At the height of the pandemic – the end of isolation for those returning from abroad?
The Ministry of Health sent notices this morning (Monday) to those returning to Israel, stating that they are exempt from isolation upon receiving a negative result for the coronavirus test they took after landing in Israel.
These are also people returning from red countries.
Some of the messages sent informed the circulars that they could be released after receiving a negative response or after 24 hours at the latest, and some of them received the exemption after receiving the negative answer.
Only afterwards did the Ministry of Health issue official announcements stating that as of midnight on January 4, 2022, vaccinated or recovered people returning from orange countries will take a PCR test at Ben Gurion Airport and will go into isolation for 24 hours or until a negative result is received (whichever comes first).
The decision will be anchored in an order from the Director General of the Ministry of Health and will be brought to the approval of the Knesset Health Committee.
The Ministry clarified that vaccinated or recovered people who have already returned to Israel from an orange country and received a negative result from the PCR test they took upon entry into Israel, will end their isolation tonight at midnight and are not required to take a second test.
Despite this, passengers from red countries reported that they had also received the notice.
Those who have not been vaccinated or recovered and return from an orange country will enter home isolation for 14 days, with the option of shortening isolation upon receiving a negative result on a PCR test taken from the 7th day of landing in Israel (the day of landing is the first day).
The decision to lift most of the restrictions on flights, especially on vaccinated people, comes a day before the High Court of Justice hearing filed by the Association of Travel Agencies, the Open Skies Headquarters and the Hotels Association.
At the hearing to be held tomorrow, the petitioners are expected to demand the removal of all the other red states from the list, with Professor Itamar Grotto backing them in his opinion.
Foreigners will also be able to enter.
The Prime Minister and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Health, Interior, Tourism and Transportation have agreed that as of Sunday, January 9, 2022, vaccinated/recovered foreigners (as defined by the Ministry of Health) will be allowed to enter from orange countries - subject to filling out an online form in advance, taking a PCR or antigen test before boarding the plane, taking a PCR test upon entry into Israel and then entering isolation for 24 hours, or receiving a negative test result (whichever comes first).
Unvaccinated/non-recovered foreigners (as defined by the Ministry of Health) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from red countries, except those whose entry has been approved by the Exceptions Committee, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
The outline of the groups will not be renewed at this stage.
And what about red countries?
The Committee for the Classification of Countries at the Ministry of Health recommends to the government The committee recommends that the countries be removed from the list of red countries and that the following countries be transferred to the orange list: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada.
The countries that remain on the red list at this stage are: the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Ethiopia, the United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland, and Turkey.
Another option that the Ministry of Health is considering is to exempt vaccinated people returning from red countries from quarantine.
At the moment, it is not clear whether there is a connection between the notices received by those returning to Israel this morning and the instructions that may be received by the Ministry of Health on this issue.
The Ministry of Health has not yet received a response.
The skies are starting to open: The Ministry of Health is changing the restrictions on the country's gates
Vaccinated people returning from orange countries will be required to quarantine for 24 hours.
The countries of the United States, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates will be set to red.
After many weeks in which it was very difficult to find a destination to which it was possible to fly without restrictions, and after all those returning from abroad were required to quarantine, along with a ban on the entry of tourists to Israel, it was decided yesterday to change the procedures and significantly ease the restrictions on Ben Gurion Airport.
The Ministry of Health has decided to recommend canceling the quarantine requirement for three days for Israelis returning from orange countries.
Until now, anyone vaccinated or recovered according to the Ministry of Health's definitions who returned from an orange country was required to quarantine for three days, subject to two coronavirus tests.
Currently, the quarantine that vaccinated and recovered people returning from orange countries will have to enter is for a maximum of 24 hours, or until the results of the COVID-19 tests performed after landing at Ben Gurion Airport (whichever comes first) are received.
Anyone who is not defined as vaccinated or recovered will still be required to enter seven days of isolation subject to two COVID-19 tests, or 14 days without the second test, even if they returned from an orange country or if they returned from a red country.
A vaccinated or recovered person who has returned from a red country is also required to undergo full isolation.
The latest list of red countries recommended by the Ministry of Health, which still needs to be approved by the government, includes the United States, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
In all countries, with the exception of Turkey, the average number of positive cases entering the country in the past two weeks is more than 5% of the total number of arrivals, which automatically puts them on the red list of countries.
The rate of increase among patients from Turkey is rapid, with a positivity rate of just over 4%, so it was decided to include it in the red list as well.
The most prominent countries to be removed from the red list are: France, Spain, Portugal and Canada.
Meanwhile, as of January 9, tourists who are vaccinated in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Health will be able to enter Israel without the need for quarantine, similar to the conditions for Israelis returning from an orange country.
In this case, too, the decision is subject to the approval of the government, which will discuss the matter in the coming days.
It is important to note that there are few cases in which the government does not approve the recommendations of the Ministry of Health in this area.
The tourists are against the restrictions.
The Association of Travel Agencies, the Open Skies Headquarters and the Hotels Association have filed a petition with the High Court of Justice to cancel the restrictions on flyers.
The country lifted most of the restrictions yesterday, but left eight significant countries on the red list.
At a hearing in Jerusalem this morning, the petitioners are expected to demand that the state cancel the list of red countries.
The person who will support the petitioners' position is Prof. Itamar Grotto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.
Tourism Minister Yoel Razvozov, who in recent weeks has supported easing restrictions on the entry of foreign tourists into Israel, said yesterday: "The cancellation of quarantine for vaccinated people returning from abroad and the return of tourism to vaccinated people is the right and just thing to do at this time.
I thank my colleagues in the government, who understood the plight of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the damage outweighed the benefit.
The vaccine is the best response to the pandemic, and as such, the vaccinated public deserves to lead an enabling routine alongside the coronavirus."

Almost every person these days has an "old" tablet or smartphone lying in an unused closet.
Just because a slightly newer and more sophisticated model has come out, any device can replace a Spotify player with a hotspot connection.
Old devices can be road cameras, remote controls for operating devices at home, and many other uses.
You don't have to be a victim of consumer culture and you don't have to always be at the forefront of technology, with another really useless gadget.

too bad
It was more interesting to hear how many people received allowances at the Israel Post, how much the real estate of the branches (located in the desired city centers) was worth, and how much the workers' wages were (minimum).
Israel Post must not be privatized
The question is, how many packages arrived and how many were distributed?
For how many maidens do they have?
They order packages, and they disappear at the Modiin Sorting Center...
There should be a package tax of 5 shekels so that they don't just order nonsense in a shekel and load the mail
This mainly indicates the cost of living in Israel.
Thanks to King Pakis who made it better to buy everything from China.
We are a household and we try not to go near the post office and hope that letters will not come from them, and the hatred for the post has led us to give up everything that belongs to the possibility of the mail.
Have a good week.
To lay off all the postal workers, and to start re-establishing the post office - by a private company.
Employers are condescending and some are racist!
On the phone, they talk differently and when they arrive for the interview, their true faces are revealed.
No wonder they can't find workers.
They are looking for slaves.
Slave Jobs
Everyone is invited to get to know true Judaism
congratulations
Blessed are you that you have won
One who withstands trials and is found in holiness will see only the light of his entire life
Simply lovely
What nonsense.
No Tunisian was forced to hide his Jewish identity.
Historically, this is not true.

Waste prices
Very nice article, dear brother
Kobi I wish there were many like you
I love you
My dear🔥💪❤️ brother
There are no people like you 😍
King.
This is a person who sees what an amazing country we have.
There will always be problems.
That's life.
Great Kobi!!
An admirable figure!!
You will succeed in whatever you do!!
Well done that you are on the way to the king ♥
There is nothing like keeping Shabbat.
More than we keep Shabbat, Shabbat protects us
Write on Google: Shabbat observance or Shabbat laws
And learn how to keep Shabbat, good luck to everyone♥
An amazing and very humble man!
I wish him all the success in the world and that he will continue to be as charming as he is and talented at all levels.
Inhale - the great Kobi Shimoni - also known as Subliminal.
Well done to you - in the utmost seriousness.
It's amazing that she still gets job offers, in her profession it's not taken for granted...
There's nothing like following the king's♥ path
Amazing♥ family
A few years ago I had a dream of Esti Zakheim the cow on her red Boras head.
Beautiful and talented!!
How did you win the Sabbath observant
A man who is all for his wife and children.
Insanely talented.
Looking forward to her performances
Perfection :-))
You are a world champion!
Amazingly talented Inbal good luck
Amazing that you are!! :-)
Congratulations
Congratulations!!!!!
Love won!!!
Congratulations!!!
Not worrying is not for long.
At the moment it is useless
How do you know it's true love...
They came back to each other after 20 years!!
And she's even older than him
And he is a rich and famous handsome
And in a few months, he reported on the separation of forces.
Some women can get up every morning with a new husband.
It's a shame he didn't participate in the Eurovision Song Contest
Let's hope that maybe next year he will participate in an original song of his
That's where the big breakthrough will come
In the place where the egoist rises from the scribe they brought and only shame he did
Where does this Timoni Greenberg come from lol!
Who is this?!
Why does it appear on a news site??
This is not Guy Pines or Nonsense Moses' theatrical
It smells like well-oiled PR and is invited under the guise of an all-encompassing article in a shekel yard box that hides behind the name of the newspaper's editorial board.
The joke is at the expense of our readers, the captive audience that escaped from the venomous clutches of Moses and is looking for an alternative
The song is not to my liking and the music video is also casual
Lovely lovely lovely
How much talent!!!
They want more and more from him
Tamir Greenberg is a great singer at the level of an international star.
The State of Israel is small for him.
He will break out abroad in a big way.
Clinical Optometrist?!
Well, really, her "title" doesn't take hold in her country of origin...
Who is the next sector in line?
Bibiists?
And the corneal mapping did not mention the main thing.
Alec is a clinical optometrist.
clinically on her own behalf.
Where will there be sirens?
A war on the door is preparing us
And what will the battle shocks do, what cruelty?
Bennett, Lapid and Gantz at Biden's instruction: Get ready, friends, get ready...
Because they are the champions of the champions!!
But don't worry, even when you have and stupid stupid bosses, we have abilities above and beyond expectations!!
That's right, and besides, our dimensions, like most of them, are.
The Home Front Command is playing "as if" games, because in the time of Amen - we won't know...
Why only in Tel Aviv?
Everything else was chosen by the right.
Despite the beautiful talk, we have not heard of the arrest of Khaqir, the prosecution of them to the fullest extent of justice.
And in the last four election campaigns, was the Elections Committee prepared for an attack?
Why not elaborate, for example...
Several attempts at infiltration and disruption have been made and some have succeeded in infiltrating the Elections Committee in the past three years.
Don't we deserve some data, facts and proportion?
One of Hapoel Jerusalem's more delusional signings.
Good luck Oz.
You will always be part of the Maccabi dynasty...
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
You are all blacksmiths, only complaints and answers, classic armchair sweet potatoes.
Baldwin is a social attack in the locker room, according to players who played with him in both Greece and Spain!
Hollins was injured and did not play in the last games of the Red Star...
Hilliard was also injured and hasn't played for the last six months...
Heavy gambling.
Maccabi lacks a star
What is it really about with Brown
If he doesn't sign, Maccabi could be in trouble
What about Lorenzo Brown?
lol how does it fit like a glove next to a loser for a group of......
Adam, a great player, the coach must give him more minutes, not give him up, Hapoel needs a great roster, he must not be given up.
Not.
Bring in Andrean Banks.
We need more strong Israelis on the roster.
Those who actually play
Much more suitable than Wilbekin for Maccabi, which is being built.
You can see that there are professionals at Maccabi – Blatt and Katsch.
Perhaps personal abilities are still comparable to Scotty's, but a team player, and especially a much higher game intelligence.
It's so sad that Maccabi Tel Aviv relies on foreigners and the Israelis are warming up the bench
By the way, Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes and not a collection of foreigners, so they won't succeed with all the stars who have been scratched from around the world
Who cares about this???
If you are already watching a game in which 6 American players and 3 Israelis are for decoration, it is not better to watch the Golden State game????
Puzzle until the league ends
Good luck
Good column.
Loved.
As for the Israelis, he is absolutely right!!
And a note about Ziv - we saw last season that he is a good player who can also lead a team.
So in the Euroleague he can't be a leader, but the decline in his ability in the league also indicates that he has lost his confidence (which is no wonder after the treatment he received after 2 bad games in the Euroleague, as if foreigners did not have such games) and his use may also be incorrect, and it is a result of the coach's fixation and stencils.
A non-scoring blazer with all due respect...
Yiftach Ziv shouldn't be at Maccabi Tel Aviv, he is destroying it too much
There used to be no good game, but Sorkin and Blazer Dudi and Cohen today well done.
Ido Eshed is a slacker, a Holon fan who was given 500 shekels, so he writes nonsense.
Not Federman in the picture.
Blazer, Sorkin and Jack Cohen are much better than Colliero and Taylor who play about 20 minutes in Europe and are not able to score a basket, who needs foreigners at the level of nothing and nothing, much better for the Israelis to play.
It's good that there is a good spirit for everyone, coaching players and management during the momentum
It depends on increasing the internal cohesion...
and the disciplinary and required reinforcement of the point guard and the guard
And that's the part of the management.
False.
Direct human interaction is important in many aspects.
The answer to this study is that social isolation is a bad thing from a professional perspective as well, and the truth is, what is surprising and disappointing here is the surprise.
Then turn off the camera on Zoom and the problem is solved.
What happened, the researchers used Zoom so their creativity wasn't enough for this solution?
How do you know what will happen in 30 years?
Someone here missed an important detail
Scientists don't care about warming or rainwater
They are only interested in the rate of population growth
They are working on more and more vaccines and bastard methods to destroy the world's population, so they tell us foggy stories about warming and other nonsense that they invent
There is no problem with desalinating water, in unlimited quantities
They said it 50 years ago.
In the meantime, there are more people.
The solution is to limit births, especially in poor places and in the case of Bibi's baboons, the rest of their anti-state leftists, and in all religions that believe in gods – among the fools, the ignorant, the foolish, the blind, or in short – among the herds
There is an urgent need to reduce the world's population.
Living things (including sasmolens) consume oxygen and emit carbon report.
The solution: Sesame people, commit suicide!
It's green.
Good for the world.
May it be better for you, and surely the planet and all of us.
Who are the scientists and how they carried out the research
I don't believe any research that talks about climate warming because this thing doesn't exist
It is tendentious to control us and steal our freedom and freedom.
It's all part of the new world order.
And reporters like Assaf Golan are on their side, as he did during the coronavirus.
I have never heard him present facts from both sides, he always brings the side that serves the globalists.
They boast of us.
They just burn money on "academic" engraving research.
As usual, another drawing from the land of the engravings of psychopathic seismologists.
The situation is actually improving. Human knowledge is expanding and with it new technologies and improvements.
For centuries, the world's population has been steadily growing at an exponential rate, and the situation is only improving.
The Chinese, for example, launched a huge project of war in the Gobi Desert, with astonishing success.
The Saudis are doing the same thing and are succeeding (with Israeli knowledge, by the way).
It is precisely the stupid "climate crisis" of the sasamolens (emissions of carbon dioxide, which is needed by plants) that is the cause of the Sahara becoming greener, but hey, it doesn't fit the seismolean agenda, so don't read about it in the newspapers...
The leftists are not worried.
In them, the urine goes straight to their heads, so they don't dry out.
Does proper management of water reservoirs mean a reduction of at least 70% of the world's population?
It is surprising that COVID is coming and it is surprising that most of the population is injected with an experimental substance whose consequences for the period of 5-25 years for those injected are not at all known.
It's also surprising that the 2030 Agenda is getting underway, and now it's it?
The whole story is really puzzling!!
What.
The stories of the Thousand and One Nights, all intimidation and of course nonsense by the left that is trying to control the world by controlling the media, five years ago they announced that there would be no more rain in Australia and this year they have enough rain for two years.
It was said that there was no more rain in the country and that the drought was constant, and here there is rain.
They also said that Rabin did not murder Jews in Altalena and that Peres did not know that Tamani children were being stolen.
Moshe Dayan, of course, did not rob antiquities, and Ezer Weizmann did not deal with his female soldiers.
It is clear that you are promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
Disgusting nonsense.
They will also take care of the reception on the axes, dealing with power outages and voltage drops, and we are on the wave.
"This is true Zionism," just as the opening of the Rami Levy branch in Yeruham is Zionism.
In the wake of the crook Bennett, the rest of the licking politicians will line the line.
Even if you give me free flights, I don't come close to El Al, rather "Super Shoe"
It was very pleasant, goodbye and goodbye.
You won't see us even in dreams.
One more big shame, we in Israel are held captive by the El Al company, all the direct flights are in its hands, it is better to go bankrupt already, the time has come for truly open skies.4
Some focus on this issue of flights to the East.
Even if Saudi Arabia allows El Al to fly over its territory, it will not add more than a few tens of millions to the Israeli economy, not such a big game changer.
It is better to focus on more interesting achievements such as energy supply, the acquisition of Israeli technology, transportation from the ports of Ashdod and Haifa through Jordan to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, tourism, allowing Israeli infrastructure companies to work in Saudi Arabia.
It's much more interesting than 30 planes a week that will save an hour each.
It is more important that they allow the air force squadrons to be stationed in the Persian Gulf in order to strike at Iran, and that they organize the UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Egypt and Morocco to drop armaments on Iran non-stop for a month until the complete destruction of all its military infrastructure.
And another squadron of the air force to be stationed in northern Saudi Arabia and strike the Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq to the east from a less crowded area.
After we are done with Iran, Saudi Arabia can push Oman, Kuwait, Djibouti and the Comoros to a peace agreement with Israel and obtain a majority of the Arab League countries that have joined the peace.
After the regime change in Iran, the end of the World Cup, the stabilization of the oil and gas market, and the replacement of Erdogan, it is also possible to help Saudi Arabia overthrow the regime in Qatar and eliminate the subversion of that country and its support for other Muslims and Hamas.
When all these common interests end, it will be possible to talk about a few more El Al flights if El-Al survives until then.
El Al needs to close.
Sell tickets for flights that don't take place.
The worst thing is that there is no way to get a representative
"No customer service."
Anyone who buys a ticket at El Al and wants to change or cancel should forget about it, a sure loss.
You have been warned.
Air Canada is better
In any case, they prefer to fly abroad
Arka has turned from social into a society's hell
EL AL has also dropped in level.
It is best to book a taxi.
The driver will load the luggage for free.
And you sued on the train to the airport
40 euros a suitcase in Ryanair is much cheaper than Waze.
A backpack weighing 8 kg can be uploaded.
Why are you misleading?
Wizz Air on cargo and seating take much more seriously!!
One big nonsense
Just for example, just now I've come back if I'm going to be a
The weight allowance is 30 kg
And Truli 7 kg
And each extra 1 kg is $30
Go and update
All companies steal the customer.
They advertise very cheap prices, but in the end it's a bag the size of a school bag.
A trolley already costs money and a suitcase costs very, very expensive.
Luckily, the companies don't ask us to come on the flight with underwear and a tank top so that there won't be weight on the plane.
At El Al, the price is not cheaper, but 50% cost when booking up to 6 hours before the flight.
Israelis are not surprised at all.
The Israelis were and remain combinators, using the Matsliah method.
A land eats its inhabitants and eats them.
To this must be added genetic stinginess.
Shame on our country that allows foreign airlines to oppress Israelis...
There is no government and everyone here does what he wants
So what did you learn today that it's not enough to pay for an expensive ticket?
Prepare a surprise for all of us.
You will pay extra for the plane's wheels, for the windows, for the luggage that does not arrive, for the food, for the drinks, and they will probably add to the toilet
In short, stay at home and the prices will go down.
Or big go out on ships
A journey that will take a few days
You will vomit and then you will probably come too
Bennett wants to see how much he can attack and harm Israel, and still win the challenge and support of his new fans.
Open now?
It's no coincidence.
Precisely when the mess begins there is an exemption, it's just delusional what's happening here...
This is not the peak of the pandemic
Shimon, it's not right for you
The number of confirmed cases is rising does not mean that the number of patients is increasing
Stop getting tested for any nonsense, sit at home if you're not feeling well
The story is over
A government of crazy people
The government and Bennett are mostly bankrupt.
Loss of control.
And especially stupidity
And to the confusion of the public, score 0
Only more damage than the channel
I suggest you open a new corner: "The daily and cumulative number of deaths since the beginning of the fifth wave.
The face and the pictures are behind the omission."
Your ratings will soar.
You don't understand the Minister of Finance for not paying compensation to tourism workers
Bringing them more contagion
They don't care about the people
8,500 have died so far
Anything talks about that?
They bury us, especially the elderly
We became Russia/North Korea.
If you don't talk about it - it doesn't exist!!
The main thing is that the citizens put money into the state coffers to grow the ministers' belly and buttocks!
It turns out that Doberman and Abbas are the prime minister!!
Very well, the suspension of the Omicron was relevant for the first week, now - there is no reason to isolate half the people, and there is no point in trying to stop the Omicron - which is more prevalent here than in Israel.
When someone comes from an orange country, they are statistically less dangerous than someone who is already here.
This is the first time that I have seen logical steps taken by the Israeli government in the fight against the coronavirus.
As if someone really sat down and calculated numbers, and not like Bibi – he did what he thought would look better in the newspaper (and failed in all the sections).
The government of the dream at its best:
A finance minister who told tour guides to find a new profession two weeks ago, is busy opening the skies to tourists.
The Minister of Education is tweeting at the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health and setting her own policy, which plunges all schools into complete chaos!
Foreign minister, a clown who comes to a government meeting sick with Corona.
And the most clown prime minister we've ever had in the country, doesn't control the situation and loses his temper like the last of the hooligans.
Simply a government without our leadership, without direction, in which the entire people of Israel have lost faith
Go home and it's nice to be one hour earlier!!
In my opinion, maybe it comes from a bad place, but from a place of loss of control
Now the prices of apartments there will jump to 50 million per apartment.
Well, where are all the forecasters?
A bus stop is being built and we believe it will affect all the homes.
By the way, except for sponsorship fees afterwards.
Let them discover Arad's exorbitant property tax prices, the hotel will return to being a white elephant like its predecessor
Looks amazing.
Good luck.
I feel like it.
What about the art of being photographed completely naked?
Giving up the garbage
A serious fight for Sde Barir
Why don't they give benefits to girls in the occupied Galilee by the Muslim Brotherhood?
All of them are spoiled
In the current reality, the south is still ours?!
Need a passport?
Another luxury hotel!
Surely the Knesset members will be there too!!
What about a popular hotel for a popular person?
Good for investments in the [blooming] south
Arad is developing and prospering, and kudos to the mayor, who since the beginning of his term there has been an explosion for the good and glory of the city of Arad
Cultural, social, educational, and more life on the heights
Just an excellent mayor who improved the city!
congratulations
I wonder how much protection fees the Bedouin owner will pay.
Have you prepared money for sponsorship fees?
Wow, sounds good
Those who can only afford EL AL Company with service and security, the best in the world.
When was it possible to fly to Dubai, does anyone know????
EL AL Tin Company.
Neither socially nor financially.
In recent weeks, she canceled return flights from abroad, you see, sent messages to Israelis and told them that the flight was canceled, ruined the entire trip, informed the passengers, leave a message on W.App or on Messenger and we will return, return after a day, two days or even three.
The trip was ruined.
Besides, is it better to land planes on the ground, instead of making the flights back to Israel, and also prevent economic damage?
Are there any other suckers flying to El Al?
Don't fly with them for free either.
Have they already returned the millions of customers they took captive?
EasyJet to Geneva round trip 70 euros.
EL AL one way $560.
I don't buy even $10 from the fraudulent religious who controls the company together with his son, cheaters all the time...
And then the company will cancel the flights and offer vouchers that will be worthless.
Because their realization will be in addition to the price change.
Anyone who buys tickets at El Al puts their money on the wing of the plane.
Tin Company.
Exercises by the Low Coast Company.
No luggage, no seat selection, certainly no taxes and no food.
Vacation and Corona flights...
To all the members of the "Go'alitia"... Me!
Nature dilutes fools!!
