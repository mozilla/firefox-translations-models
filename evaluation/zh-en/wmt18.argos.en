Last week, there was a temporary suspension of the ancient show, "The beautiful private foods " , which unexpectedly triggered a lively discussion about the false ratings of the national production show.
Civil rights groups issued a travel warning for Missouri.
As a result of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the American Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued travel warnings to coloured people preparing to travel to Missouri.
“In the NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which came into force on 28 August 2017, all African American travellers, tourists and Missouriers should pay particular attention and take a very cautious approach when travelling in Missouri in response to a series of suspicious ethnic incidents in Missouri,” the group's statement states.
NAACP noted that the recent adoption of a law in the Missouri region, which made it more difficult to win discrimination suits, and the law enforcement in the region, which to a certain extent targeted minorities, prompted the organization to issue travel warnings.
Violations of the rights of citizens are taking place on people.
They were beaten or killed because of their skin colour, “Rode Chapel, Chairman of NAACP, Missouri, told The Kansas City City Star.
“We have received an unprecedented number of complaints.”
This was the first such warning issued by the organization against a state in the United States.
It cited racial defamation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of a 28-year-old black male, Toli Sanders.
Earlier this year, Saunders died under suspicious circumstances. He ran out of fuel while travelling in Missouri region and was detained without charge by the Missouri police.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri states that “black drivers in the state are 75 per cent more likely than whites to be searched”.
Chapel said: “The purpose of the consultation was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri”.
“People need to be prepared, either to go to Missouri with bail or to let relatives know that they are travelling within the state”.
According to the latest data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation hate crime reporting programme, the Missouri region recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; the state ranks 16th in the country according to the number of crimes.
Travel warnings are also a response to the new law in Missouri, which will make it more difficult to prosecute enterprises that discriminate against housing or employment.
Previously, the U.S. states had passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain immigration offenders. The U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) indicated that this would increase the number of racial prosecutions and issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the United States Government against other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have responded in this way to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Following the “golden age” of the sharp increase in the number of tickets in 2015, the overall film market entered a period of calm in 2016, with the achievement of a total of $44,069 billion last year becoming a suspense.
According to data published by the National Statistical Office, the prices of new and second-hand houses in Beijing went down in October, rising by only 0.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent.

BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city: making foreigners feel "living in a new era."
On January 18, the Reference Network reported that Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly becoming the city of modern charm today.
This capital of China, with an alarmingly high Internet, sophisticated technology such as face recognition software, a huge investment in artificial intelligence and an unparalleled internationalization of energy, is one of the most exciting cities for exploration-rich foreigners.
According to the BBC website, on 16 January, the German diaspora, Clemens Sess, said: “If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere in the future.” He quotes a singer, Frank Sinatra, who celebrates New York City.
Sessy, who is the creative director of the Traveler's Archives magazine, said: “If Sinatra survives to this day, he will probably sing cities like Beijing.” He said that living in this city would make you feel “living in a new era” and would always keep up with the tide.
Simon Norton, who is home in England, but recently lives in Beijing, wrote on the personal blog site 4Corners7Seas, saying, “There is a general feeling that people are at the centre of something huge, which is hard to say, but it leaves many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it's going to look like, and they want to see it.
It was reported that high-quality, high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environments in the city make daily life easier than ever.
“Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cash-free society where the Internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smart phones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions.”
Reports indicate, however, that smartphones are only the beginning of Beijing's technological ambition and that facial recognition software is widely available, which is used in many mobile phone applications for bank transfers and payments, access to apartments and offices, and even to verify the identity of the driver of a car.
Beijing also recently announced plans to build an artificial intelligent technology park at a cost of RMB 13.8 billion, where more than 400 enterprises will be located, focusing on the development of various artificial intelligence technologies, from biometrics to auto-driving cars.
Food is also at the heart of China ' s many major festivals throughout the years. Participation in these celebrations has been praised by foreigners. Spring Festival is the most important social and economic holiday and one of the most accessible for foreigners.
“I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year, cleaning their apartments and writing the New Year’s blessing on their doors is equally important. On New Year’s Eve, all family members gather for a big meal, and then watch until midnight to greet the New Year with a loud flame. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and family is indeed an opportunity for integration.”
It was reported that while the number of foreigners in Beijing was large and growing, the language barrier in China and the ease of communication among the diaspora could easily be an excuse for their incomplete integration into local culture.
“Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but have little experience with their host countries. If your initial attempts to reach out to the Chinese are not successful, it is easy or easier for you to get along with other foreigners.
“In these so-called “exile bubbles” (“exile bubbles” means that foreigners only mix up with foreigners, without contact with local people and local culture — a translation note”), foreigners entangled in their own communities, at meals in Western restaurants and only foreigners among friends.
The simplest way to overcome this is to learn a little bit of Mandarin — easier than one might imagine.
“The Chinese private teaching of one or two hours a week or the first-class radio drama should fit everyone's busy schedule.”
Even a few classic short sentences can help with shopping, ordering meals in restaurants or chatting in taxis.
It was reported that persistent air pollution was also a fact of daily life, although in recent years the Government had tried to contain some problems.
Residents stressed the importance of outdoor activities in warm months, where pollution is often relatively light, as opportunities for blue days to be used in long-standing alleys or for the exploration of popular temple parks.
Norton said, “Beijing is the city of China where the most things can be found below the surface, where you can find great artistic and musical events, night life, historical wonders, super-modern commercial zones and ancient homogenous areas.”
According to the report, the impact of ageing on human capital growth is increasingly evident, especially in the north-east, where the average annual contribution of ageing to human capital growth is -128 per cent.
The success of Pan noted that the current risk of cross-border capital flows is manageable and that the underlying factors underpinning the balance of payments remain long-standing.
On December 17, the China People's University opened the International Summit for the Validation and Protection of China's Ancient Paints Forum, held in Beijing on December 17.
In April this year, the European Commission accused Google of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre-load software such as Google Search and Chrome Browser, otherwise they would not be allowed to use other Google applications.
The Commission considered this to be detrimental to consumers and an obstacle to competition.
EU regulators initially requested Google to respond by 27 July.
If the anti-monopoly charge is established, Google faces a maximum of 10 per cent of its global fine, approximately $7.4 billion.
Google has yet to comment immediately.
Google is also facing EU investigations because of its preference for home shopping services in search results.
Zhang Yu Ning's legacy is real, and it is not by chance that he has achieved a “jumping” from Qing to Qingo, and the extent to which he has grown is still surprising.
A picture of the legal status of bitcoin around the world.
Summary: In addition to price reversals naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the sharp decline in the current round of digital currencies is not unrelated to the “hostile” - regulatory risk.
Viewable maps show that Eastern countries are more conservative than the West in their bitcoin approach, that countries that dominate the world are still watching digital currency legitimacy, and that the “black swan risk” remains high.
* This paper is from Wall Street News (Wind:wallstreamcn), editor Wang Mu. More wonderful information can be found on the Wallstreamcn.com or on Wall Street. ♪ I'm sorry ♪
With the storm of regulation in major markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union, the global digital currency, headed by Bitcoin, has been bloody since this week, with Bitcoin prices falling by $10,000 a week, the largest single-day decline in three years.
In addition to the price reversals naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the sharp decline in the current round of digital currencies is not unrelated to the long-standing “hostile” — regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, the visualized big data site HowMuch.net produced a map showing the legitimacy and regulatory level of bitcoin in countries around the globe.
As the figure below shows, green represents the legitimate market for bitcoin; orange represents the neutral market, which has not yet publicly legalized its status, but has no major use restrictions; light pink represents the restricted market, where local governments try to use the digital currency through red-line policies or regulation; dark pink represents the country where bitcoin is defined as illegal; and grey is an unapproved country.
(The above figure is from the HowMuch.Net visualization team at the 15th of January.)
According to the article, the distribution of the green pieces in Central Africa shows that the traditional Eastern countries are more conservative than the West in their bitcoin attitude.
Russia is currently the largest country to have outlawed bitcoin, China is one of the largest restricted markets for bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries to have no comment on the bitcoin and no relevant policy.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of bitcoin, i.e., the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America in the form of a relatively different currency are evident, with a more mixed distribution of the colours in the above-mentioned regions.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are legitimate bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, etc. have some restrictions on their trade and use, and more Latin American countries have yet to speak out.
A synthesis of the above-mentioned data shows that 99 countries (or 40 per cent) of the 246 countries surveyed globally have no restrictions on trade in and use of bitcoin, i.e. green and orange areas.
7 countries (or 3 per cent) are restricted markets (light pink) and 10 countries (or 4 per cent) TTs are illegal (deep pink), and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) do not yet have more treatment for digital currency information (grey).
This suggests that the countries that make up the global majority (53 per cent, more than half) are still waiting for the domestic legitimacy of the digital currency headed by Bitcoin, and that the “black swan risk” of Bitcoin remains high, as some of these countries may eventually take legislative decisions to restrict the monetary currency.
According to the article, the emerging category of digital currency is not fully understood by global regulators and may be the main reason that most countries have not yet made a declaration.
Although Bitcoin's “human gas” has grown exponentially since last year, it does not represent an interest for all countries, and it may be that some countries are concerned about the consequent threat to local French currency or are more concerned about the use of digital currency by criminal organizations.
Wall Street News has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news about Bitcoin since last week, including China’s launch of a centralized service online platform and mobile App for off-site exchanges, South Korea’s continuing consideration of the closure of a digital currency exchange, and the EU’s belief that Bitcoin is not widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of “loss of their blood”.
Wall Street editor-in-chief, "Reading Queens 2018: Global Mothers Started the Year of Digital Currency?" It was mentioned that 2018 would be a digital currency year for global central banks from either point of view of regulation, acceptance/criticism or adoption.
The criticism of the legitimacy of Bitcoin by large countries such as Russia is in fact intended to give way to the official issuance of digital currency.
On January 8th, Xinhua News in Madrid (Reporter She Woo-ji), Barcelona New Aid Curtinio 8 was first dressed in a Basasar dress in Nokanpo.
Kutiño passed a medical examination in Basa that morning and signed a contract with Basa Chairman Batomeu to expire in the summer of 2023.
He then appeared in front of nearly 7,000 fans in Nokamp as a Bassa player.
According to the Spanish media, the sum of Coutinio ' s transfer contributions, or Euro160 million (EUR 1 = RMB 7.77), is the first price in the history of the Basa Club and the Western Jae.
As Kutinio is still wounded at this time, he will have to rest for nearly 20 days before he can get his own show in a Basasar.

Now the White House in Trump is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most definite sign of regime change was when they started attacking statues.
Americans agree with everyone. As a result, Saddam Hussein of Paradise Square in Baghdad was deliberately pushed down in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key thinkers of the Trump government, must know what would happen when Jim Acosta of CNN argued with the President about a proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did so, a group of cruise ship owners and liberal followers would surely eat him alive.
But he did attack the meaning of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was carved on the throne in 1903 (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller rebukes Acosta: “I do not want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America's freedom to light up the world ...
The poem you refer to, which was added later, not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
In fact, Miller is right, but, as he himself said, this is not really about history.
This is about the modern echo of Lazarus' horrifying language, and the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: “Your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowd of people who want to breathe freely / People who suffer reject your crowded beaches.”
There is no “suffering people reject” at a moment when our screens become more visible.
Miller did not engage in literary commentary, and he made it clear that those people would not be welcome in the United States during the Trump era.
This conflict over statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: This is in fact a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends, whose poems were engraved on the table after her death, are well aware of the highly political nature of the acts they are participating in.
The aim of the sculpture is to express the link between French and American republicanism through the ancient classic metaphor of the woman as the goddess of freedom.
Lazarus changed that: in her poem, the image of a woman was no longer abstract, and she wanted to speak.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of exile.
This poem was combined with this painting as a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to American nativeism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers always wanted it back.
The great speaker Rush Limbaugh, a temporary baptist of Trump, in 2010 believed that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, and that he was now an early neo-conservative, bringing the United States wisdom to a world of ignorance: “The goddess of freedom is courageous.
She intended to bring the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not light America's path.”
It is unusual that Limbo was actually moved by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive perspective.
The most imaginative way to see Lazarus is to see it. When weary, poor, hopeful people can see it on the deck after a long and often terrible journey.
On the face of it, this involves a world perspective for those who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveyed to them and needed the hope and welcome they heard.
Of course, this is not the point that Miller and Trump wanted to recognize.
Their torches are not intended to light the path, but rather to ignite hatred, which is their only source of strength.
In 2006, the Zatop became the first Chinese to sign a contract with the British headquarters of Globe with a unique musical style.
In the 2017 World Championship, Neil Black paid high tribute to Scotland's members of the British National Team.
Eilidh Doyle recalled that there were only two Scots on the British National Team.
Neil Black, Executive Director of the British Association of Fields and Fields, said that the World Championship team of 16 strong Scots would make a great contribution to the national team.
The largest number of Scottish field athletes ever selected to participate in the London Fields Championship in 2017, which opened on Friday.
Black believes that “Scotland is making extraordinary progress”, from which British trackers must learn.
"We accept and try to understand this, and we will persevere until we succeed," Blake says.
“I'm talking to the Scottish Sports Institute. They think this is about what they did.
Scottish trackers think this is about what they do.
The British Association of Fields and Fields considers this to be relevant to their actions.
Even street people think so.
Whatever the situation, it is brilliant. “...
A number of Scottish trackers, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, will be at least 5,000 metres above Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle will be selected as the team leader.
“Elid is a little modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible. Blake said.
“Many track athletes, whether or not they are Scottish or live or train anywhere, walk out of the door with pride and energy.
Irid's natural passion and affection are good."
The winner of the Commonwealth silver medal, who will compete in his 5th World Championship, 400 meters across the field, said that 16 Scottishs on the British National Team were “unbelievably”.
Previously, the maximum number of Scottish track and track athletes who participated in the World Series was seven, i.e. the number of contestants who were won in 1983 and 2015.
Runner Muir is the leader. She has had five British and two European records in the past year.
She's going to be in 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters of project.
Chris O'Hare, who participated in the 1500-metre project competition, was another interesting Scottish player, who had a good run in the season, winning the pre-elections and the Olympic anniversary games in the UK.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first World Championship when the only other Scottish member of the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said that she was very proud that so many of her compatriots not only joined the team, but also in some cases would challenge the medals and compete for the finals.
“The special thing about being a captain of the national team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team. Therefore, it was a great honour for me to know that your teammates voted for an extraordinary achievement, she added.
“Of course, I'm very proud of all the members of Scotland.
It just shows how far we have gone.
And they're all old track and field athletes here, track and track athletes who are about to march towards the purpose of the troupe.
How about my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's great.
I have just referred to the fact that, in this case, we are very fortunate because we are holding the World Championship on the premises.
That is why it is truly important for us to count on the support of the stadium and to grow as we return to the Olympic stadium.
I will be given a second chance to compete, and the atmosphere there will be incredible.”
In 2016, the total number of employees in China was 180,000 and the cost of employees amounted to 121.8 billion, a 21 per cent increase over the previous year.
Block the critics on Facebook: If you can't stand the voters' blame, don't run for office.
Our father knows bad media.
American people loved Washington, but shortly thereafter, major newspapers began to vehemently criticize him for everything, from domestic policy to political principles.
He was angry with these criticisms, without doubt.
But he did not silence those critics.
For as early as 1783, Washington said, “freedom of speech is denied — we will be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance”.
This reminds me of Larry Hogan, Governor of Maryland, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 posts because they expressed their views on his Facebook official home page.
The American Civil Liberties Union brought proceedings against him in this regard earlier this week.
The governor's staff considered the lawsuit to be hasty, and online coverage was full of their strong resistance: “Who cares?”
Many people say, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
This is particularly important because it is faced with people like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in a democratic majority state, and he is surprisingly popular.
Of the 50 governors in the country, he received the second best rating.
Hogan is not a reactionary impatient.
He took control of Maryland and strictly observed the rules.
He was also very good at using Facebook as the main means of reaching out to voters, and showed the baldness of his chemotherapy for the first time on his home page.
So those who blocked comments on the Governor's home page were completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous. The home page is a public forum and an official management platform for public tax-supporting employees.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan ' s spokesman, Amelia Shass, defended the Governor ' s behaviour by saying that she believed that blocking their comments was merely an attempt to restrain them.
But they were too hasty to describe it as a flood beast or a cynical cynic across the network.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with someone who had been shielded by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their elected leaders: They are teachers, small business owners and priests, not flood beasts.
They say that their comments are deep, respectful and not indecent.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and called on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Ramani, lawyer in Boy, Maryland, was not cynical, but asked about hate crimes.
She wrote in the news story section of The Washington Post, “I am polite to comment that I am disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also do not like a group of people commenting on the same subject, because they are simply ignored by people who think they are so-called public minds, not citizens of a country that worries.”
The so-called “intensive garbage-information bombing” by the governor's staff may seem to others to be a “continuing claim”.
The Facebook era has made it easy to modify a message by shielding a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It was also much cleaner than in the past, when it was necessary to send staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical statements or to arrest or silence protesters.
But that is what is happening now, just at the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for scolding others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being prosecuted by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
Last week, a landmark ruling was made in Virginia on such issues.
According to James Cacharis, District Judge of Alexandria, United States of America, the Chairman of the Lauden County Supervisory Committee blocked voters from her Facebook page in violation of the First Amendment.
The Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin (R), was also visited by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet had a similar impact.
The number of newspapers in the press quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, with anonymous letters strongly criticizing his leadership.
And even then, Washington had an anonymous flood beast against him.
People used pseudonyms such as Yurikla, Valerius, Belisalu, and Pagos to write to the press to harshly criticize Washington’s decision-making.
According to historical documents collected by George Washington newspaper's online project, his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his attitude on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the British King and the United States of America, signed with Britain.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of expression, dissent and speech are the foundations of the country.
And true leaders need to accept that.
A little bit of wind and grass in the city is driving people's sensitive nerves.
Restriction of purchases is a barb in many urban real estate regulation policies.
In May 2017, Jenan introduced a policy of six months ' continuous social security coverage for undergraduate students, with equal access to housing for residents of the local household;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that provides for university graduates to be admitted on the basis of a diploma and employment certificate within three years.
This was followed by policy additions, officially stating that “pupil students can buy a house at a price below 20 per cent of the market price”;
In July, Chengdu introduced a requirement that young people with undergraduate degrees and above at a field university could apply for a residence permit.
In addition to this, cities or regions such as Quinshan and Shanghai Port have introduced “brain introduction” policies that lower the threshold for home occupancy.
It is Zhang's belief that this is in fact a competition for the population, especially talent, in large cities, and that it is the city that is competitive because of this.
It is even argued that this means that the time has come for the municipal “restricted” purchases to be cancelled.
The same day, the director of Er Dong-Sung stated that the filming programme had been in place for a long time, that the first script had been adapted in 1999, and that he was even looking for the Golden City Wu to play Yan XIII.
Ronan Lafferty looks forward to enjoying her homecoming at Renaissance Club.

"This is really very special.
I didn't defend the Estremadura public race because it was cancelled in the second year of my victory.
It's amazing to be here.
It's wonderful to play golf here.
Last year's memories came to light, and last year's victory was of particular significance to us and to my wife, Sharon.
It's really a special memory that we'll always remember."
Back home was Gary Orr, who had just turned 50 earlier this year and then participated in the Europe Green Tour.
This is the first time he's been in a Scottish game since the 2013 Scottish golf competition.
“The game at home will always be more meaningful.
You want to be good; but you can feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed being able to play again, and I've been playing golf.
I'm happy with the situation.”
The three-member team was joined by former Masters Winner Ian Woosnan and Changqing Champions Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNeutty.
There were six Scottish athletes on the scene, two of them, Al and Sam Torrance, former Leader of the Lyde Cup, and four others, Andrew Odkorn, Stephen McCallister, Bill Romu and Ross Drummond.

In Beijing, the Director General of the Environmental Inspectorate of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, Zou Zhou Zhumin, introduced a total of 57 cases of daily and continuous punishment throughout the country in August, and new amendments to the Law on Environmental Protection introduced early this year clearly increased China ' s environmental law enforcement efforts.
At present, environmental protection agencies in various parts of China can investigate and punish environmental violations by means of daily and consecutive penalties, seizure, cut-off and administrative detention, and cooperate with the judicial authorities to punish environmental crimes.
In August, Zou Zhou Zhengmin described the total number of seizures and seizures in China as 335; the total number of production-restricted and cut-off cases as 177; the total number of administrative detentions of 189; and the total number of cases of alleged environmental pollution offences of 166.
Of these, Henan is carrying out seven consecutive daily punishments, and China is currently in the process of embedding it from the end to the full extent of environmental pollution management.
Despite the downward pressure of the economy, China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection has previously made it clear that China should properly position environmental protection in economic development, so as to strengthen the “green force” that the faster the economy goes, the less it can relax environmental protection and optimize its effects on the economy.
There is no maximum, only higher, and the price of Guizhou's shares cannot stop on the high road of innovation.

Russian media claim Putin owns a new national car: 15% less per unit than Mercedes.
Russian media reported on January 18 that Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Manturov stated that President Putin's “carcade” car unit price was 6-7 million roubles.
The budget target is to keep the price 15 per cent lower than that of Mercedes-Benz class S vehicles.
In late February and early March, according to a report by the Russian Tower Network, the Russian National Institute of Automotive Engineering (NMI), the President's main research and development unit, will deliver 16 vehicles to the Federal Security Service.
It was reported that the “Caravan” project required the manufacture of three vehicles for the country's leading figures — the limo plus, the tricycle and the minibus — using a unified modular platform. The budget for the project is 12.4 billion roubles.
Reports indicate that the news of the first national car since the creation of the Soviet Union by the President appeared some five years ago. According to the R & D unit ' s plan, the new vehicle will be equipped with 800 horsepower engines and armoured vehicles weighing 6 tons.
It is known that the engineering technical team of Porsche Germany is involved in the development of power units.

The Zhejiang province has vigorously promoted the spirit of the Red Ship and has acted with determination to bring work to the forefront of the times.
As soon as the new batch of water samples were collected, Lau Ri and his colleagues became busy.
While daily monitoring
This year they're working on the intellectual management of rural sewage.
How it can be managed is actually a very serious challenge.
Zhejiang Qinghua Triangular Institute for Eco-Environmental Research is located at the birthplace of the Red Boat Spirit.
From nothing ten years ago to now.
The Zhejiang Zhejiang Qinghua Triangular Institute has developed into three national priority innovation platforms, with nearly 400 overseas students living in Zhejiang.
Red ship spirit is a force that we have to follow and understand. Innovation is hard.
Every innovation in this.
You have to hold on at that stage and you're walking.
It's the people who came to the house. They're coming up and down.
Do things for the people.
To date, in this way, 5,985 problems have been collected in the Xiaoshan region, of which 3,868 have been resolved and 1,496 are being dealt with.
Our Zhejiang cadre has one thing to say.
Geographical superiority is less than that of cadres, policy preference is less than quality of service, and the red boat spirit of dedication is an incentive to move forward, much more so in the lead.
To fight.
In recent days, the Chinese Cultural Union has organized awareness-raising groups among the 19 leading representatives of the arts and crafts community and prominent artists to travel to the Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Shanghai, Guangdong, Guizhou, etc.
They went to grassroots art galleries, local courtyards and some higher education institutions in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Gansu, etc., and carried out a new cultural mission to the 19 spiritual Chinese artists.
I'm proud and happy, and I'm willing to sink again and write more about the fate of the big people.
There are some good ideas for grass-roots arts development.
There's a little bit of popularism in popular literature.
It's a time-honoured work.
It should be rooted and grass-roots, deep-rooted, and then work with a certain cultural thickness, positive, positive and persistent artistic glamour.
Twenty-eight (28) of the 1.520 billion acres have been measured, of which 1.110 million are completed.
The seven provinces of Sichuan and other regions, which account for 82 per cent of the land under contract for two rounds of households, have reported to the Party ' s Central State Council that it is almost complete.
It is expected that by the end of 1808, national contracting authority will be largely completed
In the future, the Ministry of Agriculture will explore the outcome of this process.
The first star in our space science satellite series and the first dark matter particle detection satellite in the world.
In orbit for almost two years, four scans of the whole sky zone have been conducted and over 3.5 billion high-energy particles have been detected, resulting in the most accurate in the world.
This result was published in the international academic journal Nature.
In space, we see a new one that has not been observed before.
The significance of this research is multiple, and most importantly, it shows that Chinese scientists are using the most advanced technologies.
The ability to create scientific instruments to detect a very difficult scientific problem.
Looking for toilets by the nose, this is the memory of the last century.
I've integrated more and more human design.
A lot of tourists are impressed. The toilets are always ventilated and smellless.
Now you don't have to look at the toilet by your nose.
Not just the hardware, but the software.
The tourism sector requires toilet paper and hand-washing fluids in view areas
But in some areas
Is it because of the uncivility of the individual that this service is stopped?
Local managers made choices.
On the one hand, the promotion of savings through civilisation is accompanied by technological innovation.
In public toilets in Jiangsunanking, Cebu, etc.
Three seconds to get a free toilet paper, but another ten minutes to get a double.
Avoiding misuse of public resources
It's a habit that some tourists might actually want to put the paper back, but on the other hand, we have to reflect.
Is there no paper in the next toilet we travel to, so that's what we've been focusing on in the new three-year plan.
We need to fix this imbalance.
To push the toilet revolution deeper is to think more about what the people think.
A third toilet must be available to allow families to accompany older persons and children to the toilet.
We brought the baby, and the men's room we were embarrassed to go in.
The little girl in the bathroom is as young as he knows how to be embarrassed. The board is so comfortable that we can take the kids.
While one feels civilization, one becomes its builder. In the countryside, villagers of the Guangxi River pool are building new flush toilets at home.
Much had been achieved, and the active promotion of the toilet revolution would not only help people to stay away from disease, but also lead to economic development that would reduce regional development gaps.
This toilet problem is an overarching problem and a node of social development.
It is a national civilizational project that directs the layout from a national perspective and then involves all sides to varying degrees in solving minor social problems.
So we're all done.

State visit to my country
This important statement has given us a loud horn for a new mission and for a new march.
Starting today, NewsLift launched a series of stories entitled New Weather for a New Era.
This is the first enterprise in the world to develop an educational robot.
He chose Shanghai, and in six months he had his own team.
My dream is to make a robot of my own and to help others.
The robot needs some electrics, some rudders and some controllers, all of which can now be developed on their own.
Shanghai has introduced preferential policies
Innovative talent has also been mobilized to stay in the country and in Shanghai.
For the first time, 19 major reports called for the construction of a modern economic system and called for
Smart manufacturing firms are transitioning from traditional manufacturing industries.
In the first three quarters of the year, the value of smart manufacturing production was close to $16 billion, an increase of nearly 40 per cent over the same period. Our original business was...

In order to accelerate the shift from paper to money, local regulations have been put in place this year to promote the transformation of scientific results and services.
Ten days after the conclusion of the nineteenth Congress, Shanghai issued an additional implementation opinion to further the development of a new generation of artificial intelligence.

Researcher's average age is only 31 years.
Five more satellites will be launched in the near future.
The transformation of the chain of manufacturing industries in the country has been facilitated by the full-scale innovation of materials, devices and components.
The 19th report clearly states that China has entered a new era, and that the strong country's standards are what I personally believe is to lead.
So far, all the satellites launched by our little satellite institute have been groundbreaking, and we're not going to walk the path or chase anyone.
An interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and integrated set of large scientific industries has resulted in the overall upgrading of the original innovation capacity in Shanghai and the strategic capacity to take the lead in the development of science, technology and innovation worldwide.
In a new era, the strong momentum that innovation drives development in Shanghai is emerging.
The spirit of boldness, boldness and self-reform also stems from the fact that institutional reform has always been the key to development in Shanghai.
The 19th report of the Party states that the reform of the science and technology system should be deepened and that a system of technological innovation should be based on enterprise, market-oriented and in-depth research and development.
It is also through reform mechanisms to promote innovation and create a better climate for innovation agents.

Unity to the 19 major decisions of the Party
Poverty and death in Indonesia
Baddine Djay cooks without a stove.
She doesn't even use a pot.
Her cabin is located in Enarotali, the capital of Pania district, Papua Province, Indonesia, where the housewife usually simply puts a sweet potato — called “nota” — directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the charred potato was taken by a pair of unwashed hands and eaten in an intoxicated state.
Djay sits on the mud - she has no furniture, and this is where she does routine household chores, such as washing clothes, and washing the water is so messy that it comes from the nearby marshlands.
There was a bucket in a room without a roof, which was an outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of the four wives of her husband, so she was not assigned to the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late is dangerous: most of the men in the village are not working and many are drunk and there are many soldiers here.
She said, "No one dares walk in the village after 5:00 in the afternoon."
This is a rare glimpse of daily life in the Papua Heights, once a colony of the Netherlands, which was incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, but which was also controversial, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands before the occupying army.
The current campaign for independence and opposition to Dutch rule soon again targeted the Government of Jakarta, which had imposed high-handed rule on the region and isolated foreign journalists and defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided between Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali's location is remote and deserted; it takes 90 minutes from Chayapura in the provincial capital to get to Nabire, and then rent a car for five hours, all the way down the river.
There's no public transport here.
In this town, which is about 19,000 people, the wooden huts are surrounded by bamboo fences, wrinkled metal roofs are all kinds of brown shades made of rust.
Few Indonesians have come, let alone journalists, and few foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes.
Dayjer said, "We're not used to these clothes." She's referring to her beautiful hand-weather, her dark shirt and her beautiful half-dress.
"We used to cover our bodies with leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and has the highest infant mortality rate and lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also Indonesia's golden continent.
Paniay County is on the high ground, approximately the same size as New Jersey, with 153,000 people. The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Glasburg, is only 60 miles from here, owned by Philip McMoran Copper, based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Philips mined around $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua is rich in timber resources, estimated at $78 billion.
Yet these vast resources are also the source of the Papuan tragedy, which has enabled Indonesia's powerful military forces to keep them down.
According to a 2005 survey in The New York Times, Philips paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 for one official alone.
The growing claim of the Papuans to independence threatened the gold lord and they were subjected to cruel treatment.
According to human rights defenders, more than half a million Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killings in the Papua highlands in the 1970s escalated into genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Brisbane Parish, "We Will Lose Everything", included evidence of the most heinous acts of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, tortures, etc. Another report reported particularly widespread rape and electrocution — as well as brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
According to Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch, “violence occurs daily, making it difficult to calculate the number of victims”.
The oppression began when Papua's resources attracted large numbers of migrants outside Indonesia.
Eighty-three per cent of the province's 3.5 million people are Christians, but the demographic structure of Muslim economic migrants has changed since they arrived from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Javan snack stand sells a mix of fried chicken and vegetables with peanut butter.
The locals struggled.
Abos Yu, a Paniai local, moved to Chayapura, capital of the province, where he explained that “those immigrants began selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans.
This deprived the local Papuans — the Mama-mama — of their market.”
Indonesian President Zoko Widodo, commonly known as Zokowi, vowed to address the issue of inequality and abuse of power in Papua during his 2014 campaign.
The former carpenter's road to Jakarta's presidential palace was supported by 27 out of 29 districts — including Pania.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and today locals feel betrayed.
"We've broken our hearts, and in 2014 we voted for Zokovi, hoping that he will fulfil our wishes and restore justice."
In fact, only two months after Zokovi took office in October, Pania had the worst nightmare ever.
On 7 December 2014, in front of the bonfire, 11 children at Enarotali sang a Christmas hymn, and two Indonesian soldiers came out on a motorcycle.
The scared kids told them to turn on the headlights.
According to the local priest, Yavet Tebba, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and returned with four soldiers.
The victims and witnesses claimed that the drunken soldiers had used their guns to beat the children.
One of the soldiers then opened fire on the children.
16-year-old Julianus Yemmer was unconscious as a result of severe beatings.
A few hours later, a fire broke out in the nearby government agency Election Commission building, which escalated the following day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at a football field in front of local police stations and military command centres to demand justice.
With their ceremonial hunting bows, they danced the waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua -- running in circles and imitating birds.
Some protesters started throwing stones at regular military posts.
According to an official document read in Time magazine, when emotions continue to intensify, soldiers receive orders from their internal radios: “If the crowd resists more than three times, the execution is imminent”. However, this document was not released to the local media.
Jeremias Kayamu, 56 years old, who was the head of the Enarotali Kego Koto neighbourhood, felt threatened and appealed to the crowd to calm down and beg them to come home.
But no one is in the mood to listen to him.
He stood on the porch of his colorful cabin and told Time magazine, "When I turned back, my left wrist was shot."
Kayaki still does not know who fired the gun, but he says the bullet came from among the soldiers who gathered.
And he said, "It was crowded and they fired a lot of shots."
According to the cousin of the local Olfius Juul, he witnessed the shooting and saw Olfius Juul being shot three times.
Juhanes sadly told Time magazine, "I ran to check his body to see if it was him.
I found him dead and I kissed him."
The Chief Inspector of Papua Police, Yuje Mende, told journalists that his subordinates were merely “protected” police stations because they had been attacked.
In 2015 Papua Police spokesman, Puggio Sulistio, said, “We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us.
It's a matter of life and death.”
According to HRW, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The next day, news of the killing was spread only slowly in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi gave a passionate speech in Jayapula, expressing deep sympathy to the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical legacy of abuse in Papua.
He said, “I hope this case will be resolved as soon as possible so that this will not happen again in the future.”
In October 2016, Minister of Security Verando stated that he would establish a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
However, the pretexts for displacement are almost instantaneous.
“Most of the violations occurred long ago, he said.
Some were in the 1990s and the early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but this will require a process.”
Then, on 5 June, in Jakarta, Vilando turned his back in his conversation with Time magazine, saying that he had no plans to establish a complaints mechanism in Papua.
On the contrary, he said that “all matters will be resolved by law”.
The United Nations had filed a complaint against Vilando for “crimes against human rights” in the 1999 bloody vote for independence in East Timor, but he said that 11 human rights violations had been resolved in the Papua region, including the Pania incident.
The families of the victims of the Pania incident were snuffed by these statements.
Juhanes said, “In the last three years, I have been interviewed four times, but nothing has happened.”
Years later he said, "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I am afraid of being arrested by the army and I am afraid of being shot.”
His brother Yukabus also believed that the Pania people were afraid to talk about the incident.
He stated that he had been beaten by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
He said, "After burying the body, the military came to me."
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Dayaï district, a neighbouring district of Panai.
The manager of a construction company refused to help transport a man in a coma to a hospital, and clashes took place between the two sides, killing one and injuring 17 others, including children.
A 24-year-old man, Lavynus Dowu, drowned while fishing near the river and died on his way to hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company's field office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the police, so they fired warning shots.
However, the riot control mobile force (the Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
29-year-old Dominique Buddy told Time magazine that “we were panicking and now afraid they would take revenge”. He lived near the hospital, where he witnessed the wounded being rushed to hospital.
"I hid at home for two days."
The Deyay Parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and for the rioting mobile forces to be withdrawn from the area.
Pania has been a good place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has fuelled the grievances of the peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered in the central highlands of Panee.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army claiming to protect the rights of Papuans through scattered attacks and raids to abduct Indonesian soldiers.
Part of the senior leadership of the Free Papua Movement was born in Pania, including Tadius Yuji and Daniel Yudas Kocoa.
As a result, in recent years thousands of Panai were arrested and deliberately detained by the military under the guise of “maintaining national sovereignty”.
Some people never showed up again.
In the eyes of Papuans, Pania is a “forgotten tragic land”.
Poverty breeds discontent.
Enarotali was selling so little rice that the locals could not afford it.
The bread is far away.
The people here grow everything they can eat: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leaves and vegetables.
Farming is a woman ' s job and every woman can take care of four or five red potato fields.
They usually retain most of the harvest for writers and sell the remainder on the local market.
Ten red potatoes worth 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has spread among local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased significantly since the opening of the new route to Nabilé airport.
The few jobs available are usually in the hands of better educated and richer migrants.
Papuans have few funds or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
John Gobay, Chairman of the Paniai tribal council, stated that “young people do not want to stay in this village ... because there is no job and no money”.
Papua is isolated.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists, Frank Escudi and Basel Lonshan, were expelled from Papua because they were “not cooperating with the relevant agencies”, even though they had rarely been authorized to film.
According to the Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Ferim Kane, the electoral vow of Zokovi to lift the reporting restrictions for transparency and development was not fulfilled.
In one of his statements, he stated that “if foreign journalists attempt to cover Papua and West Papua, the most disaffected provinces in the easternmost part of Indonesia, they are at new risk: visa denial and blacklisting”.
The absence of media monitoring means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely confined to neighbouring Papuans.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “all kinds of widespread human rights violations” in Papua, including the Pania shooting.
These countries also supported the Free Papua movement.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Armanata Nasir, who did not care about the group's allegations, told journalists in Jakarta that “in Indonesia democratic institutions are still in place and media freedom makes it difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations”.
Locals want more attention from foreign governments.
According to an informed source, on 4 May, when the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights, Keith Van Bar, led a delegation of officials to Jayapura, the local people broke their silence and cried “We want freedom”. He also participated in that meeting, but requested anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote in Zokovi again.
The Chairman of the Tribal Council, Gobai, stated that “Zokovi's intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people involved in the Panai shooting”.
He wanted Zokovi to know that the Pania people lived not only under the threat of a greedy army, but also with little education and little public health care in the region.
Goba said that the Pania people, like other Papuans, believed that their vote for Zokovi was a debt he had to pay.
He said, "They don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Panai shooting made their last symbolic resistance: the burial of a victim ' s body across the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family has been killed and my family has been killed.
What else can we do?"
On 10 February 2017, the CSRC approved the initial application of Guangdong Home & House & House of Commons Ltd. and issued a small card to market the premises, which had just been approved by IPO for more than 20 days.
The industry believes that, with the convergence of the proletariat home and European home, the custom-made home sector, which was already at the windfall, will shift from product competition to capital competition.
At the beginning of the new year of approval, news of the imminent listing of a typical branded house in the home sector was customized to attract the attention of the entire household industry.
According to Reuters, 9 Beijing time, Samsung Electronics released on Tuesday a first set of auto-driving modules developed with Harman International, as well as an information entertainment solution, which is an important initiative for the company to enter the electronic market for military vehicles.
Three-star electronics acquired Haman International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Exhibition (CES) in Las Vegas this week, Samsung released car cameras with collision alerts, motorway deviation alerts, cruise control functions, which were developed in cooperation with Haman.
The Samsung project started this year with the delivery of the camera system, which is built on automatic machine learning and expansion techniques.
Samsung also displays the “digital cockpit”, which can make vehicles more personal, even if the driver is not the owner, because the system allows users to download the driver's data from mobile devices and clouds.
Tonight, the regular 20th round of the CBA is about to begin, which also means the second half of the CBA season 2016-2017.
The fire again swallowed the Dubai Torch.
On Friday, a fire broke out in one of the world's highest residential buildings in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee this high 337-metre, 79-storey super-high building.
It was the second fire in just two years to sweep the high buildings, and it happened to be a sky tower known as the torch.
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported and no cause of the fire has been identified.
“We were sleeping, and then we woke up by fire and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs, down from the 50 floors in about 10 minutes, "A resident named George told Reuters.
Civil defence authorities in Dubai stated that the fire brigade had extinguished the fire at around 0400 local time (GMT) and was in the process of cooling the building.
The Government indicated that efforts were being made to provide shelter for those affected.
The accident may have raised renewed worldwide concerns about the safety of outer-wall materials in high-rise buildings.
A survey carried out by the skylight management following its fire in 2015 found that most of the damaged objects were coated and insulated outer walls.
The British police have indicated that they believe that the problem with the insulation and overlay panel system of the Glenfield building in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire, which caused some 80 deaths.
The Williams convoy also suggested that Masa might return, although he had announced his decommissioning.
On 9 January, just one month before the opening of the Korean Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, the atmosphere in Korea has grown stronger with the transmission of preheaters from the south to the north and intensive preparations.
South Korean public opinion expects this long-defunct inter-Korean talks to bring a “coloured egg” to Ping Dong's countdown for one month.
On 1 November last year, Pyeongchang Winter Olympians arrived in Korea.
The flames of the holy fire are directly reflected in the sale of tickets to the Pingchang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the Pichang Winter Olympic ticket sales rate hovered at 32 per cent, while the Picchan Olympic ticket sales rate was only 4.3 per cent, while the low ticket sales rate had once raised concerns about Pichang Winter Olympics’ human presence.
But, as Lee Hee-fan, Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the Ping Chang Winter Olympic Games, predicted to journalists recently, “the heat of the Olympic Games is rising as they pass through various parts of Korea, believing that the sales of tickets will soon improve”.
According to Korean media reports, as of 3 January, the Pichang Winter Olympic ticket sales had reached 64 per cent and the Winter Paralympic ticket sales rate had exceeded 50 per cent.
In order to encourage foreigners to go to the Korean Games, the Korean Ministry of Justice announced on 8 days that it would extend the stay of foreigners visiting the Ping Chang Winter Olympics to a maximum of 120 days.
The investigation found that more than one fifth of American travellers boarded with prohibited goods
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had deliberately or inadvertently carried illegal items through the U.S. Transportation Safety Authority checkpoint and that at least 6 per cent of those passengers had intentionally carried prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1 per cent of the passengers claimed that they had only subsequently discovered travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The investigation, which targeted more than 1,000 people, was conducted by the air charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., and found that young travellers were more likely to be in flagrant disregard of regulations.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had attempted to board the plane with TSA prohibited items, 19.7 per cent were from the millennium generation, compared to less than 15 per cent from the X generation.
The most common items that deliberately slip past TSA inspectors are food and beverages.
More than 3 per cent of the respondents admitted that they had intentionally carried a blade through security checks, while 2.2 per cent of the female respondents and 3.7 per cent of the male respondents indicated that they had deliberately carried prohibited drugs.
According to the company, the purpose of this investigation of the country ' s travellers was to ascertain the number of people who had accidentally carried and deliberately carried embargoed items on board the aircraft for security purposes.
It is no surprise that those who are most likely to carry embargoed items under security control — intentionally or unintentionally — are those who fly most frequently.
However, it noted that the TSA Guide was somewhat complicated and difficult to understand.
People are often uncertain about what liquids they can carry.
It is not surprising, therefore, that TSA has seized the most illegal liquid.
At one point, it was thought that TSA might have considered books as embargoed.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Director, Prout, changed his mind about the Obama-era cuts.
One day after being sued by 15 states, the Director of Environmental Protection, Scott Prout, changed his earlier decision to postpone implementation of the Obama-era air pollution reduction provisions.
This change was proposed by Plut because the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state environmental regulatory bodies than the previous Government.
He does not refer to the legal challenges raised by the Federal Court of Appeal against his predecessor.
The debate focused on setting 1 October as the deadline for states to begin to meet the 2015 ground-based ozone standards.
In June, Prute announced that he would delay compliance for one year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and to avoid “disturbing local decision-making or impeding economic growth”.
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Prout was the Attorney-General of Oklahoma State, who had long opposed the tightening of environmental regulations.
Since its arrival in Washington, Prout has repeatedly turned to regulations that prevent or delay opposition from the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden reversal on Wednesday is one of the most recent legal obstacles to the transfer of Prut regulation back to the agenda.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Director of Environmental Protection had exceeded his authority, attempting to delay the implementation of the Obama administration ' s requirement that oil and gas companies monitor and reduce methane spills.
In a statement released on Wednesday night, Pruit presented a sharp shift in his attitude towards ozone standards, expressing his commitment to strengthening the Environmental Protection Agency, working with the states to implement complex procedures to reach new standards.
According to Prout, “the EPA, under the previous government administration, usually falls short of the specified deadline and then waits for radical groups and others to sue and then agree to set the designated timetable by agreement”. In his previous work, he initiated dozens of prosecutions against the Environmental Protection Agency.
“We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We take the regulations and the authorities seriously.”
Nevertheless, the EPA statement indicates that Prout may again use his “extended authorization and all other legally available authorizations” to ensure that the provisions are “good policy and best available information”.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wide rewriting of ozone layer regulations.
The House of Representatives Bill, approved last month, aims to delay the 2015 rule for at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney Eric Schneiderman led the state coalition this week against the United States Environmental Protection Agency for its intention to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman says, "The reverse of the US EPA -- after we have filed a lawsuit -- is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with more than 115 million American communities directly affected by smoke."
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C., joined the New York State in this case.
Ground-based ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants from cars, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke causes serious respiratory problems for sensitive populations, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists hailed the surprising transformation of Plut.
The Center for Biodiversity, Lori Ann Byrd, stated: “It is disturbing that this common sense measure is under great pressure from the heads of the departments that protect the air we need to breathe.”
“We must fight the Trump Government's ideological campaign to cater to polluters and special interest groups.”

Yesterday, there were live competitions over two lands located in the mountains, which were at a high level, with a total of 1,845.2 million yuan.
Recently, the Japanese animated " Your Name " in Asia, and in Japan, after becoming the director of Miyazaki ' s " Thousands and Thousands " , for the first time in 15 years, the 20 billion yen video was broken to top the second place in the ticket office.
Since the second half of 2009, there has been a relatively high level of sales of sushi wood, especially this spring, when the sales of sushi trees have reached a record high, with a sharp increase in sales and prices. According to statistics, revenues from the sale of sushi trees in the mountains in January-June of this year increased by 48 per cent over the same period last year, the largest increase being in almost 20 years.
The Deputy Director of the Shaw Mountain Forestry Authority, Shae Yong, stated that, along with good marketing, the production of Xiaoshan flowers had grown relatively rapidly.
In the last two years, the area under squalid forest cultivation has increased by 30,000 acres to a total area of 180,000 acres, while it has also been active out of the region, with a squalid farmer building up to 80,000 acres nationwide, an increase of 30,000 acres over 2008.
The expansion of the area under cultivation has been accompanied by an increase in the quality of the trees, an increase in the value of the nursery stock, higher levels of retention of large-specified, high-quality trees and the sale of some of them.
Shihyong also warned that, in the face of the current boom, producers should face up to the need for a calm and objective analysis, both of the long-term and growing demand for flowers in society and of the increased competition in the market.
On the morning of 13 July, Beijing time, the United States company Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the Eastern Texas District Court, alleging that apples had violated a battery technology patent it had applied for in 2010.
The company has also been sued on the same patent before, against Huashu, Consort, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.
The action alleges that both iPhone 6s and similar apple equipment violated United States patent No. 7,657,386 entitled Integrated Battery Services System.
The plaintiff wished to receive cash compensation or to charge patent fees for tort equipment after the judgement was pronounced.
It appears from the indictment that the plaintiff argued that the iPhone ' s fast-fill function violated the company ' s patent.
The iPhone with a fast charge will rapidly charge up to 80%, followed by a trickle-down charge.
Somaltus was in fact a so-called “patent hooligan” because the company did not provide obvious products and services and it was difficult to find relevant information online.
However, they have succeeded in reaching an out-of-court settlement on the patent with automobile manufacturers such as Ford and Japanese products.
The meeting recognized the importance of accelerating the development of information, promoting the integration and efficient use of resources, and increasing the digital and intellectual level of industry, in order to promote “China's production of 2025” and popular entrepreneurship and innovation, to foster new dynamics and to improve the quality of life of the population.
Taiwan's hot-blooded young film, The Six-Café, by Dong Qiang, is a major media award competition for this festival, while another Chinese-language film, The Drum, by him, competes for the Golden Lord's Award.
He was 23 years old, dressed in coloured T-shirts, black sweatpants and a young sun. Because there were not enough chairs in the interview room, he sat directly on the floor and said, "Come on, it's good to talk."
As previously disclosed, the railway sector has implemented an expansion of the 12306 website, introduced new services during spring tickets, and nearly 60 per cent of tickets no longer require authentication codes.
According to leaked phone records, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall at the border.
The Washington Post leaked records of conversations between United States President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On 27 January, during a call to the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly expressing his intention not to pay for the proposed border wall.
It was reported that the President of the United States was dissatisfied with his public criticism of the wall, allegedly stating to him that “You do not tell the media”.
During the presidential campaign, Trump pledged to build the separation wall on the southern border of the United States and solemnly announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
A record of his conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also published, which revealed a tense exchange between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the United States assumed that the refugee repatriation deal to Australia was “puzzling”, “obnoxious” and “stupid”, that he had recommended that the United States ban the resettlement of refugees, and now insisted that the Obama administration brokered the deal, which would make him look like a “wit”.
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull that this was the most unpleasant call today.
In the award-winning speech read on behalf of the United States Ambassador to Sweden, Dylan stated that he was on his way to the show when he received the award, “I took a while to respond”.

On January 9th in Seoul, Xinhua (journalist Rui Jie Guang Peng) South Korea and North Korea concluded their high-level talks at Panmunjom on the night of the 9th, when they issued a joint statement agreeing on the DPRK's participation in the Ping Chang Winter Olympics and the holding of military sector talks between the two sides.
According to the joint statement issued by the two sides, the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea will send a high-level delegation and a delegation of the National Olympic Committee to the Pingchang Olympic Games.
In addition, the Korean side will send groups such as athletes ' groups, cheerleaders, artists ' groups and journalists ' groups to visit the country; the Korean side will provide the necessary facilities for this.
It also agreed to ease the current military tension and decided to hold talks between the military components of the Korea.
The report analyses the results of the survey of 1045 foreign tourists who visited Seoul last December.
According to the report, the per capita purchase of foreign tourists is 1.06 million won.
Of these, China has the largest per capita number of tourists, 2.13 million won, 6.5 times the number of Japanese tourists and 3.2 times the number of American and European tourists.
Asked about the purpose of travelling to Seoul, 62.2 per cent of Chinese tourists answered “shopping”, and 94.9 per cent of Chinese tourists bought cosmetics.
96.3 per cent of Chinese tourists shop at duty-free shops in urban areas at a cost of 1.56 million won per person.

The Moor Beach Tragic: A return to racist lynching and justice for activists
In 1948, a Ford Mercury car came through a crowd of viewers in the town of Monroe, Georgia, running towards the tiny Moor Beach Bridge.
The vehicle, carrying four black passengers and one white driver, was blocked by a group of white men with guns before it reached the bridge.
The mob leader-- a middle-aged man in a striped suit-- takes a deep sip of cigars, eyes in the windshield.
The passengers in the car were full of fear.
"We want-Roger!" The man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged down from an ex-passenger seat and screamed into silence.
Fortunately, July 22nd, this terrible scene was just a repeat.
But when Roger's neck was covered with a cord, almost all the viewers made a real gasp.
Since 2005, civil rights activists returned to the Moor Beach Bridge, where two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Merey Dossy - were hanged in 1946 by the three K parties.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
“Although we know who they are, and although we have seen them in the community, it is incredible that none of them has been arrested over the years” Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize this recurrence, said.
“This is a stain on history and a burden on our souls.”
Brooks, 71 years old, was a former Georgia congressman and a lifetime defender.
For him, the repetition was a dramatic call that reminded the people of the Monroe community every year that injustice had never been corrected.
“We want to sue, we want to close, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we must first get justice”, he said.
“We will not be cured and reconciled unless we have justice.”
On July 27, 1946, the Coroner placed a bed sheet on the body of a lynching victim at Moore Beach.
According to FBI files obtained by the National Broadcasting Corporation News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in lynchings.
None of them has been prosecuted.
Although suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists have indicated that the dual motive for lynching is well known throughout the town: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens of Georgia to vote in the initial elections for the first time later in the summer.
According to the FBI, at about the same time, the black tenant Roger Malcolm assassinated the white landlord, Bannet Hearst, in a struggle that looked like it was for a woman.
According to Brooks, the rumor in town was that Herst slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and her baby was not her husband's.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946, a prominent white landlord, Roy Harrison, spent $600 bailing Malcolm out of prison.
Dorothy and cousins McMerry and George Dorsey accompanied him to prison.
However, when they returned from prison to the Moor Beach Bridge, a group of vigilantes surrounded the car.
“It turns out that Harrison organized and ordered the murder”, an FBI report concluded.
“It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement authorities, who not only participated in the murder, destroyed evidence, but also concealed the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks is very brief.
He said, “This is a vote tragedy”.
“They were killed by the murderer who sent a message to the black people in the community: `If you register and vote, you will suffer the same fate.”
For almost a decade, Cassandra Green has been in charge of leading the annual re-emergence of the Moor Beach lynching.
Her behaviour is well-articulated, distasteful and racist. Many wanted that racism to cease to exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, it's harder not to look, but Green says it's the key.
“We do not want to talk about lynching, because it exposes us to the ugly face of all”, she said.
“But if you don't listen to me, or if you don't hear me tell my story, I can't have a relationship with you.”
This year's show started in June, and on the first day there were almost 30 actors -- a dozen whites, the rest blacks -- sitting in a room, listening to Green's rehearsing show overview.
Wade Malbau was co-director of Green.
He's been playing the Klan for years, but he says it's never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like this," said Malbau.
“But I think it is very important to keep this history alive, because we don't want to go back to that era.”
In the room, the actors Roger Malcolm and Barnetthurst, Darios Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, rehearsed their lines.
At the beginning of the play, Malcolm shouted and pushed Herst away, outraged that he had slept with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said, get out of my land!"
Rascona echoes.
And then they fight.
And then everybody laughs.
Green laughs the best.
"What's wrong?" Lascona asked.
He was scared and confused.
Am I overplaying it?
"No," Green laughs.
"I just don't think white people say, "Aah."
"Yes," another black actor plays funny.
"You must speak hard."
So the energy in the room has changed; the feeling of fraternity has driven away.
Everyone tried to do so not only to perform the play, but also to honour the four victims.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona said the word "aah," it was sharp and powerful.
No one laughs.
Again, the end was strong and swift.
Screams, guns, then silence.
A woman in the black dress of her funeral was standing by the body of an actor singing the sad words of Billy Haladay, “the strange fruit”.
Her voice overtook other words.
A hundred yards away, about 40 viewers were wiping their sweats and tears.
Blacks and whites account for almost half of the audience.
A couple came to see the show from Ithaca, New York, and many lived near the road.
Brooks took them to Malcolm and Dorothy's graveyards where they were worshipping for almost eight hours, and everyone was suffering from Georgia's uncomfortable wet fever.
Until then, the murderer remained a mystery. But now, in the same land where lynchings take place, there is anxiety in the air.
When the last note of the song disappeared, Green asked people to come closer and examine the bodies played by actors.
The children bowed down, watched fake blood and bodies, whispering to each other.

American media: Chinese Air Force Engineering University scientists research laser satellites for space garbage removal
On January 18, the Reference News Network reported that Chinese scientists had put forward a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up a chaotic Earth orbit and destroy old satellites and their sky litter.
According to the United States Newsweek website, on 15 January, researchers from the Chinese Air Force Engineering University prepared a paper entitled " Space-based laser removal small-scale space debris reorbiting model studies " , which described how space debris could be exposed to less hazardous pieces of laser radiation through the use of space-based platform lasers.
It was reported that space debris had been an issue of concern to international space agencies for many years, and NASA had considered options for tracking, detecting and removing man-made debris.
Large-scale space debris is removed through giant networks used to clean and collect waste and by magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean up Earth orbits.
The summary of the paper states: “(imisto) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based platform laser technology for space debris removal.”
A 2014 study by the United States defence giant Lockheed-Martin found that there were approximately 200 threats per day for satellites operating in orbit.
High-speed debris moving along Earth orbit is considered a serious threat to future space missions and is described by ESA experts as “a lethal chain of threats”. High-speed debris has continued to increase over the past year.
It was also reported on 17 January on the United States website for the monthly Mass Machine that space was largely empty, but that space was becoming increasingly crowded near the Earth. Each satellite that we send into space eventually becomes another piece of debris that orbits the Earth and that accumulates over time.
The more debris, the higher the probability that a satellite will be hit by debris, the more it will damage or destroy an investment worth millions of dollars.
Reports indicate that all space agencies have plans to remove space debris in the future.
NASA is considering the use of jet gas to reduce the speed of debris from orbit, Europe is considering launching a satellite with a large web to capture debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan is thinking of capturing debris with an electric chain.
At the present time, China has also proposed a solution to the problem of space debris, namely, the use of a large laser to crush floating space debris into less harmful pieces.
According to a paper published by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University in the monthly German newspaper Optical, the installation of such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean up space, at least on the basis of simulation results.
It was reported that the only way to prove effectiveness was to test and that there were currently no arrangements for such missions, but that perhaps sooner or later someone would install lasers on satellites and send them into space.
Once we have done so, we can finally begin to eliminate the problem of space debris once and for all.

The violence highlighted the precarious security situation in the country at a time when United States President Donald Trump weighed the increase in Afghan troops and police.
According to journalists, the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the Government and its policies, in particular the reputation of Ashraf Ghani.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lawsuit overturning resolution and delaying smoke regulations
During his tenure, Obama made a requirement for states to contain all types of smoke-induced emissions, and states prosecuted the United States National Environmental Protection Agency for that provision. One day after the indictment, EPA overturned the provision.
The US EPA announced on Wednesday its decision to continue the so-called “Ozone Compliance Area 2015” and committed EPA to working with the states.
In a statement, US EPA Director Scott Pruit said, “We are confident in dialogue with national partners and are committed to responding to them”.
In June, Pruit announced that the EPA planned to postpone the application of the ozone compliance area standards to October 2018 for a period of one year, according to which existing smoke contamination in some areas would be measured to determine which areas should be reduced to meet air quality standards.
This action was brought on Tuesday by the major Democratic states and the District of Columbia, claiming that it was illegal.
As part of the broader agenda, the authorities of President Donald Trump have been working to restore the environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama to stimulate economic growth.
However, these efforts provoked opposition from the Democratic Party and conservative groups. They feared that further emissions would affect public health.
The US EPA website claims that breathing ozone-containing air “would reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma”.

McGi García and Vassili Lomachenko met for the first time to discuss a possible future duel.
The most striking 147-pound boxing competition will be held shortly, and Vasily Lomachenko and Mackey Garcia meet for the first time on Thursday in a state of potential conflict.
In their separate rooms at the ESN office in Los Angeles, the undefeated World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion García led the way down the corridor and paid tribute to the World Boxing Organization Superfine Champion, Lomachenko.
At the Showtime boxing on Saturday, the referee unanimously concluded that García had defeated Adrien Brona, the world champion of the four divisions, and that both fighters had become the top five on the same weight list.
Jasira's right hand says, "How are you, champ?
Good luck."
On Saturday night, at 7 p.m. in the ESPN competition, Lomachenko defeated Miguel Mariaga and preserved his position.
When both of them took photographs, Egis Klimas, the manager of Lomachenko, pointed out that the potential rivalry between the two players depended on “perfect size”.
"I was lightweight before," Jasira.
"I'm up to battle for Brona, but I'm not that big.
I'm a little less than 140 pounds.
I want to go back light.
And he has to be lightweight (135 pounds) before we fight.
That's what fans want.
Then we'll satisfy them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing community needs this battle."
Some of his strategy was to get Lomachenko to start with a 135-pound player later this year, thinking of a date with Garcia next summer. García is also interested in fighting with Jorge Linares-Luque Campbell after the Lightweight Championship of the Forum on September 23.
“Because all the fans are asking this question, the war may be a second-rate battle,” García says. He then expressed his openness to competitions on networks that offered the best financial options.
“We are the main figures.
Others could not have been so focused.
As long as they're ready..."
García praised Lomachenko as an “excellent player” and probably watched his Saturday boxing match.
But Lomachenko hesitated about García's praise, saying he thought that the three-division champion from Riverside seemed “slow”. I'm sorry, Mikey, but you're gonna be out."
García said that the focus was on displaying the power of fists and then boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their fights.
“This is the battle that must be fought.
Attention and heat are beyond the reach of other boxing competitions.
I'm very happy to be in the race," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, “I've been waiting for the top warriors, and it's Mikey's turn.
This will be a great battle.”

China’s CSD officials have expressed their views on the early completion of the 11-5 reduction target, giving strong expectations for the resumption of the restricted steel industry.
Although the steel plant has not received a clear notification from the local government that the energy-saving reduction effort has been completed, it is estimated that on or about 15 December 2010, steel plants that were previously limited in production will be restarted and steel prices may begin to contain.
No notice has been received of the end of the electricity cut-off, but in fact the pressure on businesses was much lower than in September/October when a private steel company in Hebei province told journalists.
In the northern part of the river, electricity-limiting documents have been repeatedly issued and, at one point, the production of enterprises has been restricted by forced locks.
Journalists have learned from local businesses that steel factories in most of Hebei have now been reopened and that production restrictions have eased.
My steel grid analyst, Zhang Tieshan, predicts that the end demand for construction steel will gradually shift from strong to weak, as the north is already in winter.
Together with the phasing out of energy-saving emission reductions, most steel plants will be largely restored by 15 December, with products arriving in local markets by New Year ' s Day.
Increased resource availability will put some pressure on the price of steel, which is currently on the right rise.

Update on the results of the Swedish age assessment test for asylum-seekers
The latest results of the medical assessment of the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden, using the latest methodology, show that more than 80 per cent of those tested were found to be over 18 years of age, but not all believed in their accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (R?ttsmediacinalverket) started the test earlier this year.
When it was alleged that the age of some of the refugees claiming to be minors had not been accurately assessed, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) designed these tests with a view to conducting a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Immigration Service has sent 6880 testers, and the results of a total of 2481 testers between mid-March and 31 July 2017 have been published by the Centre for Forensic Medicine.
Eighty per cent (persons) were convicted of having reached the age of 18 or more, but in 25 other tests, the Swedish National Centre of Forensic Medicine found that the subject “may have reached the age of 18 or more”.
In 432 tests, the result was that the person “may be under 18 years of age”.
Tests are only for people of questionable age.
According to John Graham of the Forensic Medical Centre, these results are consistent with those of previous months.
He told The Local: “These data are not very different from those of previous months, and the figures are very consistent.”
The high proportion of cases in which the age of 18 was determined did not necessarily mean that the asylum-seekers had falsely stated their age.
In May, the Centre published 581 test results and stated that there were 442 “showing that the person was 18 years or older”.
The news newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of 581 tests published and found that 243 of them had publicly indicated that they would be 18 years old this year.
An X-ray examination of intellectual teeth and an MRI scan of joints, followed by an analysis by dentists and radiologists, has also been questioned in some areas.
One of the suspects is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have gone through puberty earlier or later than normal age.
He told the press paper Metro: “I have reason to think so, and I don't think the measurement used should be this way.
The determination of biological age in this way is inaccurate.
If we cannot guarantee accuracy, we should not pretend that we can do it.”
However, Grayson of the Forensic Medicine Centre defended the accuracy of these tests: “It is generally possible to say that there is little risk of determining that a child is an adult”.
The greatest risk is that the person is just under 18 years of age, which is about 10 per cent.
The governor of West Virginia announced a change of party.
Thursday evening, Jim Justice, Governor of the West Virginia Democratic Party, announced at a rally of President Trump that he would change his party.
The Democrats have left me, according to the Governor.
“Today, after a great deal of prayer and a great deal of thought, I would like to tell you that today I, as a West Virginian, will no longer be able to help you as Governor of the Democratic Party.”
The rally broke out cheering.
“So tomorrow, I will convert the party into a Republican”, said Justice.
"As a coach, I'll tell you it's time to start another race."
At an earlier gathering in West Virginia, Trump promised to make a major announcement.
Mr. Trump won 42 per cent of West Virginia's votes, while Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice was selected as the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
Forbes stated that he inherited his father ' s coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.
At present, he is worth approximately US$ 15.9 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on the evening of Thursday, stating that “the change of Governor Jastis was another blow to the Democratic Party, which would not prevent our country from becoming great again, but would make our country great again”.
“Democrats currently have only 15 governors and have the lowest number of state councils in their history, and Governor Justice’s statement is the latest rejection of a party that has lost its leadership from top to bottom and has been unable to find an active unifying slogan.” Rona McDaniel, President of the Republican National Council, claimed in a statement to the CBS News.

Sebastian Ko praised Russia for its "scientific" apology for the doping scandal.
On Thursday, Sebastian Ko, President of the International Association of Fields and Fields, expressed his appreciation to Russia for its apology for the doping scandal and stated that it was “open”, but reiterated that this was not the time for Russia to rejoin the campaign.
The President of the Russian Federation of Fields and Fields, Mitri Hiractin, stated at the Congress of the International Federation of Fields, held on the eve of the World Fields and Fields Championship, that his country was right to be prohibited from participating in the campaign and that he was determined to combat stimulants.
He expressed his regret that “all athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were denied medals”.
Despite his comments, the Congress had voted in favour of maintaining the ban. Previously, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report mentioned the discovery of evidence of State-sponsored use of stimulants in Russia, and the ban was imposed in November 2015.
“I think the response today is very frank and very frank,” the President of the International Federation of Fields told the press.
“The Council as a whole and the General Assembly of Tanaka are pleased ... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has gone through a very hot period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can resume its participation.”
He said that he was also “happy” that Russia had accepted the criteria for re-entry.
“I think this is a very constructive day, and I think that we have made some progress, but it is not yet the time to reinstate Russia's eligibility to participate in the panel's recommendations,” said the Section.
“We need to do everything we can to normalize this situation in the coming months.
Our guiding principle has been the desire to separate innocent athletes from contaminated systems,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the International Federation of Fields, will participate as neutral players in the World Fields and Fields Championship on Friday in London.
On Monday, the head of the field unit of the United International Federation indicated that Russia had not met a number of criteria for resuming its participation.
Following his speech to the International Federation in London, he told journalists that drug testing was still inadequate and prohibited trainers were still teaching.

The median value of RMB 6.4401 depreciated at 66 base points, and the increase was delayed.
Macroeconomically, information-sharing 2018-01-18 09:50
On 18 January, the median value of the renminbi against the United States dollar was reported at 6.4401, resulting in a depreciation of 66 basis points on the previous trading day, ending the previous five consecutive increases.
In the overnight market, the dollar warms and the dollar index moves out of the V type, reporting 90.8900 as at 07:30 Beijing time.
According to the Federal Reserve’s publication of the economic brown paper, almost all of the 12 Federal Reserve regions reported moderate to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018, maintaining optimism about this year’s prospects.
At the same time, unemployment in the United States remained at 4.1 per cent in December, the lowest since 2000, and businesses are expected to increase their wages in the coming months.
The Federal Reserve officials generally agreed that tax changes were a factor supporting this modest and robust economic outlook, and the Federal Reserve projected a 2.5 per cent growth rate and a three-time increase in interest rates in 2018.
Marketers have pointed out that, in recent times, the ECB’s monetary policy has tightened its expectations of pushing up the euro exchange rate, that the dollar index has declined continuously, and that there has been a corresponding wave of rapid increases in the renminbi’s exchange rate against the dollar. However, it is unlikely that the ECB will adjust its policy stance soon, that short-term fluctuations in foreign exchange markets will eventually lead to a return to fundamentals, and that the continued smooth operation of the renminbi’s exchange rate is an approximate event.
It is worth noting that, as markets are expected to stabilize the renminbi, the attractiveness of the renminbi assets to foreign investors has become more pronounced.
The People ' s Bank of China authorized the China Foreign Exchange Exchange Centre to declare the median exchange rate of the inter-bank foreign exchange market on 18 January 2018 as follows: US$ 6.8546, 1 Swiss franc to the RMB 6.6731, 1 Canadian dollar to the RMB 5.1747, 1 euro to the RMB 7.8482, 100 yen to the RMB 5.7854, 1 Hong Kong dollar to the RMB 0.82399, 1 pound sterling to the RMB 8.9017, 1 Australian dollar to the RMB 5.1302, 1 New Zealand dollar to the RMB 4.6779, 1 Singapore dollar to the RMB 4.8546, 1 Swiss franc to the RMB 1 to the RMB 6.673, 1 Canadian dollar to the RMB 5.1747, 1 yuan to the RMB 1 to the RMB 0.61399, 1 yuan to the RMB 1 to the RMB 8.8352, 1 Hong Kong dollar to the RMB 1 to the RMB 1.930, 1 yuan to the People ' s RMB 1.91, 1 RMB 1 to the People ' s RMB 0.190, 1 RMB 1 to the Government of the Republic of the amount of the Republic

The Hubei police brought down four transnational telecommunications fraud syndicates and over 500 cases involving over $70 million in 31 provinces and counties.
The journalist Cai Changchun, Journalist of the Rule of Law, has learned from the Ministry of Public Security today that the fraud of the transnational telecommunications network, which was discovered in cooperation with the Malaysian Police, was a more representative case of a telecommunications network fraud in Taiwan under the command of the Ministry of Public Security and the Kubeiyang Police.
What's the impact of football financial rules on Neymar's transition to Paris?
The rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending at European football clubs are not obstacles. Mal moved from the Barcelona Club in Spain to the San Germain Football Club in Paris (PSG) in France at record prices.
As a result, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has further downgraded the football club in San German in Paris. The Union of European Football Associations, which is the governing body for European football games, has the right to prohibit teams from participating in highly visible championships.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules (FFP) launched by FIFA in 2011 mean that the Paris St. Germain Football Club must ultimately prove that Nemar’s transfer is funded without causing significant losses.
The Barcelona Club has already paid €222 billion ($262 million) just to pay the Brazilian player's severance, and Nemar's salary will be tens of millions of dollars per year.
Below are some of the financial implications of the transfer of Nemar to France.
Taking into account that the team is funded by the ruling family of Qatar, which is rich and rich, the San German Football Club in Paris can, of course, contract Nemar in cash and include him in the ranks of other stars.
Clubs can buy players at great expense, but they must use legal sources of income to make up for the huge sums spent, so that they can achieve a balance of gains and losses in football-related operations.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules were conceived by Michel Platini after his election as the President of FIFA in 2007.
According to the former French player, if the bank or the owner withdraws their support funds, they are actually deceiving and putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from club debt to club loss monitoring.
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich when he bought the Chelsea Club in 2003 – that is, buying a potential club, then spending a lot of money to improve the team and create a global brand – is now more demanding.
During the three-year rule assessment period up to 2018, the club could lose Euro30 million.
Despite Abu’s denigration by the then President in 2015, UEFA’s successor, Alexander Ceferin, remained committed to stopping excessive spending.
“Of course the Rules have not expired, and we will certainly strengthen future regulations.” UEFA told the Associated Press last week about Andrew Traverso, who is responsible for the Rules.
Although the San German Football Club in Paris will pay off Nemar ' s buyout terms in a lump sum, it can also distribute the amounts for accounting purposes over the duration of the contract.
As Nemar had signed a five-year agreement, the transfer of contributions might show costs of Euro44.4 million in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of Rules sanctions imposed in 2014 resulted in the most severe sanctions being imposed on the San Germain Football Club in Paris and the Manchester City Club under Abu Dhabi.
The Paris St. Germain Football Club was fined Euro60 million ($82 million at the time) and then reduced to Euro20 million, demanding that the championship leagues in the 2014-15 season reduce the number of players to 21 instead of the normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking at clubs that try to raise income by linking with club owners and deceive financial regulators.
Although companies in Qatar could sponsor the St. Germain Football Club in Paris, UEFA would not regard the amount of sponsorship as legal income if it was considered to exceed the standard market price.
This was what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount of Qatar Tourist Board sponsorship of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris had been exaggerated.
It is reported that part of the income of Nemar at the St. Germain Football Club in Paris may come from payments made by the Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee in 2022.
However, both the Paris football club in St. Germain and the organizing committee denied that Nemar would be the World Cup ambassador, but such an initiative would be easy for UEFA regulators.
The recent sanctions imposed on the San Germain Football Club in Paris meant that FIFA would be more vigilant about any attempt to circumvent the rules.
According to the source on Thursday, UEFA did not pre-discuss with the St. Germain Football Club in Paris about Nemar ' s transfer.
All of the above-mentioned persons have approached the Associated Press only in an anonymous capacity, as they were not authorized to discuss the situation at the San German Football Club in Paris.
The last published accounts show that the Paris San German Football Club earned 542.4 million euros in 2015-16 and earned more than 10 million euros.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year had not been disclosed.
The Paris San Germain Football Club anticipates that Nemar's association will bring evangelization to sponsorship, franchising and the sale of jerseys.
The club is expected to grow by at least 30 per cent to sign off on Nemar.
It is clear that the Spanish coalition, which saw one of the most famous players leave, was deeply angry at the attempt to obstruct Nemar ' s move and claimed that the San Germain Football Club in Paris violated the Rules.
Chairman Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS that “this is a clear example of a `financial stimulant' that is the same for clubs and countries” and that it refers to Qatar, which has the ultimate ownership of the San German Football Club in Paris.
Arsene Wenger, the principal coach of the Arsenal team (all the club's owners are American sports tycoon), has reservations about the attitude of state-funded clubs and the U.S.C.C.C.
"This is the consequence of ownership, which has completely changed the entire ecology of the last 15 years of football," said Winge on Thursday.
“When the State owns a club, everything happens.
This would make compliance with the Rules very difficult, as there are many different ways or interests for a State to require a large player to represent a State.”
Rokid, an intellectual interactive robot developer, has received a new investment.
In recent years, start-ups in the area of artificial intelligence have continued to attract capital.
An artificial intelligence, Rokid, has recently completed a new round of financing, which is led by the tamarthics, with Swiss credit, CIDB (an investment agency under the umbrella of Taiwan’s Development Finance Holdings), and old shareholders IDG capital.
It is known that the current round of financing is about $100 million in size, and for the first time Swiss letters and CDIB have appeared in domestic financing transactions in the area of artificial intelligence.
Rokid is a researcher for smart interactive robots, dedicated to research in the robotic field, with products that manipulate home-based smart devices, enable continuous self-learning and growth, and recognize, understand, provide feedback, etc.
This round of finance will be used primarily for R & D, talent introduction, strategic promotion and investment in the industrial chain.
Prior to that, in August 2014, Rokid had access to IDG, linear capital, Mfund and dollar capital for $8.3 million in angel rounds. In October 2015, the company received an additional tens of millions of dollars in round A from the Wadden International leading, angel investors and investment; On 1 November 2016, Rokid completed the B round of IDG, Mfund, Yuanmin Capital, Warden International and others.
Rokid stated at the time that the post-B round of finance company valuation had reached $450 million.
In May 2017, Rokid released a consumer-grade smart voice robot, Joachi Moonstone, which combines artificial intelligence and family scenes at a price of $1399.
The robots use speech synthesis, natural language understanding, speech recognition and microphone array technology, and are able to talk, play music, and live in smart homes.
The International Consumer Electronics Fair (CES) Tech For A Better World and Home Audio/Video Components and Accessors, as well as the German IF Design Award, in the name of Oscar of the design community, were won.
On the recently concluded 2018 CES, Rokid released a new product: Consumer-Level Enhancement Real Realistic ARGlass.
The lenses will be used independently, i.e. without connection to smartphones or external computers, and are expected to be commercialized by 2018.
Prior to this, the company had released the first generation of family robot Rokidalien and the second generation smart soundbox RokidPebble.

Recapitulating this story is a tribute to the great years of the '80s and the garbage age of the '90s (David Wayne and Michael Shawart made a sketch of the state for MTV); it is also a memory of the past itself, and of the year 2001, when so many of the stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Luther, did not rise.
As a cultural art, it is an imitation and expression of our permanent memory of the Facebook age.

The first day of the camp was strongly resonated, but not only because of its ridiculous humor (the original story of a talking vegetable canned by H. Jon Benjamin).
In the scene, the double use of the core joke -- middle-aged actors playing children of the age of trouble -- made it impossible to go back into the past and become a funny part of it.
Ten years later, adults actually played adult roles, and emotions were not too deep, and imitations were more widespread, including improvisation of films that followed the 1990s, such as The Hand of the cradle.
At some point, a character was trapped in an apple notebook, some straight skates and something else from 1991.

This comedy, written by Brian Gatwood and Alexandro Tanaka, was pushed onto a television screen by director Reese Thomas: it was a comedy film of the brother-in-law, set in Romania in the 1980s, about two Bucharest officials fighting for truth, atheisticism and Marx Leninism.
The main players - Grigor, hard-core, and Ethel, idealist - were respectively Florin Pierce, Jr., and Cornelius Ulić, who spoke in English by Chanin Tatum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levet.

And there's a lot of celebrities -- including Jenny Slater, Nick Ofman, Mahsala Hashbaz Ali and Kolo Sevini -- who made a great sound gathering.

Recent interviews by journalists have revealed a general decline and even loss of benefits in the north-east sector in the fields of steel, rail transport, ships, machinery, etc.
In the view of some experts, under the current circumstances, the new round of industrial revitalization in the north-east is not only related to the current round of national economic recovery, but will also have an impact on the long-term development of our manufacturing industry and international competitiveness and therefore needs to be adjusted for transformation.
The general decline in business efficiency in traditional industries, which has lost much, if not much, on the raw materials industry and the manufacturing of heavy machinery and equipment, is the primary expression of the current economic downturn in the north-central and north-eastern industries.
In the past, lower-end and lower-end industrial products were affected by economic fluctuations, mainly low-end and high-impact primary products.
In previous years, the saddle steel group (Webbo) began with a restructuring of its products, focusing on the development of high-end plates such as container boards, steel tracks, shipboards and civilian electric panels, but this year the sales of these varieties have fallen considerably, particularly by 50 per cent from the sales of the same period last year.
The stock of saddle steel (Hou Kyung-soon, Director of the Metallurgy Division of the CTI of Liaoning Province, described metallurgy as the third pillar of Liaoning ' s industry, with 60 million tons of iron and steel produced annually in third place in the country.
In January-May of this year, Liaoning Province produced 2,154,000 tons of crude steel, and the production and distribution of products needed for projects encouraged by State policies and built by local governments was better, and the decline in more competitive products in the market was another feature of the north-east manufacturing sector.

Yang Yang, who had had a right ear surgery just a few days ago, showed himself for the first time after his injuries, explaining that his role was “unsatisfied” and he had always worked in silence to hide all his feelings.
Yang Yang expressed the need to mobilize all the emotions in order to convey to the audience the insinuation of the role, “This is a new challenge for my performance, and I am really about to suffocate my internal wounds during the performance”.
Liu Yofei revealed that when he was doing the film, he was crying to death.
The Japan Olympic Committee has recently indicated that the Japanese delegation ' s goal for the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020 is to have 30 gold medals and to advance to the top three gold medals.
Last October, the Chairman of the Olympic Committee Sports Committee of Japan, Tae-Yu Yamayama, indicated that the total number of gold medals expected from Japanese children at the Tokyo Olympics was 2.5 times that of the Rio Games.
At the Rio Olympics in 2016, his delegation ranked sixth on the 12 gold list.
The delegates formed their own teams, supported the umbrella, and moved on to the venue.
The roads around the venue are normally moving, there are no balloon signs outside the venue, no red carpets, and no plants and flowers.
Yesterday, the second meeting of the four-member people ' s assembly in Guangan City was held in a simple manner.
Walking into the Guangan Centre, there were no slogans, no tea cups or even a bottle of ordinary mineral water.
Instead of a simple banner, a meeting place, a simple, environmentally friendly paper file bag with conference materials, and a green paper cup with tea.
The material for the meeting was thinner than before, and a few sheets of paper summarized the theme and agenda of the meeting.
“The economy must be economical. We are well aware and welcome to return to our present state of convoluted and real meeting environment.” The Guangan City People ' s Congress, on behalf of Wang Sung, expressed their willingness to see and participate in efficient and pragmatic meetings without formalism.
Experts noted that the current slowdown in inflation and deflationary pressures was undoubtedly good news for the transition period.

The Bank of England will maintain a 0.25% interest rate.
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged, and previous weak economic growth and moderate inflation have dashed hopes for upward adjustment.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue to be “weak” because it controlled interest rates while tightening household income.
Policymakers in the Bank ' s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain a 0.25 per cent interest rate by a vote of 6-2 while a few members this month called for higher interest rates, even if weak economic growth had weakened the boost.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced growth projections for 2017 to 1.7 per cent and 2018 to 1.6 per cent, respectively, and issued warnings that the contraction in household income would continue, while inflation would surge to nearly 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, it indicated that an upward adjustment in interest rates would be required in the coming years to contain the inflation caused by the de-Ouerium, while the cost of borrowing might need to rise even more substantially as expected in financial markets.
A year ago, a massive economic promotion policy was implemented as a result of the fallout, and members also voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce the discontinuation of the scheduled financing scheme to provide low-cost funding to banks starting next February, although the Bank claims that under the scheme, the Bank currently needs an additional Pound15 billion over Pound115 billion.
In the minutes of the Interest Rate Conference, the Bank of England stated: “In the MPC's core forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) has remained weak in the recent past, as the contraction of real household income will continue to stifle consumption.”
With regard to interest rates, the Bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for “some monetary policy tightening” to suppress inflation and for “a greater degree” than market expectations.
The market is now expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year and for the second time in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that any increase would be “slow” and “restraint”.
Growth projections for the Bank for this year and next year show a downward trend, compared to 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent for May.
The Bank maintains a 1.8 per cent growth projection for 2018.
The exchange rate of the pound sterling vis-à-vis the United States dollar declined and the euro followed closely.
The exchange rate of the Pound to the United States dollar fell 0.5 per cent to 1.31 and that of the euro by 0.4 per cent to 1.11.
Prior to the emergence of this unchanging decision-making, the rising expectations were dashed by recent and less optimistic growth figures. In the second quarter, GDP rose to 0.3%, compared to 0.2% in the first three months.
The bank said that growth in the third quarter might be at 0.3%, although it would be slightly higher at the end of the year.
The average household was hit by a sharp rise in inflation and wage growth was negligible, and their recent inflation report by the Bank of England did not give them any good news, because it said that austerity would get worse before it got better.
It was also said that monetary policy “could not prevent” the impact on income in the coming years, but that wages were expected to recover “large-scale” by the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, because of the depreciation of the pound sterling and the substantial increase in demand for British commodities, the economy would be stimulated to offset in part low consumption.
One year before the decision was made, an alarming European Union referendum brought down the Pound to 0.25 per cent in August.
The Bank of England estimated that it would take four years to have a full impact on prices and the British economy.
Before the bank published its latest interest rate ruling, the call for an increase in interest rates was strong, as inflation worsened the average household that was already under stress, while three policymakers called for a 0.5 per cent increase in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9 per cent in June to 2.6 per cent last month, although according to the Bank of England this was expected and will rise again in the coming months.
The line is called the 2% target, more than the last line of the weak pound.
The director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, Andrew Monterk, said: “In the light of the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market appears to be again becoming more competitive, as lenders strongly appeal for more business, and look forward to a positive move to a perfect end this year.
For those who may be close to ending existing transactions, such markets appear particularly advantageous, as re-collateralization (many free of charge and low interest rates) is increasingly popular.
The Chinese seismic network officially determined that on 13 November, at 1902 hours, an earthquake of 8.0 magnitude occurred in New Zealand (42.53° S and 173.05° E). The source of the earthquake was 10 km deep and the capital, Wellington, had a strong sense of shock.
The UK National Health Service (NHS) has a highly controversial HIV drug on the green light.
Following the closure of the High Court of Justice's provision of drug support for NHS, patients will be able to access “changed” HIV prophylaxis from September onwards.
NHS England has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug that can be administered before sexual intercourse, has proven to reduce the risk of infection among at-risk populations by about 86 per cent. Health services will now provide the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year initial test.
It agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court decision last year. The decision states that, although NHS states that the local authorities should fund the drug, NHS is entitled to pay the costs of the PEP.
The announcement on Thursday was referred to by British CEO NHS Simon Stevens as “a major new intervention”, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as “a critical moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first registered sexual health clinics. More clinics will join in October, followed by full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PREP) is an HIV drug that is administered before sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission among populations at risk of infection.
Pre-sexual use means there are enough specific drugs in humans to prevent HIV infection.
It can be taken daily or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include lesbian, bisexual, transgender and HIV-positive persons who have not been successfully treated.
The clinic will determine whether the eligible and agreed participants, including men, women, transgender people and those whose sexual partner has HIV status are unknown for antiretroviral treatment.
Persons residing in England and registered as general practitioners may also enrol in sexual health clinics where they attend.
The scheme will cost £10 million, while the NHS England branch has signed a contract to procure these drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The experiment aims to assess the full potential of the PEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is located, absorbed and implemented on the basis of large samples.
Mr. Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and reinforce the widespread and growing success of HIV prevention.
This is another milestone in action worth making progress in addressing the major health challenges of humankind over the years.”
“This is the critical moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target populations in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offer the possibility of changing the British AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, people at risk of HIV will gain access to an approved new tool through this experiment in England, funded by the NHS, which is truly stand-alone and does not require consultation with sexual partners, which will improve the lives of many people.
We agree with the announcement.”
The CEO of the Terence Higgins Trust, Ian Greene, said: “The first task now is to ensure that the trials move rapidly across the country and that none of those infected with HIV is left behind.
Now we've bought the Prep experimental drugs, and we're ready to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV."
The shadow Minister of Public Health, Sharon Hodgson, stated: “After months of delay and delays by the Government, the start of the prEP first trial was welcome and should have come earlier.
Evidence shows how this drug can bring about change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and preventing the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This experiment will allow us to go further and fully understand the advantages of the PEP.
It is now very important that the experiment be rolled out throughout the country as soon as possible in order to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us further to end the spread of HIV in society.”
In 2015, for technical cooperation or M & As purposes, a number of vehicle factories were visited by a team led by Gui.
Quality of life: using lofts and smart designs to make small condos of the Count's Palace a large home
Joanne Ray, a former banker, was keen to renovate her house, and in 2014 she moved from a large house at the Knightsbridge to a small apartment at the Count's Palace.
This apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne balcony -- Joanne didn't pack and sell it, which is a strong proof of the new design.
Before that, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a bigger house at Knightbridge, Joanne said.
“I was looking for the right house with the right offer.
I saw this apartment at the Count's Palace, and it had a tall ceiling.
I'd love to make an offer the same day.”
Since the first look, this 1,000 square feet apartment has now been completely overhauled.
This apartment was originally a complex single room -- it had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom -- and Joanne wanted to add storage space and attics to make full use of the ceiling height.
“I want high ceilings, big windows, enough light.
That's what I asked," she said.
To that end, she hired Elfan Azadi from the Duck & Shed Building and Design Studio (in the Notting Hills) to build a home with this 12.5-foot ceiling. This is not just a development project, it's where Joanne lives.
The ceiling is not high enough to add two upper and lower spaces, so the construction challenge is to create an attic that is sufficiently high to allow people to stand.
Erfan must think creatively in order to resolve this problem.
"The steel structure is quite complex," he explained.
“We must arrange for space to be displayed, without shrugs.
Not only is it so simple to build a simple platform, but it is also to activate the steel so that it is at the right height to function.”
Through this arrangement, Elfan was able to obtain two full-body rooms in the space -- many interesting elements could be added.
The penthouse uses retrouvius branded retrouvius retro-coated copper windows that can look over the fascinating areas of life.
Gold furniture with mirrors, silver small pieces of furniture and Sergei Mouille ' s retrofitted lighting set the whole style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
The installation of mirrors on both ends of the short corridor allows it to look longer.
In the kitchen, a spatterboard with mirrors is like a window to another room.
At the bastion, a small grid with mirrors provided Joanne with storage space to store dishes and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an exciting sense of space to keep the kitchen occupied when it is not used.
The folding kitchen is not new.
But what's unique about this folding kitchen is a garage-style elevator.
“It involves knowledge in a number of engineering fields,” Elfan explains the steel-stretching MDF doors.
"This is the principle of balance, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide."
Joanne received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and an improved layout as a result of his skilful use of space and storage.
"In the end, you sell the size of the house -- or your property is valued on the basis of the size of the house," said Elfan.
“By and large, the real estate agent would go into the room and calculate it on the basis of the size of the floor.”
They will seek to increase their land space while using high-quality materials, thus giving it a sense of luxury.
Elfan states that “the material is of your own choosing and thus helps to create emotional ties at home”.
"You're not gonna love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they don't tie you."
It has been proven that, through good design and additional space, standard apartments can shake and become a surprise to you.
Actually, you might choose to stay like Joanne.

Two brothers in the 500 million-dollar real estate empire battle.
Forty years after their Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers fought for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million.
Colin De Lutis, a former director and developer of Carlton Football Club, lives in a mansion located in Tucla district, and three houses are located at a distance from his brother Paul. The latter brought him before the Supreme Court regarding the division of their real and business assets.
Since 2014, Paul had wanted to leave the family business, but the two brothers had a heated debate in the Supreme Court about the division of assets.
The brothers and their mother owned 38 properties worth more than $500 million that had accumulated since 1973 when the family bought Smith Street, Colin Wood.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually expanded it to 160 retail chains.
In 1999, it was sold for $85 million.
Then the money was invested in real estate. At present, the De Rutis family ' s portfolio includes city office buildings, the Braunschule and Sorento development projects, the Golden Coast and Mount Brewer apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin, known by his brother, Paul, as the “principal promoter and dominant figure” of the De Rutis family, owned about two thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounted for about one third.
According to the documents submitted to the Tribunal, Colin owned $316 million of property, while Paul owned $176 million.
According to Paul, the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the negotiations.
“Colin's proposal for the division of property left him what I thought was best,” he wrote in a first court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failures of mediation, the Supreme Court held its first hearing.
Now that the brothers were still fighting for control of the existing business, Paul claimed that Colin had kicked him out.
Colin denied this and accused Paul of poor administration of certain properties.
In the early affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed the wish to settle the dispute.
“My Italian tradition determines that the family is the most important option. My Italian blood determines that family is the most important thing”, he wrote.
The cost of the case continues to rise, and there are hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails and company reports submitted by the top law firms, such as Deloitte, Picher Partners, Charter Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Both Ms. De Rutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants. They started running popular restaurants and deli stores in the late 1950s and bought a store in Braunrick in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy Colin Wood property, where Colin opened the family ' s first jeans shop.
Colin said, "I read in senior year, where he founded Westco, " Paul was little at the time (about 10 years old). "
Anna De Rutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to give their property to their son in peace.
“Louigi used to say to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court”, she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of De Rutis Group, and Colin said that when Mark left, he paid him $10 million and he paid Luke $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark “expressed their dissatisfaction with the division of their property clause”.
According to Eddie McGuire, a television star, published in 2015, Colin kept a low profile despite being a member of the former AFL Board.
“Fairfax Media” contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
But Colin was the only one who replied by text. He stated that since the case had been brought before the Tribunal, “I really cannot say much”.
"My brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family to court, which is very, very sad," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet the demands of his brother.
He said, “Our father does not want to see Paul and I end up in a dispute like this” and added, “He still has hope for its resolution”.
Friday, that hope seems to be dashed.
“Our problems will be resolved through the Court in the near future”, Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the President's media time.
Others have tried, but failed.
John F. Kelly may be able to do that.
If that's the case, he's the first.
According to the United States political news site Politico, the new White House Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump — including media reports — in order to ensure greater stability for the boss.
Here is a quote from journalist Josh Dowsey:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, began his first day of work and gathered with senior officials, he pointed out that he was addressing one of the main problems of President Tripp's entry into the White House: bad information to the President”.
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the President to make better decisions, so the information would need to be in his hands, both in writing and in the form of briefings.
Kelly's diagnosis looks like it, but others tried to tame Trump by watching his media time, but ultimately failed.
President Trump's television addiction has long been — and now in the White House, his habit of watching television is still growing.
In February, Sam Naberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico: “If candidate Trump is frustrated about unfair reporting, it would be useful to let him know that he has received positive reports on credible channels.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that “according to the experience of the six former campaign officials, the practice of controlling Trump's tweets was focused on ensuring that he had always received some praise in the media messages he personally received”.
That's totally fine.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits were “controlled” was ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know — that if they had not intervened, Trump's Twitter would have been even more angry.
We may never know that Trump didn't send those tweets.
If his staff were able to save him from the fire, their efforts would be worthwhile even a few times.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of competing groups, people are promoting their world view and their cause by presenting to Trump information that may be reliable or unreliable.
Politico — all about this story — reported in May on the preferences of the advisers to strategically provide suspicious information to the President.
This is an example described by journalist Shane Goodmancher:
“The present and former Tromp officials claim that Trump's reaction to negative news clips, such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with destructive leaks, would be a mad attempt to find their source.
At the end of February, there was a malicious copy to the President of an article on the website of the cyber-seditor Charles C. Johnson, GotNews.com, accusing the Deputy Chief of Staff, Katie Walsh, of being the “source of massive information leaks” in the White House, as Trump did at the time.
Even though Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, no concrete evidence had been provided, and he had blown up a large number of false allegations, which were later openly denied.
Trump read the article and then started asking officials about Walsh.”
Gudmancher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reines Pribas, and the White House Secretary, Robert Potter, “had tried to establish a system to manage and document the documents received by Trump”.
And?
Kelly was gonna do the same thing in three months.
Perhaps he could prove to be a more efficient manager than Pribas, but Trump was the impulsive Trump, and his assistant was still competing for influence.
These constant influences will make Kelly's task even more difficult.
Traveling town: how to get drunk
[Summary] The potential of the town of Zhejiang was gradually awakened.
These towns are now an important destination for Zheshan tourists to appreciate Zheshan water, read Zheshan culture, and feel the sorrow of Zhejiang, and will also provide an important contribution to my efforts to create the most American tourist destination in China.
Winning's in love.
"The social play goes up with the moon, and the salami smells up with the wind.
“The town of Shao Xing Ancungo, where traditional handicrafts such as buckets, bamboo, iron, shoes, flowers and cotton picks are seen everywhere, are amply displaying the intangible cultural heritage of An Xiangu, and the tourists are intoxicated by the atmosphere of the experience of Shao Xing folk and the historical and cultural build-up.
More than 65,000 visitors were reported to have visited Anchangu town during the three-day holiday this year.
In Zhejiang, a unique town like Anchangu, the Zhejiang town of Ka Xianxi Tong is filled with light, warm and euphemism, the White Wall Dewa of the 28th Land of Xinzhou, accusing of the years of the Millennium Old Town, and the painting of fishermen in Stone Tong Town of Taizhou, sculpting the traditional and modern life of fishers... These towns are the Zhejiang tourist's "hand-in-hand" and the "kick-in-the-heart" of the eight tourists.
In recent years, the potential of the town of Zhejiang has been gradually awakened with the development of tourism throughout our province.
In 2016, the Office of the Provincial Government officially published the Zhejiang Department of Tourism and Community Development (Zhejiang Province) Scheme for the Creation of Small Towns of Tourism (Zhejiang Province), which provides for the designation of 100 provincial tourist towns in the region over a period of approximately five years, with the approval of the province as a whole.
These towns are now an important destination for Zheshan tourists to appreciate Zheshan water, read Zheshan culture, and feel the sorrow of Zhejiang, and will also provide an important contribution to my efforts to create the most American tourist destination in China.
The director of the Department of Tourism explained that, in the midst of the creation of tourist-friendly small towns, my towns and villages now place greater emphasis on the construction of individualized tourism industries, and that new tourism projects and business practices have developed in such a way as to provide visitors with a rich experience and a good reputation.
Focus on promotion
In recent days, the Zhejiang Tourist Department and the Zhejiang Daily Press Group, hosted by the Zhejiang Group's All-Media Tourism Centre, held the closing ceremony of the Zhejiang Tourist and Zhejiang Tourist Festival, which was held in Zhejiang Province.
“The town of Windy has the beauty of art and the temperature of life.
The style of the town lies in the original juice, the original taste, the place of origin, the pureness of the original ecology.
It's not like it's a bad idea. The Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, Faculty of Visual Animated Arts, Faculty of Film and Television, Director of the first-line video advertising in China, and the Director of the Faculty of Arts and Communications of the Chinese University of Metrology, Prof. Xu Tsai Sun, shared cross-border stories of small towns such as " Small towns in the lens " , " Small village renovations " .
Many popular tourist towns in Zhejiang have a wealth of cultural resources, and the new town representative Dong from the southern city of Lake County has been able to read the country's painting on the scene.
Gangnam has been popular with painters since ancient times, and the town of Nanyangu is now working in depth with universities of art such as the Chinese American Academy.
A tourist-like town must have its elements, tourism elements, service elements and environmental elements.
The services and environment of tourism are also important elements in this context.
A timely umbrella on a rainy day would also allow tourists to experience the town's style better.
In this shared era, the hottest shared umbrella company in Zhealers’ All Media Center for Tourism has designed a series of shared umbrellas for the Zhejiang version of Poetry Painting, hoping to promote the concept of “Shared? Green”, to promote civilized tourism awareness and public decency among tourists and small-town residents and to create a better shared tourism environment.
This became a highlight of the Zhejiang Winds in Poetry.
Looking forward to it.
To date, Zhejiang Province has published a list of the first 21 provincial tourist-friendly towns and a list of 115 provincial tourist-friendly small towns.
As a priority area for the development of rural tourism during the “13th Fiveth” period, a small town of grace will eventually be built up with a 3A level and above as a new model for the diversity of tourism products, high tourism efficiency and industrial integration.
The attraction of tourist town is its original taste.
The beauty of a small tourist town stems not only from a small bridge of smoke and rain, but also from a long cultural tradition; rural renewal stems from cultural self-confidence.
At the international level, the towns of Lisser in the Netherlands, Harstadt in Austria and Pumpkin in France, with tulips, “salt” and pumpkins as their core attractions, attract large numbers of tourists from all over the world each year and drive the economy of the town.
For a small town of style, the emphasis on “dignity and preservation” has given the town a distinct personality and soul, and more so on providing cultural immersion, carrying local history and highlighting local civilization.
A small tourist town, linked by culture and homelessness, with humanities and landscapes, is followed by tourists who allow traditional styles and cultures to pass on and innovate in shared construction.
In essence, the tourist town is a complex, open tourist attraction, and more importantly, a shared living space for the local population and tourists and even the Travellers.
As the main battleground for the future growth of tourism, tourist-like small towns have the potential not only to change the rural landscape, the way in which economic and social development takes place, the direction of industrial factors, but also to reduce the rural-urban infrastructure gap and revive rural cultures.
In the tide of accelerated rural renewal, the Zhejiang tourist town will play a much richer story.
According to data, 70 per cent of China ' s travel needs are concentrated within a 3-kilometre radius, so that the entire short-distance market is the world of shared bicycles sooner or later.
The Japanese Finance and Economics News reported that inflationary pressures would intensify as a result of the fiscal expansion policy of the next Trump regime and that the rate of interest hike would accelerate in 2017.
The annual International Consumer Electronics Fair (CES) opened in Las Vegas, United States, from 9 January (10 January Beijing time) to 12 January.

These “captures” are no more than a single one in the ocean, relative to the huge production of 13,000 television dramas broadcast every year.
Roverers negotiate ditches and go back to Rich Man Street.
Some of the richest owners in the Simidranz region have reoccupying with determined caravanrs who have negotiated for the return of land outside the mansions in a ditch opened by the Government.
The Rovers parked their 20 trailers in an empty area outside the luxurious Soliher Street, which was named "The Rich Man Street."
The occupants, who were carrying horses, carrying babies and leading a motorcade, returned again after being expelled in May, and the town authorities did not block their entry by digging up the moat.
The team found a gap in the defence line, through which their vehicles were crowded, although there was no roadblock to pass.
Angry residents have strongly criticized the Solihull Council for its “failure in dealing with this issue”.
“They arrived there on Monday night, before coming to Benjis Street, throwing stones at passers-by.
The Commission should be ashamed of what they did, because they had nothing to do with dealing with them.
The occupants came here in May and were then expelled, and now they are back.
There were a lot of them last night. There might be more today."
She adds: “The Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with this by imposing a permanent ban on the protection of its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook, and if the council can't stop this, I won't be willing to continue paying municipal taxes.
“This is ridiculous. We have just seen the last group of RVs leave, just to facilitate the destruction of another group.
This time again, the number increased, and people even saw horses eating on the park's lawn.”
A female spokesperson for the Solikhel Commission said: “We know that unauthorized camping is taking place in an empty area on Sjutzbruck Road, and now we work with the Solikhal police and take the necessary legal action to get them out of the country as soon as possible.
In order to support our gathering of evidence, it is important to request as many local residents as possible to report any anti-social or criminal acts to the police by telephone.
This helps us to outline the situation when we bring a case to the Court for its examination.”
On 15 March, the fifth meeting of the Twelfth National People ' s Congress was closed at the Beijing People ' s Hall.
This was an interview with the head of the National Post Office, the Ma Jun.
Xinhua correspondent Chen Xianhua International Online: On 15 March, at 9 a.m., the fifth meeting of the Twelfth National People ' s Congress was closed in the People ' s Hall.
Before closing, during an interview with the Minister's Passage, the Director General of the National Postal Service, Hwang Ma, stated that this year, the State will strengthen its regulation and lead to greater self-regulation in the industry in response to outstanding problems such as the delay in delivery and the loss and damage of the express delivery in the current express delivery industry.
This year, more efforts will be made to address the salient problems in the four express delivery industries, which, according to the Mahjongg, have now entered the fast track.
China ' s delivery capacity in 2012 was 5.6 billion, with 10,000 express delivery three-wheel drive routes, and uniform standards, marking and insurance were introduced, facilitating delivery and ensuring security.
This is not the first time that the United Nations has tried to use a virtual role as an honorary ambassador. Angry Birds, Tinker Bells and Winnie Bears were all honoured ambassadors to the United Nations.
As of the closing date, light crude oil futures delivered by the New York Commodity Exchange in August 2016 had increased by $2.04 to $46.80 per barrel, an increase of 4.56 per cent.
The London Brent crude oil futures delivered in September 2016 rose by $2.22 to $48.47 per barrel, an increase of 4.80 per cent.
The United States dollar index, which measures the dollar against the six major currencies, fell by 0.10 per cent that day, to 96.479 at the end of the market.
The weakening of the United States dollar increased the attractiveness of investment in dollar-denominated oil and supported oil prices on that day.
The Plan proposes that by 2020, the value added of strategic and emerging industries as a share of GDP will reach 15 per cent, creating a new generation of five new pillars of $10 trillion worth of production, such as information technology, high-end manufacturing, biology, green low-carbon, digital creativity and, more broadly, new growth points of massive cross-border integration, generating an average of more than 1 million new jobs per year.
The University of Stanford, in the United States, launched the One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence to assess the future of AI in the long term.

When it comes to employment and the workplace, the study suggests that AI can replace tasks rather than jobs, while helping to create new jobs.
According to an actor in the group, Zhang Mao was a timid person at the scene and had to be personally targeted from the crowd of actors to the indoctrination.
Italy ' s strong attitude towards the NGO Migrant Rescue Ship
Italy warns non-governmental organizations operating migrant rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue to carry out the rescue unless new operational regulations are signed.
The Minister of the Interior, Marco Minnetti, said in an interview with the Turin Daily News: “It is hard to see how non-governmental organizations will continue if they do not sign new codes of conduct”.
On the day before Minnity issued the warning, the Italian authorities detained the crew of a German aid organization, “Youth for Rescue”, on suspicion that the crew had actually collaborated with traffickers to assist illegal immigrants.
This aid organization operates for only one year and refuses to comment on the specific subject of the charges of the Italian prosecutor, Ambrogio Caltocio.
In a social media statement, the organization stated that “for us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing, and we regret that we cannot operate in search and rescue areas at this time”.
“When all the information has been gathered, we can now only assess all the allegations and the situation.”
The Italian official has been monitoring the Iuventa ship of YUVA since October.
Their crews were suspected of carrying human traffickers directly from small boats and allowed smugglers to flee in haste and re-use ships.
According to the Prosecutor ' s documents, at least one such meeting allegedly took place at sea 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast. The document was published in the Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of blatant disregard for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area for humanitarian and not any other motivation.
According to the code of conduct, vessels such as Iuventa clearly require an Italian police officer to supervise their activities on board.
Currently, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the norms of conduct: Save the Children, the Migrant Maritime Aid Station in Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considered that the new provisions, while unnecessary, were acceptable, since they did not entail any “significant changes and obstacles” to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign were the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins sans frontières (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti reported a sharp decline in the number of immigrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guards and unite local mayors had begun to bear fruit.
The Minister said: “For recent days, we have begun to see the dawn at the end of the tunnel. “...
He announced plans for in-depth talks this month: discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development activities and with Chad, Niger and Mali on ways to reduce the number of migrants wishing to leave those countries for Europe.
The Chief Financialist of the Transport Bank even indicated that industrial value added was expected to accelerate to 6.6 per cent in December owing to late seasons of industrial value addition in the first three quarters of 2017.
The cumulative increase in investment in fixed assets is expected to be 7.2 per cent in December, at the same rate as last month, down from last year.
Industrial production, although weaker than in October, remained essentially the same as in November.
In December, however, our manufacturing investment was operating at a low level, but capital investment improved slightly, so it is expected that the fixed asset investment will remain at the same level as in November.
More than 200,000 people have entered the United States, mostly as stowaways; they are in foreign countries, returning to their homes for a long time, their families are separated and similar scenes continue to unfold.
Beijing's new “Ledification” initiative: 10,000 North Chemical teachers and students will be admitted to Changping New School District
The inauguration of the new campus of the Beijing Chemical University took place in Changping District, Beijing, and the 1,800 acres of green campus was officially inaugurated.
The journalists learned from the ceremony that, in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and to combat the problem of “large-city diseases”, in recent years, in the context of the collaborative development and defusing of non-capital functions, Beijing has stepped up the process of defunctization of central-city institutions of higher education to the suburbs, with teachers and students moving to new campuses in suburban areas such as Shunyi, Da Xing and Hsinyama.
The North Chemical New School, located in Changping South Point Town, covers 1,800 acres, 40 kilometres from the city, and is one of the priority projects to defusing non-capital functions in Beijing City.
The construction of the new school is divided into three phases, all of which have been completed, and phase two, which is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year, will meet the learning and living needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduate, graduate and teaching staff.
Looking back at this year's film market, we found that the original text of the film and the two crowds of the star players became an important part of the film's intended audience.
Today, at 1710 hours, command centre 119 of Shunyang city was alerted to a fire in the storage of the tetrahydrofuran at the macro-specified chemical plant in the city ' s twin-sizing area of Dragonshu pond.
The Shunyang City Fire Unit immediately deployed 20 fire trucks from five squadrons to the scene with heavy chemical protective clothing and equipment such as chemical cleaning vehicles.
The fire was initially detected in small storage tanks where chemicals, such as tetrahydrofurans, were stored, resulting in a high level of smoke.
As of the time of the press release, firefighters were in a state of intense distress, and the municipal health, security, environmental, security, transport and so forth had proceeded to the scene without any casualties.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to suicide for texting out Conrad Roy.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and telephone calls.
In the current year, 20-year-old Michelle Carter will serve a 15-month prison term, which can be converted to a suspended sentence. Another five years' probation.
Carter was convicted in June of unintentional and premeditated murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father at the hearing on Thursday said, "My family is devastated.
My son is my best friend."
While awaiting appeal, Carter was allowed to retain his personal freedom.
She faces a maximum of 20 years ' imprisonment, but her lawyers believe that both she and Mr. Roy are mentally ill.
At the time of sentencing, Carter stood and was wearing red trousers and white coats, with tight hands and tears in his eyes and looking down.
“She killed Conrad Roy” the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended her life for better.
She didn't take responsibility. The prosecutor said.
"She has no regrets."
But Carter's lawyer said it was “a terrible consequence, and she felt very sorry”.
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he had not found her “age or maturity, or even her mental illness, which could have any significant impact on her behaviour”.
A prosecutor read a statement by Lynn Roy, Roy's mother, saying, "I haven't had a day without grief for losing my beloved son.
I hope he's proud of me and everything I've done. I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my pains, which will accompany us forever”, stated.
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was “mental” because she realized that she would never be able to attend her brother's wedding or become an aunt of his children.
“The loss of a man who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and I will spend the rest of my life with it.” She said.
This case appears to set a legal precedent, as the laws of Massachusetts do not make it a crime to encourage others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a car; this year, Carter was 17 years old.
The case was of national concern after Carter ' s text message revealed that she had encouraged him to commit suicide.
"There are many ways to hang, jump, stab yourself." In several messages sent two weeks before his death, she stated that he was on vacation with his family.
In the period before he committed suicide, she wrote, “You need to do this, Conrad” and “All you have to do is start the generator and then get free and happy”.
Judge Moniz stated that Carter had drawn attention through the death of Mr. Roy and ordered that she not profit from the case through any media.
There are differences of legal opinion in this case.
One of the few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox, was charged with murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and acquitted two years later.
In a column published in the Los Angeles Times, Ms. Knox, 30, said: “Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment”.
Since Zhang was destined to be a controversial film artist who had started filming his first film, Red Gospel, he had also reaped a lot of criticism while leading the Chinese film.
Journalists learned on 2 February from Lhasa net-earth basketball club that, recently, the Lasaa net-earth youth team won its fourth final in the national youth basketball league in Beijing.
The Lhasa Pure-Turkish Youth Team is composed of 11 local players and is headed by the Assistant Coach of the Lasa Pure-Turkish Boys Team, In-sang Ju.
Tibetan “Ballball Kid” before he went to Beijing for the finals.
The Managing Director of Lhasa Basketball Club, Leung Jun, said to journalists that the team had improved its performance compared to last year and that there had been a marked improvement in the players ' self-confidence and confidence in the game. Exchanges between players and other teams have also become more comprehensive and more frequent and easier on and off the scene.
At the end of the competition, Captain Jiang Zo expressed his desire to build experience through participation in the competition and to do his best for the basketball cause in Tibet.
In Beijing, players are known to have overcome factors such as low-altitude intoxication oxygen and to have a Tibetan image.
Although the track is a golden house at the Olympic Games, and those who have received it are the world ' s best, the track name will be lower than the gold.
Automobile manufacturer facing shock, Audi will modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before Audi announced the modifications, BMW indicated that it would provide software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman stated that BMW believed that “driving has more intelligent choices than restrictions” meant that major European cities, including Munich, where BMW is based, consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Dimler announced on Tuesday that 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe would be converted to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed to have done so as a recall.
The use of diesel vehicles has been promoted by European automobile manufacturers in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emission requirements.
However, nitrogen oxides released from diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
Installation of equipment by automobile companies to offset the cost of diesel tail gas emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of diesel vehicles.
As German auto manufacturers face censorship, the Government of Prime Minister Angela Merkel has been accused of overselling these powerful car companies and neglecting the signs of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid repeating the popular pattern of using so-called fail-safe devices, adjusting emissions to comply with regulations during car tests and returning to normal under normal driving conditions.
Several public officials have been charged in the United States, while others are under investigation in countries across the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zachero Giovanni Pamio is Italian and therefore is not protected by extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the general public, and the German Government ' s allegations that the Audi system had been installed to evade European emission requirements extended the scope of the investigation previously limited to the United States.
The investigation of Audi may have a significant impact on the general public: luxury car manufacturers have a disproportionate share of the profits of popular cars.
It is common for a film to run for a year or two or years, from preparation to presentation.
Animated film The Big Fish Seagull announced that it would be released on July 8th, 12 years from its preparation to its release!
The original author of the Big Fish Sea Tsing, 21-year-old, defunct from the Thermal Power at the University of Qinghua, founded with his best friend Zhang Chun, received a $1 million venture investment in 2008 to launch an animated film " Big Fish Sea Tsang " .
The film has won many national and international prizes at the creative stage, and has been recorded and hailed as “one of the most outstanding works of art” by the Centre for Contemporary Art in Pompidou, France.
For six years, from creativity to production, the film was called the “The Pit of God” by millions of fans who looked forward to it.
The Big Fish Seagull tells a fantastic story about Chinese people. With the release of this pre-sentenced trailer, new expectations for all audiences have been created.
“It has only been one thing for 12 years, and now it has become a reality, and I am both nervous and excited”.
Zhang Chun said, "I'm driving the team crazy because I'm trying to do exactly the same thing with someone else's budget."
Dong Zheng, a “world factory” that used to rely on the processing of raw materials and the creation of large numbers of common workers, is looking at high-level talent who can lead the repositioning of the city.
During the high-level talent week organized by the municipality of Dongguan in recent days, the first financial journalist observed that a number of powerful local enterprises had participated in the talent fair.
They each have a very good price on the particularly bright billboards that are under the orange background wall.
Accordingly, the China Television Production Industry Association has decided to join the national television production industry to sign the self-regulation convention.
Provence lavender is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but there is now bad news that it is being threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining as a result of the continuing drought and the presence of insects carrying the virus, which is causing headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute of Agricultural Research (CRIEPPAM) in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is under great threat, as the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with a significant drop in spring rainfall, while in the autumn it is raining.
This affects the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a smaller type of individual, a leaf that can transmit tiny bacteria, which can be found in a very dry weather. “...
The key is its magnitude.
In addition to attracting vacationers to the elegant lavender fields, lavender oil is also favoured by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric Chase said, “By contrasting to the many flowers that can grow with a long valley, we have smaller, stunted, missing or weak individuals.
So we have less refined oil."
Solutions under study included the adoption of better irrigation techniques and the mitigation of soil water evaporation, the spraying of clay and water protection mixtures on plantations and the development of more drought-resistant varieties.
The two leading stars say that they're more attractive than the science fiction in the film.
On the afternoon of 5 September, a journalist from the Washington City newspaper, who continued to interview a number of eminent persons from the audience, and two performing artists from the community, were surprisingly almost silent.
One was a Berlin filmmaker, and one was a rising young actor, and " Psychiatry Crime" was the first partner of Levan and Li Yifong.
Mexico is in danger. Journalists are killed.
The entire staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually gathers on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on riots in Sinalo State caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today, the shadow of tragedy looms over them, who come together to discuss security issues.
It is important that they are told to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what was safer: whether to take their children to the office (the office had been hit by grenades in 2009) or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemy, neutral and ally.
They gave the journalists the names in each column — without evidence, with observation and intuition.
Suspected drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on government lists, or cartels, these thugs put Mexican reporting at great risk.
The violence has continued, with more and more journalists throughout the country: President Enrique Peña Nieto has died since he took office in December 2012; 589 journalists have been under federal protection after being attacked and threatened; and so far this year, at least 7 journalists have died in seven states.
The last was their editor and source of inspiration and co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdez Cárdenas.
Valdez wrote many books on drug violence, one of which he wrote: “The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist”.
You can feel that he has left everywhere — a huge picture hanging on the front of the Riodoce office building, Valdez with a finger in it, with the word “justice”; and his smile on the T-shirt, worn by two 30-year-old journalists, Aaron Ivara and Miriam Ramirez, who wore glasses or his iconic Panamanian straw hat.
Less than two months after his death, the seminar was held; journalists discussed their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and suspicion.
Although a special federal prosecutor ' s office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists ' cases, according to the records of the Commission for the Protection of Journalists, it prosecuted only two persons.
Since most of the thousands of crimes committed each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, very few journalists have been brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they insist on reporting violence in Sinalo State, although they are already heartbroken, and the land is sorely damaged.
Evalla stated that there was little use for security discussions without information about the perpetrators and without justice.
He said, “It's stupid to waste time attending such seminars.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital, Culiakan.
His Red Toyota was stopped by two men just a few blocks away; they forced him to get out of the car and opened 12 guns, presumably because of the newspaper's name, translated into The Twelve Rivers.
The assailants left in his car and crashed him in the vicinity.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two adult children behind.
Kulyakan gossiped.
But the subject of Valdez is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzmán was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinaro has become the bloodiest battlefield in the country, with hostile forces killing with madness.
One or more people are shot every day in the streets of Sinaloh, and the cemetery is filled with two luxurious mausoleums of drug lords, which are common.
For the time being, the state of “quiet” was forgotten when only one cartel controlled the coastal state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdez is acutely aware of the dangers of the job, 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodoce, Ismail Bohoguey, still feels guilty for failing to protect his friends.
He believed that two mistakes had caused the tragedy.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso Lopez, who led a cartel that fought against several sons of Guzman.
The report may have provoked the sons; newspapers were bought by suspected gang members as soon as they arrived at the news stand.
The second error was that Valdez was not forced to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper reporting the same story was confiscated.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great significance for Mexican violence against journalists.
He has a long spirit and his friends and colleagues believe that he has been with us.
He was also a senior journalist for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling $50 in shares.
In Sinalo, according to Bohoque, “it is not possible to stop dealing with drugs.”
As time passed, the newspaper gained a good reputation for its courageous and honest reporting, as well as increased sales and advertising.
Journalists prefer to be able to publish investigative reports that strike the key without fear of censorship, and readers like to publish stories in newspapers that others are afraid to report.
Five years after its creation, Riodoce received the María Moscabo Press Prize from the Latin American nation.
In the same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdez International Press Freedom Award in recognition of his courage to pursue the most authentic Mexican drug reporting.
He confessed that he was scared.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the award, he said, "I want to live."
Later in October, in an interview with the local television station Rompeviento TV, he said, "In Sinalo, drug trafficking is a way of life.
You have to be a reporter on a mission that falls on your shoulders. - Either that or you're deaf.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many deaths why don't you say something about what's happening?"
All of Riodoce's employees miss Valdez, and he curses like a dock worker, as well as a friend who never caressed and advised, and a teacher who knows how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar across the office often sits at the same table.
Now they will ask, "Did his daily habits cause his fall?"
His death also forced them to think about how to do their job and live well.
“They don't like you getting their women and children into trouble, nor do they like you influencing their legal companies and the secret airports used to transport drugs.
They're all over their bottom line."
The result is to maintain a high degree of self-censorship and self-protection, even at the most safe times.
Trust your instincts.
If you smell dangerous, stay away.
According to Andrés Villar, editor of Riodoce, the problem is that “the breath is a sense of being deceived and then something like Javier happens”.
He and others said that the previous rules were no longer applicable in Sinalo State — just as they no longer applied in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where smuggling routes were profitable and institutions were weak, government officials corrupted and inflated.
The situation is changing.
Cell phones were suddenly not allowed to be used in the room where Riodoce employees attended security training; a few days earlier, spy software allegedly sold only to the Government had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two policemen took a cold in the shade and escaped the heat of 104 degrees (40°C).
They were sent by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a four-storey building in the Culiacan middle class neighbourhood.
Some journalists are jokingly saying that they don't know if the police will be 50% of what the Governor himself says.
Journalists have been in the mountains for several months, where drug cartels are under real control.
This week's Riodoce featured three major events.
Among them was the murder of the brother of Julio César Chávez, a great former boxer in Sinaro.
And the Governor's home government funding disclosure.
As well as the kidnapping in an expensive restaurant in Culiacan, one block from the prosecutor ' s office.
The authorities do not publish information on the victims and the process of kidnapping, and it is therefore necessary to be careful in writing what the city knows: That's the place where drug dealers and officials love it.
A journalist learned from a public file that the restaurant was registered by a politician of the ruling party, the Revolutionary System Party (PRI), who dominated the political class almost throughout the last chronology.
Recently, several RU Governors have been accused of corruption in several high-profile cases.
Villarill asked journalists to write about what had happened at the place before, including the case of a son of the biggest Mexican drug lord, Guzman, who had escaped military attacks.
If a few months ago, readers looked at Valdez's column to find out the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
The 46-year-old Villarill, known as “skinny” because of his thin body, said, “We knew what had happened before.
Now all of our sources have been cut off.
Valdez ' s office is now being used to store signs and stickers of protests against the killing of journalists, as staff members become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The following morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez accompanied him with a sign out of his room and went to the office of the local prosecutor to attend a demonstration in connection with another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacán three days after he was killed in Valdez.
Officially, a burned body was found, and according to DNA tests, this is his body.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more vocal, organizing protests and placing the word “saving media” on pavements and buildings.
On that day, Director Bohoque was not in Washington, and he was working to bring justice and international support to the Valdez case.
During a meeting with the Governor of Sinaro State, the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez complained about official raids on journalists and killed them because they had told the truth.
Since her anger had affected her objectivity, she also called for her resignation from her position of reporting on government affairs.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that Mexican journalists are “encircled” by organized crime, mixed government officials and indifferent societies.
In his last book, The Drug News Industry, he wrote that journalists were not only mutilated by drug trafficking groups, but were also on the list of politicians and security forces who were complicit in organized crime.
Media Watch Group Articulo 19 blames the police and public officials for more than half of last year's attacks on journalists.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up."
Clearly, these murders are chilling.
No one has forgotten that six years ago the blogger Maria Elizabeth Matias died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
There was a note by her body, allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “I came for my report”.
Her head was cut off with a computer keyboard and headphone next to it.
After Miroslava Blatch was killed in March, some newspapers chose to close down, such as the newspaper El Norte on the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others continued, and the director of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo was killed in 2014, but they continued.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke openly about the drug cartel in a front page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists fled their homes or even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still need to be careful and vigilant on the streets.
They were sometimes arrested and reportedly killed in 2015 by photographer Rubén Espinosa, three months after fleeing Veracruz, in a Mexican city with four women.
For those who remain behind the scenes, this is a daily step in high-risk decision-making.
Evara had wanted to be a poet, and he admitted that he was afraid to report on the drug trade.
He said, "Mexico is becoming hell, so I became a journalist."
In the middle of the last Friday, the latest edition of the newspaper had been printed, and the editors of Riodoce had been sitting on the walkway outside the office drinking beer, and suddenly their cell phones were ringing.
There was a series of shootings by rival gangs and security forces near the beach resort city of Masatran, which confirmed 19 deaths.
The fighting continues to escalate, as predicted by a series of cartel information found in the region.
They uploaded the news to Riodoce's website on the side of the road.
The headlines had to be changed the next day.
The sound of sirens was heard in the vicinity — there was another live-and-death shoot-out in the area.
Bohoque looked at the policemen standing there to see if they were alert.
If they're a little scared, they don't show up.
The founder of the newspaper had been killed, and in his large portrait, he had pointed to a place where the whole of Sinalo region needed to look, and the entire staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
"How can you even want to shut it down? On the same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the street for coverage.”
China's auto-driving tourism market size by 2020 or exceeding trillion yuan
[Summary] Against the backdrop of consumer escalation and the prevalence of free trade, self-drive is encouraged by national policies and increasingly popular with consumers.
At the same time, however, self-drive markets, which are expected to exceed trillions of dollars, face a double challenge.
In the context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free trade, self-drive is encouraged by national policies and increasingly popular with consumers.
At the same time, however, there is a double challenge for self-driving markets, which are expected to surpass trillions of scale. On the one hand, the development of the self-drive industry is not commensurate with market demand, and on the other hand, self-drive organizers, such as self-driving clubs and travel agencies, are facing a low-profit dilemma; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services they face are at an early stage.
60 per cent of the country's population, and the market is expected to break trillions of dollars.
With 4.44 billion domestic trips throughout 2016, self-travel accounts for about 60 per cent of the country ' s tourism population, and the size of the self-travel market is expected to exceed trillions by 2020.
According to statistics from the Chinese Tourist Association on the number of people travelling by their own cars, the number of people travelling has continued to grow over the past five years, with the proportion of those travelling within the country stabilizing at more than half.
At the same time, there has been increased attention and support at the regional and national levels in the emerging area of self-driving, with intensive policy and regulatory work on self-driving, motorbike and camping tourism from 2016 to 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, namely, the National Tourism Board, the National Sports Directorate and others, jointly published the Automobile Sports Camp Development Plan; in the same month, self-driving was highlighted in the Programme of Action for the Upgrading of Rural Tourism Development (2017), published jointly by 14 departments, including the CDRC and the Ministry of Finance.
The introduction of policies has provided opportunities and policy direction for the development of self-drives in the country.
Self-drive clubs are not very profitable. The whole chain is the key.
Although domestic self-drive markets have great potential and national policies have been actively directed, the self-driving sector is still in its infancy.
According to China ' s Annual Development Report for Self-Drive 2016 - 2017, home-grown self-drive clubs, auto clubs, car clubs, etc. have reached thousands, but the proportion of tourists making self-help arrangements for self-drives accounts for the majority, with only about 15 per cent of visitors participating in a variety of agencies such as car clubs and self-driving clubs.
At the same time, there are few online tourism enterprises and traditional travel agencies that independently develop their own tourism products, and many online tourism platforms sell only self-drive products from suppliers, and some self-drive clubs are important providers.
In terms of organizing self-drive activities, there are multiple aspects of “eat, live, travel, buy and enjoy”, with a high degree of fragmentation, a heavy upstream supply chain and a high level of random tourism consumption.
The founder and CEO Lee Chongjie of the Beijing Automobile Club considered the Club to be inherently similar to the Travel Agency, with the early major profit model dominated by underground activities, with the core focus on self-drive line products and lead service.
However, today, there is a high degree of homogenization of line products in the self-driving field, with uneven levels of service in the lead, and the self-driving clubs are faced with the need for a new transformation.
As can be seen, self-drive is not an independent industry in itself, but rather forms a trans-territorial, industry-based ecosystem that is important for forming a complete industrial chain.
Experts noted that beyond basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important element of consumption.
Therefore, for the development of the self-drive industry, it is important to enhance the identity of the experience, develop the theme of “self-drive plus” and IP for self-drive products.
The landscape is not just a road. The car camp should not just feed and board.
The basic development of self-drive is also relatively early in the face of self-drive.
Li Chong Jie pointed out that the tourism landscape was not just a road, but a combination of transport and tourism elements was needed, but that road construction and tourism itself were the responsibility of both departments, and that the transport sector added tourism elements to the construction of latrines, counselling centres, information boards, etc., which were not sufficiently integrated with tourism.
The experience of construction in comparison to the well-known self-drive route “United States 66 Road” is worth learning.
The design of the landscape is no longer the most direct and fast route between departure and destination, but rather follows the design concept of “exhausting the joy of driving” to provide the best enjoyment of the beauty of the road; the landscape can link points, faces and landscapes, preserve the historical and cultural value of ecotourism resources along the routes, and organize thematic events to enhance the participation and experience of tourists and generate economic benefits for local tourism.
In addition to the viewing lanes, the camp is an important complement to self-drive.
However, among the tourists who are known by New Kyoto newspaper journalists, there are few consumers who choose to stay in camps.
In their view, many camps tend to be infrastructure-oriented and serve only food, low grade and single products that do not meet the many elements of self-drive.
According to industry sources who do not wish to reveal their names, many of the enterprises that had been camping in previous years had been used for land acquisition, and since that time, the accompanying infrastructure and services had not been kept up, many of the operations had been in deficit, and it had been difficult to make some of the corresponding products without a later infusion of funds.
Consumption group
According to data published in 2017 by the Chinese Association of Tourists and Boats, the self-drive population is concentrated in the 21-40 age group, mainly in the 31-40 age group, which has a certain economic base and is in high demand for personalized tourism, mostly by parent-to-child customers.
According to the accommodation survey, the self-drive population has a relatively higher preference for non-standard accommodation.
In terms of the type of self-drive, peri-driving is the predominant type of peri-driving, accounting for 84.32 per cent.
A large number of people prefer to leave the country, but the proportion is smaller.
At the same time, as the demand for consumption rose, tourists who used to drive their own “tourage” began to change their mindset, not to “go out and take pictures and sleep” during their own trips, but to focus more on the experiences and processes of travel.
Dinosaurs use disguise to avoid enemies.
At first glance, it's scary, but it looks like a statue.
The researchers published their first study of the incredible biochemicals discovered by Canadian miners, the size of a rhinoceros, noting that the fossils were well preserved and were therefore referred to by experts as “Mona Lisa of the dinosaur community”.
The fossils were kept very well and could even be concluded to have a red brown colour in their slab skin. This suggests that it has had some “fearful experience”.
The relevant reports in Contemporary Biology magazine describe it as “the best preserved capicorn ever discovered and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world”.
The fossil is a newly discovered species of condensers that lived in the middle of the era of the white circulus between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
It was extremely well preserved and shocked the researchers, who described it as “unbelievably spectacular”.
According to the National Geographic Journal, this herbivorous capicorn dinosaur is the most preserved of its kind ever discovered.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn Funk discovered this fossil in a mine at the Senkol Millennium mine near McMurryburg in northern Alberta, Canada.
At that time, he encountered something that seemed different from the surrounding rocks and decided to look at it carefully.
The fossils he discovered were then sent to the Royal Tyrel Biological Museum of Canada.
It took six years for the researchers to show the true face of this beast, hidden within 2,500 pounds of earth (1,100 kg).
After such hard work, the final results are now published.
"If you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a scientist and first author at the Royal Tyrell Museum. The creature was displayed at the exhibit.
"It will be one of the most beautiful and preserved specimens in the history of science -- the Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world."
By studying their skin, researchers have found that this herbivorous creature, dressed in armor, is likely to face a major threat from predators, such as walking tanks.
The coated dinosaur uses red and white disguises to avoid predators, as well as covert techniques known as “backshade”, which are also used by many modern animals.
The expert indicated that in this way, it would be better integrated with the surrounding environment and thus avoid the enemy, indicating that it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
This one, which has a history of 110 million years, belongs to the Yuzhmorgeologiya family, which became the headlines for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrell Museum of Biology.
Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was a member of the team, has spent over 700 hours carefully unmasking the beast's veil, and researchers have now studied it and named it “Borealopelta markmitchelli”.
The sample was extremely well preserved, allowing Dr. Mitchell, as well as the international team of scientists, to record the patterns and shapes of the scales and armour on their bodies.
They found a “reverse shade”, a common defence in the animal community, which means that the back of the creature is darker than the color of its side.
Although “anti-shade” techniques are common, the results of the discovery are surprising, as the shape of the dinosaur is far greater than that of existing animals using anti-shade.
Such dinosaurs are under pressure to be hunted by predators, and thus evolve in a favourable direction, enabling them to hide in a base as a means of survival.
However, most of the existing animals that use anti-shadows, such as deer, zebra or Zebra, are as small and vulnerable as prey, indicating that the creature is under real survival pressure.
“The frenzy of predators of large-scale heavy-methyl dinosaurs shows how dangerous it is to be a meat-eating dinosaur”, Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales similarly indicates that the skin colour of the dinosaur is red brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the life clues of the creature, including the stomach contents it retains to find the last food to feed.
They believed that the dinosaurs had fallen into the river at the time of their death, then washed into the sea and then sunk to the sea floor in a back-down manner.
At that time, Alberta ' s climate was as warm as today ' s climate in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans could be deeper inland than they are today.
Brown said: “This is truly amazing, because it is completely covered by its slab skin, which is preserved, and it is still preserved in space so that its original shape can be preserved.”
“As a result, the creature is now in almost the same shape as it was in the circulatory era.
You don't need too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping.”
The era of the cataclysm is the time when the two-footed giant foot dinosaurs roam the Earth.
Although the Tyrannosaurus is the king of dinosaurs, it appears millions of years after the cape dinosaurs. The cape dinosaurs may have been captured by some of their ancestors.
They include high-strength dragons, a giant beast weighing 6 tons and 38 feet (11.5 metres).
Recent studies have found that scientists appearing in the journal Contemporary Biology believe that the mausoleum was washed into the sea after its death and that mummies were formed in the soil.
On 21 March 2011, Sean Fink dug up the creature at the Millennium mine near McMurryburg, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world ' s most well-maintained coated dinosaur, complete with skin and armor from the nose to the ass.
This creature is about 18 feet (5 m) long and weighs 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
It's got two 20 inches long, tipping up from the shoulder.
According to the researchers, the herbivorous capricorn dinosaur was active in the present western part of Canada and was then washed into the sea by a flood of rivers.
However, such dinosaurs are buried under the sea floor to preserve their cape in its entirety.
The fossil remains of this particular sample are very well preserved, leaving the remaining skins still covered with unsatisfied fragments of the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic, this level of preservation is as rare as winning.
The more I look, the more I think it's incredible.
The remaining skin fossils are still covered by the capped armor on the skull of the dinosaur.
Its right front hand is on its side and five toes spread up.
I can count it."
Journalists have learned that adding sea algae, corrosive acid and amino acid efficiency vehicles from natural or plant sources to the urea production process can modify the efficiency of traditional urea, resulting in an increase of 5 to 10 percentage points in the utilization of urea, zinc urea, and urea urea from grains compared to ordinary urea.
The potential for increased crop production is evident in an environmentally friendly environment, especially for urea added by large particles, which is a quality raw material for BB fertilizer.
This total number of security personnel is twice as high as the number of security personnel at the 2012 London Olympic Games.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Games, Brazil will launch the largest security linkage programme ever.
Previously, the Government of Brazil indicated that a total of 85,000 people from the army and police, including 20,000 troops and 65,000 police, would join forces.
Most of the troops will be responsible for the protection of the Olympic stadium, while the 3,000 additional troops will be responsible for the security of international airports, subway stations and streets.
The police patrol the rest of the city, including the subway, bus and street.
It is known that 6,000 troops have now arrived in Rio for Olympic security services.
In addition to being responsible for the four main areas of the Rio Games, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport and the main road connecting the airport to the Olympic stadium.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service sector is long overdue, and it is important to make them more effective and not more formal.
How do radicals learn to answer the question: "Who's street?
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was troubled.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the Saint-Louiser sat in his rented bed and browsed Facebook on his mobile phone.
She happened to find the post of a high school student.
It says, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid who was still lying on the street."
She was confused to find that no other person had published the message on the feed. She turned off Facebook and turned on Twitter.
One of @TheePharaah's users continues to send her the Dynamic Times.
The death of Michael Brown was broadcast live by rappers in St. Louis. Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He put on a body that Brown lost his vitals. His body was lying on the street for four hours.
"Crazy," Ferrer thought.
But death is not new to her or her community.
She dropped her cell phone and did not turn on Twitter again that night, reading tweets about the crowd gathering on Campfield Avenue.
There's a police video and a photo of people screaming, and there's a photo of a man who says he's Brown's father.
She saw a live feed from a policeman standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman raised his rifle screaming: “I will kill all of you... animals”.
“It's not normal,” Ferrer recalled.
“This is not what we used to call a classic murder.”
That moment, I felt chilly.
I'm angry, I'm crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
In the next three years, what happened to Ferrer and Ferguson was the theme of a new documentary, "Who's Street? " , which was shown at the cinema on August 11.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of those who live in this community, crowded in streets, demanding answers.
When Ferrer and her daughter drove to Ferguson (in a flower dress, with a crown coronation), they revisited the topic that they had discussed numerous times before that morning: “On black experiences and black conditions”.
"Do you remember when I taught you black people to fight for their faith?" She remembered.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is wrong.
I had to take her, "Ferrell, say it later.
“What happens today is the culmination of all the past.
She needs to know, see and rise from this.
She needs not only to develop well in radicalism and organization, but also to understand the different dimensions of black experience and the situation of black people and what we must do to achieve freedom and liberation.
Even if I had the privilege of giving her a racist experience that she had not experienced personally, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her on this, I think I'm hurting her."
They arrived at the first stop in Ferguson at a site opposite the South Florida Road Police Department. The site became their camp when militants waited for the outcome of the eventual non-prosecution of police officer Darren Wilson.
Ferrer and her daughter were in contact with a local business owner who made a bag full of lunches.
They prepared the bags and were responsible for transmitting them to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to develop a new type of activism.
She said, "My radicalism changed completely after August 9th." When studying undergraduate studies at the University of the State of Missouri at St. Louis, she was the president of the Association of Minority Nurses, focusing on food justice and health gaps in black communities.
“I have no organizational experience.
It's all here."
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with the film co-director, Sabah Fulayan, during a night march.
Freiyan said that she and her photographer Lucas Alvarado Fall “just wanted to record” what had happened.
There's a question in Ferrer's mind: "Do you want to record or find a story you can use?"
This suspicion stems from many cases of people -- usually white -- entering a community to benefit from their pain and resilience.
As Freiyan explained in a recent interview, “We heard that the native people of Ferguson did not concentrate their voices, and we wanted to do it differently”.
Freiyan has contacted co-director Damon Davis. Damon Davis is a regional artist known for his radicalism against prisoners on death row.
His involvement led Ferrer to join the other six locals in “Who's Street?” The project team, for several years after Brown was shot, has been on the move.
“This documentary is not about people talking to us or talking to us, it is about us.” Davis says.
"I'm concerned about how these people are presented, because that's how I'm presented."
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrer’s experience – but to show that the campaign was “not about the Savior’s leader, but about community cohesion”, Freián said – she proved to be the most open of film participants.
As a result, “Who's street?” is a surprising record of Ferrer's personal life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I feel naked," Ferrel laughed when he first saw the finished product.
“But I understand that doing this job and humanizing blacks requires a degree of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrer's story reaffirms and repositions the role of black cool women in the wider black life event movement.
Two of the three founders of the campaign -- created #BlackLivesMatter in social media after the shooting of Black Teeny Trevor Martin in 2012 -- were identified as cool.
“Black cool women in the leadership generally support this movement”, Ferrer said, “That is because we are fighting on multiple fronts.
Black cool women must bear all this.”
Freiyan agrees and mentions that “the movement is truly supported by black women and many black and cool women”.
Because of her identity, Ferrel was chosen as the centrepiece of the film. However, she maintained that “this is not a positive action for the cause”.
"She's the one who inspires this energy," she said.
“It is not a coincidence that she is on the front line. Because you have a lot to do as a black cool woman in these crossroads.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
At the same time, in Ferguson, news cameras had long disappeared, but ethnic tensions between the community and the police persisted.
Ferrer was given a suspended sentence of more than two and a half years for attempting to block the highway during a march.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in what she calls home: "A mess."
Nevertheless, since she went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she had insisted on the sacred song she had tried to remember.
“We have a duty to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can't lose any more, except the shackles on our bodies."
In fact, an online translation service was available 10 years ago, and it was a long time ago that the argument that “mechanicals are about to replace humans in translation” was heard.
Similarity: Artists use Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits.
There are multiple faces in the centre of the Freedman Museum in New York: white, black and brown, with almost undetectable similarities between each face, and these faces are tied by lines falling from the ceiling.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea Manning's cheeks and hair chips.
The former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking confidential diplomatic cables via the WikiLeaks website.
The exhibit, entitled “Similarities”, was opened on 2 August.
This was the result of two years of communications between Dewey Hagburg and Manning, who combined their disciplines with their own in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a well-known dissident, who had been imprisoned and had undergone a transgender operation in prison. The former President of the United States, Barack Obama, pardoned her remaining sentence three days before the end of her term.
Analyzing from Manning's DNA, and creating 30 portraits of the very likely appearance. With this, Hesseldwey Haborg made a sharp and somewhat inexorable comment. His comments are both about the polycentricity of DNA and about identity itself.
Manning was born under the name Bradley Edward, who publicly admitted to being a woman at puberty. Convicted in 2013, on 20 charges, including 6 espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photograph, a photo of her own in black and white with a platinum sense, which appeared to be clearly uneasy, sitting on the driver ' s seat, wearing a platinum-colored wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Haborg achieved tremendous success in her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
In that work, she used evidence from the middle court of cigarettes and gum, DNA from the scraps, creating a portrait of a possibly similar 3D person.
That's an e-mail she just got from PaperSmart magazine.
“They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison, and they need a photo,” Heather Duwayh Haborg told the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning was unable to visit and photograph, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she was interested in producing DNA portraits.
As a result, the artist and her imprisoned muss became unattainable pen pals who exchanged many letters over two years.
They even created a comic book, The Repressive Headshot, by Shoili Kanungo. The comic book foresees that the President would grant Manning privileges in the future and that she would be able to see the exhibition in prison.
And Obama asked for her release just a few days after the book was published. It may be a coincidence that Manning spent his seventh year in military prison in Kansas.
In addition, the exhibit has another meaning. Because of the modern United States, the Trump administration has continued to declare war against government leakers and transgender soldiers, while at the same time looking for new ways in which they can be tweaked on Twitter in order to inflame the division that this exhibition is about to bridge.
When asked about all this special occasion, Heather Dewey Haborg said, “Nothing happens for a reason”.
In the artist's statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning's super-size signature (the “i” of the name is drawn with one heart) is below, calling for an end to “the bickering of parties based on gender, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the other side of the wall is a sequence of her nematode DNA with a pencil twisting Cs, Gs and As symbols.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleic acid, a complex scientific dictionary of each artist), Heather Duvie Haborg would like to express, at least in terms of the physiological structure, the same for everyone by drawing these strangely similar portraits.
“I want people to get out of this. Our genome doesn't care who we are, how the open genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is.” Hesseldwey Haborg said his 2007 video, False Memory, was also shown.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so this is 30 stories."
The last piece of the exhibition, in one room, came from a page in a novel in the previous illustration.
It shows Manning, who is overrated and made up of King Kong under a loudspeaker at the hands of soldiers in the United States.
"When they stop your speech, they win." The wall says.
"So don't shut up."
"This came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said an artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm just afraid again, and I'm still going to say it."
Manning hasn't seen this exhibition in person, as foreseen in the comics, but when she does, she'll get cheers from her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters at the center of the gallery.
This is also a purpose, as is the case with all the items in the exhibition, to reach the height of the monogamy of her genetic information (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
"I used to hang them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a group of people." Dewey Hagburg said, "When he talked about portraits,
“But I want them to feel like a bunch of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting her release.”
Northwestern professor and Oxford employee wanted for homicide.
According to the police, a man was found fatally stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago, and a Northwestern university professor and an Oxford university employee were subsequently wanted and are currently looking for suspects throughout the country.
The Cook County Court records indicate that on Monday, 42-year-old Windham Laisem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were placed under arrest warrant for non-bailable murder in connection with the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Durrano.
According to documents, 26-year-old Connell Durrano died as a result of multiple stab wounds.
The community alarm issued by the Chicago Police stated that the body had been found on 27 July.
After receiving a telephone call, the police arrived at Grand Plaza's apartment and found several fractures on the victim's body.
According to the police, Cornell Durrano died instantly, the detective is investigating the murder, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Laisem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement, the Deputy Chief of the Campus Relations Division, Alan K. Kobbec, stated that Lesem had now been separated and had been banned from the Northwestern University campus.
According to Kobaki, “this is now a criminal case, which is being investigated by the relevant authorities and which Northwestern University is cooperating actively”.
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
In an e-mail statement, the spokesman for the Summerville College at Oxford University stated: “We have been in contact with the British police and stand ready to assist United States investigative agencies as needed”.
The statement added that Warren ' s colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped that he would surrender himself.
Anthony Gullermi, Chief Liaison Officer of the Chicago Police Department, expressed strong encouragement to suspects to surrender to the authorities.
According to Gullermi, “the police already have a general idea of their whereabouts and we are trying to locate possible locations”.
Gullermi indicated that local, regional and national authorities were doing their utmost to assist in the search for suspects.
Gullermi stated that the police had received a telephone call from the manager of Grand Plaza's apartment and that he had just received a confidential tip that apartment 1008 had occurred.
The police claimed that the situation was terrible.
According to Gullermi, it is still unclear whether this incident also occurred on July 27.
He stated that security cameras had confirmed that Lesem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe there is a connection between Professor Laisem and the victims”, Gullermi said.
Grand Plaza's management team issued a statement to the residents stating: “The police are currently studying the victim's timing and background, and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident”.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said “We will complete the road map for the world's anti-doping institutions in the near future”.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko stated that it would not take too long to implement the remaining standards for restoring the rights of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“The implementation of the road map standards has reached a stage where RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard, as indicated by Mutko on Thursday.
This was stated by Deputy Prime Minister Mutko when commenting on Part II of the Compliance of the World Anti-Doping Agency Road Map. This section sets out criteria for the restoration of RUSADA rights and has recently been published on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutko, the criteria do not contain anything that might cause concern to Russia.
He added that “everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be submitted to IOC [IOC] and WADA in the near future.”
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency must publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by Canadian lawyer Richard McKelen on the WADA incident of Russian State support for the use of doping in national sports.
Turning to this matter, Mutko said: “We are investigating, and our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind it, and we will not recognize what does not.”
Mutko responded to Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov acknowledged the problems of the Russian anti-doping agency in the past when he was interviewed by the media earlier that day, but added: “We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and provisions.
No one planned to accept the report unconditionally,” Smirnov said.
After the November 2015 stimulant scandal, WADA suspended the right of RUSADA to carry out stimulant screening in Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director-General Olivia Negri, during a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, stated that RUSADA was “going in the right direction” in an effort to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it be checkers or national chess, defeating human beings has been silent for decades.
In an interview, the President of the Croatian Football Association, Davo-Suk, stated that participation in the Chinese Cup was of great interest to Croatian football, and that the prize figures for the Cup were very high.
You don't have to do this anymore! Zero tariffs on over 8,000 products.
At a regular press conference organized by the Ministry of Commerce on 11 January, the Press Spokesman of the Department of Commerce indicated that, to date, 15 FTAs, covering 23 countries and territories, had been in force and covered more than 8,000 duty-free imports.
At the same time, imports of cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean wine, ASEAN tropical fruits... These products are bought at no further cost.
Currently, 16 free trade agreements have been signed with 24 countries and territories, and 15 have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 zero-tariff imports.
In the case of agricultural products, for example, with the implementation of FTAs, consumers are able to taste agricultural products of good quality and affordable quality from different sources every four seasons.
For example, in the case of tropical fruits such as guerres, twigs and dragon nuts in ASEAN, import duties were reduced from 15 to 30 per cent to zero.
The import duty for Icelandic salmon was reduced from 10 to 12 per cent to zero;
In Georgia and Chile, the import duty was reduced from 14 to 30 per cent to zero;
There are also significant tax reductions for specialty agricultural products such as beef and milk powder in New Zealand.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, the import duty on partial cosmetics in Switzerland has been reduced to zero;
(b) The duty on some watch imports was reduced by 50 per cent and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
Import duties for products such as refrigerators, cookers, massage machines, beauty machines, etc. were reduced by 40 per cent and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
There are also substantial tax reductions for consumer electronics.
At the same time, zero-tariff products under the FTA also include intermediate and raw materials required for the manufacture of many domestic end-use consumer goods, which also contribute to some structural upgrading of domestically produced consumer goods.
The Press Spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce, at his peak, stated that nearly one third of the country ' s total imports were eligible for preferential FTA tariffs, most of which were final consumer goods, with real benefits for consumers.
Further reduction of tariffs on imports of consumer goods
Since 1 December 2017, our country has adjusted tariffs on imports of some consumer goods to further reduce tariffs on imports of consumer goods, covering all categories of consumer goods, such as food, health care, medicines, solar products, clothing and footwear caps, household equipment, cultural entertainment, and daily groceries, with a total of 187 tax points.
The average tax rate on consumer goods will be reduced from 17.3 per cent to 7.7 per cent, almost “cut off”!
Since 1 January 2018, we have also made partial adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
The import duty on partial cosmetics, such as lipstick, eye shadows and perfume, was reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent;
Lowering tariffs means that consumers do not have to buy substitute products, much less travel abroad to buy preferred foreign products.
Yen2018 Import Trade Festival: Importing wine, snacks, fruit is cheap!
Extrapolation: U.S. malls at the end of the year have very different rules.
On December 29th.
According to the United States Daily World News, there was a wave of retrogressions just after Christmas.
According to the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), more than half of the commodities sold last Christmas were returned for exchange.
In addition, readers have been tricked on several occasions in the purchase of online materials, and consumers need to be careful when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable procedures for the return of goods, but care must be taken when buying gifts or electricians from small shops.
On 1 December, local time, Ms. Hoo of Rolando purchased a coat at 60 different (in United States dollars, the same amount) in an online shop specializing in printing jackets, which has not yet been sent.
She e-mailed the client and did not reply.
It was also reported that last year we went to the United States to buy a mobile phone from a third-party seller and that it was a box of rubber mud.
Knowing that they had been deceived, they applied to the website for a refund in full.
However, there are customers who believe that the website's refund service is not 100 per cent perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident in Northern California, said that he had purchased an emergency distribution service for a site twice, and had provided an emergency service of $4.00 at one time, but had not arrived on time on both occasions.
A refund was subsequently requested and no response was received.
There is a better return policy for large malls or shopping malls.
The majority of Macy's commodities are fully refunded within 180 days.
However, the commodity must remain “old” and must have a certificate of purchase, such as a receipt or a bank purchase record.
In the absence of a certificate, the customer can also obtain a mall score that can be used to purchase other goods.
Target usually has a 90-day deadline for the return of goods in general and 15 days for electronics.
However, the period for the return of electronic and recreational goods purchased between 1 November and 25 December 2017 was extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day period for refunds begins on 25 December, i.e. by 25 January 2018.
It's a great shopping experience. A new era of business shopping.
More than a decade ago, our country was generally in the seller market, with limited choices and demand.
However, after a decade of development, the market has been transformed from a seller's to a buyer's market, and today the taste of consumers has become less comfortable with a simple “pay-and-pay” shopping exercise.
Thus, how to provide consumers with an extraordinary shopping experience becomes the next point of competition for real estate developers.
Of the many factors that affect consumer shopping experiences, shopping centres in the business circles are the most important.
It's a good idea to see how city builders everywhere focus on shopping experiences.
There are no identical leaves in the world, let alone two identical shopping centres, and a famous shopping centre necessarily has its own characteristics.
For example, Turkey ' s famous Kanyon shopping mall, whose unique wave-shaped architectural design is inspired by the Canyon, is called Kanyon, which is called the Harmonious, and walks 200 metres in the middle of Kanyon ' s Minister ' s walk.
In addition to the canyon design, there is a large elliptical show in the centre of the shopping centre, with a unique appearance and frequent performances.
As a result of the open platform design, tourists are able to look down at the activities of the Canyon at every level and have the effect of changing the landscape.
At the national level, the Nanjing Forest Moor Commercial Street, known as China’s first forest-style stroller, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
The project consists of nine mono-structures, which are connected to the air corridor between the buildings. The entire courtyard is designed to take the French tree above the surface of the surface and the roof-water ceiling and create a forest-like feeling.
Walking into the forest of Moore, it's like falling into a rabbit hole in Alice's mind, climbing along a trunk that surrounds the buildings, the grass, the springs, and brings people into a forest full of life and vitality.
Also in Chongqing, the Lok Rikaham Circle of Waterworks was built to plan a multi-billion-dollar business with plans to introduce in the future more than 50 top international flag stores, more than 100 top international brands and more than 500 well-known national and foreign brands, and to create a business centre with a strong focus on service industries.
In addition, the Rigabin water business also integrates ecology into buildings, is guided by public transport through TOD, and brings together fashion shopping, life services, catering, entertainment, education, sports, and, while bringing great shopping experience to consumers, leads them to enjoy the unique “coastal culture” of Chongqing, integrating shopping with recreation and leisure on water.
On the whole, it can be seen that a section of the housing stock has now learned the trajectories of this new urban business, and industry has indicated that this consumption pattern, which focuses on consumer experiences, will also mainstream future urban development.
The business circles today are not just a repository of goods, but more integrated sites that integrate artistic culture and creative themes, but also bear responsibility for urban settlements.
Thus, while meeting the consumer ' s demand for one-stop food and drink, maximizing the multi-layered spiritual demand for the transmission of cultural and artistic art, and taking advantage of the live-in demand, must be a high point for the future development of the business community.
In Chongqing, the north bank of the country is located in the north of the river, close to the sound bridge, the world's commercial excellence, the international confluence, the first-class branding, and close to the international fashion world.
It's a beautiful place to walk, and it's a beautiful place.
Toshihara has a better shopping environment, with her proximity to the South Lawn business and her exclusive access to a four-tier, nationally leading, three-tiered transportation system, which improves shopping comfort.
In addition, the greening of gardens and landscapes on two foot blocks of Wanda Square and the planting of about 300 wood trees, the adaptation of 40,000 square metres and the enhancement of the image of the South Lawn business circle were carried out;
The first low-density riparian business, Lok Lok, near Chongqing, is surrounded by nine parks, with low-density commercial neighbourhoods and high openness, making people more willing to stay, stay and enjoy the pleasures of shopping, rather than being held up by those in the back, rushing forward to truly “walk shopping”.
Today’s commercial competition will only increase, and how to kill a bloodline in a highly homogenous market that will win the reputation of “shopping grounds” in the hearts of future consumers deserves serious consideration by all real estate developers.
Differentialization strategies alone are far from sufficient. Only developers that really put consumers in their hearts, rush consumers, think consumers, and provide consumers with an extremely simple shopping experience can laugh at the storm's coming markets.
Of course, at the end of the day, I think it's the people of Chongqing who have such good shopping experiences and business circles that no one could imagine today's prosperity 10 years ago.
Festivals: consumerist carnivals mask real environmental prices
This is the sum of $16.8 billion spent by Skycat users on 11 November 2017, within 24 hours of the World Carnival.
In particular, after the opening of the "two 11s", the amount of daily cat sales in three minutes exceeded 10 billion, more than 20 billion yuan in six minutes and 5 billion yuan in six minutes and 100 billion in nine hours.
The total number of payments made by global consumers through the payment of treasures reached 1.48 billion, an increase of 41 per cent over last year.
This consumption will result in 812 million logistics orders.
Whether the Skycat network buys platforms or pays for them, they all belong to the Ali Group in Mayun.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that the subculture of the Single Youth's Stifler Festival, created on 11 November as a result of self-censorship, would be taken up by the electrician as the bipolar 11s.
On November 11, 2009, for the first time, Ali Baba used the marketing head of the "Silent Stick Day Promotion": "Single Dogs" are buying online when no one is in love with you."
The result was surprising that the deal in the town of Treasure was worth over $52 million, 10 times the amount of the day-to-day transaction.
Since then, the “two 11” has become the shopping carnival created by Ali Baba, and nine years have passed since the arrival of domestic buyers to entertain themselves, and nine years have passed since Skycats’ “two 1,100 billion” transactions were more than 3200 times as high as that year, leaving “Black Friday” out of reach.
There are also a number of electric operators that sell double-xie with Windy Cat, of which Kyoto is the strongest.
Kyodong has its own shopping festival, “6.18”, but it does not have a double 11 impact, which lasts from 1 to 11 November, bringing the cumulative sales of Kyodong to $1271 billion.
And after the "two 11s" came a similar "two 12s" break-up, Christmas New Year's shopping slot.
After the new year, Chinese consumers are also waiting for the annual purchase slots before the spring festival, the Valentine's slots, the consumption, and no holidays.
Environmental problems caused by instant mass consumption have attracted professional and institutional attention.
According to Sino-China Daily Telegraph, it is conservatively estimated that at least 300,000 tons of waste was generated during this year's “two eleventh” period, based on the normal standard of 0.2 kg per container in the industry.
The director of the Pollution Prevention and Control Project of the East Asia Division for Greenpeace, Liu Wah, told the dialogue that this year's double 11 order volume of Skycats generated 160,000 tons of packaged garbage.
In 2016, the National Post Office issued a report indicating that the volume of fast packages for 2015 during the “two eleventh” period (11-16 November) was about 780 million, using more than 3 billion knitted bags, 9.922 billion packagings, 16,985 million m of tape, and that tape lengths could be around 425 laps of the Earth's equator.
This year, the National Post Office expects to have more than 1.5 billion fast copies of “twice 11” operations.
Wang, the manager of a waste burning centre in Beijing, told Xinhua that more than 2,000 tons of garbage entered the site every day after the "two elevens" and exceeded the capacity of the disposal station.
The express delivery company has become aware of the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry.
Some electric operators, including Sunin, have introduced recyclable reusable plastic delivery boxes and recycled bags that can be used as shopping bags and garbage bags before the “two-to-one” business, but the acceptance of troubled consumers is low.
Mayun also called on the logistics industry to support “green packaging” and “green logistics” in microblogging.
This microblogging yielded more than 68,000 “goods”.
What kind of mobile payment do the Germans want?
Zhang Winter Flank: The battle for mobile payments in Germany is not expected.
We believe that the payment and the payment of the treasure have moved the battlefield to Europe, that the rivals have not changed, and that the taking of positions — the Chinese — is globalization?
And there shall be a place where the treasure will be paid, and there shall be a place where the trust will be paid.
In accordance with the agreement with Wirecard, the German electronic payment service provider, Micro-Credit paid for the official landing in Germany in November this year, and gradually arranged for businesses in Europe.
This time, the two “back home” came back to Europe.
Over the years, the payment of treasures and micro-credit payments has been singing along the path of globalization.
With regard to the globalization of mobile payments in China, Iri Consulting, China's Third Party Mobile Payments Industry Study 2017, concluded that there are two types of investment through strategic investment, empirical output, equity entry and support for indigenous mobile payment enterprises abroad.
The second is the promotion of mobile payment services to foreign businesses through consumer behaviour by Chinese tourists abroad, thereby changing the perception and acceptance of China ' s mobile payments by foreign countries.
It's true, the Chinese have to get the world.
China ' s rapid economic development, combined with a large population base, has made the spending of Chinese tourists in Europe an attractive figure.
But it is also fated that this Chinese mobile payment battle in Germany has no expectation.
Is it globalization that Wesift paid and paid the treasures but moved the battlefield to Europe, and the rivals remained the same, and the positions seized remained the same — or the Chinese?
More groundbreaking is the question of whether China ' s mobile payments can expand its territory on its own soil.
Take Germany, for example.
The magic new retail.
Chen, Yang Kai-han: As the Amazon rushes into the world's top 10 retailers to announce his entry to military bookstores and grocery stores, both timing and motivation are interesting.
In November 2015, Amazon opened the first entity bookshop in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and Santiago.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened shop in New York and plans to have at least eight shopfronts by the end of the year.
At almost the same time, the Amazon announced that the no-man supermarket would be operated on a trial basis, that customers would not have to wait in line or close their books, that they would have to enter the door code, take the goods they wanted and leave, and that the purchases would be automatically deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
As far as the Amazon is concerned, it has suddenly been a surprise to see the frequency of movement over the physical store in recent years.
Because, as early as 2007, in the Open Letter to Shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos emphasized that Amazons would not open physical shops easily unless the following four conditions were met simultaneously:
1. We must be convinced that this new opportunity will give shareholders a return on their investments;
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great importance to the company as a whole;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
4. We must be convinced that in this market we have sufficient resources to make customer-oriented differentiation.
Bookshops and groceries are the most volatile classification of retail sales in both entities and the first rival to fall after the rise of the Amazon.
The announcement of access to both physical markets by the Amazon as it crowded into the world's top 10 retailers is both a time and a motive for play.
Is the Amazon practice contrary to the guarantees contained in the shareholders ' letters?
Similar voices were heard on the other side of the planet. On the morning of 13 October 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Yunming Congress, Mayun, Chairman of the Ali Baba Board, gave a keynote address.
He said, “From next year on, Alibaba will no longer refer to `e-commerce'.
The era of pure electricians will soon come to an end, with no e-commerce in the next decade or two, replaced by “new retail”.
New retailing occurs when offline and logistics are combined.”
At one point, the word “new retail” was as magical as it had been, and it had often been said by the industry.
But what exactly does “new retail” mean?
The concept is not new if it is simply combined on and offline.
In 2016, eMarketer followed 180 of the largest electricians, estimated that their total sales amounted to some $200 billion, of which the top 25 accounted for over $159 billion.
Of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers (such as Macy's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap) who only started operating online in the last five years.
The Alibaba Group also has $28.3 billion in shares in Sunin Yun.
Globally, retailers and electricians are moving from a single channel to a full-source retail system covering physical stores, electricians, mobile and socialized media.
Is Mavundi “new retailing” more a wrap-up rather than a vision for the future?
If not, what is the difference between the whole-channel concept and “new retail”?
Perhaps the question is not whether, but how.
Looking back at the last 20 years of retailing, the rise of electric generators, like early discount retailers, has focused on prices and convenience.
By relying on these two pain points, electricians move highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, from the bottom to the line.
With the growth of online consumption habits and the growing experience of customers, the electrician reaches out to other classes and starts to improve efficiency.
In the words of Zhang Yong, “the use of the ideas and technologies of the Internet to overhaul and upgrade the existing stock of about 30 trillion social retailers has made it possible to effectively meet the rising consumer demand of Chinese consumers and to make the entire process of production, circulation and services of goods more efficient because of the wide use of the Internet, big data”.
The electrician ' s path is thus a path of light assets and real heavy assets.
The term “light” refers to the burden of fixed assets, staffing, management processes, etc., which is not large in the traditional retail trade; the term “heavy” refers to the need for huge inputs in logistics, warehousing, etc.
Changes in logistics have ensured the efficiency of electric operators.
According to the Government of China, Premier Li Keqiang of the State Council chaired the Standing Meeting of the State Council on 28 April, which considered the expansion of domestic consumption demand to be an important step towards steady growth and structural adjustment.
It was determined that specific programmes should be undertaken by the relevant authorities on the basis of scientific assessments.
(b) A pilot reduction in import tariffs by the end of June of this year, with a gradual expansion of the range of tax-cutting goods, for a portion of the daily consumer goods that are in high demand for domestic consumers;
(b) To improve the consumer tax policy for consumer goods, such as clothing and cosmetics, in conjunction with tax reforms, and to harmonize the scope, rates and collection chain;
(a) To establish and restore duty-free shops at ports of entry, to expand the tax-free variety in a rational manner, to increase the amount of free purchases and to facilitate domestic consumers ' domestic purchases of foreign products;
Further promote the facilitation of customs clearance and tax refunds for foreign travellers and the strict application of voluntary tax declarations for imported goods in accordance with the law.
(c) Establish quarantine policies to support the import of cross-border electricians and clean up the import chain with unreasonable charges;
(c) To accelerate the development of Chinese product brand upgrading projects and support the development of physical shops to achieve online and offline interaction.
Regulating the market order, shaming and faking and promoting good and bad.
It's easy for consumers to shop near comfort.
BlackBerry has never won with hardware, but there's always something to look at in the face of peer crowding, so there's this passport that was released last September.
Sony (Soney) regularly presents a variety of black technology products, such as the 4K-reflective ultra-short-focus machine that was released at the beginning of the year.
Of course, the price of products at such a high atmospheric level is certainly a good price, with 5 million yen equivalent to 250,000 yuan, and enough to buy a car.
Large-sized luxurious television has been the representative of the technological power of major producers, as exemplified by the 77-inch curve of 4K OLD television, which won a soft LG.
This is not just a simple fixed angle warp television, but a complex device for users that allows them to adjust their curvatures according to location!
LG makes the entire tablet deformation difficult to detect with a 9mm super thin panel, thus achieving the maximum curvature of 4,000 Rs.
A user needs to be comfortable with pressing the remote, so that the best view of the 77-inch screen can move around and make it fit for any view.
Leica's position in the camera field is self-evident. This card is a product issued last year, and a brand-new T-calorie is used as a lens card for the card.

On 18 January, in Chongqing, Ali Baba convened a Summit Dialogue of Electricians against Poverty, which announced the promotion of poverty and rural revitalization by exploring a new model of “Internet + Poverty”.
This is a renewed “plus” of Ali's fight against poverty, following the presentation of the rural strategy, the launching of the Rural Treasure Project, the launching of the online pro-poor platform and the establishment of the Ali Baba Poverty Eradication Fund.
The fight against poverty is one of China ' s most important national strategies now.
A full eradication of poverty has never been achieved in China for thousands of years.
“The reduction of poverty by electricians is an innovation in a new round of pro-poor development and an important enabler for achieving a precise poverty reduction and a precise exit from poverty.
The Centre attaches great importance to the role that the Internet can play in helping to lift out poverty, promoting accurate poverty alleviation, and enabling agricultural products to move out of rural areas through the Internet.”
As a result, as early as 2014, Ali had proposed a rural strategy that, along with large data cloud computing and globalization, was listed among the three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched a rural treasure-hunting (village-paining) project to recruit “Stip 2” in the countryside to lead farmers out of poverty through electric operators.
In 2017, Ali worked with the business sector to create a channel for pro-poor farmers, which now covers 13 provinces and 120 poor counties across the country.
There are 2118 treasure-hunting villages on the Ali platform.
Of these, nearly 400 were found in poor districts in provinces and 33 in poor districts in 13 countries.
In 2017, the sale of the country ' s poaching villages reached $120 billion on the Ali Baba Chinese retail platform.
Zhang Yong stated that, in the face of a strong national strategy to combat poverty, Ali had been thinking about how to move out of poverty with innovative capabilities such as technology, big data, cloud computing and so on.
Among them, village poaching is the main carrying platform for the lifting out of poverty of the Ali electrician and leads to a new Internet link for direct marketing.
In the planting chain, village poaching and ants gold suits combine farming tools and microcredit support.
In 2017, out of 832 poor counties at the national level, 795 ants gold suits were provided with easy payment, credit, etc.
Greenbirds deal with storage and logistics, Skycats are responsible for marketing, and Aliyun's big data feed guides agricultural production and further improves the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of electric operators out of poverty requires not only products, marketing corridors, industrial planning but also human resources.
Through the University of Questing, Ali has taught farmers standardization, quality and scale farming methods, combining “poverty plus mind” to lift farmers out of poverty in a sustainable manner.
These courses already cover approximately 92 per cent of poor districts at the national level.
And the idea of “public-interest mentality, business instruments” as a way out of poverty would guarantee that Ali would be “real pro-poor” in reducing poverty.
Ma Yun, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ali Baba, had stated that poverty eradication should be divided into three phases: poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation and wealth-generation.
Poverty alleviation is the teaching of fish, and poverty alleviation is the teaching of fish, and wealth is the creation of a “fish pond” for farmers to feed.
Power-driven industries are pro-poor: fish ponds.
In the area of industrial poverty reduction, the Lochuan Apple Industry Poverty Model, developed by Ali in partnership with Shaan Shilokawa, has been replicated nationally as a model.
The anti-poverty work of the Ali electrician was also recognized at the decision-making level.
The electricity company, represented by Ali Baba, had been sent language to ensure that farmers increased their incomes through online and offline channels.
Some village and ant gold workers have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experiences of electric operators in lifting out of poverty.
Currently, the China office of the United Nations World Food Programme has been working with villages to reduce poverty in electricity industries, including Anhui.
On January 16, the Third Congress of the New Economic Think Tank, co-organized by the Ali Institute and China's Visionary Think tank, was held in the presence of Zhang Li, Director of the Institute of Electronic Commerce of the Ministry of Commerce.
In her view, our globalization has in fact ignored the most important issues, namely, the nature and use of globalization and the stages of globalization.
In this way, many believe that globalization has stalled and that many developed and developing countries, at a new stage, have different attitudes towards globalization and different patterns.
The second concept is the issue of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what are the constraints of the medium-term phase of globalization?
It is because of globalization that the economic base has changed that constraints have arisen.
According to Zhang Li, the global economic adjustment was largely over by the end of 2017 and would enter a new growth cycle after 2018, the next one having to be driven by raw products.
It is planned to open more than 1,000 shops nationwide in the next three to five years.
And with Ali's box of horse and horse, luminous super-species, Zolin's sour, the corpion's fish, etc., the “new retail door shop” began to collide and “call each other on innovative models and even prices”.
Where is the new retail?
“In 2018, we will be able to enter the country quickly, with a large number of stores opened in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival.”
The 10th CEO of the box revealed the “New Strike” of 2018 at the Second New Retail Summit.
“From 2018 onwards, the box was not just a fresh powerer, but rather a consumer-serving living-class electrician.
Under the core mode line is lead, experience, and online is real sales.”
Distinguished from the traditional malls and supermarkets, the box was born in the eyes of many consumers as a fun and delicious “net-red shop” and even the concept of a “box house” was introduced by intermediaries.
On-line electrician platforms and off-line retailers have advantages and disadvantages, while consumers appear on multiple channels, so both parties are experimenting with a full-channel model.
The industry believes that, in the broader context of consumption escalation, there will be a growing number of “boxes” in 2018.
The boxing of horses, from their early infancy, to more areas of consumption, foresaw more innovation in the retail market in the new year.
“For example, the business model of online and offline integration attracts the eyes of consumers, and the fresh supermarkets everywhere are called good.”
“These relationships are too much to talk about, they're no use to show off, and they end up giving consumers a good experience, and I'm willing to pay.”
In the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed and the demand for purchases has changed, according to CEO Yuanbin, a consortium of the Big Yunfa Flying Bull Network.
Turns out it's cut on and off the line, it's beaten on the line, it's under the counterattack line, it's holding hands together now, because there's no line-down distinction between consumers.
The competition for capital makes new retail gunpowder, which is currently represented by fresh supermarkets, all the way in.
The analysis suggests that the current competition for new retail sales in front-line cities is far from reaching the Red Sea pattern, with large areas of second-line cities yet to be tapped and markets still have significant opportunities and space.
The layout of new retailing in different types of industries brings the development of new retailing into a diversified development.
The China Institute for Economics and Economics Studies of the Chinese Institute of Social Sciences and Economics of the China Economic and Social Institute, China, has prepared a dry product, the Chinese electrician ' s annual development report.
In the course of the year, the Chinese electrician issued a report card?
What are the trends of global electric operators?
We'll show you.
The sales volume goes back to speed.
It's so cool to say that we've been experiencing super-high growth in online retail sales since 2006.
However, starting in 2013, the growth rate in online retailing began to fall below 50 per cent, and in 2015 it was below 40 per cent for the first time, and it turned into 26.2 per cent in 2016.
This year, however, the situation was different, with retail sales on the Internet accelerating again, rising to 34.2 per cent in January-September.
Growth rates are significantly higher than in 2015 and 2016.
It's possible that you're going around the world to find it more pleasurable to buy.
Of this amount, online retailing of physical goods amounted to nearly $5.8 trillion and online retailing of services to nearly $1.49 trillion.
The share of total retail sales of social goods reached 13.6 per cent, an increase of almost 3 percentage points over the same period.
Class, don't fall asleep. Focus. Service retail is a big success.
Second, French Internet users who love to cut their hands, with a net purchase per capita of US$ 1925, and who buy most of the goods on the Internet, clothing and fashion-loving land.
You must be young.

Amy Erett tried to investigate the well-being of employees at her e-commerce start-up company, but the investigation did not work.
Responses are often vague and unhelpful and, worse still, fraudulent.
Even though she had committed herself to anonymity, some employees still did not trust the process.
Erett, responsible for managing 75-person San Francisco e-commerce company Madison Reed, stated that “the responses received lacked consistency and objectivity”.
So she called for help.
A number of new human resources start-ups have emerged as springs of rain, helping companies to understand how employees feel.
They build and authorize software specifically designed to measure staff participation, which allows companies to conduct rapid polls for specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees and, in some cases, allow whistleblowers to bypass over-regulation and report directly to the board.
"Now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company Fitbit?" According to Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of the Redwood Entrepreneurship Company. Glint software analysis tools are used by companies to measure staff commitment.
Erett said that in three years she had gained more insight into the ideas and feelings of the employees with Glint.
In addition to the rapid investigation and opinion polls by specific teams, Glint also provides hot maps of the company, which offices have the highest number of complaints, and which managers have approved low scores — which gives her insight into the reasons.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must be skilled in controlling their workplace culture in order not to be the next step. The ex-employees who had previously published a blog post depicting the environment of harassment were punished by the company and then caught in a scandal.
For start-up companies such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a costly business opportunity.
According to the financial technology analysis website Let's Talk Payments, by 2020 the value of the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry could exceed $118.7 billion.
Convercent, a start-up firm in Denver, Colorado, dedicated to helping companies prevent and detect misconduct, saw an increase in interest and activity in this area earlier this year, when the reputation for ecstasy was damaged.
Convert has nearly 600 clients, including Abby, Microsoft and Tesla.
It was recently signed into a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized “diagnostic” surveys to collect confidential responses in real time and to view hot maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides anonymous text hotlines for employees to report misconduct.
If the chairman is implicated, the complaint will enter the board directly.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent, said: “The Court of Opinion usurped the powers of the regulatory body.
If a company is found to be bad at its employees or to be unethical at its employees, it may face the high consequences of consumer resistance, staff loss and involvement in litigation, as indicated by Quinlan, even if the regulator does not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a catering chain that spans more than 500 locations and has more than 25,000 employees, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of work guidelines and protocols and provide easy access to company headquarters.
Prior to this, if staff members wish to report problems, they must find a corporate headquarters telephone number or e-mail, file a formal complaint and hope that this will be taken seriously by headquarters.
This is often a fearsome and disturbing experience, with the legal adviser-in-chief of Ruby Tuesday, James Vitrano, saying that, in his view, there is no good way to track complaints from employees.
But now the company uses Convercent to identify and resolve more quickly problems previously unknown to executives in remote offices, cities or states, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage behaviour.
"I can understand the work experience more closely, 360 degrees across the board," said Vitrano, who is responsible for Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
“We are protecting our shareholders from employment proceedings.”
According to Quinlan, after the closure of the Andorran accounting firm for violation of ethical norms due to the Enron scandal, since 2002 companies have placed greater emphasis on ethics, values and staff professionalism.
But it was only after “social media entered their own world” that companies realized that they could not stop their explosion from being virally transmitted online.
“Before technology is used to monitor ethics, people see hope as a strategy”, he said.
Both Glint and Confercent used their software as a service and charged companies recurrent fees for the use of their products.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture investors, who have already supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with total capital rising to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, with a total of $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness of corporate, cultural and venture investments, these investments are hardly surprising.
An increasing number of studies show that today employees expect more from the workplace than before.
In highly competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high-paying and interesting projects are merely bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued and that their time is spent on a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to join the company, feel their voices heard, and their work is useful, they are more committed to making the company succeed.” LinkedIn Global Welfare and Staff Experience Vice President Nina McCartney said. LinkedIn uses both the Convert and the Glint software.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well when they work loyally and professionally.
It is not surprising that third-party analysis tools seek financial support if they promise to increase staff loyalty and professionalism.
The expert on workplace culture said that it was important to have data on the professionalism of employees.
However, those data would be useless unless the managers of the company took action.
In fact, if a company requires feedback from employees, it can be expected that change is taking place.
If change does not progress fast enough, or if little progress is made, it may create frustration and lead to staff leaving the company.
The consultant manager of Business Management Cot International stated, “If you are looking for 4000, then you need to be ready for 4000 conversations.” He had seen some companies rely too heavily on data-collection errors.
"Because if you don't follow through, the staff will think, "Do you really hear me?"
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I?"
Erett stated that Madison Reed was now conducting a monthly staff survey and had been able to take action on the day Glint reported the problem.
Having collected feedback from staff on their frustration with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to address the problem by reorganizing the intra-corporate team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees, and in the long run they want to be able to make a shift in this industry, which is known for its high rate of brain drain, to better retain their staff.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you'll lose talent," Vitrano says.
"If you lose talent, you lose clients.
And when you lose a client, you lose the company."

NCAA cancels training twice a day, prolongs the daytime training of the Bears.
At about 11 p.m., UCLA football team members wandered around the team's new campus practice field.
Some of the players have taken off their sweatshirts and showed that on the first day of the camp they tried to train their sweaty bodies.
For a large part of the team, this spare few minutes is a break.
After three hours of practice, the players in the summer course will return to the dormitory for final examination and then to the Wasserman Football Centre at 6.30 a.m. the next morning.
“The next three days are a bump for these guys,” said Jim Mora, the bear coach, on Monday, when he entered Tuesday.
NCAA cancelled the practice twice a day (in order to ease the burden on players), but actually extended their daytime training -- at least by Friday ' s end.
That's why the first three trainings at UCLA are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the schedule where the players are already crowded.
From the cancellation of two trainings per day to more training per day, the bear team conducted training almost a week before the last season, and Mora trained for the first time at the summer school in the six seasons of Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions on August 20th, and then start preparing for the official contest for the first Texas agro-workers in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA rule adjustment, although it would make the players busy and add another project.
“In three or four days, we will give them a huge amount of training, which is very challenging,” Mora said.
“They have just passed. They're grinding. They're great kids.
I think by Saturday we'll have more time, really great."
Once the camp is over, UCLA will stop training. This is not an easy task, given the proximity of the parking lot and the clarity of Luskin Center. The Luskin Center Hotel has been slammed by football across the post-gate fence.
Starting this weekend, the Bears will be staying at the hotel. However, Mora admitted that problems could arise once the rooms were vacant during the season.
“We'll take security measures”, Mora said.
“This is a real concern. It was not far-fetched to think that someone might rent a room and sit in it to record the training.
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good.
But we'll take security measures there and in parking lot 8.
We will make the best use of available resources.
I won't worry too much about that.
We have a plan."
ABS data show that in the second quarter of this year, the value of all Australian houses increased by an average of 1.5 to 2 per cent, with an annual increase of 3.5 per cent, the lowest annual increase since March 2013.

IT House reported morning news from the Wall Street Journal that AT&T had cancelled plans to sell China as a new flagship smartphone in the United States.
China's original plan announced the partnership at CES this week and AT&T cancelled it at the last minute.
In response, on 9 January, China responded to the press that, on 9 January, local time in the United States, it would release new products and specific listings to the United States market.
China indicated that over the past five years it had demonstrated its strength by launching high-end products in global and United States markets.
According to an earlier report by the IT House, a “best cell phone you've ever heard of” will be released on the afternoon of January 9th at the CES exhibition in Las Vegas, and its continuation will support two days of use.
It is widely accepted by industry that China will release this flagship mobile phone, which is Mate 10 Pro, on board the Android Oreo system.
The film "I'm not Pang Jinlian" , the main feature of the evening reporter Leung Bing, will be released on September 30.
Yesterday, the film held a seminar in Beijing on the theme “The Sadness of Comedy”, which was attended by three guests, Feng Xiaogang, Ning Ho and Tai Peng.
The contours of the drawings, the special features of "I'm not Pang Kinglin" and the contours of the contours, especially with a masked lens, are very fresh.
Feng Xiaogang explained, "It's a very similar subject to Zhang's Zhou Ju case, and it's easy for everyone to think of it together, and I'd like to see it in a way that everyone has never used. There's nothing special about it. It's just fun. It's something to do."
Feng Xiaogang said that he used his work as a virgin, learned from photographers how to take round pictures, and even spent millions of dollars to get photographers to take a 10-minute test.
Facebook will launch a fact-checking function to counter false news.
On Thursday, Facebook announced that more potential pranks would be sent to third-party testing agencies and that the results would be displayed below the original post. Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to fight so-called false news.
In its statement on the website, Facebook stated that it would begin to use an updated machine to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to the fact-checker, possibly showing the results of the fact-check under the original entry.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main outlets for so-called false news, and many people believe Facebook has influenced the 2016 presidential election in the United States.
This issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, where voters suffered a proliferation of false stories before the presidential elections in May, and Germany, which first approved a fine plan before the September elections, will be fined if social media networks fail to remove hate messages in time.
On Thursday, in a separate statement from Germany, Facebook indicated that a new fact-check function test was being initiated in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
On Facebook, the product manager Sarah Sue, in a blog, said: “In addition to seeing what stories are being questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people want more background to help them make informed decisions about what they read and share.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its “relevant articles” function and make other changes to its news summaries to reduce false news.
A drawing novel: the story of the castle of England.
Recently, the little Scottie Castle became the leading actor in a condensed music film and once became the refuge for Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Skotney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history in the Beale Valley in Kent, and now it is the inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire with a special hobby for historical documents with mops.
"You can see the handwriting of 300 years ago, and I find it beautiful," he says with all his eyes.
“What kind of human connection does this have in my hands.”
Throughout the Middle Ages and up to the Eduard era, the book “One Castle of England” recorded families living in Skotney, each of which was written by different, future British artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Roz's first book using archives as a raw material: He also wrote " Teeth and other stories of the dead 2014 " , a book inspired by the literature of the British Library, a work that he did with an uncontrollable passion for creativity.
He said, "I saw the thumbprint left on the side of the letter, which was written by a dual agent who worked for Jacobs in the 18th century."
"That's his fingerprints!
And the letter always smells like smoke, because then you need to light it up.
For us, 300 years later, the smell feels like they're with us.
Oh, I love archives!"
For those who are moved by old paper, it seems wonderful to have the support of the National Trust of England and the Arts Council and lived in the castle for almost four months.
Rhodes spent several days visiting Victoria's “new” castle, looking at archives, studying many of the estate's treasures and old games, such as hyena heads hanging on walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered on the land and ruins of the old castle, chatting with vagrants, gardeners, and sometimes with artists who drew illustrations for his book.
And then at night, he'd say, "Drink up and write."
The secret history of Scottie is not yet clear, because the British National Trust only entered the country after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hersey, in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff began processing the files, and he described them as: “The nobles are leaving hundreds of years ago: “Oh, put them in the attic”.
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps of national boundaries: “You'll think land disputes will be boring”, Rhodes said, “But two families will fight for a white tree.
Let go, guys!"
Some of the stories in this work, starting with the castle, went on to look at the history of Britain at a broader level, including The Laborer, which leads to a man who left the new castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
The story of the book, "Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex" recorded a riot in the castle in 1380, says Rhodes.
“The peasant uprising began in that area, and I think it was a good place to launch it.
Maybe there's a connection?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the period of British religious reform.
Or The Smuggler, the owner of the story is Arthur Darrell, the 18th century smuggler, who is thought to have his funeral by filling his coffin with stones (a few years later his coffin was exposed to the ground).
The Darrells are Roz's favorite house of the Skotney Castle: "These gentlemen seem to be scoundrels, always borrowing money and buying things they can't afford.
A generation after a generation of Darrell men have resolved their debt by marrying wealthy old women, and I think they should be a group of handsome young men who know how to pursue women.”
As his mission in the castle ended, Rhodes began to look for other strange writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the wasteland of Finland doing a drawing novel about "El?m?nm?ki," an early 20th century sanatorium that was slowly abandoned.
But Scottie has a special place for him.
"I left sad," he said.
"It's like, "Oh, I've got to face the real life of a scooter." "'"
It is understood by journalists that the headquarters of the Chinese smart car team is in Joohai, and that the operator is Tanaka, Vice-President of the Chinese Communications Department.
All large energy companies are “rich and hostile”, so who among the many energy companies around the world takes the best advantage?
Yesterday, the well-known PFC Energy Corporation announced its top 50 listings in 2011, and the United States oil and gas producer, ExxonMobil, won with a market value of $40.63 billion, followed by Chinese oil and the Dutch Royal Shell.
In the PFC list, Chinese oil had been at the top of the list twice in 2007 and 2009, with all the other years being held by ExxonMobil.
In 2011, a total of three companies from mainland China were included in the list of top 50, with China ' s petrochemical ninth and China ' s 15th maritime oil in addition to the second-ranked Chinese oil.
According to the PFC, however, although current oil prices are much higher than they were four years ago, the CEO of the PFC Energy Corporation points out that there are many reasons for the low overall market value, mainly the decline in gas prices in North America and the low dynamism of the global stock market.
According to Xinhua, heavy pollution weather, which began in and around Kyoto in 16 years, intensified on 19 December, with the appearance of an “explosive watch” in AQI in Hebei Shiji, Xinjiang and Zhui City.
United States changes to green card regulations
The media quoted President Donald Trump as saying that the United States would introduce a new immigration scheme to amend the Green Card.
The scheme aims to reduce legal migration to 50,000 persons per year, and temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications are subject to stricter regulations.
The new provisions were proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in both houses.
The United States media quoted Trump as saying, “This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save billions of dollars for taxpayers and realize these benefits by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law would replace the current programme and reduce chain migration.
This new application process facilitates English speaking, financial support and skills for economic development.”
On 29 May, the first China Fireworks and Firecrackers Safe Environment Fair will be held in Xiyang.
The event was organized around the theme “Technology, safety and environmental protection” for two days. At that time, the state-of-the-art pyrotechnic machinery in the national fireworks industry, the most safe and environmentally safe granular material and new products will be brought together for the sun.

In order to optimize the landscape environment and build beautiful South China, the “636” voluntary service unit of the South China Tobacco Office (a sub-company) has recently carried out an environmental campaign entitled “Standing, Home-Friendly”.
The activities were supported not only by the staff of the regional tobacco directorates, but also by the participation of retired seniors and family members in environmental practices. Three generations of young and old were working together to raise trees, clean up garbage and contribute to building a beautiful South China.
The voluntary service campaign aims to protect the resources of the Southern Landscape and to promote the concept of volunteerism as “care for others, care for society, care for nature”. It also enables the next generation to embrace the virtues of volunteerism from an early age.
According to the information received, since its inception in early April this year, the “636” Volunteer Service Group has 16 development members who have been engaged in a series of volunteer activities, such as visiting disadvantaged retail clients, helping smokers to care for tobacco leaves, and contributing to the love of the Jan earthquake, and have become a volunteer force to deliver positive energy.

Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful.
Just when you thought 2017 wouldn't be weirder, a new technology development report was released in the sex robot field.
Yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Shaggy, Professor Emeritus of Robotic Technology and Artificial Intelligence and Co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking the emergence of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color, nipple shape and nail type of robot.
In his new report, Shaggy said, “People laugh behind their backs, but big companies do have many sex robots, and we see more.”
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robotics, with silicone skin, touching warm skins and deliberately using artificial intelligence to set human-like sexual responses.
Users can also “self-defined” their robots to satisfy their preferences, ranging from eye colours, nipple shapes to nail types or colours.
But what's even more disturbing is that many robots with a "personality" make a "replicating wife" look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
RealBotix, for example, can come from a definition based on the characteristics that users consider attractive, such as shyness.
There are Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, which predetermine character features, including a slightly shy “cold fala” and a “presumptuously risking” “Woody Wild”.
"Roxxy Gold robots have as much personality as you can, and True Companion's website is happy about it."
That's why she loves you and hates you.
She was just like normal people.
She can be lazy, talkative, and "sexually dynamic!"
The rise of sex robots has created a great deal of anxiety — not only to replace real human relations — but also the femininity of the bow and the implication of rape on the cold (read: resistance) of Farah.
True Companion compares Roxxy to a man's shock stick on his website.
The website says, "If a woman has a vibrating stick, why can't a man have Roxxy?"
But these sex robots are not a mere lover, not just a sex toy.
Their emergence and growing maturity point directly to the darker and deeper part of our culture: from perfect gender equality to submissive sex.
Of course, most men don't have sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming popular, they are still on the edge of the consumer culture.
But what penetrates from the margins allows us to see the process of our time.
Many were neither weird nor aggressive until the free market gave them the opportunity to become so.
It is no coincidence that these fine sex robots emerged at a time when the rights of women around the globe were threatened and that there was a President in the White House bragging about sexual violence against women.
The most timid part of the television show " The story of the maids " is not the reality, not the hanging corpse, nor the excavated eyes, but the overreal imagination.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but it does not look so far away.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create, as technically as possible, the most female-like body (although in proportion to porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have human touch and imitate real human action.
But, frankly, their “personality” does not represent the real woman.
They can't break up or run away.
They have no recourse and no follow-up stories, no independence at all, and no illusions of complete slavery.
In other words, they are fun slaves.
Or according to the common saying of 2017: handmaiden.

Deng Chau said, "In the performance, I will not do the same thing, I will keep updating."
The great work of Trump?
Let Mitt Romney become a microcosm of common sense.
Political differences led to polarization among United States voters, while, from a micro-level point of view, United States family harmony was undermined. It's been strange for the Trump era.
Before and after Christmas and Thanksgiving, major newspapers in the United States featured in the commentary column how to deal with the fear of voting for Trump relatives.
It is generally believed that we are doing our best to pierce our “filtration foam”.
Less so, Trump has brought family together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, has long been at odds with the Republicans in our home, and he is coming to New York to visit me this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
As a result of working with Trump in the White House, all of the people she knew, including even the relatives of Republicans who had been in political quarrels for decades, were now suddenly and strangely on the same front.
It would certainly be a good thing if all were at the table. But I am alarmed that, from a broader perspective, this poses significant risks.
Although leftist figures have been encouraged by Trump, the warp effect of his presidency drives us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are talking about the possibility of fear that his eccentric behaviour might stop one day.
However, there is also a more worrying and long-term scenario in which the “normalization” of Trump's relationship with right-wing Republicans, who had previously opposed the President's criteria, suddenly appeared to be a symbol of reason.
I found myself a little eccentric about Mitt Romney recently: putting a dog on a car, 14 percent of his income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), and the crime of these two acts seems to be too minor compared to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate needs only reason to qualify for immeasurable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town, we took the kids to the New York Park's carousel, the biggest carousel run by the New York Central Park administration, and if you don't need coffee, these three-dollar tickets are your most consumer value in the city.
The sound of the horses is thunderous, the central cylinder is designed for fibreglass, all the clowns and animals twist their heads, the horrors and evils look at their shoulders, while the music of the clinking sounds strangely.
Too many mediocre cities are disappointing: from the landscape overlooking the buildings, the skyline becomes too familiar to provide too much stimulus, and the reality of cities does not sustain dreams.
Thirty-five years later, I haven't completely forgotten that day, and I find that this "Swiss House" is not really a Swiss cabin, but rather an old Swiss cabin (Ye Olde Swiss Cottonage) in the theme bar. I can't remember it, but it's near a junction in northern London.
However, the merry-go-round in Central Park is still a magical experience, and everyone has fun for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old and four girls in their 40s.
If I could evaluate the carousel, I'd give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, I was asked to give a one-to-five-star rating of my trading “experiment” before writing a credit card.
And that's what happened in my coffee shop in the corner of the street, and you could use a 15% tip to rate it, for shopping on the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should have been a neutral trade, but also to put pressure on service providers to add personal factors to situations that are not needed.
The poor woman at the department store laughed, and I was exhausted, and she was rated five stars by the credit card deal.
Oscar Pistolis was transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain.
This is the second time Pistolis has left the prison for hospital transfer.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital to treat a cut on his wrist, which was officially attributed to his fall in the cell.
Following an appeal by the prosecutor against the original decision of manslaughter, Pistolis was convicted of murder.
At dawn on Valentine ' s Day in 2013, he was shot several times in his home in Pretoria through the toilet door in Stinkamp, where he died.
Pistolis claimed to mistook his girlfriend for a break-in at night.
The prosecutor has announced their intention to appeal again, this time for a six-year prison term against Pistolis, which they consider too generous.
The National Public Prosecutor ' s Office has indicated that an appeal will be lodged with the Supreme Court of South Africa and that this appeal can be heard this year.
If the prosecutor wins, Pistolis will face a 15-year sentence.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

On 18 May, the Ministry of Finance published the Special Fund for Industrial Enterprise Restructuring, which will arrange for special funds to be made available to help defuse the excess capacity in the coal and steel industries, amounting to $100 billion.
Several local governments, such as Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilong River, have recently proposed reforms to address excess capacity.
A number of these provinces have even offered to actively seek financial support from the central financial authorities for de-productivity in their provinces.
It is supported by the fact that in only eight provinces the declared coal-de-energy target stands at 90 per cent of the national coal reduction plan.
In an interview with a journalist, Lim Boqiang, Director of China's Energy Policy Research Institute at Xiamen University, argued that the “defeating capacity” of the steel and coal industries was far from enough to rely on 100 billion yuan from the centre, and that more funding was needed from local governments and businesses. How?
In its recently published implementing regulations for coal decapitation in Shanxi province, the Shanxi Coal Group was transformed into a State-owned capital investment company, which reorganized the assets and operations of the enterprise and built a completely new business model.
Prior to the real shortfall in funding, which may be three times greater than the subsidy, the Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, Yoo-min, indicated that the initial figure of 1.3 million employees' coal systems, and 500,000 steel systems, would be diverted from production capacity.

Does meat, dairy products and chocolate help to alleviate inflammatory enteropathy (IBD)?
Meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmare of your digestive system.
However, a new study shows the opposite: diets rich in meat protein and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms associated with inflammatory enteric diseases.
This incurable disease affects the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 British, leading to stomach convulsions and abdominal swelling, recurrent or haemorrhagic diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington typically advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to mitigate symptoms, but they find that key amino-coloural acids in proteins help to promote immunocellular cell growth, which enhances intestine resistance.
Dr. Marco Colona, Principal Researcher, explained that immunocellular cells patrol in the intestinal tract to ensure that harmful microorganisms hidden in food do not enter the body quietly.
The balance between cells that cause inflammation and those that increase tolerance is maintained to protect the body from various sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
Inflammatory enteria can occur when the equilibrium is too biased.
An immune cell was found in rats carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria require chromium acid (one of the protein components) to form the form of cells.
Professor Colona said, “We have established a link between a bacterial species (Royx Bacillus, a normal part of the intestinal microbial community) and a population of resistant cells.
The more coloural amino acid the mice consume in their diet, the more immune cells they have.
He suggested that if humans used the same method, i.e., the combination of Lactus and colour-rich diets could create a more resistant and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Luisa Cervantes-Barragangwas, a postdoctoral researcher, studied an immunocellular cell that enhanced resistance, when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but the same strain was not raised separately.
She suspected that the difference was related to the group of intestinal microbes (bacterium, viruses and fungi, usually living in the gastrointestinal tract).
DNA sequenced cholesterol in mice, six bacterial species were found in mice with immunocells, but not in mice without immunocells.
Rats are raised in a sterile environment, so they lack intestinal microbes and cannot be immunosuppressed cells, while the presence of rubella milk produces immunos.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers cultivate rubella in liquids and then transfer a small amount of bacterial liquids to premature immunocellular cells separated from mice.
The immunocellular development becomes resistant.
When the active ingredient is pured from the liquid, it can be shown to be a by-product of the metabolism of chromamate, known as thallium-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of chromium acid in rat feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 per cent, but by half when the level of chromium acid was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragán explains that people have the same stress-resilient cells as rats, and that most of us have rubella in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether humans can induce cell development by-products of chromiumine by-products of rubella in humans, like the lab rats, but the genetic defects associated with chlamydia are found in patients with inflammatory enters.
She said, "The growth of these cells may be the result of what we want, because they control the inflammation of the intestinal surface.
Unprecisely, the presence of high-level coloured amino acids in the rubella may lead to an increase in the number of species.
José Mureño thinks Mann has signed "genius" Nemania Matic.
On Wednesday night, after the first appearance of Nemania Matitch in the Sampdolia confrontation, Murigno concluded that Mannion had signed a “genius” midfield player.
Matich, from Chelsea, signed up to £40 million, playing 2-1 on Tuesday in the final pre-season tournament in Dublin before the European Super Bowl in Royal Madrid, won the favor of Paul Bogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, during the pre-Brusty Asian Tour, the Maticchi competition was seriously inadequate, with only 45 minutes to complete, and Murigno acknowledged that improvements were needed before the British Super season began.
“He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and genius thinking — he thinks football,” said Murigno.
"We'll help him prepare as soon as possible."
Murinio began arranging his first appearance at the beginning of the season. Like Martinic, newly contracted players Victor Linderov and Romelou Lucacu also started the game at the Injehua Stadium.
This week, the independent newspaper reported that Murigno still wished to introduce three more contract players, but he insisted that the club was “excellent” and that he had four top contract players in his heart, three of whom had already been introduced.
“The club has brought in three of the contract players, and I am very grateful.” He added.
“If the club could bring in all four players, I would be happier, but they've done a great deal for me.”
If China hadn't built this type of warship, would it have fallen behind?
With the recent announcement by the world’s major naval powers of plans for the construction of new types of frigates, it seems as though they were the focus of the naval forces of the great Powers overnight, starting with Japan’s decision to procure two new types of frigates in the 2018 defence budget, which has finally led to a substantial breakthrough in the Japanese frigate programme, followed by the recent announcement by Lockheed Martin of the latest plans for the United States frigate program FFG by the United States.
With the release of one of the latest frigates, the 054A, in late 2017, marking the construction of up to 29 frigates, it has approached the sum of the 053H series of frigates, and it has been 12 years since the first 054A was brought down in 2006, with the construction of such a large number of high-performance corvettes worldwide, with the exception of China, and only the “Perry” class frigates built by the United States in the 1970s and 1980s.
The reason why so many 054As have been built is simple: they are affordable, useful and additional to years of naval debt.
The 054A frigate has been favoured by the Chinese Navy for many years on the basis of high value and good combat power, with about 4,000 tons of drainage, with a 76 mm main gun, 32 units of red flags-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine launch systems, 8 eagles hitting 83 and a direct-9 helicopter, although it was built in 2006 and designed earlier, but even if it is placed in today’s condition, it can reach a moderate level among the world’s frigates.
But, after all, this is a type I ship designed at the beginning of the twenty-first century, equipped with weapons, whose power systems and electronic radar equipment are already very different from the current world-dominated frigates, as Europe’s corvettes are already equipped with full electric propulsion, small multifunctional phase-control radars, large-sized helicopter decks, and the time has come to develop a new type.
So how should China ' s new frigate develop? This is directly related to its future positioning and strategic approach to our naval forces.
The future of China’s navy will become a blue-water navy, and the future will be a seaward one, with rapid deployment in areas where China’s interests are at stake, a demonstration of the presence of force and, if necessary, a strong force to ensure that China’s vital interests in the region are not undermined.
Looking again at the positioning of new types of frigates in future Chinese naval sequences, the future Chinese navy should be similar to the United States Navy, which, in addition to the required offshore defence vessels, will form carrier battle groups or amphibious strike fleets, depending on the circumstances.
The role of the new frigate, on the other hand, should serve as the main anti-submarine force in future carrier battle groups, as well as an empty area in the center and near regions, and an amphibious attack ship strike group, requiring, on the basis of this demand, that the new frigate must have a strong anti-submarine capability and a good medium-range area clearance capability.
Based on the above positioning, it is bold to imagine the shape of a future national frigate.
First of all, there will be a significant increase in drainage compared to the current frigate type 054A, which is estimated to have about 5000-6000 tons; the power system will use an integrated power propulsion system consisting of a QC280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines, with a maximum speed of about 30 knots and a substantial increase in continuity; With regard to the arming of the 76 mm main gun and the 1130 close defence gun, it should be retained, but a red flag 10 launch system would be added, with a 32-48 unit red flag 16 improvement and fish-8 co-mounted protraction system behind the main cannon, and a large 8-16 unit pertving system should be added to the back of the ship for the launch of the Eagle 18 and the new type of cruise missile; the hangar and parking platform would also be increased to reach the stationing and storage of two 10-ton helicopters; With regard to electronic radar systems, the high-suited radar should be equipped with a small four-sided fixed phase-control radar based on the 346A development, and the low-suited radar could be similar to the European frigate ' s multi-purpose rotation phase-control radar.
This would bring the overall level of the new frigate to its current world-class level, even in comparison to the United States FPG.
Of course, the above concept is just an assumption by the author of the new frigate of national origin, how exactly we can only wait for the new frigate to go into the water to find out, so let us all look forward to it.

Of these, around 80 per cent were medium- and long-term loans, mainly for housing, but, on an incremental basis, short-term consumer loans grew faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition, China ' s household debt rate is only a measure of the total amount of credit received by the household sector from financial institutions, while there are many private loans, including from relatives and friends, and large-scale hidden debts.
Seen in this way, there is some obfuscation. According to the Suning Institute of Finance, China ' s leverage rate was only 3 per cent in 1996 and 18 per cent in 2008, but since 2008 it has begun to grow rapidly, doubling to 36.4 per cent in just six years. By the third quarter of 2017, the rate had reached 48.6 per cent.
In another comparison, last May the HSBC Bank published a survey that spans nine countries and is close to 10,000 people.
The report is addressed to young people from nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
The report indicates that China ' s 80-90-year-old youth housing ownership is as high as 70 per cent and that it is the second-largest Mexican (46 per cent) and twice as high as the United States target (35 per cent).
These data tell us that there is a great potential problem, namely, that the largest potential “grey rhinoceros” in China at this stage may not be able to pay the debt, compared to the inability to afford housing.
Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have previously analysed, although we have been saying that housing prices are high in China, the country's housing ownership rate is actually quite high compared to the rest of the world, so rather than the high cost of housing, I'm afraid the question for many friends now is whether you can afford a loan?
As we look at the world's real estate markets, China's real estate markets, due to their late start, have not experienced an excessive real estate crisis, except for what we said earlier in Hainan, but the origin of the world's financial tsunami of 2008 was the US real estate crisis just a decade ago.
The real estate crisis in the United States, on the other hand, was attributed to two houses: Remy and the United States.
In the golden age of the United States, when real estate companies sold their houses to the then low-income American population at very low downs in order to expand their sales, the real estate market was also booming when the United States economy was better, but the good news was that, with growth stagnating in the United States, it had led to lower incomes for home buyers, and a significant decline in household consumption spending began.
However, the current situation in the United States was that of a financial and real estate asset that formed part of United States household assets, with almost all household assets of low-income groups in the United States being real estate, while most of the assets of the top 20 per cent of the high-income groups were financial assets, resulting in higher debt ratios for the poorer households in the United States.
A serious fact is that these people buy houses when the economy is better, so the money paid for the mortgage is also calculated in terms of their better income. When the income falls, not only does the pressure on the mortgage not diminish, but even because some subprime schemes have increased, so the real estate problems of these American families have gradually become a real estate crisis.
As a result, the banks began to repossess the property because they were too low in income to pay for it, and after the banks had recovered the property from the buyer who had defaulted on the loan, they would sell it at very low prices, leading to a gradual decline in the region ' s housing prices, a process that led to a further decline in the price of the house, creating a vicious circle in which, when the house price fell to a certain extent, more and more buyers found their house to be even less valuable than their own loans, resulting in more people stopping to repay their mortgages and more bad debts.
As a result, a huge vicious circle emerged:
“The economic downturn — the decline in income — some people cannot afford to pay their mortgages — the low bank prices for the sale of the houses of the debtors — the fall in the house prices — more people stop paying their mortgages — the banks sell again — and the prices fall ”
The problem is more than that, because the price of the house continues to fall, it is not that you have no debt after people stop paying the house to the bank, and if the bank has not received the money you owe the bank, then you still need to pay back, simply assuming that you bought a house worth $3 million with a down payment of $600,000, $2.4 million with a down payment, and that when the house was worth only $2 million, you stopped paying the house to the bank, and after the bank auctioned the house, you not only lost your down payment of $600,000, but you owe the bank $400,000.
Thus, in such a vicious cycle, the United States economy gradually collapsed, culminating in the 2008 United States financial crisis.
Thus, at this stage, China’s high household debt rate of 46.8 per cent is a matter of great caution. This figure is still below that of the developed world, but the problem has begun to emerge, and the country has repeatedly emphasized the issue of deleveraging since last year. This is a very early judgement that if the household debt rate is allowed to continue rising, it will entail enormous risks, so that financial risks will be carefully prevented.
As a result, the country has accelerated the establishment of multi-subject supply, multi-channel security, lease-purchase and other measures to further address potential risks.
For our individual families, it is important to abandon speculative thinking about real estate and to buy a house as much as possible, so that their families do not fall into a huge burden. Only a reasonable assessment of their income and level of indebtedness is a healthy path to family wealth development.

An English inventor implants a chip in his own body and waves his hand into the car.
A British inventor installs a chip for himself, waving his hand to open his front door, enter his office and even start the car, becoming the first person in the country.
33-year-old Steven Northham planted a small chip between his thumb and index finger and is now providing this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, which is done by his company, BioTeq, through technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Jeff Watson, Senior Anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure that the implantation process meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to cat and dog chip implants and only takes 30 seconds.
Mr. Northham ' s company will also replace the locks of the rooms and vehicles to match the chip, at a cost of £300 per lock.
The married father, who had a child, now installed the technology for his family and his BMW Z4, and he could start the car by putting his hands on the wheel.

On 10 July, the National Statistical Office published the National Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Industrial Producer Price Index (PPI) for the month of June 2016.
White House props cost thousands.
According to military records published in Time magazine, last month the White House decided to transport a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great honour of American manufacturing, at a cost of up to $24,000.
The Green and White Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as the Marines I when the President was aboard, was an important exhibit in the White House on July 17, highlighting United States construction activities.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Burns and senior White House officials visited manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibit consisted of helicopters manufactured in Connecticut, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the records of the first flight unit (HMX-1) of the unit of the Marine Corps responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House military office requested the helicopter to appear on its day-to-day orders (FRAGO) for only 36 hours before landing on the south lawn for this “special” event.
The day before the event, Commander HMX-1, in an e-mail sent to his superior deputy commanding officer of the Marine Corps flight, said, “I just want to confirm that you know that this activity has been given high priority”.
The information indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on 17 July to attend the event at 3 p.m. and would not leave until 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on the same day.
The information also indicated that, in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, a second crew would be required to return because of the time constraints on duty.
The original crew was on standby by helicopter during the operation, while the security forces were on standby nearby while the aircraft was on the ground.
The records of Time magazine do not clearly indicate the eventual need for a second crew.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record indicates that HMX-1 asked whether the event had violated the Act.
The commander wrote: “The question we ask is whether this is a violation of the Hachi Act and is informed that there is no violation”.
"Sounds like you're locked in," the deputy commander replied.
The White House defined this “American manufacturing” activity as an official activity and was therefore not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even official activities are political.
At the event, the President pursued the issue of the then Senate: medical reform, and the regulation of government regulations.
The use of Marine 1 or Air Force 1 aircraft for political propaganda purposes is no longer new.
Successive Presidents have been asked to travel by these aircraft.
However, their expropriation for photographic purposes is not common.
In February, Trump received attention when, in Melbourne, Florida, the presidential jet slowly slipped and ended up in the background of his first campaign rally, while his Twitter account was filled with information about complaints about the former president ' s use of the presidential jet.
“The White House is so excited by this `American-made' exhibition, which shows all 50 states' products made by American workers using American materials.”
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn to practice the accurate placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
Early in July, during the G-20 in Germany, HMX-1 practiced 58 landings in the White House.
One official stated that the United States manufacturing flight was included in the crew training requirements for the month.
The helicopter unit also flew an extra 11 hours of "non-presidential support mission".
The White House stated that the taxpayer did not bear the cost of any other props in the event.
Sikorsky spokesmen stated that the company was not involved in arranging the South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 did not maintain a budget record for the President ' s flight, and it was therefore very difficult to determine the exact costs of the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence ' s hourly costs for the financial year 2017, VH-3D ' s Ministry of Defence is entitled to reimbursement in the amount of USD 24,380 per flight hour.
The unit recorded a 30-minute flight time per flight from the base of the Marine Corps at Quantico Airport, Virginia.
The White House claimed that the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower.
According to Walters, “it is highly misleading to estimate taxpayers' costs on the basis of reimbursable fees.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs included in the annual appropriation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the reimbursable costs of the Ministry of Defence did not include personnel costs, but did include oil, maintenance and contractual costs.
On that occasion, Sean Spike, former White House news spokesman, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to show what the United States is making this week,” he says.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, that they all contributed to our national security, and I guess hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on it.
And I feel like most Americans that we are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, the product of countless American efforts.
So, of course, it's not out of place to show this.”
It is not clear to us whether Trump interacts with the helicopter during his tour of the South Lawn during the event, but he did take the driver's seat in the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump addressed a representative of Sikorsky and made fun of his own company aircraft with the media.
He said, "I know Sikorsky well. I have three."

United Nations states that democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political status of women
On Wednesday, the Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan stated that only all members of society, including women, were represented in the elections.
The Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, Nicholas Hayesom, stated that hundreds of women were participating in the provincial council elections, three women were participating in the vice-presidential elections and over 30 per cent of the newly registered voters were women.
In his statement on Wednesday, he stated that “the status of women cannot be reduced”.
Only when women are fully involved and included at all stages of the electoral process can there be truly representative and credible elections.
The provincial council and presidential elections in Afghanistan were held on 5 April.
Intimidation by the Taliban of an electoral process is consistent with the transition from international military operations to advisory status.
This year's elections are the first peaceful transition from a democratically elected Government to the next democratically elected Government.
Hayesom says that the important status of women will promote democracy in Afghanistan.
The Independent Electoral Commission issued reports that 1.2 million out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters were women.

13 developers fighting for the price of the hard-red factory plot in the Tianhe River area or breaking $10,000/m2
As reported by Zhao Yanhua, a night reporter in Sheep City, this afternoon, no fewer than 13 developers will be fighting for the building blocks of the red factory, and today ' s concession of the red factory block of Yellow Plum Avenue in Tianhe District is for type II residential land (R2), with an area of 17,304 square metres (15,178 square metres for construction) and a building area of 45534 square metres.
Land parcels have small and medium-sized condominium requirements, and up to 90 square metres of housing cover no less than 60 per cent of the total area of housing development in the plots.
Based on the maximum size of the small and medium-sized households, the plot will provide at least 303 small and medium-sized dwellings.
It is known that the plot is located on the east side of Huang Pil, opposite the road is the Tianhe Building. The perimeter of the site has been perfected and is used for the first house in the Tianhe region, which was hanged this year.
In addition, today a second type of residential land (R2) will be made available in the white cloud area and on the northern road of the East Pitstone, with an area of 32891 square metres (30,965 square metres of land available for construction) and an area of 92895 square metres, with an initial listing price of $6.1311 million and a cost of $6,600/m2.
The plot is the first home to be launched in the white cloud area this year, with the same requirement of 30 per cent for a small and medium-sized package (up to 90 square metres).
The metro 3 extension line runs through its western side, and the plot is located on the road between the same station and the south hospital station in Kyung Creek.

This is a pleasure for the family of the senior aunt who lives in a dormitory of the Democratic Roads Mechanical Hall in Nanning City.
Neighbors also say that the trees bloom. The residents of the neighbourhood considered it a blessing to come and watch.
The tropics called “Malabash” are tropical plants of Mexican origin that are warm and humid and must be suitable for many conditions, such as sunlight, moisture and nutrients.
Even in the wild, where tropical conditions are appropriate, flowering is rare, and there has been the expression “only one in 1,000 flowering rates”.
Yesterday morning, journalists came to the Hall of Machinery for Democracy Roads in Nanning City and, under the guidance of Aunt Gao, they saw the tree.
The bouquets are planted in the gardens of the small areas, about five metres high, the thickest branches are about 30 centimetres long and the leaves are green.
Flowers bloom at the top of higher branches, with more than 10 centimetres wide, light-coloured twigs spread apart, green twigs split and curled up on the sides, luminous as silver, silk-headed golden stars.
Aunt Gao told reporters that the tree had been growing for eight years, when it was about 1 metre tall and now more than 5 metres long.
This is the view of her son who bought it from the florist market and then planted it in a garden, and she does not deal with it much, either, but in some cases it's a pedigree.

According to the Market Star, from 2005 to 2011, my provincial GDP rose from a parallel “floor” in the centre to a secondary seat.
However, my economy continued to suffer from low investment efficiency and a lack of core competitiveness in the industrial economy. To that end, the latest edition of the Economic Blue Page of the provincial economic information centre recommended improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
It is compared to the national and central regions based on some of the indicators of representation of our provincial economy in 2005 and 2011.
In terms of industrial economic efficiency, in 2011 a significant proportion of the energy-intensive industries in our province, such as industrial energy and raw materials, were affected by market fluctuations and “double pressures” on excess capacity, while insufficient innovation in the dominant industries, such as domestic electricity and automobiles, led to low profits.
The lack of commensurate economic benefits from large investments is an important reason for the poor quality and efficiency of our economic growth.
In this regard, experts recommended that effective measures be taken to encourage innovation in enterprises and that the scientific and technological results of universities and research institutes be “transferred” to enterprises in a timely manner.
In the case of industrial economics, experts said that there was also a need to actively promote industrial merger restructuring, optimization of industrial layout and extension of industrial chains.

GMB focused on investments in the McVitie Glasgow factory.
The union hopes that the management of the cookie manufacturer, McVitall, will ensure a long-term commitment to production at the Rasco plant.
The Scottish branch of the British General Trade Union stated that the company remained silent about the future of the investment in the Tollcros plant.
The factory has over 500 employees, producing, among other things, oatmeal biscuits (Hobnobs) and tea cookies (Rich tea).
According to Pradis, the owner of McVitat, the company has invested over £5 million in the factory over the past few years.
He added that in the event of a change in plant operation, employees and union representatives “will be the first to know”.
In a letter to the head of the company, the Scottish branch of the United Kingdom General Trade Union called on McVitall to “solve the problem of funds not being carried over to modernization of the production line”.
Drew Duffy, a senior host of the British General Trade Union, said, “We cannot get a clear picture of the future business needs and investment plans of Tollcros from the plant manager, which worries our members.
Generations of families working here and the high concentration of labour in the local community and the Grand Glasgow region are important pillars of decent employment in areas with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, from the point of view of employment, pay and economic prosperity, the eastern part of Glasgow is in dire need of an ever-expanding production network in the context of the British deutsche, rising cost of living and long-term decline in manufacturing.”
“The director of Tollcross just received a letter from the Scottish branch of the British General Trade Union yesterday, and the company will respond immediately because we value continuous contact with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we held regular meetings with employees and representatives of the British General Trade Union in Tollcros to discuss a number of issues publicly.
We had discussions with employees, and then, like all other companies operating in a competitive and economically uncertain environment, we examined the sustainable business models that we applied to enterprises and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcros plant, especially in production lines and operational improvements.

On 11 May, the Deputy Director of Sports of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Nimatin, China News Agency (journalist Chen Zhongbin), stated at the base camp of the North slopes of Mount Everest that future waste disposal of life on the northern slopes of Mount Everest would move from public-interest action in the past to normal behaviour led by the Chinese Government and involving international actors.
On 10 May, environmental volunteers loaded classified garbage into trucks.
Over the past decade, the issue of environmental protection at the peaks has increased with the dramatic increase in expeditions and tourists to Mount Everest.
In the spring of 1997, the TAR Association launched its first clean-up campaign on the northern slopes of Everest, cleaning up a collection of living waste such as oxygen bottles left over from the 1960s and 1970s. The video was also featured at the World Climate Conference in Tokyo that year and attracted world attention.
According to Nima Tsien, since 1997, public-interest teams have been cleaning up the northern slopes of Everest, but the participants are mostly non-professional.
San Germain of Paris warned Barcelona three years ago to sign off on Nemar?
Seagal may regret throwing olive branches at Marco Valetti.
After making an offer of Pound189 million to allow it to exercise its exemption clause, San Germain in Paris will not give up signing into Nemar, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of an attack on this world recorder?
This sensational approach has opened the summer session window, and the fascist club is ready to break the World March record twice as much as the last one. Paul Borgba returned to the United last season for up to £89 million.
Once the transition is completed, Nemar will leapfrog to the world's highest-value players and be the world's highest-paid professional athlete — St. Germain in Paris — providing post-tax pay of over £500,000 per week.
Barcelona was outraged by the way Nemar attacked and the way out, and sources who knew the Catalonia team board insisted that the club had been doing its best to look after him since he arrived from Santos in 2013.
But did President Saint Germain of Paris make such a prediction about football three years ago?
When Mantown expressed interest in signing Blaise Matedi in 2014, Nasser Alhelifi issued a harsh warning to any club that wanted to sign St. Germain's best players in Paris.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they contact any of our players, we'll fight them, and we'll contact their players," Alhelifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they're trying to sign our players, they're gonna have to pay for it."
Earlier this summer, the Spanish club appeared to have crossed the line, and Barcelona threw an olive branch at Paris-based mid-time player Marco Valetti.
San Germain in Paris made it clear that they would in no way allow the Italian foothold to leave, and Barcelona is likely to be severely affected by the loss of Nemar, a middle-middle genius.
