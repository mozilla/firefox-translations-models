The Chinese Times Review: Building up a good rural farmer's workforce to give rural life a boost to the economy.
Rural revitalization, talent is key.
Where do you find talent?
The good returning peasant and working class are an indispensable force for life.
The Chinese company is developing a business model.
July 26 电话题: To build a good rural life force by bringing back good farmers to the country.
Zhang Zhongzhi, 34, who lives in the fruit garden village of Sichuan Mue, quit his job in Beijing in 2010 and returned to his home country to start a business that earns tens of thousands of dollars a month.
After years of struggle, he now runs the family farm where he grows grapes with an annual income of over a million yuan, becomes a wealthy leader with a small reputation, and is elected to the village board of directors.
In recent years, under the incentive of a series of agricultural policy initiatives such as national poverty alleviation, rural revitalization, and more, more and more skilled farmers like Zhang Yi chose to return to their hometown, activating rural spring water.
The Western Province of Sichuan, which is the most populous province in China, has implemented the Good Farmers' Retirement Development Project, and in 2019 alone, the result of the retiring of good farmers' workers has been more than 8,000 village party secretaries, 61,000 village reserve forces, more than 20,000 development party members, and a strong guarantee of victory in the fight against poverty and implementation of rural revitalization strategies.
Little life is not well, the key is to look after the old town.
Since the reform and opening up, rural China has seen a significant increase in the labour force's output, some of whom have started their own businesses by struggling.
But it also objectively leads to different degrees of rural emptiness, especially the weakening of the rural grassroots organization, with the secretaries and party members of the village branch showing a very low profile, such as ageing, low education, weak leadership, and the lack of connectivity of the village party.
If elements such as rural talent have been flowing into the city, rural people have been in an anemia for a long time, then revitalization is a mere slur.
To attract back those able, conscious, and willing farmers who serve their homeland, to lead them back to their homeland to become wealthy entrepreneurs, to train their peers into party members, to train their village cadres, to build up a base of hard-line workers, is to solve the ruling problem of the village cadres and the grassroots party organization.
Good farmers should be able to recover their labor, but also to stay and work well.
In recent years, Sichuan has been building a farmer labor party, based on strict selection criteria, and has established mechanisms for recruiting, service-guaranteeing, training, selection, and other workers, enabling them to improve their skills, work, hope, live in rural areas, and start entrepreneurships with a sense of accomplishment.
This year is the year of the final fight against poverty, to make the connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, and talent is the key factor.
The party committee governments at all levels should attach great importance to this group of well-off returning farm workers, by means of a comprehensive measure, to build them into a working group that can stay, fight, carry, and a life force, providing strong organizational safeguards and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development.
Due to the pandemic, this year's graduates will be a very special one, with the July 11th evening, the bilbil summer graduation ceremony bringing a special live online performance to the graduates, with old wolf, Parkshek, Li Yu-chun, and other musicians singing and congratulating the graduates.
The famous up-and-coming singer Seal Wu凡 also brought a rap song, a rap song he composed based on the novel of the same name by Rusun, which is very popular among young people.
Due to the pandemic, many graduates have been unable to experience the ritual feeling of awarding a degree certificate on the spot, and have moved the ritual feeling to online.
According to data, the 2.5 hour concert, which was broadcast live, reached a peak of popularity of over 35 million.
 Follow your innermost self, seize the opportunity, ignore the consequences, sometimes with unexpected rewards.zh
Although it is a graduation party, many of the songs also touched the graduating class.
The whole scene is really about to cry, whose youth is full of beauty and regret, but all are worth remembering, and must go down boldly.

A Beijing Youth newspaper reporter from the City Park Greening Office learned that in recent years, as the natural ecological environment of the capital has continued to improve, the species and number of wildlife has also continued to increase.
Currently, the number of land-based vertebrate wildlife in Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including national level protectors such as the black-horse, black-horse, and national level protectors such as the black-horse, black-horse, and black-horse, and other national-level protectors such as the black-horse, black-horse, and black-horse.
Whether it's an urban forest somewhere in the loop, or a tiny wetland embedded between buildings, not only did the first urban population enjoy nature, but it also attracted wildlife to settle in cities.
The Summer Festival of the Golden Dawn is taking place in the Matsunsan National Nature Reserve in the Zhejiang Mountains, northwest of Yanqing District.
A dog is playing on the side of a mountain, and two dogs are fighting each other.
In the end, the director of the National Nature Reserve Management Board of Matsunsan, Huchō Shiki, explained that as of the end of 2019, in this green sea of over 6200 hectares, 178 species of wildlife, including the national level golden statue of the national animal and the national level secondary animal, live in the area, almost a third of the entire city's wildlife species can be seen here.
 In Matsun, wildlife are the real masters, and our staff is only able to count on the people's household.保
To understand the situation of wildlife in the reserve, more than 30 professional patrols are carried out daily, along 16 carefully designed conservation routes, and a one-hour tour is conducted each month, for almost a full day, around the entire reserve, Hucholi said.
 During the tour, not only should the record of biodiversity be checked, but also the installation of artificial bird nests, rescue of injured wildlife, installation of wild infrared cameras, etc.
The Matsushana National Nature Reserve has now installed over 200 infrared cameras, documenting the wildlife life in the forest.
As the biodiversity of the reserve has increased over the years, more and more wildlife have appeared on the scene, cats and pigs have become permanent guests, and the rate of exposure of national second-tier animal protection spiders has also increased.
Zhang Zhizhing, director of the Beijing Municipal Park Greening Office for Wildlife and Wetlands Conservation, said that the number of wildlife species in Beijing has steadily increased in recent years, from 461 species of land vertebrates in 1994 to more than 500 species today.
Wildlife appearances in cities are becoming increasingly common, and are closely linked to the steady upgrading of the greening of the capital city in recent years.
In particular, the new round of green building of millions of hectares, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban ecology, improve the ecological functioning of the forest green, and highlight the idea of closer to nature.
Planning for the interconnected interaction with surrounding greenery, easy wildlife visits, family friendships, and tree species are also animal-favorite honeybees, food plants.

China New NetJuly 26, 2019 According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the religious historical building of the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul in Nantes, France, was badly damaged in a fire, the organ was completely destroyed.
On 26 January, local time, the Nantzheng prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer who was responsible for the defence of the cathedral had been indicted on charges of arson and destruction.
He has admitted that he set himself on fire in the church.
According to local prosecutor Senas, the 39-year-old Rwandan parish volunteer confessed to setting fire to three cathedrals at night.
The man's lawyer said the arsonist now regrets having done so.
This man, who several years ago entered France through the path of refuge, was granted asylum in the parish where the fire occurred, and was confined in a church.
Prosecutors noted that he had recently tried to renew his visa, and was in discussions with the police department about the matter.
But the church said it still did not believe that this usually very kind, smiling, but not speaking believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire, which occurred on July 18, the volunteer had already been questioned by the police for unreasonable questions in the narrative, but was later released.
Firefighters were called to the scene to help.
On the evening of 25 June, as a professional engineer in the laboratory of the Paris Central Police Station obtained new evidence, this man was again interrogated.

Brunet, the chief architect of France's historic preservation, believes that, according to conservative estimates, the restoration of the cathedral will take at least three years.
 General news: US unilateralism is destroying bilateral relations  International opinion supports China's anti-US policy-China Net
In the morning of July 24, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the license to establish and operate the US Consulate General in Guangzhou, and to make specific demands on the consulate to cease all business and activities.
International opinion holds that unilateral measures taken by the United States seriously affect relations between China and the United States, that China is responding to unreasonable provocations by the United States, and that countermeasures are justified and necessary.
Andrés Borques, director of the China Research Center at the Institute of International Affairs at the University of Chile, said that unilateral US measures have broken the bridge of understanding between the peoples of the two countries, causing the two great powers to face a crisis.
China's notification to the United States that it will close its consulate in the capital is a countermeasure to unilateral US measures, in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Justo, professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Center for Chinese Studies, believes that China's decision to do so is a legitimate, necessary countermeasure against the United States' previous provocations, not against the general American public.
The United States has tried to divert the attention of the American public by pressuring China to achieve its goal of masking its impotence in responding to the new coronavirus outbreak.
Banjbong Surono, chairman of the Indonesian think tank's Center for Research on Innovation in Asia, said the United States has taken a provocative diplomatic posture, seriously straining relations between China and the United States, and that bilateral relations face serious challenges.
China's notification to the United States that it will close its consulate in Guangdong is a normal countermeasure, in line with diplomatic practice, reflecting both China's firmly defending its own interests and the legitimate and advantageous stance of Chinese diplomacy.
Francis Semwinza, a Tanzanian Times commentator, said that China's decision was a legitimate and necessary response to US provocation.
Relations between China and the United States should return to normal, the United States should take action to improve relations with China, stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve economic and political win-win with China, how to benefit the peoples of both countries and the entire international community.
Ali Yusuf, executive director of the Sudan-based Arab-China Friendship Association, said the countermeasures China is forced to take are a legitimate and necessary response to U.S. recklessness, in line with international law and basic international relations norms, and in line with diplomatic practice.
Earlier, the US demanded that the Chinese consulate in Houston be closed in a serious violation of international law and basic rules of international relations.
Hopefully, the US will withdraw its previous decision, creating the necessary conditions for the normalization of relations between the two countries.
The Singaporean Daily News said in a press release that the larger strategic intent of the United States is to encircle China, preventing China from continuing to rise.
Faced with the steady pace of the United States, while China is reluctant to see China-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has had to take countermeasures.

The Polish rule of law and the Justice Party and its governing coalition partners have close alliances with the Roman Catholic Church, advocating a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda has made the right to gays and lesbians to be a major issue during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles (most of them women) held protests in Warsaw and other cities against the withdrawal from the Convention.
One of the organizers of the protests, Rempart, said during the protest march in Warsaw that the purpose of the withdrawal from the treaty was to legalize domestic violence.
Some protesters held up banners that read Law & Justice is a hell for women.
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
The previous Polish government, which was ruled by a middle-party, ratified the convention in 2015.
Law and Justice said the treaty disrespected religion and required social policies for liberal teachers in schools.
But so far the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

The FAA has issued a warrant for 2,000 Boeing passenger aircraft.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency flight order on the 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737 Classic aircraft registered in the United States, as the air suspension of the above-mentioned aircraft could cause engine air to stop after corrosion.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the report of four 737NG and 737Classic aircraft engine airstops received so far, and therefore required an emergency inspection, the inspection is carried out on aircraft that have been in continuous suspension for seven days or more and that have returned to flight less than 11 times since the start of the flight.
The Federal Aviation Administration warns that if the aircraft's five-speed manual transmission of both engines is damaged, it may die in its open position, causing the aircraft to lose power completely and not be able to restart the engine.
The air traffic controller ordered that once the stop-gap was found to be corrosive, airlines must replace this critical component before putting the passenger aircraft back into service.
Boeing responded later that day, with the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak leading to reduced travel demand, many passenger planes being sealed or used less frequently, and more susceptible to corrosion.
Boeing has also suggested that airlines check the aircraft involved in the inspection order, and if problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in repairs and replacement of the aircraft.
The airline's passenger planes typically fly multiple times a day, but after the outbreak of the coronavirus, large numbers of passengers were suspended; as demand for travel for passengers has been slowly increasing, some aircraft have re-entered service.
The Federal Aviation Administration has not released any detailed reports on four air parks.
Alaska Airlines later disclosed one of the incidents on July 24.
The airline said in a statement that its next flight was on its way to Austin, Texas, on July 15 from Seattle, Washington, when an engine caught fire and the plane finally successfully landed at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the engine of that passenger plane and had inspected the engines of six aircraft in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration directions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on 24 April that there were no engine fires associated with the air-stop-return aircraft.
Four American Airlines aircraft will be inspected, and 28 United Airlines aircraft will be inspected.
DAMA said it would inspect 20 of its aircraft, but did not say whether there were any engine fires.
According to multiple media reports, the Federal Aviation Administration's emergency flight order is yet another blow to Boeing.
The Indonesian Lions Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX aircraft crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
This series of aircraft was subsequently halted globally, production ceased in January this year, production resumed in May.
Federal Aviation Administration Director Steve Dixon admitted in June that the Federal Aviation Administration made mistakes in regulating Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft.

The constant addition of nutrients to the party history, the new Chinese history, and the new Chinese history.

Recently, during a visit to the Qu'Phin Memorial, Xi Jinping's Secretary-General stressed: "We need to make sure that 1.4 billion people, over 90 million members of the party, especially the leadership at all levels, learn the history of the Chinese Communist Party, the history of the new China".
Studying the history of the Party, the history of New China, is a key part of the Party's leadership, and remembers the essential lesson of its mission, to draw from it a rich, nurturing, and patriotic spirit, and to take the long way to the new era.
A rich history of the Party, New China, records the hard struggle and glorious course of the Chinese Communist Party since its birth, demonstrating the Communist Party's belief in life and bloodshed and its commitment to the cause and mission of loyalty, eternal adherence and perseverance.
History is the best textbook, for the party's leadership, party history, new China history is the most important chapter in this textbook.
Each member of the Party's staff must continually strengthen itself with historical insight, moving forward with historical thinking, setting new paths, new missions, embracing the connecting rods of the age, and walking the long path of the contemporary.
With the spirit of the times, we will stick to our primary mission in learning Party history, New China history.
The history of the party, the history of New China, is filled with the Chinese Communist Party's eternal unchanging mission and firm conviction that the party is always with the people.
Close up to understand the history of the Party, important events, important meetings, important figures in the history of New China, not only intuitive heart-shaking, baptism of ideas, but also deep soul reading of the meaning of the original belief, understanding the proportion of missionary responsibilities.
For the party's leadership, who want to continue to advance in the mission, must find our starting point, our starting point in the history of the party, the history of New China, maintain a clear conscience and a firm stance, strive to fight for the country, ensure that the revolutionary leaders are passed on to the Red Jiang Dynasty, who have fought with blood and life.
Learn history wisely, and inherit a noble spirit in the study of party history, the history of New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has shaped a series of great spirits, including the red boat spirit, the Iyang-san spirit, the long-distance spirit, the Yan'an spirit, the anti-war spirit, the Zhejiang spirit, the Zhejiang spirit, the space spirit, and so on.
These great spirit of history, which has provided a powerful spiritual incentive for our party to overcome all the risky challenges along the way, are precious spiritual treasures that cannot be smashed, dispersed, or stolen.
The process of learning Party history, the history of China, is the process of re-evaluating and shaping these spiritual and self-sentiments, of consciously mirroring the lofty spirit of the revolutionary pioneers, of sticking to the spiritual home of the good Communists, of building a strong spiritual foundation for the advancement of great things, of realizing great dreams, and of inheriting and advancing these spirits, and of shining a new light on the age.
Read history in self-examination, and continue to live in the history of the Party, the history of the New China.
For the party's cadres, no history has ever been able to bring a deeper warning, revelation and lesson than the history of the party, the history of the new China.
In the history of the Party, in the history of New China, we can see both the great feats of the old revolutionary movement, the devotion to faith, the unwavering struggle for the achievement of the established goals, and the great feats of certain individuals, who are shaken by the idealized beliefs, who are drawn to the profound lessons of revolutionary opposition, revelation and warning that we, with our firm resolve and will, never stall, never fail, always have a strong fighting spirit, constantly pursue party purity, and practice self-control.
To truly become a firm believer, a loyal practitioner of the far-reaching communist ideal, one needs to think about dust, dirt, party history, and the New China history, and it should be the duty of every party member to examine himself, to warn against self-reliance.
The history of knowledge is encouraging, the rebirth of the brave and challenging era in the study of party history, the history of the new China.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once noted: "Learning Party history, national history, is a must to uphold and develop the Chinese characteristic of socialism, to continue to advance the Party and state affairs forward".
Looking back on history, asking questions, for the sake of continuing glory, for the sake of moving forward.
Each party member should take the study of party history, the history of New China as a lifelong pursuit, constantly adjusting the course of life in learning, taking on the historical mission in their respective positions, daring to take responsibility, and actively taking initiative as a leader.
Persisting on the advanced work of the old revolutionary as a reference and guidance, constantly blurring the political essence of the Communist Party, maintaining a striving-to-be attitude and a striving spirit of struggle as the struggle progresses more and more, writing is a wonderful piece of his own in the turbulent journey of the great Chinese nation's resurgence.

The dream of the river show zhpo
The Yellow River, which flows 397 km through the middle of the year, is the mother river of the two families.
But with the rapid advancement of industrialization, urbanization, imbalance in the development and management of lakes, over-pollution, lake-building, water intrusion, and other disorders, water pollution, water scents, water quality, pollution, and ecological degradation have led to water scents.
Now, Ningxia is pushing for a diverse water ecological restoration, working to restore the Huang River watershed.
Water treatment should be done from the source.
In Ningxia, the local method of 提标+治污+严管 was adopted, all industrial park wastewater was centralised treatment, all town wastewater treatment plants achieved Tier A standard emissions, the urban development zone was basically eliminated, successfully declared third China black-smelling water demonstration cities.
In addition, in 2017, Ningxia implemented the full length system of river lakes, now it has achieved full coverage of the five-tier system of river lakes responsibility in the countryside of Zhongshan County, and the river lakes are becoming a normal route.
64-year-old Guqing-gu, who lives in a village on the Yellow River, witnessed the Yellow River's change: the water smelled like a previous one, and after being healed, it no longer smells like a new one.
According to Gujin, the ecological environment is better, his life is more comfortable, and now he often goes for a walk with his family along the Yellow River, feeling the blue sky.
The dream of the humidity of the 沙翔集
The beautiful scenery of birds, green trees, canals, water...... and the beautiful landscape of the Shanxian Islands in the Yellow River Wetlands Park on the Ningxia River is now a reality.
The Yellow River flows through the Nijmegen, forming a number of wetlands along its course, including river wetlands, lake wetlands, swamp wetlands, and other wetlands, and plays an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and the balance of water ecology, while also becoming an internationally important migratory route for birds.
Since 2009, the relevant departments of Ningxia have accumulated about 345 million yuan of project funding for wetland protection projects, currently, the wetland area of the Ganges River is 1.920,000 hectares, the wetland protection rate is 78.5%, with natural lakes, almost 200 wetlands, five national wetland parks, one national urban wetland park, six municipal level wetland parks, eight municipal parks.
The deputy director of the Centre for Wetland Conservation in the city of Tsinghua, Zhengqing, told reporters that wetland conservation has increased biodiversity, is particularly evident in birds, and is an endangered species, with only 20,000 species worldwide, of which the Tsinghua wetlands are home to more than 2,000.
At the same time, the Ninhashia Law has defined a 500-meter red line for the protection of wetlands on both banks of the Yellow River and the Ganges, stipulating that no entity or individual, except for public-benefit projects, may carry out development, construction and business activities within the protected area.

The dream of drinking water is a universal one.
The city of Ningxia, Yangtze, once had an awkward title: the only city along the Yellow River to maintain a water-scarce drinking water supply.
Since 2010, the city of Banki Kawasaki has been facing the problem of water shortages during the peak of the summer season, and the last decade of water shortages has become a summer ordeal for many upper-level residents, but in the current state of the large underground water-extraction pipeline in the city, where the water supply is at a disadvantage, the city of Banki Kawasaki has become a problematic problem.
Thanks to improved water quality in the Yellow River, drinking water from the Yellow River after purification has become a good solution to the drinking water problem of local residents.
Dingming, deputy director of the Bank's municipal water authority, explained that in order to improve the demand for water for the production of water for the residents of the bank's city and village, Ningxia was in a good time to start the water supply project for the western line of the bank's city circle, replacing the original groundwater source with high-quality Yellow River water.
On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially extended to the three-district water supply of the city of Zhengzhou, in 2020, residents of the town of 宁,兰 county also drank the water of the Yellow River.
Dingming said that the Bank's water sector will take into account the transformation of regional rural water and urban water integration, the next step, we will integrate rural decentralized water supply points into the entire West Line water project, which is expected to achieve urban and rural water integration in the Bank's region by the end of this year.

For the first time, the United States has conducted an anti-subsidy investigation against China, underestimating the exchange rate of the yuan.
The US Department of Commerce recently announced that it has decided to launch an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese-made zapatz products and to launch an investigation into the undervaluation of the yuan exchange rate.
China's Commerce Ministry noted that this was the first time the US had investigated the case in an anti-subsidy case, a so-called RWF undervaluation project, which China strongly opposes.
A press release issued by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce on 23rd evening specifically said that China is implementing market supply-based regulation based on a basket of currencies, a managed system of floating exchange rates, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of exchange rates.
The press release stresses that, overall, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable equilibrium level and is not underestimated.
Since 2005, the yuan has accumulated a more than 17% appreciation against the US dollar.
According to data released by the International Bank for Reconciliation and Development, from early 2005 to May 2020, the renminbi rose 38 percent in effective exchange rates, and the effective exchange rate rose 49 percent, making it the strongest currency in the G20 economy, and one of the largest globally.
The Ministry of Commerce noted that the exchange rate issue went beyond the powers of its members to conduct anti-subsidy investigations in accordance with the World Trade Organization rules.

Tensions in China-US relations further increased the impact, and the overseas yuan against the dollar was once again stronger, the binary fell to $1 - 7.0 yuan.
Whether this move by the U.S. Department of Commerce is intended to push the yuan upward is worthy of consideration.

The official regulated currency, the middle price of the USD to the exchange rate, dropped 17 basis points on the 24th, newsletter 6.9938

Family Lewis: John Lewis was a warrior who fought for the weakest of the strong.
U.S. Congressman, civil rights activist John Lewis, was commemorated as a fighter who fought for the most powerful and vulnerable in the war at a memorial service held for him on Saturday.
Lewis's public memorial service was held in Alabama from Saturday.
On the first day there were two memorial services.
At a public memorial service Saturday at Troy University in Alabama, Lewis's five siblings and a niece-in-law spoke of him as a man full of love, fearless, and family-minded.
Lewis' younger brother Henry Grant Lewis, said at the meeting: "He devoted his life to helping others.
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John against bothering him.
He added that John had not heeded his mother's warning, saying: "We all know that John always caused trouble, always caused trouble, but that was because he stuck to the right thing, that was a good trouble".
Lewis's siblings reminded the people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to create a good mess, that is, to make a point of not being out of the loop for the sake of justice.
John had applied to Troy University in his hometown of Troy, Alabama, but at the time, the all-white school, Troy University, declined his application.
This young man, who was a preacher of the gospel to John Lewis on his family farm, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, Lewis was awarded an honorary doctorate by Troy University.
Doug Jones, a congressional senator from Alabama, said the current protesters were protesting peacefully, nonviolently, as Lewis did during the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump knocks down a boatman for a whole day, calling all the protesting crowds a mob, he's wrong.
The protesting masses are patriotic, and they want the United States to move toward a more equal country.
A six-day series of events in memory of Lewis will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis's coffin was unveiled Saturday at a public memorial service at Troy University, where people came to pay tribute to the civil rights pioneer.
Later Saturday evening, a private ceremony was held in a small church in Selmazh, Alabama, to pay tribute to him, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis's remains will be flown across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the protesting mob demanding black suffrage were beaten up by Alabama police outside the bridge, and the police also sprayed tear gas on protesters.
Lewis was almost killed at the time.
This day is later known as zh blood Sunday.
Lewis's remains will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to queue up on the sidewalk, and to complete this final leg with Lewis.
At the same time, officials have asked the public to wear a mask and maintain social distancing when participating in events.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered the flag to be lowered halfway in Lewis's honor on Saturday and Sunday.
During a nearly week-long memorial service, Lewis' remains will be temporarily placed in the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., respectively, for the public to mourn.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people can attend the US House of Representatives on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, a public event in tribute to Louis will be held outside.

The Kozori Tibetan Sheep enter the return season.
Journalist Wang Kim reported from the Five-Way Beam Protection Station of the Kokosiri District of the Yangtze National Park Administration in the Yangtze National Park, where monitoring shows that Tibetan sheep who had previously migrated to the Kokosiri region of Lake Tsunami are continuing to end their livestock and begin taking their young back to their original habitat.
A surveillance image near the Five Ways Liang Protection Station shows that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan sheep led by three Tibetan lambs and young sheep were continuously passing through the 3002 km long Qing Tibet Highway, the Qing Tibet Railway's Five Ways Liang North Bridge, and the Tibetan sheep had begun to move back.
 Experts analyze, in recent years, the number of Tibetan lambs among the repatriated herds accounts for a quarter to a fifth of the total number of Tibetan herds.
Dr. Liang Xinzhming, associate researcher at the Northwest Highland Biological Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "In the early stages of migration, Tibetan sheep are at a higher risk of being preyed upon, so the number of young in the herd will be lower, and even the possibility of no young occurring".
According to the statistics of the Kokosiri Management Department of the Yangtze Park of the Three Jiangsu National Park Administration, the total number of Tibetan sheep relocations is increasing year by year, and in 2019 the number of Tibetan sheep relocations was 4,860, an increase of only 338 compared to 2018.
连新明 said:zh is expected this year the Tibetan Sheep Refugee Movement will end in early September, and the number of Tibetan Sheep Refugee Movements is still expected to continue to increase.
The Tibetan Sheep are listed as a national level animal of conservation.
Every year, at the end of May, Tibetan sheep from the Qinghai Three Rivers, Tibet, and the Alkin Mountains of Xinjiang travel to the Chounying Lake in Kokosiri.
Dr. Liu Mi, a researcher at the Western Tibetan Animal Institute, said: "Return is a process by which female Tibetan sheep return to their native habitat after giving birth to their young. Initially, the groups of Tibetan sheep who leave their native habitat are larger, but then they will return to their respective native habitat along different paths according to different geographic populations".
To ensure the safe return of Tibetan herds, the reporter learned that the Yangtze Yangtze National Park Administration has deployed personnel in the main repatriation areas, continuing video surveillance and patrolling the jurisdictions.
If a Tibetan herd is found trying to cross the road, the patrolman will initially conduct temporary traffic controls, making the herd safe through the wildlife passageway, and ensuring that it is as little human interference as possible on its return journey.

澳大利亚大学 is developing a new drug that is expected to be used to treat the blood clot caused by the coronavirus.
Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a novel drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that it will be used to treat the blood clot caused by coronavirus.
Researchers have found that before a heart attack or stroke, an enzyme in platelets accelerates the clotting of platelets.
They therefore developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet clotting, thus preventing blood vessel blockage, and have a preventive effect on heart disease and stroke.
Researchers say that this drug only suppresses the clotting effect of platelets when symptoms of heart disease or stroke appear.
Since studies have shown that similar blood clots are one of the leading causes of death in patients with chronic coronary artery disease, researchers hope that this drug can be used in the future to treat patients with chronic coronary artery disease.
Currently, the drug has been shown to be effective in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next phase of human clinical trials.

More than 6000 panoramic sunscreens, each 48 square meters, arranged in a circle, like a silver one, rotate with the sun, reflect sunlight to the center of the more than 200 meters high heat-absorbing tower, generate electricity.
Reporter25 saw this scene at the Chinese electrical engineering Hamim Salt Tower Light Thermal Power Plant in the town of zh毛湖 in Uyghur County, Xinjiang.
 The so-called  salt tower photoheat generation is the process of concentrating sunlight through the mirror to form thermal energy, and then converting thermal energy into electricity using traditional power generation techniques.
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of NKO Solar Hamim Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd., said its design principles were similar to those used in rural areas in northwest China, using sunlight to collect sunlight.
The power plant was commissioned in October 2017, completed at the end of last year, combined with a grid area of 6600 square meters, and plans to install 14,500 solar panels.
 Its biggest advantage over traditional solar power generation technology is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and also generate electricity at night
Zhang Yong said the 13-hour heat storage system deployed by the project allows the generator to maintain a continuous stable operation, without being affected by lighting changes; and can also participate quickly in grid upgrades according to the demands of the grid load peak valley.
Once fully constructed, the project will achieve an annual power output of 1.9 billion degrees Celsius, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce emissions of more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, 60 tons of oxide, about 20 tons of smoke, and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, providing a continuous source of clean energy to the local population.
In addition, there is another silverware in the solar PV industry park in the city of Hamizh.
The Hamimfer-Light solar PV plant covers an area of more than 2,300 m2, and 714 generating units have been built, which also follow the sun's motion, always keeping the sun and the polyp plane at 90 degrees rectangle.
 We use dual-axis tracking technology for the generation of polymer power, through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment can adjust the height angle according to the sun, maintaining power efficiency
The station's headman, Zheng Dre, said that under good lighting weather conditions, the power generation technology could improve the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic power generation by about 20 percent.
In the first half of this year, the power plant generated more than seven million degrees of electricity, supplementing local electricity demand.
The Photovoltaic Industrial Park of 石城子 is currently the largest single-unit, most complete photovoltaic industrial demonstration park in Xinjiang, with a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects, with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kW.
The first half of this year saw the completion of over 110 billion degrees of electricity generation, a 6% increase over the same period in 2019.
Khami is one of the best regions in China for solar energy.
The average total annual solar radiation is 6200 megajoules per square meter, with a total of around 3,200 hours of sunlight per year.
In recent years, the city has been heavily developing the photovoltaic industry, which is well-suited to the growing demand for solar power.
The total installed solar power capacity of 2.5 million kilowatts has been built, and the market's photovoltaic power generation capacity exceeded 1.4 billion degrees in the first half of this year, representing an increase of about 14% in the same period.
Currently, there are more than 330 combined-cycle photovoltaic power plants in Xinjiang, with installed capacity exceeding 10 million kilowatts.
The year-round photovoltaic generation is expected to reach 15 billion degrees Celsius, replacing more than 6 million standard coal.

The media has uncovered the truth about the unprovoked demand by the United States that China shut down the consulate in Houston.

The media has exposed the truth about the unprovoked demand by the United States that China shut down the consulate in Houston.
On 24th, the Chinese Foreign Ministry notified the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the license to establish and operate the US Consulate General in Guangdong, and to make specific demands on the consulate to cease all business and activities, as a countermeasure to the US's sudden demand on 21st of January that China shut down the consulate in Houston.
The US government's actions have sparked widespread concern, with its political motives being questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why did China demand the closure of the consulate general?
According to several foreign media outlets, it is not clear why the United States would elect the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, foreign media outlets have said frankly: For general elections.
US demands that China close the consulate in Houston raise questions about its political motives.
The US government's catastrophic response to the coronavirus outbreak has caused President Trump's pre-election polls to be somewhat underwhelming.
White House officials privately said the tough strategy against China was to save Trump's support, while shifting responsibility for the White House's failure to respond to the epidemic.
The article argues that the Chinese consulate in Houston is a politically motivated, very cautious target chosen by the United States, and that the U.S. government chose it to create a hard-line stance while avoiding the risk of major conflicts.
The BBC also believes that, in the run-up to the US election season, when the US economy is hit hard by the pandemic, Trump believes China has a political advantage.
The current situation is a spiraling upward struggle, driven in part by the US government's domestic considerations, which will only worsen the tensions between China and the US.
According to CBS, Trump's re-election prospects were under pressure from the outbreak, which he repeatedly blamed on China.
The United States has almost every day a new campaign against Trump's so-called "China exploiting America" absurdity.
The Houston Consulate General is very important in establishing the ties between the two countries.
The United States' demand that China close its consulate in Houston has exacerbated tensions between the world's two largest economies.
If the Chinese consulate in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic implications, Chinese citizens in the southern United States will face difficulties in obtaining consular services, and U.S. citizens seeking visas and other services will also face similar difficulties.
A Houston-based business group regretted the U.S. request that China close the consulate in Houston, saying the consulate played a key role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
According to the Associated Press, this reflects the importance of China's economy.
According to the website of the Foreign Policy magazine, the move by the United States is part of a series of provocative moves that will only worsen relations with the United States and China.
Jonathan Borac, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, said that since the establishment of comprehensive diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1979, he could not think of any move that could be compared to the US action against the Chinese consulate in Houston.
According to the Hong Kong Daily News, this move by the United States is unprecedented in over 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe that this move could cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979, the first Chinese consulate in the United States to be opened.
Currently, China has one embassy in the United States and five consulates.

The majority of the Urumqi Free Nucleic Acid Testing Areas have basically completed their secondary testing in high-risk areas.
July 26th, 2020 (journalist Sun Tintingwin Zhyamimin) Zhang Wede, head of the Urumqi City Health Commission, told the news agency about the latest outbreak and nucleic acid detection in Urumqi that at present, most areas of the city of Urumqi have been virtually completed.
The State Council Panel and the Autonomous Region, Urumqi City experts are further assessing the development of the outbreak based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region Press Office held a press conference on 26th to report on the outbreak and prevention situation in Xinjiang.
According to him, from July 25th, 0h to 24h, there were 22 new cases of coronavirus infection in the city of Urumqizh, including 5 cases of symptomless re-diagnosis, and 38 new cases of symptomless infection.
As of July 25, 24th, there are 135 confirmed cases in the city of Urumqizh, 147 cases of symptomatic infections.
The newly added symptom-free cases on the 25th were also largely detected through free nucleic acid testing throughout the city.
Zhang Wedezh, head of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said that most of the free nucleic acid testing work in Urumqi has been completed.
He also said that from experience elsewhere in the country, many factors influence the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the test, the time of infection and detoxification of the test subjects, the level of cooperation of the test subjects when sampling is done, the level of cooperation of the test subjects when sampling is done, and the testing environment, the level of operational skill of the test subjects, etc.
For various reasons, nucleic acid testing can also produce false negative results.
The so-called false-negative, meaning that the test subject is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test results are negative.
In addition, for people who have been in close contact with confirmed cases, or suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to rule out the possibility.
 For people who have been to high-risk areas during the outbreak, if fever and respiratory symptoms occur, a single nucleic acid test negative may be possible, so it is also necessary to have two nucleic acid tests to rule out 
He said that given the above, in order to ensure the health of the entire city's ethnic groups, starting today, the city of Urumqi will conduct a second free nucleic acid test on the main areas of the Tianhan region, Shaibak region, and other areas, while also carrying out the check-in removal process.
It is reported that the Tianjin region, Shaibak region is a high-risk area for the outbreak.

In particular, this year's outbreak, the country's tourism industry, and the Red Tourist attractions are facing serious challenges.
For example, using technology such as drone photography, VR immersion experiences, can meet the tourist needs of visitors who have not yet visited the area; introduce network broadcasting, promote the reputation of the Red Area, directly enhance the economic benefits of the Red Area; introduce technology, create thematic highlights, oriented bright, rich content, fully display and enhance the mission function of the Red Area; innovate ways of spreading Red Culture, make revolutionary artifacts alive, make red tourism popular, transmit the red gene, enhance the attractiveness of the Red Area attractions.
The popularity of the event during its run, including the promotion of Red Voyage features, the use of 5G technology to provide real-time views and smart city presentations, and other services to promote the Red Voyage attractions, are all attempts to instill smart wings into Red Voyage, looking forward to the increasing red fire of Hunan Red Voyage.
The representative of the U.S. and China Trade Negotiators met in August.
The Hong Kong Daily News quoted an anonymous source as saying that the head of the China trade negotiating team, the deputy prime minister of the State Council, and the co-leader of the US trade team, trade representative Rai Heijze, would hold a formal meeting in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the trade agreement between the two countries.
Although China has significantly increased its purchases of U.S. agricultural products in the past few months, due to factors such as the coronavirus outbreak, China's purchasing volume is still a distance from the amount promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say that the recent closure of each other's consulates in the United States, along with other disputes, could undermine any progress on trade between the two countries.
The first phase of the trade agreement entered into force on January 15, a month after the signing of the trade agreement, and stipulates that a high-level trade framework group of both sides should meet once every six months.
According to sources familiar with the matter, this meeting will be a major turning point, allowing both sides to assess progress on the agreement.
But the person also said that if tensions between the US and China lead to a lack of willingness to talk at this time, both sides may agree, in a telephone meeting between Raiheijze and the May 8 trade agreement, that is, the provision of a semi-annual meeting has been met.
Since this year, China-US relations have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes between the two sides including a range of issues such as the origin of the coronavirus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea, and ideology.
While US President Trump boasted earlier this year of his achievements in the first phase of the agreement, his attitude has recently changed.
He told a White House press conference that while China recently bought a record-breaking amount of U.S. corn in a single day, it also bought a lot of soybeans, but the trade deal is now meaningful to me, less than it was originally meant to be.
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that due to poor relations between the U.S. and China, a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place, and that trade issues have lost their relevance in the U.S.-China relationship.
But he revealed that Chinese economic and trade-related units were still meeting on 23rd to discuss a range of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, which we have already tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult.
Zhengming, vice chairman of the U.S.-China National Trade Commission, said it was more important than ever to keep the first phase of the agreement in place, and noted that China has made progress this year in opening up further to U.S.-based businesses in financial markets.
An analyst at independent research firm Plenum says: "Talk is better than talk, although it may only be used as a routine public affair".
The Ministry of Emergency Management, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Emergency Management, and the National Food and Resource Reserve once again urgently transported 1,350,000 textile bags, 1.2 million square meters of weaving cloth, 130,000 square meters of earthenware, and six other types of central reserve materials to the security of the country, supporting the flood relief efforts.
According to relevant officials from the Emergency Management Department, the current downstream trend in the Yangtze River basin has been high, the 2020 Yangtze River flood of No. 3 in the Yangtze River basin has been formed, and the risk of local disasters has increased.
The weather department predicts heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River for the next three days, and the weather situation remains extremely complex.

Nasdaq China District Chief Representative Zhengsheng: Now is the best time for a Chinese company to go to the U.S. IPO - Economic Observation - professional financial news website
Economic Observation Network: Journalist Zhang Because of the coffee counterfeiting incident, the US market has implemented stricter regulation of over-the-counter stocks, coupled with long-term valuation pressures, the stock market pressure in the US, the net ease of trading, and other markets in the world, the stock market has recently reopened its market.
And recently, companies like Shell, Ideal Cars, and others have been increasingly enthusiastic about the U.S. market.
Amid the pandemic and the stock market crisis, is now the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the United States?
 In terms of recent IPO cases and the situation of companies that are next to go public in the US, the IPO was not affected by anything in essence, but the market is now very good, even now, this time period is the best time period for Chinese companies to go public in the last 10 years.
The chief representative of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange China Region, Zhengsheng, spoke at the 2020 summit of leaders of publicly traded companies organized by Snowball.
In April this year, the SEC and the American Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued a statement on the importance of audit quality and the role of auditing and other international information in regulatory access.
The statement said that while international cooperation and coordination has increased significantly in recent years, the U.S. regulatory authorities still have problems with access to information, the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; in line with the document, the PCAOB website details a list of listed companies and their audit bodies that encounter audit barriers, and a large number of publicly traded companies are listed.
In addition, in May of this year, the U.S. Senate passed the Foreign Companies Accountability Act, requiring additional disclosure of information to foreign companies listed on the U.S. stock exchange.
In the eyes of Shengsheng, the stock market crisis did not affect investors' appetite.
When this news first came out, it caused panic among everyone, everyone was wondering if the future would still be possible to go public in the United States, but later we found that these issues were not the case for investors, investors may have asked these questions during the recent IPO, or even become standardized, but this is not a significant factor in investors not taking a Chinese company for granted.
I recommend that everyone try to look at the current situation as normally as possible.
Of course, this surface may seem to be the worst case in the last two years, but as far as the investor's appetite is concerned, it has not been affected by any of it.
So from now until the end of this year or before the US election, the rush to the US IPO will continue.
On May 9, this year, Kimsan Yun officially went public on the Nasdaq in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to go to the U.S. after the outbreak.
The IPO of Kimsan Yun gave Chinese companies a very high confidence in their future IPO preparations.
zh盛 is a word for zh盛.
Snowball's 2020 mid-year general stock data report shows that in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese companies went to the U.S. IPO, up 17.6% from the same period last year; in terms of total initial public offering, the total of 20 companies raised 27.25 billion, up more than 52.4% from the same period last year; in terms of industry distribution, the number of healthcare IPOs in the first half of this year stood out, with a 100% increase over the same period last year.
According to Zhengsheng, Chinese companies that went to the U.S. for the first half of this year's IPO will be more likely to gain investor favor with higher-quality, rigid fundamentals and growth-friendly companies.
In the short, medium, and long term, Zhengsheng remains optimistic about the IPO of Chinese companies in the United States.
 In the short term, the momentum for the IPO is still ongoing; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more options, A, H, and H, and US stocks, and everyone will consider the US general election and the relationship between China and the US as a factor in the selection of markets and time; in the long run, everything will return to normal, market volatility will be cyclical, both political and economic, and eventually it will return to normal, stock market history will be a volatile precedent.
At the same time, Zhengsheng said, "There are a lot of uncertainties this year, but for quality companies, whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary, investors need to invest in good Chinese companies".

Beijing, 25 July 2017 People's Daily and 26 July commentator article: Focus on the task at hand  Create a new advantage for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the global economic situation remain extremely complex, and China's development challenges are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic steadiness, building self-confidence, concentrating on our own, are key to our handling of various risky challenges.
At a recent conference of entrepreneurs, Secretary General Xi Jinping stressed that in the current climate of rising protectionism, global economic downturn, global market shrinkage, we must concentrate our efforts on our own, fully exploit the domestic super-large market advantage, gradually form a new development paradigm with domestic large-scale, domestic international double-loop mutually facilitated, raise the modern level of industrial supply chain, drive technological innovation, accelerate key core technological advances, shape new development advantages in the future.

In the context of the deeply developing external environment of economic globalization, markets and resources both outside China have played an important role in China's rapid development.
Now, the world is undergoing profound changes, facing more uncertainty, economic globalization, and headwinds and upheavals.
To be more prepared to think and work for the long term to cope with external environmental changes, to promote the economic growth and stability of China, a crucial aspect is to use expansion and meeting domestic demand as a strategic basis for development, to fully exploit its own strengths, to increase the momentum of economic development in China through a prosperous domestic economy, through the domestic cycle, and to drive the global economic recovery.
We need to recognize deeply, build a complete system of domestic demand, and our relationship to long-term development and long-term governance.
The party's central committee reviewed the timing and clearly proposed a firm implementation of the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to cope with the pandemic shock, the need to maintain a long-term sustainable healthy development of the Chinese economy, and the need to meet the growing need for a better life for the people.
The advantage of the economy of a great nation is that it is internal circular.
China has the world's most complete, largest industrial system, strong production capacity, perfect support capabilities, over 100 million market participants and over 170 million highly educated or skilled professionals, and a super-large domestic demand market of 1.4 billion people, including over 400 million middle-income groups, which is in the new stage of industrialization, informatization, urbanization, agricultural modernization, and rapid development, with huge investment demand potential.
The socialist basic economic system, such as the socialist market economy, the socialist basic economic system, the multi-proprietary economy, the co-development of the economy, the distribution of labor, the co-existence of multiple distributions, the socialist market economy, can both stimulate the vitality of all types of market subjects, liberate and develop social productivity, and can promote efficiency and fair organic unification, and continually achieve common prosperity.
We must firmly grasp this strategic basis for expanding domestic demand, making production, distribution, distribution more reliant on domestic markets for good circulation, defining strategic directions for structural reforms on the supply side, promoting a dynamic balance between total supply and total demand at a higher level.
To accelerate the construction of a comprehensive internal demand system, to drive forward technological innovation and other innovation in all areas, to accelerate the development of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, smart manufacturing, life health, new materials, to form more new growth points, growth pools, and to gradually form a new development paradigm that is complemented by a domestic, international, and bilateral, domestic cycle.
Opening up brings progress, closing down inevitably lags behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that the door that China opens will not close, but will only open bigger and bigger.
By focusing on the domestic cycle, not on the closed-door operation, but on the exploitation of domestic demand potential, better connecting domestic and international markets, better utilizing international domestic markets and two resources, and achieving stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, expanding domestic demand and expanding openness are not contradictory, the more smooth the domestic cycle, the more favorable it is to build a new open model, the more favorable it is to form new competitive advantages for participation in international cooperation and competition.
While the protectionist ideology is rising internationally, we must stand on the right side of history, insist on deepening reforms, expanding openness, strengthening open cooperation in the field of technology, promoting the construction of an open world economy, and building a community of human destiny.
The Chinese people have experienced many hardships in their history, but they have never been oppressed, but they have become more and more frustrated, growing in hardship, rising out of hardship.
On the road ahead, with a strong leadership of the party's central party, centered on comrade Xi Jinping, significant advantages of the Chinese characteristic socialist system, strong mobilization and strong integrated power, a party-wide unity struggle of ethnic groups across the country, we will be able to overcome all the hardships, maintain the good momentum of development of our country's economic and social society, fully build a socialist welfare society, and successfully launch a comprehensive new road to socialist modern statehood!
The remaining interest rate decreased after 90%, but instead increased by a return on savings?
As the balance sheet gains declined, not only did the bank not escape the balance sheet after the 1990s, but instead began to retaliate with savings?
The report on the balance of payments after 2020 published by the Joint Research Centre of China's New Economic Research (JRC) shows that the first half of the year, after 1990, the amount of money spent on the per capita grew by almost four percent compared to 2019.
Interestingly, after the 1990s, people tended to start with a small penny, with 60% of the average amount of money earned per penny being less than 20 yuan.
Using the surplus to make money, it also became the habit of making money after the 1990s.
Data shows that out of 700 million users with a balance of assets, 134.4 million users are after the 1990s.
China has 174 million backlogs, that is, about three out of every four backlogs in the country are using the balance of their money.
Currently, the 7-day annual yield of funds such as the balance sheet and other financial instruments has fallen to about 1.5% from a level above 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of money creation after 1990.
And in the context of the improvement of the balance of wealth, many young people who are accustomed to using the balance of wealth also directly translate into 基民.
According to the data from the Payment Bank, as of July 13, the number of new people on the payment bank has more than doubled in the past month, and more and more young people are achieving advanced finance on the payment bank.
Some analysts believe that the flow of funds from the remaining assets into the stock market is also an important reason for the sharp drop in the June IMF share.
The report also shows that girls after 90 are more likely to make more money, with an average of two percent higher than boys; among users who hold funds on a payment gateway, 6% are men, women and men who are more likely to choose a more robust financial approach than men.
After depositing money, what are the plans for after 90?
Paypal data shows that after the 1990s, people who had the habit of aiming for money, had the most users who aimed for money, traveling.
Affected by the pandemic, many post-war travelers prepared for the post-pandemic journey; the cinema resumed operations, also providing a new avenue for the transition from money to consumption.

A video meeting of APEC trade ministers was held on July 25, with the meeting's commitment to reduce the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the regional economy, accelerating the regional economic recovery and achieving resilience, sustainability and inclusion.
The meeting was hosted by Malaysia, the host of this year's informal meeting of APEC leaders.
A joint statement issued after the meeting said, "APEC member trade ministers recognize, at this challenging time, the importance of a free, open, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent and predictable trade and investment environment to drive economic recovery".
The parties pledged to ensure that the emergency measures taken to address the outbreak are targeted, appropriate, transparent and temporary, that unnecessary barriers to trade are not created and that global supply chains are disrupted, while respecting the rules of the World Trade Organization.
The APEC trade ministers pledged in a statement to strengthen cooperation to promote the flow of necessary goods and services, to promote interconnectivity by strengthening supply chain resilience, to minimize disruption to the flow of medical goods, food and agricultural products, and to respond to the epidemic.

The press department of the Philippine presidential office has accumulated 13 positive tests.
(Combating pneumonia) The press department of the Philippine Presidential Office has accumulated 13 positive tests.
Manila, Philippines (July 26th) Press Office of the President of the Philippines (PCOO) issued a notice on July 25th, stating that the Minister of the Philippines, Martin Anandral, had received a negative test result for coronavirus pneumonia on July 24th.
As of this afternoon, PCOO had accumulated 13 positive staff members, three of whom had tested positive, one of whom died and two of whom were still receiving treatment.
Due to contact with an infected PCOO employee, Anandral and 49 PCOO employees were tested for novel coronavirus on 24 June.
A report released on 25 June showed that 10 of the staff tested positive.
Marvin Gatpayat, deputy minister of administration and legal affairs at PCOO, said the new administrative office building in the presidential palace was scheduled to be reopened on the same day as President Duterte's fifth State of the Union address on 27 December.
Today, Martin Andanar assured the public that PCOO continues to fulfill its duty to the Filipino people, ensuring timely delivery of important information to the public, while strengthening contact tracking and detection to prevent further spread of the novel coronavirus among PCOO personnel, he prayed for a speedy recovery of the personnel who tested positive.
The Philippine Health Ministry announced that on the same day, the country's newly confirmed 2019 cases, cumulatively 78412 cases, of which 50,763 are still in patients, almost 90% are mild, 9% symptomless, and less than 1% are serious and life-threatening.
France has increased its military spending in space.
French Defense Minister Florence Parry said on 24 May that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to the space defence budget, develop a space military force, and prevent other countries from taking unfriendly actions outside space.
Pali told the newspaper Provence that on the same day, the budget for spending on French military space projects between 2019 and 2025 will increase from the previously planned 3.6 billion euros ($4.2 billion) to 4.3 billion ($5 billion) ($4.3 billion).
According to the French parliament's 2018 approval of the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025, France is expected to update existing observation satellites and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic surveillance satellites, and improve the modernisation of space surveillance radar in the future.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that the French Air Force would establish a space military command and a joint aviation and space force within it.
Pally said that she would later announce the formation of the space force when she visited the Salone Military School in Provence.
According to Pally, the Space Force is part of the Air Force and is scheduled to reach 500 personnel by 2025.
She said: Previously, people thought that space served the common interest of science, and this idea never receded. Space is now the scene of nations' battles for global dominationzh
Pali reiterated Macron's earlier statement, saying that France had no intention of provoking an arms race.
We are not in an arms race, but I have a responsibility to fully recognize the threat we may face.
In 2017, a military satellite jointly used by France and Italy was monitored by the Palliative.
She said the stolen was a Russian satellite.
Russia denies this claim.
Parley said that France would soon have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and locking down those unfriendly moves behind the hands of the black man.
French media believe that France's efforts to establish a space force are motivated by the fact that US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense in February to draft a Space Force Act.

The longest high-speed railway tunnel in the Three Gorges basin passes through the new network.

Here is a picture of the construction site for the small Three Gorges Railway.
The company is a subsidiary of the Zhongshan Railway Corporation.
China New Network Chongqing July 26 (Reporter) The reporter received a report from China Railway Corporation Limited on July 26 that the entire length of the 18.9 km long Shan Shan Shan Shan Shan Shan Shan Shan Shan Shan Shan Shan Shan Shan Shan Shan Shan Shan Shan Railway line was completed on the same day.
As you know, the Little Three Gorges Railway is not only the longest high-speed railway in the Three Gorges basin, but also among the projects currently under construction in the country, the longest single-hole dual-line high-speed railway, with a design speed of 350 km/h.
The Hunan Railway, located within the city limits of Henan, Hubei, Chongqing, in the three provinces of Henan, Xuanzhou, and Xuanzhou, is an important part of China's network of high-speed railways along the River Pass and the Hoanzhou Pass.
The entire line of the 26th Junction of the Sukhoi Highway passes through.
The diagram shows the crossing of the field.
The Hunan Highway runs from Henan Province, Zhongshan City, southwest through the city of Pyongyang, Nanyang City, and Zhongshan City, Hubei Province, and is approximately 818 kilometres long, with a design speed of 350 kilometres per hour, and 184 kilometres in Chongqing.
Among them, the 州 to 阳zheng segment has already been inaugurated for pre-opening operations on December 1, 2019, while the Chongqing segment is stepping up construction work.
The 26th full-line mini-dungeon is a construction project for the control of the entire line of the Chongqing Metro Railroad, the project is located at the junction of Chongqing City, Congju County and Wu-san County, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers, maximum depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the canal began in February 2017, and the entire line was completed on July 26, 2020.
According to the Royal Army of the Interior, the design team responsible for the design of the China Central Railway II yard Engineering Group Limited, the location of the Little Three Gorges is very complex, geographically and geologically, with risks such as rock melt, mudslides, soft rock erosion, high-risk grade I tunnels, and the design and construction of tunnels is extremely difficult.
 During the project construction process, we used geological surveying, object detection and ultra-pre-drilling methods to make ultra-pre-geological predictions, and adopted special design schemes for the remaining 30 types of trenches. For example, the design involved building a bridge 24 meters long, crossing the trenches along a length of over 10 meters, and a large trench over 55 meters deep, avoiding the sinking of the trenches. Kingdom Army said
According to the Central Railway Agency, the construction of the canal, using a combined method of drainage and blockage, by building a horizontal horizontal channel, water supply, reinforced canal structure support and building a sewage treatment plant, both ensured a smooth progress in the project, avoided the destruction of the water in the scenic area of the Little Three Gorges, while successfully overcoming the adverse weather conditions such as soft rock deformations of up to 7 km, and the multiple mudslides of up to 157,000 cubic metres of water per day with maximum flow.
Once the entire line of the HWA is completed, it will become the new convenient high-speed passenger transportation hub for China's southwest region to the central, northern, northeastern regions, which is of great importance for improving the capacity and quality of the Northeast to Northeast railway connections in the Southwest region, improving the regional route network layout, speeding up the development and urbanization process along the route, promoting regional coordination and implementation of the Western Great Development Strategy.
 Experts say immigration data collected through the U.S. Census is unconstitutional for the purpose of allocating House seats.
Several civil rights organizations and several U.S. cities and counties have filed a lawsuit against the U.S. federal government, claiming that the Trump administration's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. Census is both untenable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the allocation of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sarah Brannon, executive attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, told the Voice of America that this was not possible.
She went on to say that Trump's demands to determine the citizenship of those who are being censored in the census are difficult to achieve, and not very reliable.
Another civil liberties organization, the Joint Task Force, filed a lawsuit Thursday, challenging the Trump administration order.
Several cities in New Jersey, Georgia, and Georgia have joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also filed suit Friday.
Garvey, chairman of the Arlington County Board of Supervisors, said, "The U.S. Constitution requires that we clean up our population every 10 years, and we must clean up every person living in Arlington County, so that this illegal practice of trying to scare off and squeeze in our immigrant community does not happen".
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall said the executive order was a victory for the state.
He said,When allocating congressional seats and electoral college seats to each state, it must be based on the number of residents living in each state, and the number of legal residents who live therezh.
Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing Ross, the Secretary of Commerce who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to submit census-based statistics on stateless people so that the administration can exclude these stateless people from the state census and determine whether each state increases or decreases or retains House seats.
Every 10 years, the United States has to redistribute House seats based on population changes.
Heavy rainfall in 33 counties in the state of Chongqing has been reported in the area.

In response to the storm, Chongqing City Flood Control and Drought Control issued a Level III Flood Warning Information on 26-13 and launched Level IV Emergency Response, requesting that the relevant counties and units strengthen patrols, mobilize emergency rescue troops and supplies in a timely manner, evacuate and relocate the populations of the threatened areas.
In a move that moves forward, promote the construction of industrial projects - viewpoint headlines - Hunan Daily Net - China Voice Online
The heat wave in the summer of Hunan.
The construction of a provincial industrial project has fueled the enthusiasm of the on-site observation conference, overcoming the three-day heat, and using industry as a force to be reckoned with, and driving the water to the three-hour event with the clear direction of project heroism.
The development of Hunan has always been based on construction projects, the construction industry.
Faced with an extremely unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of Comrade Xi Jinping's Party Central, the whole province has stuck to one chessboard, working hard to fight the epidemic, fighting two hard wars, and putting industrial projects into practice as a pioneer in the implementation of the six-stage strategy.
From a quarterly GDP decline of 1.9%, to a first half-year growth of 1.3%, the difficulty, the enormous effort, is obvious.
On this priceless scoreboard, the construction of industrial projects is the key to the accelerated economic recovery and stability of Hunan.
It is easy to do, irreversible.
Industrial project construction, to be put into the big picture, is both good at accumulating, stockpiling, and earning, and is good at learning, demanding, and changing.
In the complex and severe context of the current international situation, in addition to investing in thousands of hard-earned ventures, it is necessary to study the new features of the current new situation, to gain a better understanding of the rules, to be more scientifically precise, to better integrate into the new development patterns that are mutually promoted by domestic and international double-looping.
zh more focus on improving industrial infrastructure capacity.
In the first half of the year, I have not only seen a large number of emerging industrial investment projects being launched, but also more traditional industrial companies with advantages accelerating the ups and downs of the digitization, smart and greening of industries.
The Yiyang Osikong Third Science Park project is a transformation of the existing production line, the high-end printed circuit board intelligent production line is a pioneer; the new plant district of the Hunan Chinese Tobacco Factory is committed to the intelligent transformation; the history of the construction of the modern factory is a living image of the new booming tree...... focusing on the major national strategy and two new ones, focusing on strengthening the advantages of the industry, actively cultivating the development of emerging industries, and fully increasing technological innovation and national alternatives, to continue to create real infrastructure conditions, and to save energy for transformation.
More emphasis is placed on developing new economic development, new business models and new models.
The sudden outbreak of the new corona, which brought a boom in the digital economy, stimulated the potential of the digital economy, provided new opportunities for industrial change: in the first half of the year, the province's computer and office equipment manufacturing, electronics and communication equipment manufacturing sector grew 12.6%, and online retail sales of wholesale and retail businesses above the limit increased 32.2%, and online meal revenue of catering companies increased 35.6% compared to the same period.
Building new machinery in the face of crisis, actively promoting digital industrialization, industrial digitalization, and driving the digital economy and the integration of the physical economy are all the rage.

Especially in February, many enterprises' production and operations activities were essentially in a state of shutdown, business demand for workers declined, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the unemployment rate in town surveys rose.
As the situation of epidemic prevention gradually improves, the whole society is continually restoring the order of production and life.
The party's central committee insisted on a general tone of work on steady growth, further increased macroeconomic policy hedging, comprehensive strengthening of employment priorities, and actively promoted support for enterprises and employment expansion.
China has increased policy hedge positions, introduced a package of policies, phased reductions in the contribution of three social insurance units, allowed for postponed social insurance contributions, expanded SME unemployment insurance, benefits from the employment training policy, subsidized employment for the enterprise absorption focus groups, and see apprenticeship subsidy.
With the implementation of stable employment policies, the demand for workers in enterprises has steadily recovered, the employment situation has gradually improved, the town survey unemployment rate has gradually declined, and in June, the survey unemployment rate was 5.7%.

In January this year, the CPI increased by 5.4% year-on-year, setting a new high in several years.
 In February, the CPI compared to the zh, although slightly lower, remained in the 5 range
The CPI is high in comparison, with both factors driving consumption demand before the spring, and factors that also have lower springtime mismonths and relative figures.
However, the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on prices is particularly evident.
Influenced by the pandemic control, in February all over the country there were logistics delays, inadequate supply of goods, increased transportation costs, etc. and some citizen buildup and takeovers, and the prices of some basic necessities of life significantly increased.
To address the disruption caused by the epidemic control to the price situation, relevant departments have included vital life goods in the scope of emergency transportation safeguards, ensuring the transportation of goods.
Through a series of policy initiatives, the supply of vegetable, fruit and vegetable markets is strongly guaranteed.
To cope with the rapid rise in pigmeat prices earlier this year, after the central government introduced a policy of stable supply and price, the regions and sectors quickly implemented the implementation, the pigmeat stockpile and disposal supply improved significantly, pig production capacity was restored in an orderly manner, the sales order gradually normalized.
Since March, pigmeat prices have been falling steadily, and in May, the price of animal feed has fallen to 10.6%; in June, influenced by factors such as the slowdown in pig production, the reduction in imports and the uptick in consumer demand among groups, pigmeat prices have increased slightly.
Seasonal fluctuations in the prices of fresh produce are evident, with the first half of the year an average increase of 3.4%.
The price of fresh fruit has been declining steadily, falling by an average of 13.3% in the first half of the year, compared to the same period last year.
The basic life of the masses is effectively ensured, the economic and social order is maintained.
As transportation logistics gradually recovers, the supply and demand in the marketplace improves.
Starting in March, the CPI ratio declined for four straight months, and the share increase also fell from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June, with the overall price level recovering from a steady decline.
In the second half of the year, Chinese prices will continue to remain moderate, with overall inflation pressure not much, but still to push for the restoration of the order of production and living, subject to the normalcy of the epidemic control.
It has an impact on natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and floods in the main production areas of food, fruits and vegetables, strengthened market regulation, and firmly fought against market disruptions such as accumulation of food, price increases, and more.

In this regard, China's president of Beijing Heavy Duty Beekeeping Company Limited believes it is worthwhile: This move has been able to increase the popularity of the Chinese bee products, attract more consumers to know, prefer non-natural bee products, and drive increased beekeeping yields.

The picture is for the Qinghai Lake.
This spring, everywhere because of the need to set up roadblocks, beehivers are blocked from pursuing honey, many bees die from missing their flowering period, lack of food, and bee farmers' income is severely affected.
 A year later, the beekeepers followed a long flowering journey, moving north from Yunnan, Sichuan Road to the Northwest, their windy dining quarters, their unstable, very hard work.
As a business, we have a responsibility to help them.
娜 said.
 Honey bees are  environmental scouts, bees in areas heavily polluted cannot survive Chinese Bee Products Association's permanent vice president 小川 introduced, that honey bees are an important link in the ecological chain, playing an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment

图为小川常任副主席 of the China Association of Beekeeping Products (CCP) zhzhzh) present the products of the Chinese bee industry.
The economic, ecological and social benefits of bee pollination are far greater than the value of the bee products themselves, the bee industry has enormous potential in terms of human health, crop production, plant reproduction, and ecological protection, about which little has been known.
小川 is represented byzhō.
Today, with fewer and fewer beekeepers, in addition to the regularly-running bee farmers, there are still many disadvantaged poor people who choose to join cooperatives with beehives.
 Countries have financial support, we contact technical staff to help guide, beekeepers lack understanding and judgment about the market environment, and to open up sales routes, they also need the help and coordination of governments, businesses, industry associations.zh
小川 said zh.
 I hope you will pay more attention to the bees in the future,  supporting the bee community,  said, our bee products are also strictly selected and controlled according to national standards, guarantee quality, while helping the beekeeper and protecting the consumer's interests

White House advisers in the United States have been critical of the state's premature re-establishment of jobs.
White House advisers in the United States have been critical of the state's premature re-employment.
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States exceeded four million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
For months, President Trump has repeatedly demanded that states across the country, until recently changed their minds, actively wear masks in public, while his adviser has repeatedly called some state governments too early to resume their work.
On 22nd, White House presidential adviser Killian Conway told a news conference that some state governments had failed to meet the standards of re-employment, re-launching prematurely places like bars.
Conway also mentioned that previous claims that the president has the absolute power to decide state re-election cases were misconstrued.
The president is a federalist, he believes that states have autonomy.
She has defended Trump.
However, the rumors in Conway's mouth were those Trump spoke at a White House news conference on April 13.
This self-defeating operation was ridiculed by netizens for rewriting history.
Killian Conway wants to rewrite history, she is a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer an authoritarian because she followed medical standards, insisted on a strike.
Trump wants to push for a re-work so he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time that Killian Conway has caused controversy.

She seemed to understand the 19th as a version number, fucked up by the interneters: without common sense, look at the newspaper!
Is it reasonable to sue the school after a three-year-old child is found guilty of being a victim of a felony?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source:法制日报 Author:王思  responsible editor:王思
The playground was destroyed, the children were damaged and the school was again sued.
□ This newspaper correspondent zh一凡
Three-year-old Chen-Moo, who was accidentally hit by a softball team, hit his head while pitching.
After Chen Mu's compensation, Wen, the father of Xiaoming, as Xiaoming's legal representative, appealed the school to the court, apologized to the school where the incident occurred, and paid a total of 20,000 yuan for medical expenses, mental health and other benefits.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Beijing People's Court of the Haizhou District of Beijing ruled that the school had set up a safety net on the playground at the time of the incident, had fulfilled its proper security obligations, and had made restitution, and dismissed the plaintiff's claim under this judgment.
Mr. Wen claimed that during the 2019 summer break, he took him to play on the school playground, while the varsity softball team was training on the playground.
To avoid the risks involved, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents were active in the safety zone designated by the softball team.
But later softball team member Chen Mao broke his hand while pitching, causing the softball to cross the fence and fly into the above safety zone and hit the small-sized back of the brain.
Mr. Wen immediately took Mr. Wen to hospital for treatment, where he was diagnosed with a head injury.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities on the school's field do not meet the relevant safety regulations, and that the team and facilities are not effectively managed.
Failure of the school to perform the above-mentioned tasks, which caused the child to suffer great physical pain, but also greatly to his family, is a legal responsibility for which the school should bear the responsibility.
The school has already set up a safety net on the playground, and posted administrative regulations, training notices, advising entrance to the playground to be kept a safe distance from the training site and warning of attention to their own safety, and the plaintiff cannot prove that the school has not fulfilled its security obligations, so he declines compensation.
The court held that the site of the incident was the site of the university involved, which was open to the public free of charge, and that although the school had a security obligation to manage the playground, such a security obligation only had to meet the general duty of care.
It happened that the school had set up a safety net on the playground, had fulfilled its proper security obligations, and had compensated Chowin for over two thousand yuan of damages such as medical expenses, transportation costs, and other damages in accordance with the previously agreed compensation agreement, both sides agreed to settle the dispute once and for all.
Later, the parents of the minority once again claimed the school's compensation, but the court's ruling dismissed the plaintiff's entire appeal.
After the verdict, neither side appealed, but the verdict is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of the Law on Public Liability for Infringement, schools as public places administrators have security obligations; in the event of third party harm, third parties have a responsibility for infringement, and public places administrators who fail to meet their security obligations have a corresponding additional responsibility.
Since the judge said that as a public place administrator, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the entire site, anticipate the potential dangers and damage, and thus take the necessary measures to prevent the loss or to reduce the extent of the damage, and avoid and reduce the cost of the damage to a minimum, the law provides that he is obliged to undertake social activities to ensure that they are adequately protected.
In this case, the school's security obligations for unspecific access to the playground, which is open to the public free of charge, should be consistent with the social activities it carries out, specifically, the basic security measures and the obligation to inform the public about the risk of secrecy.
In judicial practice, it is also not appropriate to impose too high a security obligation on public works managers.
If the school has already set up a safety net and is complying with the notification obligation, it can be determined that the school is not faulty, should not be held liable under the law.
In addition, for third party infringements, even if the administrator of a public place such as a school does not fulfill its security obligations, its liability is also assumed as a complement to damages, which, under the Civil Code, can be compensated to third parties after the administrator assumes additional liability.
Therefore, in such an accident, the victim should not extend the scope of the claim after he has received compensation from the person directly violating the law.
Under the normal practice of epidemic control, people are very enthusiastic about physical activity.
With the gradual opening up of cross-provincial tourism, the tourism market is also about to recover.
Fujian Province resumed cross-provincial tourism operations from July 21, the first weekend after opening, as the gateway to a popular tourist destination has reached its peak in passenger traffic.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are many tourists arriving at the weekend for a tour of Zhenzhen.
The train station is expected to carry 3.7 million passengers in the summer, while the airport's passenger traffic is dominated by students, tourists and family members.
The tourism market gradually warmed up in July, when the airport operated 440 flights per day, domestic flights were restored to 80% of pre-epidemic levels.
The airline has encrypted the airline's hotline from major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an, and other cities, seizing the booming tourism market.
Currently, many travel agencies are continuously offering a series of summer domestic, interprovincial and cross-provincial travel products, with team travel mainly based on outdoor attractions.
The summit of summer passenger traffic at the train station, the airport, the area where the relevant units are easily crowded at the value counters, the security corridors, etc. have sent more people to evacuate, Fujian has also optimized the upgrade of the health code, achieved health data sharing and mutual recognition between 31 provinces, and promoted the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can the city of Dzhongqing be able to unleash a new spark?
The dismantling expert 2zh recently announced that it will be released on December 24, becoming the first film in the series to be filmed.
The second part is still directed by Dzhong, and is directed and starred by Dzhong, opening with a whole new story.
The addition of the second element of the nuclear bomb also made the challenge for the detonation experts even more difficult, with several surprising shots in the foreground, a heart-wrenching line, a big explosion, an airport engulfed by fire, and a pretty shocking scene.
Three years ago, the bomb-breaking expert made by the original crew of the horse, won the top five box office awards of that year and received seven nominations for the Hong Kong Film Golden Image Award, and Dewar also became a gold medalist in the audience's attention.
This time, the bomb-destroying expert2zh, also makes it again hopeful if this medal set can wipe out a new spark.
The bomb-destroying expert tells a whole new story: former bomb-destroying expert Panzh Kpak, who fell on the scene of the explosion, and was identified by police as a suspect.
In order to find the truth, he had to seek help from his best friend Dong Tzuen, who was also a bomb disposal expert.
The woman who was the inspector of the crash, as well as the former girlfriend of Panzh, were also involved.
Still a bomb disposal expert, but can sense the complexity of the new character from the preview: he broke a leg, put on a limb, was chased by the same bomb disposal expert, and was commanded by his ex-girlfriend, Jenny.
What exactly was the relationship between the three of them, what Dewar did at the Chan Island Hotel, what cases he was involved in, what twists and turns his career as a bomb disposal expert experienced, and all sorts of puzzles are intriguing.
The film's main plot is reportedly a world-class landmark building in Hong Kong, with a top-notch special effects production team, that brings a shockingly realistic visual impact.

Israel has stepped up its efforts to prevent the recurrence of the outbreak.

Israel has stepped up its efforts to prevent the recurrence of the outbreak.
In the early days of the outbreak of the coronavirus, Israel's preventive measures were clearly effective.
However, as the control measures are gradually being phased out, the number of new coronavirus infections confirmed in Israel has recently increased significantly, and the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen control of the outbreak.
On February 28, the first case of new coronavirus pneumonia was confirmed in the Israeli mainland, promptly closing all entry-exit ports, suspending unnecessary industries, switching schools to online classes, restricting public transport and unnecessary social activities, blocking cities severely affected, joint military police maintenance and prevention initiatives, etc.
This series of measures quickly had positive results, and by mid-May, the number of new cases of daily coronavirus infection confirmed in Israel once fell to a single figure.
As the outbreak is brought under control, Israel's preventive measures are fully dismantled, and since June, the number of new coronavirus infections has been steadily rising.
Especially after entering July, the epidemic has been spreading rapidly.
Recently, Israel has had more than 1,500 new cases per day for eight days, and as of July 25, when the draft was issued, it had reached 916 cases per day.
As of July 25, Israel has confirmed 59,745 cases and 448 deaths.
In the face of the rapid resurgence of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen its prevention efforts.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases had surpassed 30,000, the Israeli government closed down public entertainment venues such as gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, and introduced a public transportation policy that limited the number of passengers per bus to no more than 20 people.
On 17th, the government announced a series of new restrictions, including the weekend implementation of the city, which stipulates that the city is to be implemented between 5pm and 5pm every weekday.
During this period, the public can go outside, but shops, shopping centers, hair salons, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic service areas such as supermarkets, pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, on all dates and times, gatherings forbidden for more than 10 people, gyms, studios, etc. will be closed, restaurants and cafes will be forbidden to eat, only out-of-court services allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people have not paid enough attention to the seriousness of the outbreak, and have not been able to form a coalition with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After the repeated outbreak of the Israeli epidemic, many people marched in protest against government prevention measures that impaired their economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people marched in Tel Aviv, believing that the anti-epidemic policy was affecting the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered outside Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem to protest against Netanyahu's ban on restaurants, cafes and other food safety measures and the failure to pay compensation.
In addition, many people also fail to adhere to the rules of wearing a mask during outdoor activities, maintaining a safe social distance of two meters, and to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing a mask, many people only wear a mask on their foreheads or on their wrists.
During the pandemic, schools were a hotbed of coronavirus outbreaks, and according to a recent visit by a reporter to the kindergarten, teachers and students in the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters, which poses a danger to a large number of schoolchildren infected with the virus.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the National Security Council's Expert Advisory Council on Epidemiology, believes that Israel is heading toward a dangerous situation, noting that the current measures taken by Israel to control the epidemic are insufficient, and that all leisure facilities and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Vaxman said Israel lacks a comprehensive plan to combat the outbreak, and that parliamentary and governmental bodies should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, agree on the issue of fighting the outbreak, and develop clear measures to include sector-specific restrictive measures.

Ninja-shing villagers resisted the old companion, Daei Tianfu, and two men, in a car, drove from their home 20 miles away to Liang Yun Cultural Palace.
Despite the two years of uncomfortable legs, 77-year-old Daizh Tianfu still hopes to come here in a few days, and has done the trick.
This is a stunning courtyard in the original district of Shoreham, which, unlike a typical farmer's courtyard, often features lavish caves, with exquisite sculptures, carvings, traditional caves, eyebrows, etc.
The owner of the palace is Liang Yun, who was once a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he, a lover of cinema, began planning the construction of a cultural palace.
With the Liang Yun Cultural Garden, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
The reporter has not yet entered Liang Yun Cultural Palace, and the tune of the song has already been passed on.
The singing of the song for the countrymen is performed by the neighbouring village village people Berlichan.
She was a child prodigy, now a little known locally, and as long as she had time, would come to the Cultural Palace to perform for the countrymen.
Recently, Berry Chan also started playing live networking.
Berli香 said:zh having a stage to allow more people to see themselves performing is a very happy thing
On stage, the singers stand face to face, the drummers stand face to face, and despite being amateurs, the enthusiasm is not diminished.
Like the simple style of the farmhouse, outside the cave, the artistic and non-traditional roots of the Liang Yun Cultural Garden come to life.
The palace also houses a collection of more than 300 objects, including agricultural tools, traditional and handmade plastics, cutting paper, embroidery, parchment, and other objects from different eras.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the gallery in the courtyard, where he displayed his collection of old items, old wine, three-strings, rail cars, etc.
A common farmer builds a cultural palace for Zhong?
I started learning the art of theater at the age of 15.
Liang Yun Cultural Academy was established in 2012, becoming the first rural non-material cultural heritage exhibition hall in Ningxia, and the non-material cultural heritage conservation demonstration facility in the city of Sohryang.
In addition to the Liang Yun Cultural Palace, the original Zhongguo district of Quang Mai has also emerged with more than 120 cultural palaces, 79 folk performance groups, of which, there is a certain size of cultural palace with more than 50 such as Shenyang River Cultural Palace, Wang Yong Red Cultural Palace,郎 Cultural Palace, etc., covering the towns and streets of Quang Mai, with a capacity of more than 5,000 people.
These herbalists were active in the fields, enriched the cultural life of the masses, and satisfied their spiritual needs.
 As life improves, traditional culture cannot be so degraded.zh
The battle of Liyuzhan came back again to win the battle against Liyuzhan.
The 40th Battle of the Bulge will be aired on Beijing Television starting July 16.
It is based on true events, and is based on the dust-clogged Soviet military archives that first appeared.
The actor Liu Yunzhong, known to the public for his role in the war drama, broke through in the drama, challenging a cheerful, cheerful, mouth-eating agent.
In recent years, the rise of disguised masks such as the War of the Worlds has shown the vitality of war-style drama.
Unlike previous war novels, the novel takes a world-wide look, extending the story's background to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
Set against the backdrop of the final stages of the 1944 anti-Japanese War, it tells the story of Chinese Communist Intelligence Officer Dongfei, who, under the leadership of the Chinese underground Party's provincial secretary Lin River and director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, executes the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency's Mudan Ural tactical operation.
In many war dramas, the male protagonist acts as a high-ranking spy, with a first appearance being a perfect image of a mature person, a high IQ, and a mature personality.
But in the eyes of Liu Yun Long, such a person is not suitable for espionage, he should be the kind of person you can't find in the locker room, if a show is that kind of a very nice image, hateful of everyone to notice you, can you still sneak in?
So in the game, Liu Yun-long unwittingly designed the protagonist of his role, Dong-fei, into a cheerful mouth-eating agent.
The other camp in the 胜算, was set up by Japanese director of police department Wang Sebo Koeng-li, played by Liang Zhenhua and Japanese director of police department Fu原 and Li Li, played by Li Li Li.
One South and one North, two powerful actors, added to the whole drama many high-profile actors' tricky points of view.
The director's role in the drama is to describe the performance of Li Li and Liu Yun-long, who are definitely the antagonists of the drama, their two special silences, which are very striking to me. Often their plays are all still in the works, for example, we only write half a page long, and when I shoot I don't stop, they can both play continuously.
The actors are not playing each other, the director is not playing, when the actors are in the role and assure themselves of their character status, not only can they shape the character from the perspective of the character, but also give the audience more viewing possibilities, so that such a play is only spectacular enough.
In the series, you can also see the familiar face of many of the war dramas, the quake of the middle name of the storm, the F4 of the city of the wind, and the three other characters in the series.
He played the roles of 孝zh安 and 简之侯 and 名洋, this time again playing the left-handed right-arm of Donfei.
Director Zhaofei said, "These two people have no inferiority, they just flowed slowly through the era and environment".
Liu Yun-long also actively proposed, "We need someone to be sympathetic to". This person's sympathetic attitude means that those around me must have good and bad people, bad people are enemies, but also develop them, our squad also grow.
The ending of the two characters in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunzhong, who believes it will provide the audience with a satisfactory answer.

He is optimistic about Hong Kong's financial stability and economic prosperity.

The total amount of bank deposits has also continued to increase over the past few months, the stock market has had a series of open-ended fundraising events, and market share has risen.
Xu Zheng Yu said the coronavirus outbreak has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantage remains the same.
Hong Kong's many advantages, including geography, rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and funds, and a simple low-tax system, continue to make Hong Kong a leading international financial center.
Xu Zheng Yu pointed out that the special government has set aside 6 billion HONG Z in the Epidemic Response Fund, creating some 30,000 temporary jobs in the public and private sectors over the next two years, covering people with different skills and qualifications.

He encouraged Canadian businesses to take advantage of Hong Kong's advantages and its status as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center, and a global offshore hub for the RMB business, developing and investing in the greater Hong Kong Bay Area and surrounding areas.
The Chinese government praised the efforts of China to combat the epidemic and encouraged countries to learn from experience.
According to the 25th edition of the journal 柳叶刀zh, China, as a country of 1.4 billion people, similar in size to Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the outbreak of the new coronavirus at this stage, without any further extensive outbreaks, largely controlling the domestic outbreak.
Over the past decade, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, making China much more prepared for the new coronavirus than it was for SARS that year.
The author says that when SARS started in 2002, China was initially under-prepared, especially for the pathogen.
When the coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were able to quickly identify virus types, and on January 11, 2020, they shared genome sequencing data with the international community.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had elaborated on the clinical features of the virus, warning the world of the threat posed by the novel coronavirus through a research paper published in the Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, in the state of emergency declared by the country, through close domestic cooperation, such research was carried out very quickly and strictly, in May and July, respectively, announcing the results of the progress of early trials of China's newly developed coronavirus vaccine on the Lancet.
China's experience shows that investing in the national health and research system, effectively improving laboratory capacity, is very important.
This is the basis for a nation's rapid and effective response to a health emergency and global health security.
zh other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are very worth learning and learning from.
Furthermore, Chinese experience shows that, on the basis of strong research, strong senior decision-making must be made with strong determination based on scientific evidence, in order to effectively control the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
The article emphasizes that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand the value of science, and act on it in a way that is most beneficial to society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, the Chinese National Health and Safety Commission sent three groups of infectious diseases experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the novel coronavirus, their suggestions provided the basis for the decision of January 23rd in Wuhan; when experts raised the need and urgency of a hospital, the government quickly made the decision and implemented it quickly; at the same time, the broad participation of the community and the masses also allowed the outbreak to be quickly and effectively controlled.
The article concludes by stressing that in response to the global health emergency, countries need to strengthen global cooperation, joint response and action.

The film was nominated for the Golden Lion Award.
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official shortlist for the Golden Lion.
The director's first real-life feature film, successfully nominated for the prestigious Filmfare Award, officially launched the first poster.
The header is a side for the picture.
The film is the director's first work of real-life themes, and his second-degree tie-up to the Golden Globe.
The film tells the story of a comedy film director who, with a sudden surprise, returns to a rural North East village, hoping to turn a family into a feature film over the years, and encounters a series of unforeseen circumstances.
The family members, who had gathered for the film, completed the final party.
In the poster for the film released today, a member of this family, King Zhijiang, is sitting in the center of the picture smoking, the background is the Northeast Black Land, covered in silver, the outlook is the red lights that Chinese people must hang on to the Chinese New Year's Eve.
The red light symbolizing joy and unity and the embodiment of the king, Wang Jixiang, formed a huge contrast, and also seemed to reveal the complexity and entanglement of this large family relationship.
In the film, in addition to the daughter of 三王吉祥 played by actor陆, the rest of the drama is done by real directors, the film experimental visual and audio style, breaks the boundaries between theater and reality, bringing the audience a whole new immersive viewing experience.
According to the director, the creation of the film originated from a series of sudden family breakdowns during filming, causing the original shooting schedule to change, life without a script to be finally recorded as a film, but releasing stress beyond design.

The regional government once again called on small and large owners to reduce their rent and to share their time with retailers, grocers and small and medium-sized businesses.
Chen Mao-po published an article online entitled "The Road to recovery".
He said that the recent number of confirmed cases of HCoV in Hong Kong is high, the situation is dire, affecting social life, and also plaguing the economy.
When an outbreak repeats itself, the priority is to strictly prevent individual imports, and to process and disrupt the virus transmission chain as quickly as possible; when the outbreak is contained, economic activity should be restored in due course.
He noted that in the face of the shock of a new wave of epidemics, the trade flows and economic activity that had been expected to resume in the Soviet Union were also hit.
For business, social responsibility is equally important, besides the spirit of the contract, especially for groups that receive large government subsidies under the Employment Insurance Program.
He noted that the economic situation in Hong Kong was still very dire in the second quarter of this year, but the contraction trend seemed to be slowing slightly.
On the export side, he believes that the peripheral situation in Hong Kong remains dire.
The development of Hong Kong over the past few decades has shown that every crisis hides new opportunities, every difficulty hides the key to future development, Chen said.

Chinese doctors gathered a salute to the hero of the pandemic.
Recently, with Chinese filmmakers paying homage to the heroes of the epidemic, the chairman of the BONA Film Group in Winter, Guangzhou, met with the academician of Zhongnan-shan, who were working on the filming of the anti-epidemic documentary, China Doctor.
The BONA film industry hopes to pay tribute to all healthcare workers who are fighting in the front line of epidemic control, thanks to Chinese doctors!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
Currently, the BONA film industry is deploying, under the arrangements of the Ministry of Information and the National Film Board, with the support of the Guangdong Provincial Film Board and the Hubei Provincial Film Board, organizing the film China Manager, the original staff member, and the film China Doctor, a film that reflects the unity of the national people in fighting the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, under the strong leadership of the Party Central.
The film focuses on the Wuhan First Battlefield, will feature the character background of Wuhan medical personnel and the medical teams of the various provinces, from a human perspective, using unique narratives, and a highly impactful language of footage, and will showcase the moving story of the Chinese medical personnel of the Wuhan First Battlefield, full of devotion and sacrifice.
It is understood that during the first period of the Wuhan unblocking day, Bona overcame the heavy difficulties, sent a pickup team into the epidemic front, exchanged information, information and information with hundreds of healthcare workers, and has now interviewed, including Zhongnan Shan academicians themselves, Guangzhou First Aid to Wuhan, Guangdong First Aid Medical Team, and Wuhan Golden Silver Hospital, Wuhan Association and Hospital, Wuhan University Hospital, Wuhan University Hospital, Wuhan Center Hospital, and other leading anti-epidemic frontline white-collar angels, who have shot a large number of precious first-hand video materials.
During this talk, Dr. Zhongnan-san also expressed hope and expectation about the film's making: "I look forward to, hopefully, that you will not only visit some of the most outspoken experts, but also more interviews with the medical personnel who are on the front lines, most of whom are the most vulnerable".
He said that he had seen me and the pilots of my homeland, China, before, and thought it would be a good way to tell a big story from the perspective of ordinary people.
 Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China
Speaking of the spread of the film, Dr. Zhongnan-san said that currently, some people abroad like to label the virus politically, and he hopes that the film will touch the audience from a human perspective: This film will not only be shown in China, but also best shown abroad, in a way that both domestic and foreign viewers can understand, and will touch the audience with a true human spirit
Dr. Zhongnan also fondly recalled the 1980s film 'Man to the Middle Ages', so many years had passed, and I was most impressed with the post-reform and post-open cinema until the middle ages, when my doctor friends abroad were watching and crying, and it would be great if Chinese doctors could play such a role.
Dr. Zhongnan said that if Chinese doctors could generate a foreign audience, it would be very successful.
During the exchange of talks, Prof. Zhongnan also shared his views and suggestions on the current international epidemic control, "I believe that people will always be smarter than viruses".
Dr. Zhongnan-san said that although the virus is difficult to predict, from the early society to the present day, humanity has gone through thousands of hardships, modern society now has advanced medical technology and social management measures, and medical professionals worldwide, even the general public, have a basic understanding of science in response to the new coronavirus outbreak, people will no longer be as passive as before, and that attention should be paid to two aspects of the work, first, to study how to strengthen global cooperation, and second, to focus on reassuring people's minds.

At the same time, they invited the national non-material cultural heritage protection project 安塞剪纸北民歌 and the provincial non-heritage project 延川布堆画承承承人, focusing on promoting and promoting products with a folk and folk character, and taking this opportunity to communicate with other exhibition units, promote cross-regional cooperation.
In Japan, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus has accumulated more than 30,000 cases.
According to statistics, on 26th of January, Tokyo has 239 new cases, six consecutive daily new cases exceeding 200 cases, totaling 111214 cases.
In addition, there are 141 new cases confirmed in Osaka, 90 in Fukuoka, and 80 in Aichi.
In the first half of the year, the crime of telecommunications fraud increased by 70 percent.
China New NetJuly 26, 2017  According to the highest prosecuting website, in the first half of this year, the national prosecutors' office charged a total of 5,8101 people with fraudulent crimes, an increase of 35% compared to last year 
Especially in the case of crime that impedes the prevention of epidemics, the prevalence of fraud, prosecution of fraud by the prosecutor's office, and the number of criminals responsible for fraud account for 43.4% of the total number of crimes that prevent the prevention of epidemics.
The Supreme People's Prosecutor's Office has targeted guidance, with a total of nine cases of fraud involving nine of the ten cases of epidemic prevention cases that have been published so far.
From the prosecutor's office's case reports of the first half of the year, the number of names for fraudulent crimes, from national macro-policy up to national policy, down to the public's clothing housing market, including epidemic fraud, health care fraud, health care fraud, recruitment fraud, subsidy fraud, national asset fraud, etc., has been increasingly promoted, with a range of issues including education, health care, employment, pension, social security, land removal, precision poverty alleviation, financial credit, and many other areas, not only causing economic damage to victims, but also seriously affecting economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network fraud breaches national, regional and personal boundaries, has characteristics of involvement, cross-border, remote, electronic payments, and other factors, unidentified victims are numerous, dangerous.
For example, some set up a specialized company, rent a high-end office, set up multiple departments or positions, use legal online platforms to advertise, recruit, train and evaluate recruiters, adopt business model management, wear legal outfits, and be more confusing.
The prosecutor has the unyielding responsibility to punish and prevent crime, and to issue timely warnings to the public and relevant authorities.
In the judicial branch, the prosecutor's office has a serious role to play, both by maintaining a high-pressure attitude towards fraud crimes, and by tailoring enforcement efforts to promote social governance through the issuance of prosecutorial recommendations, among others.
The prosecution strictly applies the facts, evidence, procedural and legal framework to the arrest, prosecution, prosecution and prosecution of fraud cases, based on facts, based on the law, and without prejudice to the law.
Especially for the crime of telecommunications network fraud, focusing on the central role of electronic data in determining facts, striving to build a mutually-enforcing chain of evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence, and documentary evidence.
As a result of a case involving a fraudulent prosecutor's office in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the prosecutor's office first intervened early, from the case's occurrence to its completion, in just five days, demonstrating its determination and determination to maintain stability in the social fabric from the very beginning.
It has reviewed arrests and prosecution, focused on prosecuting offenders in cases, corrected the 733 arrests of the public safety authority, corrected the public safety authority's oversight of the prosecution of the 1113 co-defendants.
In the first half of the year, the National Prosecutor's Office issued 298 prosecutorial recommendations against fraud crimes, promoted joint prevention of fraud crimes, promoted deep governance, and promoted cooperation in the fight against fraud.
For example, in the case of the communication companies, banks, intermediaries, etc. found in the case, the gaps in telecommunications network regulation, the Guangzhou Municipal Prosecutor's Office, the Guangzhou Municipal Prosecutor's Office, and the Dong City Prosecutor's Office, promptly make recommendations, urge the relevant units to strengthen the regulation, improve the mechanism, and promote the construction of a long-term system of effectiveness.
Four is to do everything possible to recover the damage.
The prosecutors will seize the important elements of the investigation, such as guiding the investigation, reviewing the prosecution, urging the investigation to actively collect the money, cooperating with the relevant departments in the recovery of the losses, and working to minimize the economic losses caused by fraudulent crimes to the masses.
For example, in the case of a loan scheme in the Beijing Municipal Prosecutor's Office, which involved 22 real estate suits, the first-order foreclosure, where the property may have been previously disposed of by other cases, the first-order foreclosure, the timely delivery to the relevant court, the recommendation that the court of first-order foreclosure suspend the enforcement of the property in question, the uniform disposition of the property after the facts of the crime have been established, the best efforts to recover the property in question, the recovery of the loss of the victim.
The prosecutor reminds everyone that there is a high risk of fraud, don't expect to fall from the sky, don't think it's cheap to believe, and keep your own money in your pocket.

On a hot day, villagers Li Yuanzong sat in the base, although their faces were red, but they occasionally sang a few small songs in their mouths.
The town's location, in the province of Wining, is known for its low humidity, high elevation, high light, high day and night temperatures, high sugar content, good taste, and reputation in the surrounding area, but also for its small size and high spots, and has not been able to sell well for money, or to form an industrial scale.
The town was once a poor rural town in the Yangtze Valley, where the poverty rate reached 25.8% ten years ago.
The breakdown of poverty and the entry into a critical period of decisive victory, changing traditional cultivation habits, adjusting industrial structures, increasing farmers' incomes are imminent.
After several visits to the town, Chen Zhuang, the party secretary of the party committee, and a group of people in the town, felt that industrial development could not go back to the old way.
To this end, the town introduced the flagship enterprise, cultivating fruit in a modern way.
Wening went beyond being Vice General Manager of Agricultural Limited, Houzh Jianwin, who came from the west in 2015 to study the town, taking a look at the local growing conditions, starting in 2016 and planting fruit trees there.
Initially, the village activist Li Yuanchong turned the land into a flooded planting of fruit trees, and Li Yuanchong and his wife committed the following: After so many years of planting fruit, they never saw who in the village had made a fortune.
All fruit seeds are shortened, so they won't make the tree grow too tall.
What Lee Yuanzhong did not remember was that this time the apple cultivation took a new approach, water pipes were laid under each apple tree, water and fertilizer were combined to the tree roots, and when the fruit was harvested in the autumn, the tractor opened directly into the orchard, stopping and picking the fruit.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered a period of high production, and the market, as Hu Jianzheng predicted, is not too bad for Apple, and is highly valued by consumers in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and others.
The booming apple industry has changed Li Yuanzh's life, and while he is still planting, he has a new source of income.
The Li Yuanzong family has transferred more than 9,000 acres of land to the base, and each year, in addition to the underground land transfer fee, the base is divided in dividends, the couple is usually employed at the base, earning 80 yuan per day, and living in the regular year.
Li told reporters that last year, the dividend of profits was more than 2,800 rupees, plus the transfer of land and the couple's working income, a family income of more than 80,000 rupees, the days of well-being are over.
 The initial results have been seen so far,1 fruit has an annual production value of over 150,000 yuan, about 10 times the value of maize
Chen Zhu told reporters that the town of Zhenzhou has planted 20,000 fruits at present, 6,000 in the village of Zhenzhou alone, covering 4,056 farmers, 1,720,000 of whom are in the poverty line, 656 households, 2,952 of whom are in the poverty line, with a salary of more than 6 million yuan a year, really achieving the goal of building a base at home, working without having to go abroad.
Li Yuancheng, who was getting more and more worn out, also began to realize his own wishes.
This year, during the Lunar Spring Festival, Lizh Yuanzho bought a pickup truck, today he starts working in his car, he still has a dozen acres of land in his family, etc. The next step in the expansion of the Apple base, all of it flows to them, earning more revenue.

The membrane separation technology helps break down the greenhouse effect.
The membrane separation technology helps break down the greenhouse effect.
A new type of hybrid basement membrane is being prepared, technical blueprinted.
This article was originally published by 记者商瑞报道:日前, the Tianjin University's atmospheric environment and bioenergy team made significant progress in the process of film separation and carbon dioxide capture, successfully researched and developed a new type of hybrid base-layer film preparation technology, and significantly improved the performance of film material in capturing carbon dioxide concentrations.
The results have been published as a cover article in the international journal Greenhouse gases: science and technology.
The greenhouse effect is a major environmental problem plaguing human development, while carbon dioxide emissions are responsible for the greenhouse effect.
How to efficiently capture and use human emissions of carbon dioxide is a focus of scientific attention.
Membrane separation is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology that separates carbon dioxide from gas using membrane materials, has energy-efficient efficiency, and is characterized by simple operation.
How to make a film material breathe deeply, increasing the efficiency of gas separation, is the difficulty of capturing carbon dioxide from the bottle using the membrane separation method.
The team of researchers at the University of Tianjin, using innovative ideas, through repeated experiments, explored the effects of different solvents on the separation performance of membrane gases.
 Experimental results showed that with N-methyl as a preparation solvent, the carbon nanotubes distribution in the generated membrane material was more evenly distributed, more permeable, effectively improving the efficiency and rate of gas separation of the membrane material
Using this new technology, the hybrid substrate film, which has carbon dioxide separation performance close to the theoretical separation limit of current film material such as this one.
 New technology has provided a new way of capturing carbon dioxide from the membrane separation process
Lizh, a member of the Tianjin University's atmospheric environment and bioenergy team, said: "We hope this technology will provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical plants processing of smog, and will play a significant role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions and more".
Before you apply for volunteer status, first understand what is a professional level difference.
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning newspaper Author: Xiazhong  Responsible editor: Xiazhong
Before you apply for volunteer status, first understand what is a professional level difference.
Every year, students or parents who volunteer for the high school apply for a job do not know the names involved in the volunteer application, and thus affect the volunteer application.
This year, the Beijing Transport University, Beijing Tech University, Beijing Postal University, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing Chemical University and five other universities have jointly released a 2020 admissions policy, eliminating the professional level gap.
What is the meaning of a professional level gap, and what is the significance of volunteering?
There are three ways in which the rules of professional allocation can be applied.
 experts remind, before filling out the volunteer form, be sure to read the admissions documents of the heart school, understand the university's admission rules, including the grading ratio, professional allocation rules, etc.
 the rules of professional allocation, that is, after the university's grading, for professional admission there are mainly three ways of specialty priority, scoring priority, and professional level variation
The specific method used by the high school will be specified in the admissions document.
But there are also some universities that acceptance principles are that total scores are given priority, and there is no difference in grades between professions.
That is, in the admissions range, candidates are sorted according to the total score, and when the score does not reach the first professional volunteer admissions score line, see if the second professional volunteer admissions score line is reached, thus pushing until the last professional volunteer admissions, so that there is no difference in grades between the professional volunteers.
The so-called  professional level difference, is one or more scores that an institution publishes in the admissions document when arranging candidates for a professional level, to determine the admission of candidates for different professional volunteers, such a scores are  professional level difference──
That is, the difference in scores between the first professional volunteer and non-first professional volunteer when the academy admits candidates, the difference in scores between the various professional volunteer levels, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example, the.
Suppose students take the exam at a high school, taking 560 points, and their professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, and a high school professional admission is a method of applying professional grade differences, with grade differences of 2, 1, 1, 1, 0 points.
At the time of the professional assignment, if the first volunteer of the first professional is eligible for professional admission and has a professional program balance, then he is admitted to the computer program; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be deducted from 2 points, based on the results of the 558 points and the first professional volunteer examination for international trade, to determine whether he meets the professional admission requirements; if he is still not, the score will be further reduced from 1 point to 557 points for the automatic admission of the third professional volunteer; if he is still not, the score will be further reduced from 1 point to 556 points for the admission of the fourth professional, and if the subsequent professional still does not meet his professional volunteer, the score will be further reduced, as such.
Different universities have different professional level differences.
With the spread of parallel volunteering, many universities have now eliminated professional scarcity, but this year some universities have retained this approach, according to the admissions charters published by each university, this year more than 20 universities have set professional scarcity.
For example, the Sichuan Agricultural University, the Shandong University of Technology, the Chinese Medical University of the Yellow River, the Jiangsu University of Technology, the Jiangsu Master University, the Chengdu Medical University, the Northeast Electric University, the Shandong University, the Nanjing Medical University, the Nanjing Industrial University, the Ningxia University, the Shandong University of Technology, the Chinese Civil Aviation Aviation School, and so on.
In these universities, the professional level of each university is very different.
Some universities have different grades in each profession, such as Ninisha University, the application has been submitted to the candidates of the university, and the candidates are admitted in the order of their graduation, minus 1 points, and then in the order of their graduation.
While some universities set different professional levels between different professions, different degrees vary.
For example, in the US, the total difference in the number of volunteers is four points, that is, three points between the first volunteer and other volunteers, and one point between the other volunteers and the moderators.
When filling out the volunteer application, applicants and parents must carefully read the admissions policy of the school, see if there is any professional difference, what the form of difference is, while fully considering the scores, and also rationally analyze the schools and professions selected, if the institution explicitly uses the scores difference method in the admissions document, students should pay attention to the gradient between the professions when choosing the professions, improve the chances of admission.
