The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a report on the 26th, pointing out that Iran has begun to use advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, further violating the nuclear agreement reached with world powers in 2015.
According to comprehensive foreign media reports, the IAEA report pointed out that advanced centrifuges at Iran's Natanz Nuclear Facility (Natanz Nuclear Facility) "are accumulating or are ready to accumulate enriched uranium".
Since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal last May and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran has been progressively violating the limits of the 2015 nuclear deal with major powers.
The agreement stipulates that Iran can only use the first generation of IR-1 centrifuges to refine uranium.
The other signatories to the deal, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to salvage the deal, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
According to Japan's Kyodo News Agency, on the afternoon of the 25th local time, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in New York, the United States, where he visited the United States, and confirmed that he would promote the conclusion of peace treaty negotiations including the territorial issues of the four northern islands (disputed islands between Japan and Russia, known as the "four northern islands" in Japan, and the "South Kuril Islands" in Russia), and develop relations between the two countries in a wide range of fields such as politics and economy.
This was Motegi's first consultation with Russia as head of negotiations on the conclusion of a peace treaty since he took office as foreign minister.
Motegi told the Russian side that he "would like to earnestly hold consultations, including the promotion of joint economic activities [on the four northern islands]."
According to the Japanese government, the talks did not include a detailed discussion of the territorial issue.
At the Japan-Russia summit meeting in December 2018, the foreign ministers of the two countries were confirmed to accelerate negotiations as the person in charge.
At the meeting, the foreign ministers of the two countries welcomed the progress made in the consultations on common economic activities in the fields of tourism and waste disposal.
Motegi expressed his expectation that the pilot tourism project will be launched in October, saying, "We hope that it will be a successful implementation and lead to the next step." ”
In addition, the talks confirmed Lavrov's visit to Japan in November in conjunction with the G20 foreign ministers' meeting in Nagoya.

The women's volleyball team is expected to defend the World Cup ahead of schedule!
On the 27th, in the game against the Dutch women's volleyball team, the Chinese team was pulled back by the opponent after winning two games in a row, and finally defeated the Netherlands 3:1, ushering in nine consecutive wins.
The World Cup schedule is coming to an end, and although the title defense is in sight, the Chinese women's volleyball team still cannot be taken lightly in the face of the Serbian team.
In the first two games of the game with the Netherlands, the Chinese women's volleyball team performed as strong as ever, winning 25:19 and 25:16 respectively, until the third game, when the team encountered a setback.
The Dutch women's volleyball team strengthened the aggressiveness of the serve when it was behind, and the Chinese team's pass was impacted, coupled with the girls' eagerness to attack, and the mistakes began to increase, and finally the opponent pulled back a city at 21:25.
After the game, Lang Ping also pointed out in an interview: "In the third game, we gave away about 8 points because of mistakes. ”
Of course, the strength of the Dutch women's volleyball team should not be underestimated, and the Chinese women's volleyball team was also prepared for difficulties before the game, although it lost a game, everything was still in Lang Ping's hands, "It is normal to win or lose games with strong teams, and it is normal to play five games, so we told the players to be focused," Lang Ping said.
In the fourth game, the players actively adjusted their state, and Zhang Changning was full of firepower on the offensive end, scoring 8 points in a single game, making a great contribution to the team's victory.
So far, there are only two rounds left in the 11 rounds of confrontation, although the Chinese women's volleyball team has touched the championship trophy with one hand, but it did sound the alarm for the Chinese women's volleyball team in the game against the Dutch team: the more critical the moment, the more we must go all out.
In another game on the 27th, the Russian and American women's volleyball teams played 5 games, and the United States team failed to take all three points from the opponent.
All kinds of situations are developing in favor of the Chinese women's volleyball team.
However, although the Serbian team is all absent from the six main players this time, it does not mean that they will easily give the three points to the Chinese team.
Judging from the current form of the standings, the Serbian team has basically missed the medal, which means that they can "travel light" in the game against the Chinese women's volleyball team, put down their burdens and go all out to impact the opponent, while the Chinese team is under pressure to win the championship, and the state may fluctuate.
In addition, the substitute Serbian team is not a lamb to be slaughtered, in the previous battle with the Netherlands, the two sides fought 5 rounds, and the Serbian second team finally reversed the Netherlands' all-main lineup 3:2, which shows the depth of its lineup.
Before the start of the third stage of the game, Lang Ping also said that the Dutch and Serbian teams are not easy to deal with: "The game in Osaka will be very difficult, and we still have to prepare carefully as always. ”
Now the horn of defending the title has sounded, and the game has truly entered the "white-hot stage".
In terms of strength and lineup, the Chinese women's volleyball team is above the opponent, but at the last critical juncture, it depends on whether the girls of the women's volleyball team can play at a normal level and release themselves on the field.

But times are changing, he said.
Stoltenberg said: "We are facing more and more competition.
So we should redouble our efforts now to be sure that no one will overtake us. ”

On September 24th, more than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to board the Star of Orange Island cruise ship to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Xiangjiang River and celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Most of the more than 100 people with disabilities who participated in the event were boarding the ship for the first time.
Zhao Zhengang, 56, is a disabled man who rarely goes out because of his limited movement on his feet.
He said: "Today, I took a cruise for the first time, and I was very excited and unforgettable to enjoy the magnificent waves of the Xiangjiang River up close and feel the pulse of Changsha's development. ”
Volunteers from the Changsha Fukang Social Work Service Center and the Blue Sky Rescue Team provided meticulous services to the disabled.
Especially for clients with severe physical disabilities, volunteers will carry them on their backs on board and on the cruise.
The relevant person in charge of Fukang Social Work Service Center said that in the past 70 years, with the support of the party and the government, the cause of the disabled in Changsha has continued to develop and progress, and more and more disabled people have truly become participants, contributors and enjoyers of social and economic development.
The 70th anniversary of the Republic is approaching, and the spotlight of the media is suddenly on, making many images that we usually don't remember very well, shining brightly – it is they who bring heat and light to our shining days...
However, if the hero walks around, it also seems to be as ordinary as you and me.
Yuan Longping, who devoted himself to rice research, bred good varieties and cultivated all over the world, so that more than one billion Chinese people no longer had the risk of hunger, and made great contributions. One pot, only one thing in his life, nibbling on cold steamed buns in the deep mountains of Guizhou, no different from the old man in the village; Zhou Ruchang, a red scholar, a village boy who is enlightened very late, still looks like a child when he is old, he has studied both Chinese and Western, with a messy white hair, and likes to laugh when he talks about learning; Qin Yi, a film artist who is popular with half the sky, is over 90 years old, and he still bumps six or seven hours a day on the plateau in order to rehearse the play, and is willing to play an unknown old maid in "The Legend of the Demon Cat"...
As long as they are immersed in the cause that outsiders do not understand and they cherish themselves, it is easy to be happy, and they do not care about fame, wealth and glory.
Just like in Jin Yong's novel, the sweeping monk in the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion of Shaolin Temple, although he has amazing martial arts, he is not dazzling, and there is no joy or sorrow.
Every "sweeping monk", every innocent heart, has a family and country responsibility behind it.
The responsibility of the family and the country is not only carried on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the palms of hundreds of millions of people.
Once, the words of a female middle school student were crazy by netizens, "When the hero passes by, someone must sit on the side of the road and applaud ... I don't want to be a hero, I want to be someone who sits on the side of the road and applauds. ”
In fact, there is no contradiction between being a hero and applauding a hero.
The people who applaud on the side of the road are also transmitting heat and light, and they are themselves luminous bodies.
Ordinary like you and me, there are always some opportunities in life, some moments, and there is a kind of accumulation over time, which is also shaping the appearance of heroes.
Zou Bihua, an outstanding judge in Shanghai, shoulders the heavy responsibility of judicial reform, but at the annual meeting, he let the master of the communication room come to the stage to tell his story, and sent and received countless newspapers and letters in a year, never making mistakes, "doing simple things well, but not simple", Zou Bihua led the judges to give applause to this "sweeping monk" style old send-and-cere.
It's a sympathy between heroes, one hero applauding another.
The sweeping monk has the Shaolin Temple Tibetan Scripture Pavilion, Yuan Longping has a vast rice experimental field, Nanrendong has the "Heavenly Eye", Qin Yi has a stage, Zhou Ruchang has a pulpit ... Whether you can be a hero or not depends not only on your own efforts, but also on a good environment and positive incentive mechanism.
For example, "China's Sky Eye", now it seems, is a myth.
In the 90s of the last century, China's scientific and technological circles were still struggling to climb, and novelist Liu Cixin had not yet started writing "The Three-Body Problem".
At that time, the most powerful "eye" was the single-sided aperture radio telescope in the valley of the island of Puerto Rico in the United States, Arecibo, with a diameter of 350 meters, which was considered to be the "unsurpassable" of the world's largest.
At that time, the diameter of China's radio telescopes was less than one-tenth of that of others.
However, Nan Rendong, who enjoys world-class scientific research conditions and salaries in Japan, insisted on returning to China and brought back an almost crazy idea: to build a new generation of radio "big telescopes" in China to receive more information from outer space!
China is in ruins, and investing huge sums of money is just to play with the stars?
The motherland trusts Nanrendong, and the "Sky Eye" project has been launched.
It took 12 years to select the site, and it took another 9 years from project approval to completion.
The 500-meter-diameter "eye in the sky" was opened, and China made a "large-scale scientific project that has no precedent to follow" and is unique in the world.
Therefore, the "Eye of the Sky" is remarkable, the Nanrendong are remarkable, and the Republic of China with a large tolerance and a lofty vision is remarkable.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, Nanrendong has the opportunity to become the soul of the country and the heart and soul of the people.
There are young talents and white-haired heroes walking by kindly, and there are people applauding softly on the roadside, such a country is very beautiful and harmonious.
Garbage classification education first entered Jilin kindergarten The concept of environmental protection starts from the baby
On the 27th, a kindergarten in Jilin City, Jilin Province carried out a garbage classification education class to teach children to distinguish recyclable garbage and other types of garbage.
It is reported that this is the first time that garbage classification has entered the local early childhood education classroom.
A few days ago, nine departments of Jilin Province jointly issued the "Jilin Province to promote the classification and treatment of prefecture-level urban solid waste work plan".
In 2019, on the basis of the pilot project of compulsory classification of domestic waste in Changchun, the province decided to carry out domestic waste classification in prefecture-level cities.
Jilin City is one of them.
We hope that through this activity, we can achieve the effect of children driving families and kindergartens driving society, and advocate the concept of environmental protection.
Liu Lijuan, executive director of Hi Fan International Kindergarten, who held the event, said.
On the same day, the director read out the environmental protection proposal, hoping that garbage classification would start from children.
After performing the dance of "Low Carbon Babe", the children were divided into groups to make a small game of garbage classification.
The instructor also handed out "recyclable" and "other garbage" labels, and suggested that the children stick the labels to the trash can and record a small video when they get home.
Liu Lijuan introduced that the kindergarten has been advocating the concept of low-carbon and green environmental protection, and regularly opens environmental protection lectures.
Sortable garbage bins are also set up at the garbage disposal area in the park, and the categories of garbage are marked on them.

According to preliminary statistics, Jilin Province generated about 5,465,200 tons of municipal solid waste in 2018, all of which went to domestic waste disposal sites for treatment.
Among them, 3,292,900 tons were spared landfills, 2,092,300 tons were incinerated, and 80,100 tons were treated by comprehensive utilization technology.
After years of efforts, all cities and counties in the province have the ability to treat domestic waste harmlessly.
In the "Jilin Province Work Plan for Promoting the Classification and Treatment of Prefecture-level Municipal Domestic Waste", it is clearly required to carry out in-depth activities such as garbage classification into campuses, teaching materials, and classrooms, and strengthen the interaction between students and parents through the creation of garbage classification songs, songs, comics, micro-videos and other works, so as to achieve the effect of "educating a child, influencing a family, driving a community, and cultivating a generation of new people".
According to Mazda's data released on September 27, global sales in August were 117,015 units.
Sales in China decreased by 21% due to the lack of new models and the reduction of price cuts.
Domestic sales fell by 6% and demand for the last train before the October consumption tax hike was limited.
Mazda sold 17,729 units in China in August.
In August 2018, sales volume decreased by 13% compared to the previous year.
Sales of the CX-4, the main SUV exclusively for China, decreased by 14% year-on-year.
It has been a long time since the CX-4 was launched in 2016, and the effectiveness of the new model has declined.
It is reported that the reduction of price reductions due to the strategy of increasing brand value from a long-term perspective has also had a significant impact on sales.
Mazda's sales in the U.S. increased by 7% y/y to 27,482 units, marking the first time in 14 months.
In August, sales of the CX-5 SUV increased due to the increase in sales of the CX-5 SUV due to the increase in sales of the CX-5 SUV due to the addition of one more business day than the previous year, as well as the "enhanced promotional activities" (Mazda).
Sales in Japan fell 6 % to 14,422 units.
The company said the pre-tax rush was "not as big as it was last (in 2014)".
Sales of compact cars such as the Demio decreased.
Chirac's death and his political legacy lives on
On the 26th local time, former French President Jacques Chirac died suddenly at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is undergoing major changes unseen in a century, the many political legacies left by this French politician when he was in power are still worthy of our praise.
Jacques Chirac served as president of France for 12 years in a charismatic manner.
He not only inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of Gaullistism, but also firmly supported European integration, and was a representative figure of pursuing the "European dream".
At the same time, he also vigorously advocated multipolarization and multilateralism in the world, and was a politician with strategic vision.
For this reason, the French press described him as "an outstanding representative of France on the world stage".
One of Chirac's most talked-about political decisions was to oppose the U.S.-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France and Germany withstood American pressure and were at the forefront of the anti-war effort.
A year after the war began, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to an increase in terror and make the world more dangerous.
Chirac's warning proved to be correct.
At a time when European integration is in turmoil and US unilateralism is becoming more and more prominent, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices on international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly of great enlightening significance.
Chirac is also a French politician who is familiar and familiar to Chinese.
He is one of the advocates and creators of the "golden decade" of Sino-French relations, and after being elected president of France for the first time in 1995, he has promoted the rapid development of Sino-French relations with the strategic vision of a statesman.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, marking a new stage in bilateral exchanges.
During Chirac's administration, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and breakthroughs were made in cooperation between the two countries in aviation, nuclear energy, railway transportation and other fields.
The Sino-French Year of Culture initiated by Jacques Chirac has created a new model of cultural exchange in the history of China and France.
Chirac's lifelong love of Chinese culture was particularly impressive.
According to Chinese diplomats who know him, Chirac can recite some poems of Li Bai and Du Fu, and can even accurately judge the historical age of Chinese bronzes.
"If you don't look at the pyramids, you won't really be to Egypt, and if you don't look at the Qin figurines, you'll not really be to China" -- this golden phrase comes from Jacques Chirac.
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency, Jacques Chirac said: "The West has concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems caused by China's economic growth, and China's international political position.
But I myself have full confidence in China.
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is sufficient to help it establish the concept and values of harmonious development and shoulder its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time. ”
I also believe that China's rejuvenation will bring new creative vitality to world culture and enrich world culture.
The Sri Lankan people are gone, but Chirac's legacy and revelations to the world will live on.

Pro-establishment members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) signed a joint petition against the US Hong Kong-related bill
Some pro-establishment members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region issued a joint statement on the 27th, expressing strong opposition to the passage of the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019" by the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States Congress.
The statement, co-signed by 40 pro-establishment legislators, said that Hong Kong currently enjoys the rights conferred by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, including maintaining the status of a free trade port and a separate customs territory, signing and implementing bilateral and multilateral agreements with different countries and regions around the world in the name of "Hong Kong, China" in various fields such as economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports.
These rights are not conferred by any foreign government or legislature.
All along, Hong Kong has strictly adhered to international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, conducted business with different countries and regions, and participated in co-operation in many related fields.
The statement said that the move by the Foreign Affairs Committees of the US Senate and House of Representatives to pass the relevant bill is not necessary, but is only in response to the call of its agents to bring disaster to Hong Kong and as a means of grossly interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs and gaining political bargaining chips for its agents in Hong Kong.
Pro-establishment lawmakers expressed deep regret and strong opposition to this move by the US Congress.
The statement pointed out that Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the largest source of trade surpluses.
Hong Kong's excellent rule of law, fair and free business environment, and clean society make it a good location for American businessmen to do business.
If the US Congress passes this bill, in addition to striking at Hong Kong and the interests of the United States itself, it will also make Sino-US relations worse, without any benefit and harming others and itself.
The statement said that Hong Kong will, as always, unswervingly implement the principle of "one country, two systems", continue to enjoy the rights conferred by the Basic Law, and earnestly fulfill its obligations.
In the past, present and future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and international commerce and trade.
According to a report by the European Times on the 26th, the two houses of the French parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week.
French President Emmanuel Macron recently claimed that France cannot "accept everyone", but at the same time it must strive to "properly accept".
According to the report, Macron is trying to find a compromise on immigration matters to slow the impact of the upcoming debate.
Recently, Macron said in an interview during the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, USA, that he hopes to have a real "two-pronged" approach to migration policy, finding a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
"If France wants to be able to accept [immigrants] properly, it cannot accept everyone", Macron said.
Macron outlined four priorities for migration policy: the granting of asylum status to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible, the more efficient integration of migrants, the reception and protection of all migrants entering French territory, and the more efficient resettlement of people who have entered France illegally and are not fit to stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the "National Medical Assistance" (AME) system has been the most discussed topic in the past.
Macron said he wanted to be able to "assess" the system, but not to eliminate it, but to limit it.
After Macron's remarks, Le Pen, the leader of the far-right "National Rassembled", tweeted that Macron's statement was "empty talk".
Senate President Raschel, a member of the right-wing Republican Party, also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a "moderate" but "realistic" way, indirectly criticizing Macron.
Leftist Socialist MP Valau believes that France should "accept more and better" on the issue of immigration, and criticizes Macron for "manipulating" the issue.
The report pointed out that the new version of the "Asylum and Immigration Law" has been enacted for a year, and it has led to differences of opinion within the ruling party, but at the same time it has not been able to appease the opposition parties on the right.
In the next 2022 election, the topic of migration policy will once again be the focus of attacks on the far right, and Macron will need to do something on this issue, but at the same time risk angering the left wing within the ruling party.
According to reports, the lower house of the French National Assembly will debate the immigration policy from September 30, and the Senate will debate it from October 2.
There are signs that China's A-shares are ushering in a "buyback wave", and many listed companies have taken out "real money" to buy back company shares.
According to the statistics of Oriental Wealth, a financial data service provider, as of the 27th, the total amount of repurchase of A-share listed companies in 2019 has exceeded 100 billion yuan (RMB, the same below), far exceeding the data of the same period in previous years and setting a record high in the amount of A-share share repurchase funds.
In this regard, Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Maikerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said that the overall valuation of the A-share market this year is low, and the repurchase of shares at a relatively low price is conducive to the improvement of the efficiency of the use of funds by listed companies, and also reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage market value and abundant cash flow, which is conducive to boosting investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the share repurchase system has also promoted the active development of share repurchase by listed companies.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued detailed implementation rules for listed companies to repurchase shares, providing detailed share repurchase norms and guidelines for listed companies.
According to media statistics, since the beginning of this year, the listed companies that have implemented the repurchase plan are mainly concentrated in the infrastructure industry, the real estate industry, the information technology industry and the electronic equipment manufacturing industry.
In addition, judging from the amount of repurchase payments, there are 6 listed companies with a repurchase amount of more than 1 billion yuan this year.
Among them, the first place is Yili shares, whose repurchase amount exceeds 5 billion yuan.
What is the impact on the market for listed companies to buy back shares?
Zhao Xijun, deputy dean of the School of Finance and Economics of Chinese University, said in an interview with a reporter from China News Agency that on the one hand, the buyback shows that the listed company has strong economic strength and a good financial situation, and has the ability to maintain the stability of the stock price and give investors confidence; on the other hand, it also shows that the listed company and its controlling shareholder are responsible for the company, the market and investors.
The former is based on the company's good operating performance, while the latter requires the listed company and its controlling shareholders to have high quality.
For the capital market, these are the core basic elements.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence and supporting the stock prices of listed companies.
In addition, according to the calculation of the research report of Orient Securities, according to the estimated number of stock repurchases set by A-share listed companies since the beginning of this year, as well as the average transaction price of repurchased shares, the incremental funds brought by the repurchase of shares to the A-share market this year are expected to exceed 150 billion yuan.
It took nearly two months to complete the restoration of the large-scale mural "Tianhou Holy Miracle Map" of Tianjin Tianhou Temple, a national key cultural preservation unit, on the 26th, and will be reopened to the public during this year's National Day.
"The Sacred Miracle of the Queen of Heaven" is a large-scale traditional mural that comprehensively reflects the life of Mazu.
With the approval of the relevant state departments, it was drawn by Cai Changkui, the former director of the Tianjin Folk Museum (Tianhou Temple), from 1991 to 1994.
It is understood that this mural is painted on the south and north palace walls of the main hall of Tianhou Temple, with a total length of 32 meters, a height of 2.6 meters, divided into two parts, with more than 30 stories such as the birth of the Queen of Heaven, crossing the sea by seat, and ascending to heaven by feather, 358 characters reproduce the life deeds of Mazu.
Cai Changkui said that in recent years, Tianjin has been rainy in summer and dry in winter, which has led to the cracking of the murals, which account for 60% of the entire mural area.
In order to protect and rescue the murals of Mazu's deeds, the Management Committee of Ancient Culture Street in Nankai District, Tianjin and Tianhou Temple launched the restoration project of the main hall of Tianhou Temple and the murals in the palace.
The restoration project was led by Cai Changkui and invited four famous Chinese painters to participate.
The restoration work is based on the principle of 'repairing the old as the old', and at the same time, some parts of the original mural have been adjusted, and the original imperfect parts of the mural have been supplemented and restored.
In the restoration, we have also made innovations and experiments in color, materials, pen and ink, etc.
After restoration, the style, spirituality, spirit and artistic style of the original mural have been maintained.
Tianhou Temple was built in 1326, formerly known as Tianfei Palace, commonly known as Niangniang Palace, after many reconstructions, it is the oldest building complex in Tianjin urban area, and it is also one of the earliest existing Mazu temples in China.
On September 25, the commissioning ceremony of Beijing Daxing International Airport was held.
The shape of the terminal building of Beijing Daxing International Airport means "phoenix spreading its wings" and is known as the first of the "Seven Wonders of the New World".
At present, Beijing Capital International Airport is already in a state of overload, carrying 100 million+ passengers last year, becoming the second airport in the world to handle more than 100 million passengers annually after Atlanta Airport in the United States.
It is estimated that by 2022, the passenger throughput of Beijing Daxing International Airport will reach 45 million, with international flights accounting for 20%; By 2025, passenger throughput will reach 72 million, and the proportion of international flights is expected to reach 30%.
As a "new country", how cool is it?
Beijing Daxing International Airport is located between Daxing District, Beijing and Guangyang District, Langfang City, Hebei Province, with a straight-line distance of 46 kilometers from Tiananmen Square, making it the world's largest new airport.
The roof of the terminal is covered with a steel projection area of 180,000 square meters, the size of 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is the first terminal in the world to have two arrivals and two departures levels – F1-F4 for international arrivals, domestic arrivals, domestic departures, and international departures.
The double-decker bridge connecting the expressway and the airport outside the terminal corresponds to the F3 and F4 of the terminal building respectively - the upper floor of the international departure and the two floors of the domestic departure.
The maiden flight of Beijing Daxing International Airport ushered in the era of Beijing's "dual airports".
Up to now, a total of 66 airlines are interested in entering Beijing Daxing International Airport, including 20 domestic airlines, 46 Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan and foreign airlines, and the flight schedules of various airlines have been approved.
In the 2019 winter and spring season, Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, including 101 domestic routes and 15 international routes, covering 112 destinations around the world, including 97 domestic destinations and 15 international destinations.
This forms a "dual-hub" airport pattern with coordinated development, moderate competition and world-class competitiveness with Beijing Capital International Airport, which not only alleviates the operational pressure of the capital airport's saturated capacity, but also better meets the urgent needs of the rapid growth of air transport in Beijing and surrounding areas, and effectively enhances the international competitiveness of China's civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daxing International Airport fully considers the relationship between geographical location, airport and surrounding airspace and operating environment, and the airport runway adopts an "omnidirectional" layout for the first time in China, adopts the world's largest air traffic control automation system, and establishes China's largest terminal control area, which can maximize the efficiency of aviation operations.
For the first time in China, an airport of this size has adopted a localized automatic baggage handling and information management system, and adopted an innovative baggage transmission mode to improve the efficiency of the baggage system.
The maiden flight of Beijing Daxing International Airport indicates that the phoenix spreads its wings and takes off coolly.
The new airport, which has created more than 40 international and domestic firsts and has a localization rate of more than 98%, will have a direct and indirect economic impact on the industries in the surrounding areas and inject vitality into Beijing's economic development.
MCA is tentatively scheduled to hold a congress in November to reduce the age of joining the party to 16 years old
MCA is tentatively scheduled to hold a central congress in early November, and plans to revise the party constitution and lower the age of joining the party to 16 years old.
With the approval of the National Assembly to lower the voting age in the general election, MCA announced that the 66th Central Congress to be held this year will put forward proposals to amend the party constitution, including lowering the age of MCA to join the party from the current 18 to 16 years old.
MCA president Datuk Seri Wee Ka Siong said that the MCA Central Committee was originally scheduled to hold the Central Congress on November 2 and 3 this year, but due to the by-election for the Tanjung Piai parliamentary seat, the date of the congress may be changed.
He said that since the Election Committee will only meet on October 1 to finalize the nomination date and polling day for the Tanjung Piai national seat, they will meet the next day, October 2, to discuss whether to change the date of this year's Central Congress.
He also explained that the purpose of the Central Committee meeting yesterday (26th) was to finalize the date of the congress and amend the party constitution, but it just happened that the Bumiputera Solidarity Party Tanjung Piai MP Datuk Mohd Fali passed away due to illness, so he joined the agenda of the by-election for this national seat.
Wang Boxiang, former secretary of the Shouguang County Party Committee of Shandong Province - Qiang County Rich People Pure Heart-Xinhuanet
Wang Boxiang, a native of Shouguang, Shandong, was born in February 1943, joined the work in 1967, and successively served as secretary of the township party committee, secretary of the county party committee, mayor and other positions.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang served as the secretary of the Shouguang County Party Committee in Shandong Province, which was a poor county in Weifang at that time.
During the five years of Shouguang's tenure, Wang Boxiang had the heart of serving the people and concentrated on three things: one was to promote the industrialization of vegetables, the second was to develop the saline-alkali beach in Shoubei, and the third was to lay the foundation for the industrial turnaround, so that Shouguang people would bulge their pockets and waists.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables, and they have also learned the lesson of growing vegetables.
In the early 80s of the last century, Shouguang farmers planted a bumper harvest of vegetables but could not sell them, and they rotted in the ground.
Wang Boxiang's investigation found that the key to grasping vegetables is to do a good job in circulation.
Shouguang took the lead in building a vegetable wholesale market, which opened the prelude to the development of market economy.
Party members and cadres must take the lead, mess up, and bear all the losses in the county.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Boxiang, 17 party members including Wang Leyi of Sanyuan Zhu Village set up 17 winter warming vegetable greenhouses, and 17 "double 10,000 households" emerged in the village that year.
Subsequently, the county set up a promotion group, under the mobilization of Wang Boxiang, Wang Leyi toured and guided in various towns and towns, and promoted more than 5,000 vegetable greenhouses in the first year, and then the vegetable greenhouses were promoted to the whole county and even the whole country like a prairie fire.
For thousands of years, 1.6 million acres of land in Shoubei have been shallow tidal flats in addition to saline-alkali flats.
Life is very difficult for the local people.
Shounan has a vegetable greenhouse, what to do in Shoubei?
Wang Boxiang organized more than 100,000 people to engage in a general battle, and set up camp on the barren alkali beach, which lasted forty or fifty days.
Wang Boxiang and the leading cadres in the county eat and live on the construction site, pushing carts and carrying burdens like migrant workers, eating and sleeping in the open, and the people all stretch their thumbs when they see them, and admire them in their hearts... At that time, Shoubei developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt pans, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and developed a "cornucopia" on the saline-alkali tidal flats.
In July 1986, Wang Boxiang participated in the Weifang Industrial Conference for the first time as the secretary of the county party committee.
During the meeting, a "comparison table of industrial economic figures in the twelve counties and urban areas of Weifang City" was issued, and at first glance, the total industrial output value, Shouguang was not bad, ranking fourth.
But if the raw salt is removed, Shouguang's pure industrial output value is only 119 million yuan, ranking third from the bottom.
Wang Boxiang led a group of more than 70 people to "change their brains" in other places.
In less than a year, the county invested 150 million yuan and launched 77 projects.
Since then, it has organized "scripture learning groups" every year to go to Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai to learn from them.
Shouguang lacks enterprises, and even more entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang presided over a special meeting to make a decision: in the county's open selection of factory directors and managers, 40 "enterprising talents" stood out and were pushed to the front line of industry.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the top 100 counties in the country, and Wang Boxiang was transferred to the deputy mayor of Weifang City.
What he left behind was more than 200,000 vegetable greenhouses, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt pans, and shrimp ponds, 4,854 enterprises, and more than 100,000 "10,000 households", and a cadre team recognized by the people. The people of Shouguang still affectionately call him "our secretary of Boxiang".
On September 26, local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presided over the Foreign Ministers' Meeting of China and African Security Council members at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
Present at the meeting were Foreign Minister Tano of Côte d'Ivoire, Foreign Minister Oyono of Equatorial Guinea, Foreign Minister Pandor of South Africa, Foreign Minister Carra, and Foreign Minister Geshinawi of Tunisia, who are currently members of the Security Council.
Wang Yi put forward a four-point proposal on strengthening cooperation between China and Africa in the Security Council.
First, we need to unite to build strength.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, the direct consequence of which is that the basic norms governing international relations have been challenged, the role of the United Nations has been impacted, and the interests of the vast number of developing countries, including African countries, and small and medium-sized countries have been undermined.
To meet this challenge, China and Africa need to join hands and stand shoulder to shoulder.
In the Security Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, and the weight of the focus is not just three votes, but the entire African continent.
If China and Africa stand together, it will not just have four votes, but will lead other countries to follow suit, influence and shape the agenda of the Security Council.
Since 2018, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council, and we should make full use of this coordination mechanism.
Second, resolve disputes through negotiation.
China has always advocated the political settlement of hotspot issues, and Africa has a good tradition of consultation and the experience of successful mediation by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex issues on the Council's agenda, particularly the African hotspots, are mostly the bane of colonialism, while others are directly related to external factors.
We should make good use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and give full play to the role of the United Nations in mediation and mediation.
Third, we need to seek self-improvement through self-reliance.
African countries and peoples know best about Africa's problems, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
When dealing with Africa's hotspot issues, the Security Council should focus on listening to and respecting Africa's wishes, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is ready to strengthen coordination with Africa and firmly promote the capacity-building of Africa's independent peace operations.
Fourth, we need to rely on development to address the fundamentals.
China and the vast number of African countries are developing countries, and we should persist in putting economic and social development first and support each other in the development path they have chosen.
China is ready to closely align the Belt and Road Initiative with the African Union's Agenda 2063, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the development strategies of African countries, so as to help African countries enhance their development capacity and eliminate the root causes of conflict.
Together, we need to push the United Nations to increase its investment in Africa's development.
With the resurgence of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), China has made and will continue to provide all-out assistance, providing manpower and material assistance to the best of its ability, and is ready to coordinate actions with African countries, mobilize the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO) to increase assistance, and give full play to the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MINUSTRIA).
The neonatal department and other relays to save the lives of the little ones.
Thrilling!
The mother of the second child had an early seizure, and on the way to the hospital in a hurry, a 32-week premature baby was born in the passenger seat of the father's car.

After 9:30 a.m., Ms. Cheng packed up and asked her husband to drive from Xu Dong's home to the hospital.
Unexpectedly, not long after the car drove out of the house, the baby couldn't wait to be born in the passenger seat of his father's car.
Twenty minutes later, Ms. Cheng and her baby finally arrived at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Building of Hubei Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital.
When the hospital security saw the panicked couple and the baby, they immediately notified the obstetric delivery room, and the deputy chief physician Zhang Huan and other 4 doctors and midwife Liu Yanyan rushed downstairs with the delivery bag and umbilical cord coil.
At that time, the mother was half-lying in the passenger seat of the car, with amniotic fluid and blood under her, and a baby boy was next to her, with an umbilical cord attached. ”
Zhang Huan inquired and learned that the baby was a 32-week premature baby, and the parents did not have time to cover the child on the way.
Liu Yanyan hurried to the co-pilot to treat the baby's umbilical cord, Zhang Huan got into the cab, quickly opened the birth bag, wrapped the child with several layers of warmth with the treatment towel and the cloth of the delivery bag, and cleaned the respiratory tract for the newborn (as shown in the picture), and then carried the baby up to the neonatal department on the 12th floor.
After learning the news, the neonatal doctors immediately rushed to the nurses' station to rescue the premature baby on the spot.
At that time, the baby's face was purple, there was suffocation and lack of oxygen, the doctor immediately intubated him, and in less than a minute, the baby's heartbeat was restored, and the skin color gradually returned to ruddy, and the recovery was successful.
After being admitted to the hospital, the 32-week-old baby was put on an invasive ventilator, and after continuous rescue, his breathing was stable, and he was successfully weaned the next day.
After a week of treatment, the baby's vital signs are stable, his breathing is smooth, and he has begun to feed a small amount.
Coincidentally, on the 19th, 20th, and 21st, the obstetrics and neonatology departments of the hospital received three premature babies born on the road for three consecutive days, and the other two were born in the 120 ambulance, both of which were premature babies at 29 weeks, and are currently being actively treated in the neonatal department.
Sun Guoqiang, director of the obstetrics department of the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital, said that in recent years, the provincial maternal and child children have received many babies born on the subway and in private cars, and this situation may threaten the life safety of mothers and children if they are not handled well.
Director Sun reminded that once pregnant mothers have abdominal pain, broken water, redness and other phenomena, they should come to the hospital immediately.
In case of delivery at home or on the road, the mother should try to lie flat as much as possible, and put a blanket under the buttocks to prevent the baby's head from hitting the ground after delivery, and the child should be kept warm immediately after delivery, and sent to the nearest hospital as soon as possible.

Although this rule will only be piloted in the NBA Development League for the new season, fans are more concerned about what the impact of the rule will be on current players if it is implemented in the NBA.
At present, many people believe that the new rules may be beneficial to the "bearded" Harden, and James, who is relatively not so good at free throws, is going to "suffer".
Wuhan promotes the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises and gives a subsidy of up to 20 million yuan
On the 27th, the reporter learned from the Wuhan Municipal Government Information Office held a series of press conferences on the "Praise New China and Welcome the Military Games" that since the beginning of this year, the city has accelerated the promotion of industrial intelligent transformation and implemented transformation subsidy measures of up to 20 million yuan.
Up to now, more than 800 industrial enterprises above designated size have been collected to meet the needs of intelligent transformation.
Zhang Hong, deputy director of the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Economy and Information Technology, introduced that since this year, Wuhan has launched an action plan for the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises, providing free consultation and diagnosis services and proposing solutions for industrial enterprises above designated size in demand, and comprehensively promoting a new round of technological transformation of high-level enterprises.
According to the plan, Wuhan openly selects a number of professional diagnostic service institutions every year to carry out a census of the demand for intelligent transformation for all industrial enterprises above designated size in the city through the opening of special columns, questionnaire surveys, door-to-door filling and other forms.
Up to now, more than 800 industrial enterprises above designated size have been collected to meet the needs of intelligent transformation, accounting for nearly one-third of the number of industrial enterprises above designated size in the city.
Five municipal-level diagnostic platforms have organized teams to settle in enterprises in batches to carry out "one-to-one" on-site evaluation and program demonstration.
Zhang Hong introduced that at present, the city is organizing the implementation of 373 intelligent transformation projects, with a total planned investment of 29.76 billion yuan, Hongxin Communication's first 5G intelligent production line in central China, Motorola's national leading intelligent mobile phone production line, Wuhan Siemens transformer digital unmanned factory, the country's first batch satellite production line of aerospace science and industry, Huisheng Biology's world-leading new veterinary drug intelligent production line, Oubang smart home Internet of Things intelligent production line and a number of industry-leading intelligent workshops and smart factories have been started construction.
In addition, Wuhan has also increased financial support for intelligent transformation projects.
Among them, including the implementation of intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises, according to their actual completion of investment, including equipment hardware investment, research and development soft investment, to give 8%, up to 20 million yuan of transformation subsidies.
At the same time, it actively cooperates with financial institutions such as Bank of Communications and Wuhan Branch of Zhejiang Commercial Bank to provide personalized financial services for the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises and vigorously alleviate the financing pressure of enterprises.
Trudeau's "personality collapsed", can he be successfully re-elected
The "big hole" that tripped Trudeau out of his heels this time was dug by Trudeau himself little by little.
Recently, Canadian media have exposed a number of old photos of the current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which Trudeau dresses himself as a black person.
This was considered a clear act of racial discrimination and immediately caused an uproar in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
Canadians, however, aren't buying it.
Trudeau shot himself in the foot.
As political commentator Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the "anti-blackface movement" in the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been loudly accusing opposition parties or dissidents within their own party of "making big mistakes" in this regard, and have repeatedly threatened that "whoever makes this mistake should be expelled immediately".
To put it simply, the "big hole" that tripped Trudeau out of his heels this time was dug by Trudeau himself little by little.
Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, is young and handsome, and there was a whirlwind of "political idols" when he first debuted.
Originally a "political amateur", after taking over as the leader of the Federal Liberal Party, he fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the 2015 Canadian federal legislative election - the Federal Liberal Party won a majority of seats in the Federal House of Commons and won the precious right to form a separate government.
At that time, Trudeau put forward many deafening political platforms and ideas, such as "ethnic and gender equality", "ecological and environmental protection", "economic revitalization", and emphasized the elimination of corruption and "unhealthy practices".
However, in the five years since he was in power, he has been anticlimactic in almost all of the above-mentioned aspects, "driving high and going low".
Aside from the issue of "ethnicity and gender equality", he has "paid lip service" to a series of Aboriginal issues that led to the removal of protest tents to the gates of Parliament Hill on the 150th anniversary of Canada's founding.
In terms of eradicating corruption, at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, Trudeau was involved in the boiling "Lavalin incident".
It was revealed that he had exerted pressure on the departments and officials responsible for the investigation and punishment of the major violation of favoritism and fraud in the case of the construction engineering company "Lan Wanling" in his hometown, asking the latter to "raise his noble hand".
Moreover, after the incident became serious, Trudeau became angry with the official who disclosed the fraud case - Wang Zhoudi, mentioned above, was the first to disclose the fraud case and directly handled the case at the time.
Although the case itself is still suspicious, its suspicion is difficult to clear.
Many observers have pointed out that the collapse of Trudeau's personality in the five years of his administration is mainly caused by his own "digging pits", and the biggest "pitfalls" are none other than "anticlimactic", "self-reaping the consequences", and "being lenient with oneself and strict with others".
Canada's most authoritative Angus-Raide poll data shows that since 2015, the number of respondents who support Trudeau has slipped from more than 60% to more than 30%, while the number of opponents has soared from less than 30% to more than 60%.
While the other opposition parties and their leaders have also performed poorly, even a significant number of voters who still vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now unimpressed by the figure of the Federal Chancellor and leader of the ruling party.
On October 21, the new Canadian federal legislative election is about to begin, can Trudeau repeat the drama that won five years ago?
The answer may be in one word: difficult.
Whether it is from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or from the level of regional aviation integration and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration, it has far-reaching influence and positive significance.
On September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially opened.
The Beijing News reporter learned from the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission that the capital airport has been in a state of super-saturated operation, and the opening of Daxing International Airport will enhance the service capacity of the capital air.
After Shanghai, Beijing has become the second city in China to have two airports in the same city, similar to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, which mainly serves domestic aviation affairs, and Pudong Airport, which mainly serves international shipping and aviation, and the capital airport and Daxing Airport will also provide more subdivided services in the future to serve the differentiated positioning of different domestic and international aviation businesses.
The opening of Daxing Airport, from the perspective of business development, is more of a positive impact on the capital airport.
In 2018, the passenger throughput of Capital Airport exceeded 100 million, ranking first in the country, but compared with the rapid growth of business demand, there is still a significant capacity gap, especially the demand for international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passengers for tourism and business trips, and to adapt to the development trend of Beijing's increasingly open and international city, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large-scale international hub airport, and plans to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million person-times and cargo and mail throughput of 4 million tons in the future.
Therefore, the positioning of the two airports does not overlap, and they are aimed at different customer groups, and they also have enough market space.
From the perspective of economic accounts, the opening of Daxing International Airport will obviously form a win-win effect, alleviate the tight situation of Beijing's air capacity, accelerate the growth rate of passenger and cargo throughput, and create an incremental cake for the dual-core operation of Capital Airlines.
From the user's point of view, with the opening of Daxing International Airport, the future does not have to focus on the capital airport travel, but also can reduce a series of problems caused by the excessive concentration of routes, such as the extension of the transit guarantee time, the slower boarding speed of passengers, indirectly increase the time of aircraft and passengers in the airport, intensify the burden of airport operation, and reduce the burden of shipping at the capital airport, in fact, it also improves the travel experience of passengers.
According to the media's estimation of the time and cost of various transportation routes to large international airports, such as starting from the South Fifth Ring Road and taking the Beijing-Kaifeng Expressway directly on the Daxing Airport Expressway, you can get there in 50 minutes by car, the fuel money is about 40 yuan and the high-speed fee is 15 yuan; and the Daxing Airport Line of the rail transit subway is limited to 20 kilometers and 30 kilometers according to the distance, and the fare is divided into three grades: 10 yuan, 25 yuan, and 35 yuan; the public can also take the Beijing-Xiongxiong intercity, and it only takes more than 20 minutes from Beijing West Railway Station to Daxing Airport Station.
In general, citizens have a variety of transportation options to go to Daxing Airport, and the cost and time are also within a relatively reasonable range.
From the perspective of trend development: Daxing Airport is positioned as a Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei transportation hub, so it is a little far away from Beijing's urban area, but it strengthens the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, facilitates more people to travel, and is of great significance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, passengers in Hebei and Tianjin will be able to enjoy more international air services provided by Daxing International Airport, which can be seen from the transportation planning of Daxing Airport.
In addition to the new airport line that directly connects Daxing Airport from downtown Beijing, there are also a number of expressways connecting Daxing Airport and the surrounding areas.
Just as passengers in cities such as Dongguan, Foshan and Qingyuan in Guangdong can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport through Guangzhou-Foshan, Guangzhou-Shenzhen and other expressways, residents in Langfang and Xiong'an New Area around Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport and obtain convenient and efficient aviation services.
It can be seen that the opening of Daxing International Airport is not just the addition of a few runways and a few aircraft, whether it is from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or from the integration of regional aviation. The integration of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development has far-reaching impact and positive significance, which is not only related to the long-term layout and development of Beijing's shipping industry, but also provides diversified choices for the majority of residents in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, and promotes the further improvement of the service quality of Beijing's shipping industry, which is more conducive to promoting the integrated development process of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and stimulating the economic and trade development of the surrounding areas of Daxing Airport.
Therefore, for the opening of Daxing Airport, we should not only calculate the small account of the individual in the economy, but also calculate the big account of the overall development.

The 2019 Vietnam Forum on Economic and Social Issues was held in Thua Thien-Hue province
Nguyen Duc Kyen, deputy director of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, revealed that at the beginning of this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new improvements and continued to maintain a growth trend.
The forum focused on the outstanding economic and social issues in the first few months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development at the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the forum, the participants had an in-depth exchange of views on four themes, including the economic development in 2019 and the impact of some free trade agreements, some outstanding problems of Vietnam's economy in 2019, outstanding problems in Vietnam's social culture in 2019, and forecasts and suggestions for Vietnam's economic and social development in 2020.
Delegates generally agreed that the first months of 2019 were marked by a slowdown in global economic growth and increased risks and challenges.
Trade frictions between major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has determined that despite the uncertainty of the global economy, in which 70% of the world's economies have fallen into a state of stagnation, Vietnam's economic development has still made many gratifying achievements, with the stable operation of the macroeconomy and the effective control of inflation, with the consumer price index growing by an average of 2.64% in the first half of 2019, the lowest growth rate in nearly three years.
GDP growth in the first half of 2019 was 6.76%, which was lower than the 7.05% growth in the same period last year, but still a high level compared to the level of the same period in the 2011-2017 period.
When making a forecast for Vietnam's economic development trend in 2019-2020, Deputy Director of Vietnam's National Economic and Social Forecasting Center Dang Duc Anh said that Vietnam's economy showed a high growth momentum in 2019 against the backdrop of world economic turmoil.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macro economy will continue to remain basically stable, the implementation of various free trade agreements will boost trade development, economic restructuring and business environment improvement work will be further strengthened, due to the impact of trade frictions, Vietnam's export activities will show a downward trend.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring, forecasting and early warning mechanism, take the initiative to find trade remedy measures for Vietnam's export commodities, and look for opportunities to expand new export markets, so as to create convenience for the export of various commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, the inflation rate should be kept at a reasonable level, so as to promote the development of auxiliary industries and support the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture, and ecological agriculture.
Liu Zhijie, Director of the Consular Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia in Siem Reap, held a reception in Siem Reap on the 26th to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Liu Zhijie said that since the founding of the People's Republic of China 70 years ago, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributed more Chinese wisdom and solutions to improve global economic governance and promote global common development, made important contributions to world peace and development, and brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and people's livelihood and well-being.
Liu Zhijie said that as the world's second largest economy, China contributes more than 30% to world economic growth, especially China's "Belt and Road" initiative, and the cooperation between China's local provinces and cities and Siem Reap and its consular districts has been deepening.
He said: This year marks the beginning of the 61st anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia, and the two countries have fraternal friendship, and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Cambodia will become the driving force for local economic and social development.
Siem Reap Governor Di Saiha highly praised the great achievements made by New China over the past 70 years and congratulated China on the achievements of friendly cooperation between China and Cambodia.
Disaiha hopes that the two sides will continue to work together to promote China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit, and continuously improve people's living standards.

Witness the 10 years of digital China's "cloud rise" in Yunqi Town - Xinhuanet
If we take the 2009 local website forum as the starting point, the 2019 Apsara Conference held in Hangzhou from 25 to 27 has gone through a full decade.
From the concept of "foggy in the clouds" to the practice of "going to the cloud", big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies supporting China's economic development, social management and public services in the past 10 years.
In the photovoltaic cell workshop of Chint New Energy in Haining, Zhejiang, there has recently been a new "colleague" loaded with Alibaba Cloud artificial intelligence next to the quality inspector.
It is 24 hours a day, the recognition speed is more than twice that of manual work, and the accuracy of quality inspection is stable at more than 95%.
According to the person in charge of the company, the "quality inspector" with a camera has concentrated on learning more than 40,000 defective samples, and with the cloud computing power behind it, it can quickly convert infrared images into binary languages and classify and place defective cells.
This company is just one microcosm of today's cloud-enabled manufacturing transformation.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the "Implementation Guide for Promoting Enterprise Cloud Migration (2018-2020)", proposing that by 2020, efforts will be made to significantly improve the awareness and enthusiasm of enterprises to go to the cloud, and the proportion and application depth of cloud migration will be significantly improved.
Wang Jian, founder of Alibaba Cloud, said that today, data-centric cloud computing has built a bridge and opened the way for a digital economy in which data is the key element.
At the same time, in the past 10 years, the scale of China's cloud computing industry has also been expanding.
According to the White Paper on Cloud Computing Development (2019) released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology in July this year, the overall market size of cloud computing in China reached 96.28 billion yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2% over 2017.
In addition to becoming a key technology to support industrial transformation and the development of the digital economy, the invisible and intangible "cloud" has also unconsciously changed urban management and social life.
At this year's Apsara Conference, the "City Brain", which has been unveiled for three consecutive years, is still attracting attention.
According to Alibaba Cloud, the city brain has become the center of urban management from a traffic management tool, and related cooperative applications have been expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, and powerful computing power, the city brain can realize new urban management service functions such as "park first and pay later", "real-time perception of the number of patients" and "tourism route design".
In the field of government services, cloud computing has brought convenience to both ends of the supply of government services.
At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform for the whole province through government affairs on the cloud.
As of September 11, the platform has covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province, and collected and governed 19.08 billion pieces of data in 3,066 categories.
The average monthly data call and share between government departments in Zhejiang Province has reached 12 million times, and every time the data is called and flowed on the 'cloud', it may mean that the masses have less errands.
Be cautious of using plastic tea bags to make tea!
According to the "Central News Agency", recently, a new study in Canada found that a pack of plastic tea bags may release billions, or even tens of billions of microplastics, significantly higher than the amount of microplastics a person is estimated to ingest throughout the year, but so far there is no evidence that ingesting microplastics poses a threat to humans.
According to reports, researchers at Magill University in Canada have found that dipping a plastic tea bag into a cup of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius) releases about 11.6 billion microplastics and 3.1 billion smaller nanomicroplastics into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than the amount of microplastics a person is estimated to ingest throughout the year.
According to a study published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 microplastics per year and inhales the same amount of microplastics at the same time.
It is reported that the study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, and the researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montreal stores and cafes, opened the tea bags, washed the tea bags and immersed them in almost boiling water for 5 minutes, and then analyzed them with an electron microscope and spectrometer.
According to the study, they found that more than 11.6 billion microplastics were released from a single tea bag, which was "several orders higher than the previous plastic load of other foods".
According to the report, most tea bags are made of natural fibers, but many brands that use natural fibers to make tea bags still use plastic to seal them.
Some brands of tea bags have moved away from paper and have switched to plastic, which the researchers tested.
Microplastics are tiny fragments of plastic that researchers define to be between 100 nanometers and 5 millimeters in size and are mainly produced by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of microplastics in the air, soil, rivers and deepest ocean trenches around the world, as well as in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
In October 2018, researchers first found microplastics in human fecal samples from several countries in different regions of the world.
To test the potential toxicity of microplastics released from tea bags, the Canadian team put Daphnia in contaminated water and found that microplastics affect the behavior of these Daphnia and cause them to develop malformations.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that ingestion of microplastics poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO notes that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and what the impact is on humans.
The researchers speculate that the reason for the release of large amounts of microplastics in these tea bags may be that these plastic tea bags come into contact with boiling water, which can decompose or leach toxic substances even when the "food grade" plastic is heated above 40 degrees Celsius.
Guterres said the climate emergency is the biggest threat to the survival of small island states.
There, a natural disaster can erode the development gains of a generation.
This is illustrated by the hurricane-scarred events of Barbuda, Dominica and the Bahamas this year.
About a quarter of people in small island developing States live at an altitude of 5 metres or less.
Relocation can have serious social and lifestyle implications, and even raise questions of sovereignty and national identity.
At this Monday's Climate Action Summit, small island states are once again leading the way in the right direction by their shared commitment to achieve carbon neutrality and 100% renewable energy by 2030.
Guterres said: "The climate crisis is piling new injustices on top of old ones.
Although small island developing States contribute little to global warming, they pay the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many are also trapped in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must act, and now is the time to make big decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States. ”
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risk, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and transition to renewable energy, and urge international agencies to help small island developing States, particularly heavily indebted middle-income countries, access finance.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the lifeblood of the planet – the oceans.
The latest special report released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans are already suffering the "sweeping in" consequences of the climate crisis.
By mid-century, many regions are likely to experience some of the most extreme sea-level rises that would otherwise occur once in a century each year.
The report warns that some island nations are likely to become uninhabitable without significant investment in adaptation.
Pollution, overfishing, and acidification have taken their toll.
In the last 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, and plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the last 40 years.
Demands from industry, shipping, mining and tourism are leading to dwindling resources, including the maintenance of fishing grounds for many island communities.
Small island states also face high costs for transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on a number of external markets, making them subject to price fluctuations.
Some States are also grappling with the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons, arms and drugs.
Guterres said: "By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, that problem can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples that the world can learn from. ”
He stressed that small island developing States were a special case of sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
India's finance ministry said the financial system was fully liquid.
Indian Finance Minister Sitharaman said on the 26th that the current financial system has sufficient liquidity, and India's economic growth is expected to recover in the second half of this fiscal year, driven by holiday consumer demand.
Sitharaman made the remarks after a meeting with representatives of private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks and other institutions in India.
Sitharaman did not say what the remarks were about.
Previously, some Indian and overseas media blamed the continued economic slowdown in India on the liquidity constraints of non-bank financial institutions.
Sitharaman cited the decline in car sales as an example, dismissing that liquidity constraints were the main reason for the decline.
Sitharaman pointed out that the decline in car sales was mainly due to cyclical factors.
Sitharaman expects India's economic growth to likely recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday spending.
India's annual shopping season starts in September and lasts until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping consumption will greatly contribute to India's economic growth.
The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education recently issued a notice to strictly prohibit primary and secondary schools in the province from making up classes in violation of regulations during the National Day holiday, and will organize personnel to conduct random inspections and secret visits.
In the "Notice on Strictly Prohibiting Illegal Make-up Classes during the National Day Holiday", the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education stressed that primary and secondary schools in all localities should resolutely do so during the National Day period: they must not organize students to make up classes or take new classes collectively, and they are not allowed to hold subject training classes, specialty classes, Olympiad classes, interest classes, improvement classes, etc., and they are not allowed to rent out campuses and school buildings to other educational institutions to hold various training courses.
At the same time, it is strictly forbidden for in-service primary and secondary school teachers to organize, recommend, or induce students to participate in illegal make-up classes inside and outside the school, and it is strictly forbidden for in-service primary and secondary school teachers to participate in off-campus training institutions or illegal make-up classes organized by other teachers, parents, parents' committees, and so forth, and it is strictly prohibited for in-service primary and secondary school teachers to introduce students to off-campus training institutions and others and provide relevant information.
The notice makes it clear that for the verified illegal make-up classes of primary and secondary schools, the local education administrative department will be deducted points in the high-quality development education assessment of the county-level government in that year, and the teachers who participate in the illegal make-up classes will be seriously dealt with in accordance with the relevant provisions of teacher ethics and teacher style.
Support pig production and ensure market supply
Sui Zhongzhong demanded that the implementation of various measures be grasped in six aspects
The province's video and telephone conference on promoting pig production and ensuring market supply was held today to mobilize and redeploy the policies and measures of the central and provincial party committees and provincial governments on supporting pig production and ensuring market supply.
Sui Zhongzhong demanded that the implementation of various measures for pig production should be carried out from six aspects.
Do a good job in the implementation of the "vegetable basket" mayor responsibility system, and this year's province's clear 45 million pig slaughter tasks have been decomposed into cities and prefectures and included in the responsibility system assessment.
We should do a good job in the implementation of various policies and measures, and effectively solve the "last mile" problem of policy implementation.
Do a good job in the implementation of the production of fertile sows, conscientiously implement the subsidy policy for breeding sows, encourage breeding enterprises to expand the scale of breeding pigs, and select and retain excellent sows from commercial pig groups in a planned manner.
Do a good job in the implementation of investment promotion, and take the well-known domestic large-scale breeding enterprises that have not yet entered our province as the top priority of investment promotion.
Do a good job in the implementation of the market circulation system, speed up the construction of pig cold chain logistics facilities, and comprehensively promote the transformation from "pig adjustment" to "meat adjustment".
To do a good job in the implementation of the modern epidemic prevention system, all localities should be equipped with grassroots epidemic prevention and quarantine personnel suitable for the scale and work tasks of breeding, and build the first line of defense for epidemic prevention and control.
Sui Zhongzhong demanded that every effort be made to ensure the supply of meat in the market, to ensure that there will be no large-scale shortages and large-scale supply interruptions, and to ensure the stable supply of pork in the pork market during major holidays.
The meeting also made arrangements for continuing to do a good job in the prevention and control of African swine fever epidemic, banning fishing and returning fishing in important waters of the Yangtze River basin in our province, and purchasing medium and late rice in the province.
Representatives of time-honored brands in Shanghai, such as White Rabbit, who talked about the love of the motherland and the soul of the nation, gave party classes to college students

Shinzo Abe recorded a video to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and also spoke a word in Chinese
On the 26th local time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe congratulated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China through video.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good evening, everyone, I'm Shinzo Abe.
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of the Government and people of Japan, I would like to extend my warm congratulations.
At the G20 Osaka Summit held in June, Japan and China cooperated to make the summit a success, and the G20 Osaka Summit Declaration was adopted to declare the G20's firm will to the world.
In addition, at the Japan-China summit meeting and dinner before the summit, the two sides agreed that President Xi Jinping will pay a state visit to Japan next spring, and at the same time agreed to usher in a new era between Japan and China.
Japan and China share a heavy responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.
I firmly believe that the two countries will work together to address the issues facing the region and the world and contribute to the international community together, which will help build a new model for the future relations between the two countries.
In closing, I wish Japan-China relations a flourishing and my friends a prosperous career.
"In some construction sites, it is estimated that more than half of the overage migrant workers are employed.
Where to find young workers now?
I don't want to use so many 'old people' on the construction site, there is no way. ”
Recently, Zou Kui, who has been working as an engineering contractor in the construction industry for many years, lamented that there are many over-age migrant workers (over the retirement age) on the construction site.
Recently, the author's university has carried out a rain and sewage diversion project, and there are many migrant workers on campus.
Overage migrant workers go out to work not because they are "idle", but because they "can't be idle", and have the helplessness and hardship of "having to do this" -- whether it is saving money to solve their pension and medical problems, or helping their children, they all drive these old people who should be "idle" to continue to work hard.
The "old age dependent" of over-age migrant workers is not as easy as we imagined.
When these migrant workers complete their "life tasks", their money bags have been emptied and even have a lot of debts, and most of them lack wealth accumulation.
In order not to drag down their children and to accumulate more wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "working until they can't do it".
Many of the new generation of migrant workers from the "post-80s", "post-90s" and even "post-00s" are unwilling to engage in the secondary industry or low-end service industry with difficult conditions and high labor intensity, resulting in a structural "labor shortage".
Due to the lack of a skill, and the decline in physical function and working ability, many over-age migrant workers are engaged in work with high intensity, low income, high risk, and low security.
Being able to work day by day is a day, and being able to earn a little more is a little bit, and the survival plight of over-age migrant workers behind "can't be idle" cannot be ignored and ignored.
In addition to their "self-salvation", solving the problem of arrears of wages and wage bargaining, improving labor protection, reducing safety risks, increasing labor income, and improving the living conditions of over-age migrant workers are also inseparable from the institutional protection and humanistic care of the public sector.
Some scholars have pointed out that over-age migrant workers are less likely to rely on returning home to farm to solve their pension and medical problems, and they must find other ways to support their families.
Understanding the helplessness and strength of over-age migrant workers will help us better understand the love and pain of over-age migrant workers.
Seeing the backs of over-age migrant workers, hearing their sighs, and trying to make them truly "rely on the elderly" when they return to the countryside, it is necessary for the public sector, the market and society to share responsibilities in a benign interaction, and to work together.
Chemezov said that Russia will not export such systems in the next five years, because "it will first supply its own army, after which it will be produced for export."
This approach is fully in line with international practice.
The main producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure their own defense needs first, and only then do they process export orders.
Earlier, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Aerospace Forces, General Yuri Glekhov, said that the development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by the "Diamond-Antai" air and space defense Kang Zeen.
This is a new generation of air defense systems with a working principle for destroying ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main role of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles with a range of less than 3500 km.
In addition, according to some information, the S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles, as well as aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles that exceed the speed of sound by 5 times, and even targets located in near space.
This weapon can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defense systems, in particular, the S-400 system, which is very important from a defense point of view.
Sergei Chemezov expressed special concern about the S-400.
He said that the system is currently in great demand in the world, but the Russian army also needs it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 air defense system entered service with the Arctic air defense regiment.
According to information from September 15, the modification of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system of the Arctic air defense regiment of Novaya Zemlya has been completed.
This is not the militarization of Russia in the Arctic.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, this is a process that is fully within the planned transition to more advanced defense tools in the northern strategic direction.
According to the press service of the Russian Northern Fleet, "With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controllable airspace in the Arctic region has increased significantly. ”
It is very important that, according to military assessments, the use of this system in the Far North and the Arctic is successful.
Officers and men of the air defense regiment were trained on the new system and were ready to go on combat duty.
Previously, the S-300 long-range air defense system was equipped there, and now part of it remains.
When it comes to air defense systems, they must have weapons capable of destroying all kinds of air targets, whether they are high-speed targets flying at the outer altitude layer or "fish in the net" that are close to the protected facilities.
According to open sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by Golden Diamond-Antai Aerospace Defense Kang Tseen, is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other air attack weapons.
This weapon can attack aerodynamic targets at a range of 400 km and shoot down ballistic targets at a distance of 4.8 km per second at a distance of 60 km.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defense forces in the far north to ensure the security of its airspace along the northern sea route.
Not so long ago, the first batch of 12 anti-aircraft missile systems "Tor - M2DT" was delivered to the Russian Arctic, they are enough to form an air defense battalion to strengthen the air defense system of the Arctic region.
The Russian Ministry of Defense said at that time that the Arctic "Thor" unit would be expanded to a full brigade-level formation in the future.
Together with the S-400 long-range systems newly deployed to Novaya Zemlya and the Kola Peninsula and the Pantsir-SA short-range systems deployed in the far north, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons are a powerful defense of Russia's polar skies.
It will be difficult for enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles to break through this defense.
According to the idea of the Russian government, the flagship store will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place their goods, avoiding the complicated and lengthy process of opening their own store.
Rospindo, the operator of Russian stores, focuses on the sale of Russian goods in China.
Rospinduo has online stores on China's largest trade platforms such as Tmall, JD.com, 1688, Pinduoduo, ShouQ, and Wechat, as well as its own online platform Epinduo.com and retail chain stores of Russian goods.
The Russian Export Center will work with Rospindo to develop store marketing strategies and participation criteria, as well as screen companies with products on virtual shelves.
The store is scheduled to open by the end of this year and have products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers on the shelves.
According to the Russian Export Center, the total number of visits to Chinese e-commerce platforms is as high as 1 billion per month.
At the same time, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014 and exceeded $1 billion in 2018.
Currently, Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of its global import strategy.
According to Alexei Kozhevnikov, the new store will display the goods of enterprises with sales of at least 500 million rubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, sales of 500 million rubles are not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers have a very positive attitude towards Russian goods, regarding Chinese products as high-quality and environmentally friendly. ”
Kozhevnikov said competition for Chinese consumers, who have strong purchasing power, is fierce and intensifying.
"Our goal is ambitious, to launch 500 businesses through this store within three years," he said. ”
At the same time, the platform will also list the products of companies in the Russian Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor at the Department of Fundamentals of Trade Policy at the Plekhanov University of Economics in Russia, said: "This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export center is state-owned, not private. ”
"I don't see a lot of Russian goods that are very competitive on the market. ”
He believes that the project will most likely not be actually implemented, but it will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to RIA Novosti, Andrey Slepnev, president of the Russian Export Center, said on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum that information on the products of more than 170 Russian companies has been published on the largest international wholesale online platform Alibaba.com, which can be purchased both in China and in other countries.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, namely a training program for Russian companies by experts from Taobao University, the first seminar of which was held in July this year.
At the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November this year, the Russian Export Center will also serve as an organizer of the participation of Russian companies in industry exhibitions and business projects.
A large-scale exhibition will be held in a 1,000-square-meter exhibition hall, which will also become a center for business project events, agreement signing ceremonies, presentations and meetings with representatives of Chinese companies.
About 50 applications from Russian agricultural enterprises have been received.
The press service of the Russian Export Center said: "In addition to the agricultural stand, we will definitely hold business meetings, that is, arrange direct contacts between entrepreneurs. ”
"This is another direction of our efforts to support companies and ensure that dozens of dedicated meetings are arranged for them. ”
In addition, master classes, cooking competitions and a tasting of Russian food by famous Russian chefs of the project "Discover Russian Cuisine in Shanghai" will be held.
Police are taking the next step after the coroner's court of deceased life-saving officer Mohd Adi ruled on Friday that the cause of death was not accidental death, and the police awaited a full report and instructions from the Attorney General's Office.
Datuk Huzl of the National Police Criminal Investigation Department issued a statement on Friday that the police will wait for the Attorney General's Office to give the most further instructions based on the coroner's ruling.
In his statement, he stressed that the police had never stopped investigating the murder of Mohd and that the investigation was still ongoing.
On the other hand, Selangor Police Chief Noah Cham said the police would wait for a full report on the contents of the ruling before taking action.

He said the police investigated the case based on the relevant reports.
He added that the police would also decide whether to re-call those who had previously been recorded for questioning, depending on the progress of the investigation.

Xinhua Times Commentary: Unswervingly follow our own path
The white paper "China and the World in the New Era" released on the 27th answers: Over the past 70 years, the fundamental reason for China's successful development is that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the correct development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and unswervingly followed this road.
It is the choice of history and the choice of the people for China to follow a development path that suits itself.
In modern times, in an environment of poverty and weakness, internal and external troubles, generations of people with lofty ideals have sought and continued to explore the road to save the country and the people.
However, "the constitutional monarchy, the restoration of the monarchy, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, and the presidential system have all been thought of and tried, but none of them will work." ”
It was not until the Communist Party of China and New China that Chinese people gradually opened up a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The path that China has embarked on is the road to the happiness of the Chinese people, the road to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the road of common development between China and other countries in the world.
It is precisely because China is on the right path that it can handle its own affairs well, become the world's second largest economy and the country that contributes the most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As pointed out in the white paper, China's development path is in line with China's national conditions, adapts to the requirements of the times, and will show more and more bright prospects for development as the times progress.
Looking back, the Chinese people know very well how difficult it is to find a correct path; looking around the world, the Chinese people cherish this correct path even more.
Chinese understand the truth of the south orange and the north orange, and understand that what suits others is not necessarily suitable for themselves, and only what suits them is the best.
It is with this kind of self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created a miracle that has attracted worldwide attention.
In the tortuous process of mankind's progress, the "final conclusion of history" was once famous.
Today, the success of the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics has announced the end of the "final conclusion of history", the collapse of the "theory of China's collapse", and the failure of the "theory of the defeat of socialism".
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries in achieving national prosperity and national strength, broadened the way for developing countries to move toward modernization, and provided experience and reference for those countries and nations in the world that wish to accelerate development while maintaining their independence and take a path suited to their national conditions.
The world is colorful.
China has always respected the right of each country to choose a development path suited to its own national conditions.
China will not "import" foreign models or "export" Chinese models, but will unswervingly follow its own path, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen governance exchanges with other countries, and make due contributions to the common realization of good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that a Foodworks supermarket owner fired a 66-year-old female worker via text message because he preferred to hire employees from Asian backgrounds, and the boss's practice was slammed as "shameful."
The committee said the way Jianbin Wang, the owner of Ms. Gail Ayton, who has worked at the Wagga store for more than 20 years, treated employees was "grossly unfair" and may have violated anti-discrimination laws.
Ms. Ayton told the committee that Mr. Wang took over the shop in 2016 and that he had been "trying to fire me" because she was not Chinese.
In this case, Peter Sams, Deputy Chairman of the Commission, conducted an internet search and found "some job advertisements posted by Mr Wang in the past at various Australian Chinese employment forums".
Among the job requirements listed for these positions, one of them says "Asian Lady Preferred" and the other says "Asian Employee Preferred".
The third post said he was "more inclined to people overseas (sic)".
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton via text message in April of this year, later saying it was due to her absence from work and a small amount of cash missing from the cash register that was allegedly $5.10 to $30.
Mr. Sams alleges, however, that Mr. Wang's reasons for dismissing Ms. Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
She has only missed one shift in three years, and the "missing amount" totals a few dollars.
He said Ms. Ayton's dismissal "had nothing to do with her conduct or performance."
He said: "It seems to me that the real motive of the respondent in dismissing him, supported by the evidence of the job advertisement posted by Mr. Wang, was that he preferred to hire employees with Asian backgrounds.
Under section 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's conduct constituted a prima facie violation of the Anti-Discrimination Act and/or the dismissal of the Applicant was unlawful. ”
Mr. Sams stated that it would not be appropriate for him to consider reinstating Ms. Ayton in view of the "appalling" treatment he had given to Ms. Ayton.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton, who is a casual worker who earns $26 an hour.
In light of the possible violations of anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation, Sams said he would submit his ruling and documents to the commission's supervisor to consider whether Mr. Wang's conduct should be referred to another agency to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
He states that Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged grounds for her dismissal.
He said: "In my opinion, the respondent adopted an incorrigibly unfair and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant, and Mr Wang 'waited' for this opportunity, which he believed would 'justify' the termination of employment of the applicant. ”
"He was wrong ... The Respondent completely ignored any natural justice given to the Applicant in the dismissal of the Applicant and, shockingly, his disrespectful and grossly unfair perfunctory conduct. ”
Mr. Sams said that while Foodworks is a small business, "it must be frankly said that no decent employer would dismiss an employee in the manner that is grossly unfair and perfunctory as admitted in this case." ”

Walking with the Motherland - a sketch of a certain team of the Armed Police Force
In the golden autumn, on the military parade training ground, a certain team of officers and soldiers with an average height of 1.83 meters was busy with training.
The shiny spears, the exclusive olive green and bright red epaulettes form a beautiful landscape.
A few days ago, this reporter walked into this team and felt the determination of the officers and men of the armed police to always be loyal guards of the party and the people, as well as their feelings and pursuit of "honor first."
"Dreams shine on a brilliant life and write an immortal legend in the new era ... This is a team song composed by the officers and men of the square team -- "Walking with the Motherland."
In the square team, this song is the motto of every team member.
Qi Xiaoguang, who is 1.92 meters tall, stands out in the team.
As the flag bearer of the former Armed Police National Flag Guard, he has a deeper understanding of honor.
The honor of a soldier comes from hard training.
As the flag bearer, Qi Xiaoguang's training has always been of high standards and strict requirements.
He practiced styling with a sandbag, strides with a stopwatch, strides blindfolded, and stability against the wind.
In his "Qingqi career", there is a picture that is always unforgettable.
During a flag-raising ceremony, heavy rain poured down, but none of the tourists who came to watch the flag-raising ceremony left.
The moment the national flag was raised, Qi Xiaoguang deeply felt the glory represented by the five-star red flag on his shoulder.
In 2019, Qi Xiaoguang was selected as a benchmark soldier for review.
The standard movement of the base soldier and the flag bearer are different.
Qi Xiaoguang introduced that although the frequency of the march of the flag bearer and the benchmark soldier is only more than 20 steps, more efforts need to be made in training.
The benchmark soldier is the first place in the first row, which directly determines the neatness of the square.
After the military parade focused on training, he repeatedly kicked his legs every day and practiced some hard kicking skills.
In the demonstration, his precise stride and pace won bursts of applause from the officers and soldiers.
In the square, almost every officer and soldier had the same experience as Qi Xiaoguang.
The father of the soldier Zhu Xu Dongfang participated in the 50th anniversary of the National Day parade 20 years ago.
In order to follow in his father's footsteps and become a member of the team, he suffered setbacks again and again, but he was never discouraged.
He said: "It is the honor of my life to be able to walk through Tiananmen Square like my father and to be inspected by the party and the people. ”
Walking into the honor room of the team, the 8 characters of "The Elite Division of the Capital to Maintain Stability" came into view.
Wang Qian, political commissar of the team, introduced that all the members of the team are from the Beijing Armed Police Corps -- this is a unit with a glorious tradition, which has successively undertaken major tasks such as the founding ceremony, the National Day celebrations, the security of the previous national congresses of the party, and the maintenance of anti-terrorism and stability in the capital, and has cultivated a large number of heroic collectives and individuals such as "National Flag Guards" and "Patriotic Hero Squadrons", and more than 50 units and individuals have been awarded honorary titles by the State Council, the Central Military Commission and the Armed Police Force.

Vietnam needs to seize the opportunity for the development of artificial intelligence.
The four criteria used to evaluate and rank the readiness of cities in the face of the AI wave include prospects, implementation capabilities, asset base, and development direction.
The city of Singapore ranked first, followed by cities from various countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an expert at the organization, said in an interview with reporters: "I find it very meaningful when reviewing and evaluating cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.
Overall, I think Vietnam's future is very bright against the backdrop of high growth rate, strong economic development path, and rapid development of the talent base.
I think Vietnam is on the right path and doing a good job.
It is important that Vietnam knows how to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to drive economic development. ”
Artificial intelligence is completely changing the way people work, communicate, and live.
It brings greater efficiency, but it also threatens to exacerbate social, economic, and technological inequalities.
However, according to a global study organized by Oliver Wyman, only cities in the world today are ready for the breakthroughs brought about by the age of artificial intelligence.

About 800 million people traveled on the National Day, reflecting the booming supply and demand of China's tourism
About 800 million people will travel during the upcoming "National Day" Golden Week!
Big data from a number of tourism platforms show that China's tourism consumer market is prosperous in both supply and demand.
Ctrip's National Day Travel Report predicts that the number of domestic tourists during this year's National Day holiday is expected to be close to 800 million, and more than 7.5 million outbound tourists will be made during the National Day holiday this year.
At present, tourists from more than 500 cities have booked group tours, independent travel, customized tours, local entertainment and other products through the platform, involving 100 countries and regions.
According to the China Tourism Academy, the country received 726 million domestic tourists during the National Day holiday last year, a year-on-year increase of 9.43%.
This year's National Day holiday will not only have a new number of tourists, but also consumption upgrading will become the "main theme" of travel during the National Day holiday.
Ctrip reported that the average per capita spending of domestic inter-provincial tourists during the National Day holiday exceeded 3,000 yuan, an increase from the same period last year, which was due to the fact that tourists generally chose products with better experiences, such as high-rated brand hotels, non-shopping tour groups, exquisite small groups, and special car guides.
The booking data of Donkey Mama Travel Network shows a similar trend, and the "private group" with less than 10 people using comfortable vehicles throughout the domestic long-term line is more popular than in previous years.
Spring and Autumn tourism data shows that its consumers prefer to focus on experience, service, and differentiation of "calm and slow".
Fliggy's data shows that China's fourth-tier cities and below have the fastest growth in tourist bookings, with a year-on-year growth rate of 30%, reflecting the consumption upgrade of residents in more parts of the country.
Personalization is a major feature of this year's "National Day" Golden Week tourism.
According to Ctrip, car rental bookings are expected to increase by nearly 60% year-on-year during the National Day holiday, with short-distance self-driving tours to explore the surrounding niche routes continuing to be popular, and the number of private group registrations increasing by 155% year-on-year.
Sharing joy has become the main purpose of people's travel and leisure.
According to Ctrip's data, 28% of the tourists during the National Day holiday are parents and children, 25% are couples, and 23% are colleagues and friends.
In addition, from the perspective of the age of tourists, the "post-80s" and "post-90s" account for more than half of the total number of tourists.
It is worth noting that unlike the previous Golden Week outbound travel growth more rapidly, this year's domestic travel market performance is more "eye-catching".
According to Fliggy's data, the number of people booking domestic cultural tourism routes during this year's National Day holiday increased by 42% year-on-year, outpacing outbound travel.
According to industry analysis, while the demand is strong, the supply side of tourism is being promoted across the country to provide tourists with a richer "cultural and tourism feast".
For example, the General Administration of Sports of the People's Republic of China and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism recently jointly released the "2019 National Day Golden Week Sports Tourism Boutique Route"; The 2019 Shanghai Tourism Festival is being held in 7 sectors and 100 cultural and tourism activities to attract Chinese and foreign tourists, and near the Golden Week, Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong and other provinces have introduced measures to reduce or free tickets for scenic spots.
Ctrip's booking data shows that domestic destinations with unique natural scenery or cultural characteristics are the most popular, and Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing and Tianjin will be the most popular domestic tourist destinations.

China is expected to become Australia's largest beef export market.
An animal protein analyst at Rabobank said China is poised to become Australia's largest beef export market as it faces a severe pork shortage following the outbreak of African swine fever.
Chinese consumers are shifting from eating pork to other animal proteins after the outbreak of the pandemic, which has caused authorities to destroy many herds, with the number of pigs in China halved and pork prices nearly doubled in the past year.
China produces and consumes two-thirds of the world's pork.
Chenjun Pan, senior animal protein analyst at Rabobank in China, said demand for other meats, including beef, has increased, with China, the world's largest importer of animal protein, currently importing 27 percent of the world's pork and 24 percent of the world's beef.
Ms Pan said that in the first half of this year, China's beef imports from Australia increased by 65 per cent, and China surpassed the United States and Japan to become Australia's largest beef export market.

The world's oldest barber died at 108 years old and cut hair for 96 years
In New York, USA, there is a Guinness World Records certified world's oldest barber in the world (Anthony Mancinelli), 108 years old, he has never retired and diligently cuts the hair of customers every day, but on the 19th, Mancinelli passed away due to jaw cancer complications, bidding farewell to his 96-year haircutting life.
According to CNN, Mancinelli immigrated to the United States when he was 8 years old, and soon after he helped clean the floor in a barber shop, he began to pick up scissors to serve customers at the age of 12 to relieve the family's financial pressure.
Mancinelli was in primary school, but he did not graduate.
Mancinelli's son Robert revealed that his father loves his work, and people from all over the world like him, but although his father has always been healthy, he was diagnosed with cancer in February this year, and finally couldn't go to work due to physical factors 6 weeks before his death, but this is not a retirement, because he plans to come back to cut his hair when he gets better.
Robert, 82, said that after his father's death, he now had to find a new barber because he had asked his father to help cut his hair all his life.
During the year, the repurchase scale of listed companies exceeded 100 billion yuan, a record high-Xinhuanet
In order to stabilize the company's stock price and maintain the company's image, listed companies have begun to repurchase shares frequently in the past two years, hoping to pass on the information that the company's value is undervalued to the market through directional repurchase and collective bidding transactions, so as to stabilize the stock price and enhance investor confidence.
According to data from Oriental Wealth Choice, the funds used by listed companies to repurchase shares in 2017 were 7.9 billion yuan, which soared to 51 billion yuan in 2018, and since 2019, the total amount of repurchase by A-share listed companies has exceeded 100 billion yuan, setting a new high in the amount of repurchase funds in the history of A-shares, and far exceeding the previous years.
From the perspective of the purpose of the repurchase, the company's repurchase of shares and the increase of major shareholders seem to be the same, but there are great differences in the implementation of the subject, the source of funds, the purpose of the repurchase, and the rights and interests of the stock itself.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Maikerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said in an interview with the "Securities Daily" reporter that in November 2018, the "Opinions on Supporting Listed Companies to Repurchase Shares" was revised for the problems existing in the current system such as the narrow scope of share repurchase, complex decision-making procedures, and imperfect inventory system.
In January this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange officially issued the "Implementation Rules for the Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies", the introduction of these policies has broadened the sources of funds for the repurchase of listed companies, appropriately simplified the implementation procedures, guided the improvement of governance arrangements, and encouraged all kinds of listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee stock ownership plans.
After the issuance of the opinions, the operation of share repurchase by listed companies has more applicable circumstances, the repurchase process is simpler, and the enthusiasm for share repurchase is also greater.
Repurchasing shares at a relatively low position is also conducive to the listed company to improve the efficiency of the use of funds, thereby increasing the level of earnings per share, improving the return on net assets, and reducing the pressure on the company's profitability indicators.
Compared with the increase in holdings of major shareholders, the repurchase of shares by listed companies is of greater significance, which also reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage market value and abundant cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that the undervaluation of the stock price is the main factor in the repurchase of listed companies, and the company's stock price has not been able to reflect the company's future development prospects, so this kind of company is worthy of investors' attention, but can not blindly invest, and needs to pay attention to the financial reports and specific operations of such listed companies.
Listed companies with large-scale repurchase behavior at least show the company's development confidence and financial strength.
The data shows that nearly 1,000 listed companies have implemented share repurchases this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the main force in the repurchase market.
Ping An recently disclosed the progress of the repurchase, saying that the company has repurchased a total of 57.59 million A shares through centralized bidding transactions, accounting for 0.315% of the company's total share capital, and the total amount of funds paid is 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction costs), and the repurchased shares will be used for employee stock ownership plans, including but not limited to the long-term service plan approved by the company's general meeting of shareholders.
Yili shares have paid 5.792 billion yuan for share repurchase, and recently adjusted the use of repurchased shares, from the original plan "the repurchase of shares will be used as a source of shares for the later implementation of equity incentives" to "a total of 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares are used for the implementation of equity incentive stock sources, and the remaining 30.49 million shares will be used for cancellation to reduce the registered capital".
Yili shares said that the cancellation of part of the repurchased shares is conducive to further improving the level of earnings per share and effectively improving the return on investment of the company's shareholders.
TCL Group issued a repurchase progress announcement on September 25, showing that TCL Group has repurchased 3.59% of the company's shares in total, costing a total of 1.65 billion yuan.
The office of the board of directors of TCL Group told the "Securities Daily" reporter that the repurchased shares will be used for employee stock ownership plans, equity incentives or for the conversion of corporate bonds issued by listed companies that can be converted into shares.
TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy, continuously improves its competitiveness, and develops sustainably and healthily.
Based on the confidence in the company's future development and the maintenance of investors' interests, combined with the performance of the company's shares in the secondary market in the past year, and taking into account the company's operating conditions and financial conditions and other factors, the company plans to use its own funds, self-raised funds and other financing methods to repurchase the company's shares.
Yang Delong, chief economist of Qianhai Open Source Fund, said that the operation of listed companies to repurchase shares, on the one hand, can reduce the number of shares circulating in the market and increase the earnings per share of listed companies, which is an important positive for the stock price of the secondary market;
The repurchase of domestic listed companies has gradually increased in recent years, especially for high-performing stocks, and it is a very good way to boost investors' confidence through share repurchases, and it is also a practice worthy of recognition and encouragement.
Hu Henghua, member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and secretary of the Changsha Municipal Party Committee, and Zhan Chunxin, Liang Wengen, He Qinghua and Liu Feixiang, the four heads of the Hunan Army of construction machinery manufacturing, set a "small goal" around "Changsha from construction machinery to intelligent manufacturing" - three to five years later to build a world-leading construction machinery industry cluster.
To build a world-leading construction machinery industry cluster in Changsha, in the current fashionable words, is to create "the strongest on the surface".
As an inland provincial capital, Changsha shouted this bold statement, where does the confidence come from?
With the strength of domineering side leakage.
The four Hunan construction machinery enterprises participating in the dialogue are all skilled, covering the whole field of sky, underground, sea and land: Sunward Intelligent's light aircraft, Zoomlion's concrete pump, Sany Heavy Industry's all-terrain crane, and Railway Construction Heavy Industry's tunnel shield machine, its "hard power" can be described as unique and outstanding.
Once upon a time, China basically had no say in the field of construction machinery manufacturing.
With the passage of time, Chinese enterprises have taken multiple measures such as acquisitions, mergers and acquisitions, and factories to become the leader of the global construction machinery industry.
Among them, Sany Heavy Industry, Zoomlion, Railway Construction Heavy Industry, Sunward Intelligent and other construction machinery leading enterprises, their output value, market share, sales and other major economic indicators, has been significantly ahead of similar enterprises.
It is controlled by the current situation of the camera.
The "Four King Kongs" of Hunan Construction Machinery Industry Cluster is the leader of Changsha Construction Machinery Industry Cluster and the head enterprise of the global construction machinery industry.
In the rivers and lakes of the global industry, who can survive and live well is the hard way to speak.
In the early years, the global construction machinery industry encountered a cold winter, many internationally renowned construction machinery manufacturing enterprises have fallen, but Changsha's construction machinery manufacturing enterprises put the "cat winter" as a "winter swim", self-pressure, self-breakthrough, through the transformation of industrial structure, from manufacturing to intelligent manufacturing, not only survived, but also strengthened the body.
Relying on the stars to hold the moon with the power of government and enterprises.
The development of advantageous industries requires not only the active progress of enterprises, but also the active action of the government.
The reason why Changsha has the reputation of "the capital of construction machinery" is that it brings together the whole industrial chain from upstream to downstream, creates many related industrial clusters, and through optimizing the business environment, improving supporting services, simplifying the approval process and other measures to decentralize, manage and provide services, the cost of R&D, manufacturing and sales of enterprises has been greatly reduced.
A good business ecology has made construction machinery manufacturing enterprises come one after another.
History has pushed Changsha to the front of building a global leading level of construction machinery.
Whether it is the government, enterprises, or even related industry, academia, research and business links, we should seize the opportunity, take advantage of the trend, set goals, continue to make efforts, and contribute to the construction of a manufacturing power.

Qingyang, Gansu: Hu sheep come to "poverty alleviation".
The autumn of September renders the Loess Plateau.
In the Yimin Breeding Professional Cooperative in Yima Town, Xia Weili, a 58-year-old villager, filled the trough in the sheepfold with the last spade and forage, and stood by the trough to watch the white lake sheep chew carefully.
"It's delicious, and when it grows fat in autumn and winter, it can be sold at a good price. ”
Xia Weili said that he feeds the sheep "special nutritious meals" every day, cleans, sterilizes and disinfects regularly, and does not dare to slack off after careful service.
Xia Weili has been raising sheep for more than 20 years, and it was not until he came to work in the cooperative that he knew how extensive sheep herding was in the past.
Xia Weili is a native of Xiashuchi Village, Yima Town, Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His neighbors are all sheep farmers, but they adhere to the traditional free-range method, and the quality of sheep is poor and the amount of sheep slaughtered is small.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor households in the village joined the cooperative, and everything began to change.
Xia Weili immersed himself in breeding all day long, because he always held back a lot of energy in his heart.
The people who have invested in the shares are all poor households, and they all trust their sheep to the cooperative, and they are counting on him whether they can distribute dividends and sell them at a high price at the end of the year.
Fortunately, with the guidance of technical personnel, he slowly learned to engage in epidemic prevention, mastered scientific feeding, and became one of the few breeding "good styles" in the village.
Yimin Breeding Cooperative is a standardized cooperative with a total of 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1,400 lake sheep.
Zou Tao, the person in charge of the cooperative, said that the standardized sheep shed is very doorway inside and out.
"The wool is thick and dense, easy to breed bacteria, the sheep can not stay in the hot and humid place, the sheep shed must be built in the place where the ditch is surrounded on three sides, and the fan must be installed to ventilate and dissipate heat. ”
Zou Tao said that in order to prevent the epidemic, it is also necessary to spray and disinfect the sheep shed regularly, and give the sheep three to four epidemic prevention shots in the first quarter.
In addition to living well, the "little sheep" also has to eat forage made of silage corn, wheat straw, alfalfa, etc., and have a wide enough "playground" to stretch their muscles.
The cooperatives adopt the method of trusteeship and substitution to guide local farmers to put the improved breeds of lake sheep here, and raise, manage and sell them in a unified manner, so as to realize the breeding, scientific, standardized and intensive breeding.
Today, the 140 poor households with sheep as shareholders have a dividend of more than 6,000 yuan per household every year, and there are 4 poverty alleviation targets who have registered for poverty alleviation and work in the cooperative.
From "grazing in the mountains" to "precision feeding", from "local mating" to "artificial insemination", from "looking at the body shape and touching the belly" to "doing B ultrasound one by one"... In Qingyang, Gansu Province, sheep breeding is not only a change in feeding methods, but also a change in the model of "leading enterprises + cooperatives + farmers" has changed the scene of "raising sheep on the hillside and selling sheep in the market", overcoming the weakness and scatterishness of traditional agriculture and animal husbandry, and the poor life of farmers has become better because of modern sheep raising.
Zou Tao said that if the market price is weak, the local leading enterprise Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd. will buy at a market protection price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers diversify market risks.
Xu Jianfeng, general counsel of Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd., said that the company has driven more and more poor households to read the "Sheep Sutra" by providing loan guarantees, sheep supply, order breeding, quotation purchase, unified processing and sales and other services for poor households.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 impoverished families have achieved a steady increase in income through forage breeding, improved seed breeding, large-scale breeding, slaughtering and segmentation, and market sales of Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry.
Qingyang City is located in the northern agriculture and animal husbandry ecotone, rich in forage resources.
At present, there are 913 large-scale sheep farms and cooperatives in the city, with more than 5 million sheep raised, and two processing production lines of 1.3 million sheep slaughtering scale have been built.
The French finance minister said that more than 10 billion euros will be cut in taxes next year and called on Germany to follow suit
PARIS, Sept 26 (Reuters) - France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday, and Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revive the sluggish economy.
Introducing France's 2020 budget, Le Maire said the ECB's latest monetary easing measures have created an opportunity for the governments of those member states that can afford to increase investment.
The European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates to a record low on 12 September and plans to restart bond purchases to bring down borrowing costs, hoping to spur economic recovery and push up inflation.
"Low interest rates will not bring prosperity back to Europe, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not sufficient," Le Maire told reporters.
"Germany needs to invest, it needs now, and the sooner the better. Don't wait for the situation to get worse before acting," he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany on several occasions.
France has implemented more than 10 billion euros in tax cuts this year, which has given a big boost to France's economic growth.
The global economy has lost momentum, and the export-dependent German economy has borne the brunt.
Le Maire noted that the tax burden on French households will be reduced by 9.3 billion euros next year, including 5 billion euros in income tax relief.
In addition, with the gradual implementation of the corporate tax rate from 33.3% to 25% over a five-year period, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost 1 billion euros.

Study: The U.S. National Healthy Diet Index Grows Slightly, but Remains Challenge-Chinanews.com
Chinanews.com, September 27 According to a report by the Overseas Chinese News Network in the United States, a recent study in the United States showed that in the past 16 years, the healthy diet index of the US government has increased moderately, from 56 to 58.
But with a perfect score of 100, it's not something to celebrate.
The U.S. people still face "significant challenges" when it comes to diet.
Dr. Fangfang Zhang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts and one of the study's authors, said Americans are still consuming too much food that can trigger heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other diseases, which are the most common diseases in the United States.
The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on the 24th.
The study is based on the findings of a health survey of 44,000 adults conducted by the U.S. government from 1999 to 2016.
The authors write that "despite the considerable improvements, significant dietary challenges remain".
It is reported that these challenges include getting the American people to reduce their intake of snacks, hot dogs, fat beef, butter and other foods containing saturated fat.
The study found that people's daily dietary intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended upper limit of 10%.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. diet has been the reduction in sugar intake from 16 percent to about 14 percent, but the intake is still too high.
Officially, the daily diet should contain less than 10% of added sugars.
Researchers believe that the reason for the decrease in sugar intake is related to the decrease in people's consumption of sweetened sodas, but Zhang stressed that sugars are often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
U.S. adults have a small increase in their intake of fruits, nuts, oats, and other whole grain groups.
However, data from 2016 shows that these foods still account for less than 5% of the daily diet.
Although people consume a little less salt and drink less fruit juice leads to a lower intake of low-quality carbohydrates, Zhang says they still account for up to 42 percent of daily calories, many of which come from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on biennial personal health surveys that ask adults to recall the foods they have eaten in the past 24 hours.
Since 2003, these health surveys have asked this question twice every few days.
The government's dietary guidelines for U.S. residents recommend that people adopt a "healthy eating pattern" to reduce the likelihood of chronic disease.
The guidelines state that people should eat more nutrient-dense foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs, and seeds that can provide protein.
The number of Americans with diabetes nearly doubled to more than 7 percent during the study period, and obesity rates increased over the years between the study — about 70 percent of U.S. adults are now overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death for U.S. nationals.
The EU promotes a strategic partnership with Asia
Nguyen Van Binh, member of the Political Bureau of the CPV Central Committee, member of the Secretariat of the CPV Central Committee, and Minister of Economic Affairs of the CPC Central Committee, led a delegation to attend the forum.
In line with the close cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the theme of the forum was "Connecting the EU and Asia: Building Bridges for a Sustainable Future".
The forum took place one year after the implementation of the EU's strategy of connecting the two continents.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that strengthening the interface is part of this proposition because of the benefits it brings to the peoples and economies of the countries concerned.
These relationships contribute to stability and prosperity for all concerned.
At the same time, he believes that the EU wants to send a message about increasing participation and strengthening the mutually beneficial relationship between Europe and Asia.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will be a special guest of honor at the forum and will deliver an important speech at the plenary session.
The country's first joint-stock bank wealth management subsidiary was established to empower the asset management business with technology
On the 26th, Everbright Wealth Management Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Everbright Bank, was officially established in Qingdao, which is the first wealth management subsidiary of a joint-stock bank established in China.
Experts said that asset management is an important area for the development of financial technology, and the establishment of wealth management subsidiaries by banks is conducive to the use of technology to improve their asset management business.
In April this year, China Everbright Bank and China Merchants Bank respectively announced that they had been approved by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission to establish wealth management subsidiaries.
On September 24, Everbright Bank announced that Everbright Wealth Management had been officially approved for operation.
Just two days later, Everbright Bank took the lead in many joint-stock banks and took the lead in establishing Everbright Wealth Management in Qingdao.
Li Xiaopeng, Chairman of Everbright Group, said that Everbright Group will accelerate the pace of innovation, use modern scientific and technological thinking and means, and rely on big data, Internet of Things and cloud computing to improve the coverage, utilization and penetration rate of financial capital, and enhance customers' sense of gain, happiness and security.
By 2021, we will establish and improve the "four beams and eight pillars" of China's financial technology development, further enhance the ability of the financial industry to apply science and technology, realize the deep integration and coordinated development of finance and technology, and significantly enhance the people's satisfaction with digital, networked and intelligent financial products and services.
Zhang Xuyang, Chairman of Everbright Wealth Management, said that Everbright Wealth Management's asset management platform will use robo-advisory, robo-advisory, intelligent investment research, big data and other technologies to help Everbright Wealth Management better judge the macroeconomic situation.
In the future, new technologies such as blockchain will also be applied to grasp the direction and trend from traditional assets to alternative assets to digital alternative assets.
Dong Ximiao, a distinguished researcher at the National Finance and Development Laboratory, said that in the face of a new situation of competition and cooperation in the asset management industry, fintech companies and asset management institutions will use asset management technology to jointly explore new growth paths.
Fintech empowers the asset management industry, which is not only the need for the transformation and development of fintech itself, but also injects new vitality and vitality into the development of asset management business.
At the beginning of this year, JD Digital Technology launched a new asset management technology system to improve the product development and risk control capabilities of asset management with the help of technology and digital means.
The new system starts with four major capabilities: product design, sales and trading, asset management, and risk assessment, to improve the overall intelligent operation level of the asset management industry.
Experts believe that asset management technology can not only improve customer service capabilities and innovate and enrich products, but also enhance risk prevention capabilities and improve the efficiency of asset management management.
Zhang Xuyang said that in the past, it was easy to deviate from the risk appetite of customers through questionnaires, but now the use of artificial intelligence for user portraits will help to better locate customers and launch corresponding products according to customers' investment preferences, which will help resolve risks.
"Alternative big data such as e-commerce and spatio-temporal data can help us better portray the activity and prosperity of a region and an industry. ”
Zhang Xuyang said that while mitigating risks, big data technology will also help improve risk control capabilities.
The record for the deepest railway tunnel shaft in China has been refreshed
Baoshan, China-Singapore Baoshan, September 27 (Zhang Weiming, Xu Weiguo, Zhou Jingbo) After more than 1,200 days of day and night construction, the No. 1 shaft of the Gaoligongshan Tunnel of the Dali (Li) Rui (Li) Railway under construction was completed on the 27th, with a depth of 762.59 meters below the ground, breaking the record for the deepest railway tunnel shaft in China, and this record was created under the condition of a large amount of water.
The 34.5-kilometer-long Gaoligongshan Tunnel of the Dalui Railway is located in Yunnan, and the tunnel crosses the Gaoligongshan Mountains from the west bank of the Nujiang River, making it the longest double-track single-hole tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel passes through 19 fault zones and is buried to a maximum depth of 1,155 meters, because it covers almost all the undesirable geology and major risks that may be encountered in tunnel construction, and the Gaoligongshan Tunnel is known as the "geological museum" of tunnel construction.
The shaft is the most important auxiliary tunnel of the Gaoligongshan Tunnel, which shoulders the important task of increasing the working surface to achieve "long tunnel and short fighting" and ventilation of railway operation in the later stage.
The No. 1 shaft was successfully excavated to the bottom of the shaft, marking the official entry of the Gaoligongshan Tunnel into the horizontal tunnel construction, and after the excavation of the underground parking lot and the replacement of equipment, 4 working faces can be added underground to speed up the excavation of the tunnel.
"The shafts are all in the granite formation, because there are many cracks in the granite formation, the water can't be stopped, and the flow from top to bottom is non-stop, basically how deep the well is, how big the water pressure is. ”
Si Jingzhao, chief engineer of the Dalui Railway Project Department of China Railway Tunnel Bureau, told reporters that during the construction of the shaft, there were many dangerous situations such as mud inrush and collapse, and the construction party invited experts to take the pulse on the spot and discussed the treatment plan more than 20 times.
"The water inflow in the shaft is at its maximum, reaching more than 300 cubic meters per hour, and the bottom of the shaft is more than 700 meters deep, and the water pressure is equivalent to the seabed at a depth of 700 meters. ”
Si Jingzhao said, "If we don't pump and drain water in time, the well will be flooded 10 meters in one hour, and we spend almost 85% of our time controlling water and 15% of our time excavating." ”
In order to overcome the geological problems such as the development of longitudinal joints, mud inrush and water-rich granite in the surrounding rock of Shaft 1, the tunnel construction adopts systematic water control measures combining "exploration, injection and excavation" to reduce the construction risk.
After many improvements, the construction of No. 1 shaft has formed mechanized assembly lines such as excavation system, ballast system, suspension system, and winch hoisting system, which has realized the whole process of mechanized operations such as drilling, blasting, ballasting, formwork installation, and concrete pouring, and accelerated the construction progress.
In the end, after more than 1,200 days and nights of construction, the shaft was successfully excavated to a depth of 762.59 meters.
With a total length of 330 kilometers, the Dalui Railway is an important part of the China-Myanmar International Corridor and an important transportation infrastructure for the implementation of the "Belt and Road" construction.
After the completion and opening to traffic, the driving time from Dali to Ruili will be shortened from 6 hours to 2 hours, which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in western Yunnan and promote economic and trade cooperation and friendly personnel exchanges between China and South and Southeast Asian countries.
Carrie Lam: As a Chinese, we are proud of our country's achievements
Hong Kong's press circles celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The "Hong Kong Press Reception to Celebrate the 70 th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China" was held in Hong Kong on 27 July.
Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, pointed out in her speech at the reception that the achievements of our country in the past 70 years are obvious to the world, and we as Chinese are proud of it.
Carrie Lam, Deputy Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Lu Xinning, Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong Song Ruan, Deputy Political Commissar of the People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison Chen Yading, and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Celebration of the National Day of the Hong Kong Press Jiang Zaizhong attended the reception and officiated at the reception.
Carrie Lam pointed out in her speech that in the past 70 years, China has forged ahead, and although it has faced many difficulties and challenges, it has overcome and surpassed them one by one, and the achievements it has made are obvious to the world, and we as Chinese are proud of it.
Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, it has been closely linked with the mainland, working hand in hand to make progress and share fruitful results.
It is believed that under the premise of "One Country, Two Systems", Hong Kong can continue to leverage its advantages in the future, seize the opportunities arising from the Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and seek a better future for Hong Kong.
She also said that in the past few months, there have been many social controversies in Hong Kong, which has affected everyone in Hong Kong and faced different challenges for journalists.
At this critical juncture, I hope that friends in the media will continue to rise to the challenge, uphold professionalism, make fair and fair news reports for the society, and contribute to the future of Hong Kong and the return of the society to rational communication and dialogue.
In his speech, Jiang Zaizhong pointed out that the glorious course that New China has traversed is also a course of common development, common progress, blood ties, and weal and woe between Hong Kong and the motherland.
In particular, since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the central government has unswervingly implemented the principles of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong," and a high degree of autonomy.
To this end, the Hong Kong press gathered together to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
He said that in the past three months, there has been a series of violent activities in Hong Kong that are blatantly illegal and wantonly undermine social stability, and some media have published distorted and false reports, which have played a role in fueling the violent activities.
He called on the media to stir up the chaos and create a good atmosphere for the whole people to resist violence and uphold the rule of law.
Professional media personnel should scrupulously abide by the norms of the journalistic profession, use truthful reports and responsible remarks to guide citizens to consciously separate themselves from violence, and safeguard the fairness and majesty of the law.
About 500 people from the Hong Kong press and other sectors attended the reception and raised glasses with the officiating guests to send blessings to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The reporter learned from the Propaganda Department of the Xining Municipal Party Committee that Xining City will implement the "Regulations on the Promotion of Civilized Behavior in Xining City" on October 1, focusing on 15 uncivilized behaviors such as pedestrians not passing according to traffic lights and throwing objects from buildings, making a list of key governance and setting corresponding penalties.
Wang Shengbin, deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Xining Municipal Party Committee and director of the Municipal Civilization Office, said that since Xining was awarded the title of National Civilized City in 2017, the civilized literacy and moral level of citizens have been significantly improved.
However, uncivilized behaviors such as jaywalking, running red lights, non-motorized vehicles not following traffic lights, throwing objects from high altitudes and car windows, smoking in public places, walking dogs in public places, and allowing open defecation and defecation are still very prominent and easy to rebound, and need to be solved as soon as possible.

British tourist car keys fell into the lake and the whole family was trapped in France for five days
Recently, a couple in Wales, England, took their two children on vacation to France, but accidentally dropped the car keys into the lake, and the family was forced to wait for five days to get the new keys prepared by the car manufacturer.
The couple then left France with their children.
According to reports, on September 16, local time, when the British family was visiting a lake in France, their daughter accidentally knocked over a leather bag and the car keys inside fell into the lake.
But it took them hours and they couldn't find the key.
And all their belongings and cash were locked in the car.
Despite the fact that the British tourist had purchased insurance before departure, the insurance company refused to help on the grounds that there was no danger of theft of the vehicle.
They hired a trailer to take the car to a garage for storage, and then reordered the keys from the car manufacturer.
A few days later, the British tourists finally got the prepared keys, and the couple left France with their children.
Their scheduled trip was cancelled due to the loss of their car keys.

(Dubai, 27th) From now on, Saudi Arabia officially opened tourist visas to 49 countries, including China, with a total visa fee of 440 Saudi riyals (about 836 yuan).

In the field of low-risk varieties of food production licenses, the notification and commitment system will be piloted, and the representative offices of foreign enterprises will be delegated to the free trade zone
On the 27th, the Shanghai Municipal Administration for Market Regulation and the Pudong New Area Government signed a memorandum of understanding to launch 20 market supervision reform measures, some of which are the first pilot measures in the country.
According to reports, the notification commitment refers to the administrative organ's one-time notification of the conditions and requirements stipulated by laws and regulations to the applicant in writing when handling the relevant license registration matters.
After the applicant signs the pledge, the administrative organ can directly handle it.
According to the memorandum, the Shanghai market supervision department will support the Pudong New Area and the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone to pilot the notification and commitment system in three areas: enterprise name registration, simple process and low-risk food production license, and type approval of some measuring instruments, so as to make enterprise access more convenient.
Shanghai Shao Wansheng Food Co., Ltd. obtained the "Food Production License" on the spot by informing and promising on the 27th, becoming the first enterprise to enjoy the pilot dividend.
The person in charge of the enterprise said that the food license can also be obtained on the spot, and the method of "tolerant acceptance" has been adopted, that is, the enterprise is allowed to submit some materials within the time limit agreed in the notification commitment, "I really feel the convenience of the reform." ”
According to the Shanghai market supervision department, the implementation of the notification and commitment system for food production licenses is the first pilot in the country.
After the reform, the examination and approval process has been compressed from the previous 6 links of "registration, acceptance, on-site verification, sampling inspection, material review, and approval and certificate making" to 3 links of "registration, acceptance, and approval of the certificate", and the completion time has been shortened from 20 working days before the reform to the on-the-spot completion.
Taking into account the high degree of economic extroversion of Pudong, the Shanghai market supervision department has delegated the registration authority of the resident representative offices of foreign (regional) enterprises to the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, so as to facilitate the enterprises to handle the registration nearby.
Statistics show that a total of 1,592 permanent representative offices in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone have been involved in this decentralization, of which 99 have been handled in accordance with the new regulations.
"Eleventh" long holiday consumption survey: more diversified choices tourism occupies the first place.
The National Day holiday is approaching, and people's holiday plans are gradually being finalized.
The "Securities Daily" reporter recently launched a small survey on the "Eleventh" holiday arrangement in the circle of friends, and received nearly 20 pieces of feedback showing that although everyone's plans are different, "tourism + consumption" has become the key word of the "Eleventh" holiday.
Specifically, in the feedback obtained by the reporter of the Securities Daily, more than half of the people chose to travel.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said, "I plan to take my family to Shanghai during the 'National Day' period, Disney is the first stop, and then go to the surrounding cities for a turn"; Ms. Li's family in Beijing chose to travel to Taiwan, China, "a family of three set off on September 28 and planned a ten-day trip around the island"; Ms. Ma from Chongqing is planning an outbound trip to Singapore, while Mr. Zhang and his family from Hebei Province have chosen to travel by car, saying that "my daughter is less than two years old, and it is not convenient to go far away, so I plan to drive to Shandong and spend a few days at the beach."
According to the "2019 National Day Golden Week Residents' Travel and Travel Trend Report" jointly released by Tongcheng-Elong and Tongcheng Tourism, the consumption upgrade trend of travel and travel during this year's National Day Golden Week is obvious in the three sub-sectors of travel, accommodation and tourism.
The penetration rate of airplane and high-speed rail travel has increased steadily, and the proportion of demand for star-rated hotels and personalized non-standard accommodation has increased.
On September 23, Meituan released the "2019 National Day Tourism Consumption Trend Report", which shows that tourism consumption continues to be strong, and shows a trend of diversification and upgrading of "food, housing, transportation and play".
More young people are favoring high-quality and distinctive experiences when traveling, and the popularity of cultural tourism and night tourism continues to rise.
In addition to tourism, all kinds of consumer demand are also released during the "Eleventh" period.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the Securities Daily, "The main plan for this year's 'Eleventh' is to buy a car. ”
A staff member of a 4S store of an automobile brand in Beijing told the "Securities Daily" reporter that generally speaking, September and October of each year are known as the golden period of car sales.
During the "Eleventh" period, many activities will be launched in stores, such as lucky draws, in-store discounts, etc.
In addition, many brands have recently launched new models, and it is expected that the new products will have a more obvious effect on sales.
Under the trend of consumption upgrading, people pay more attention to the satisfaction of spiritual needs, and the proportion of service consumption such as culture and education continues to increase.
Ms. Du, who lives in Beijing, said, "Since the birth of a child, cultural and educational consumption has become the bulk of household consumption expenditure.
This year's 'Eleventh' was full, and I had to go to the 'check-in' planetarium and children's theater, and I made an appointment with a few families to go to the Elk Museum to set up tents and camp on the weekend, and also arranged some trial experience classes. ”
Some people in the industry said that, theoretically speaking, the evolution path of residents' consumption upgrading is from survival consumption to development consumption and enjoyment consumption, of which a considerable part of the enjoyment consumption is the category of service consumption.
With the continuous development of China's economy and society and the rising income level of residents, people pay more and more attention to the spiritual level of consumer demand, tourism and travel is a good way.
Especially to catch up with the "Eleventh" National Day holiday, there is more time, and people are more willing to travel and consume, which can not only meet the spiritual consumption demand, but also the embodiment of residents' consumption upgrading.
In the afternoon, I began to be lonely, and I was reluctant to go out, and I had not adjusted to the state that the children were not around.
Cheer up and say to the dog Nana: Mommy will take you out.
wrote in detail about a few things to do when I went out, and the character traits of blood type A became stronger and stronger, and I felt very awkward.
Take a suit, buy nutritious grains, pay, buy sashimi, a small snack of Nana.
That's why you go out.
On the phone, I just finished telling my sister Aiqiang that thanks to Nana, otherwise there would be no excuse to buy snacks.
There was a perfunctory laugh over there, saying that the child was calling and hung up.
Nana jumped into the assistant's seat with a familiar car and got down honestly, she knew that she was motion sick, panicked, and unwilling not to accompany me.
It is rare for her husband Boao to come back early.
I was amazed at the salad with salmon and avocado, and then went to the bedroom to lie on the bed and watch TV.
Looking at the pole on the wall, it was just 7 o'clock, and the sunset in the country of sunrise was early, and it was already dark.
The circle of friends is inventing the month, and it turns out that today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.
I washed a bunch of grapes sent by a friend, kept half of them for Boao, and put the rest in a bowl of small flowers that I liked, and took them out to see the moon.
I sat on the ground with Nana, I ate the grapes and she ate the skins, and I spit out the seeds of the grapes far away.
The moon is hiding in the clouds, but fortunately, when the clouds are walking, the moon flickers and appears, and it is a little dazzling when it is bright and dark.
There are all kinds of poems about the bright moon in my mind, but I only like this sentence clearly: Reunion every three or five / full of clear light jade fence / a round in the sky / all the surnames in the world look up.
Maybe we give the moonlight too much emotion, for me now, in fact, the sentence God's to God, Caesar's to Caesar is the best.
The moonlight is the moonlight, and the emotions are yours.
After eating the grapes, this cold moon is cold.
Nana snored slightly at her feet, stood up, and spread Nana's little blanket on the edge of her little house, on which Nana lay happily.
Pull open the door and shout: Is the bathwater boiled?
You can't see the moon from the bathroom window, you can only feel the moonlight, turn off the bathroom light, and pull the glass open.
I didn't eat mooncakes or drink alcohol.

Is MCA contesting in the Johor state parliamentary by-election for Tanjung Piai?
MCA President Datuk Seri Wee Ka Siong: "Submit it to the BN Supreme Council for discussion!"
With the Tanjung Piai national seat by-election just around the corner, it will be interesting to see whether the MCA of BN member parties will contest this traditional seat.
However, after the MCA meeting, it was announced that it would be up to the BN Supreme Council to decide whether the traditional MCA seat would continue to be contested by MCA or replaced by other member parties.
Speaking to the media on Thursday afternoon after chairing a meeting of the MCA Central Committee, Wee Ka Siong said that any by-election would be conducted in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), which would require a meeting of the BN Supreme Council before the decision could be finalized.
He said the BN Supreme Council meeting was expected to take place in early October as the Election Commission will only meet next Monday (1st) to finalise the by-election for the Tanjung Piai seat.
"Yesterday (26th) morning, I also met with BN chairman Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Zahid and we all agreed on the need to regain this seat from Pakatan Harapan (PH). ”
"We have finalised a special BN leadership meeting in early October, where the leaders of the three BN parties will determine which member party will contest. ”
Asked if MCA would insist on contesting the traditional seat in the BN Supreme Council, Wee reiterated that as MCA president, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures and therefore any decision must be made by BN.
"In any by-election, it's common for people to be willing to run, political parties, parties to think they should come out. ”
"The most important thing is what organization and political alliance do we come from?"
"This is a big test of the political coalition we have formed over the years and we believe BN has upheld some valuable values along the way. ”
"In the process, some people may say something, and that's not unusual. ”
"But once the BN Supreme Council has made a decision, everyone has to prepare for the war with all their might, and that's the most valuable thing. ”
In any case, Wee said that MCA will go all out to prepare for the upcoming Tanjung Piai by-election with three levels, namely the district councils, the state liaison committee and the central government.
"The district committee will be led by the (Tanjung Piai) district committee chairman Datuk Seri Wong Yat Seng , the state liaison committee will be led by the Johor state liaison committee acting chairman Datuk Lim Pei Heng, and the central committee will be deployed by acting president Datuk Ma Han Soon and general secretary Datuk Teo Seng Wen. ”
Last Saturday (21st), Bumiputera Solidarity Party Tanjung Piai MP Datuk Mohd Farit passed away at Pontian Government Hospital at the age of 42 due to heart problems.
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province was ordered to "patrol the mountains" for hunting wild animals
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province, was sentenced to prison for hunting wild animals, and at the same time ordered to compensate 15,420 yuan (RMB, the same below) for the cost of repairing ecological resources and environmental damage.
Due to the poverty of the defendant's family, the procuratorate used alternative labor to compensate for the cost of ecological restoration, realizing the organic unity of legal and social effects.
Wang Zhongliang, deputy procurator general of the Baokang County Procuratorate, introduced on the 27th that through 3 months of alternative labor such as "voluntary patrols", the defendant Zhou has established a deep relationship with wild macaques, and feels deeply remorseful for his previous animal hunting.
On June 21 this year, a criminal attached civil public interest lawsuit in the field of ecological resources filed by the Baokang County Procuratorate was openly tried in the county court and the verdict was pronounced in court.
Defendant Zhou was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment, suspended for 4 years, and fined 3,000 yuan, and ordered to compensate 15,420 yuan for the restoration of ecological resources and environmental damage.
After investigation, Zhou began to set up a power grid at the cliff in late January 2014 and hunted more than 20 wild animals, including impalas, small muntjacs, hairy crowned deer, etc.
Impala is a national second-class endangered wild protected animal, and the small muntjac and hairy crowned deer are listed in the "National Terrestrial Wildlife Protection List".
During the trial, Zhou confessed to his illegal facts and behavior, and was willing to bear attached civil liability.
However, considering the poor economic situation of Zhou's family, under the coordination of the Baokang County Procuratorate, the local village committee, Lin Zhan, and Zhou reached an agreement on alternative labor compensation for ecological restoration costs: that is, Zhou provided public welfare labor services to compensate for ecological restoration costs by carrying out macaque domestication and management work, voluntary mountain patrols, and forest protection in the village macaque reserve for one year.
The court recognized the prosecutor's suggestion and agreed that while Zhou was executing a suspended sentence, he would actively fulfill the obligation of "alternative labor to compensate for the cost of ecological restoration".
At present, Zhou has been working on a voluntary basis in the macaque sanctuary for 3 months, actively patrolling the mountains and performing well.
In recent years, the Baokang County Procuratorate has organically integrated procuratorial functions and social governance behaviors in practice, scientifically using supervision methods such as procuratorial suggestions, investigation supervision, and litigation supervision, and minimizing the damage caused by criminal acts to the ecological environment with the help of judicial means.
UN awards Champions of the Earth Award to Ant Forest
Amid warm applause and magnificent music, Xu Di, the leader of the "Ant Forest" project, and Shen Junliang, the user representative, walked onto the podium and received the trophy of the 2019 United Nations "Champions of the Earth" award from the host.
The 2019 Champions of the Earth award ceremony was held in New York, USA on the 26th, and the "Ant Forest" project, which uses mobile phone mini programs to drive hundreds of millions of people to participate in environmental protection actions, won the "Incentive and Action Award".
A week earlier, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) had announced the winners at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but the excitement of the ceremony was still unconcealed.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said that the "Ant Forest" is an exciting innovation that has brought hundreds of millions of people into action to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans can do for the environment.
It uses technology to connect people and the environment, so that everyone can participate in the action to protect the planet, which will have a huge impact.
Launched in August 2016 by China's Ant Financial Services Group (Ant Financial) on the Alipay platform, "Ant Forest" allows users to accumulate "green energy" and "plant trees" on their mobile phones by recording their daily lives in green travel and paying utility bills online.
Every time a user grows a virtual tree, Ant Forest and its charity partners will plant a real tree in the desertified area.
As of August this year, 500 million "Ant Forest" users have reduced carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons, and 122 million trees have been planted in desertified areas.
Costa Rica was awarded the "Champions of the Earth" award on the same day for its national environmental efforts, and Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado, who came to receive the award, praised the contribution of the "Ant Forest", "It is impressive to be able to inspire so many people to participate in green action".
Jing Xiandong, Chairman and CEO of Ant Financial, said that the Champions of the Earth Award is an affirmation of the "Ant Forest" project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for everyone to participate in a low-carbon life, and this honor belongs to all participants.
Jing Xiandong said that in the past three years, the "Ant Forest" has affected 500 million people, and the goal of the "Ant Forest" in the next three years is to bring 1 billion people around the world to participate in low-carbon actions.
While preventing desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how to make farmers' income come from more green mountains and clear waters.
In addition to providing employment opportunities through tree planting, it also hopes to help farmers increase their incomes through agricultural product development projects and e-commerce platforms.
The public welfare and environmental protection model based on digital technology created by "Ant Forest" has also successfully gone overseas and has been used as a reference by other countries.
In June this year, GCash, the largest "e-wallet" in the Philippines, launched the Philippine version of "Ant Forest" to encourage Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon living.
According to reports, GCash will work with the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources, environmental protection public welfare organizations, etc., and plans to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the project's launch.
The Champions of the Earth Award is the highest award in the field of environmental protection at the United Nations and is awarded annually.
The "Ant Forest" award is the third consecutive year that a green innovation project from China has won the "Incentive and Action Award", following the builder of China's Saihanba Forest Farm and the "Thousand Villages Demonstration and Ten Thousand Villages Remediation" project in Zhejiang Province, China.
Economic and trade frictions affect the "report card" of the U.S. economy.
The U.S. economic "report card" for the second quarter of this year showed that the growth rate of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) slowed significantly from the previous quarter, affected by the sharp decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts pointed out that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they brought were the main reasons for the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on the 26th showed that U.S. GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2% in the second quarter, the same as the previously announced revised data, but significantly lower than the 3.1% in the first quarter.
According to the data, consumption growth became the main factor supporting the growth of the US economy in the second quarter.
Personal consumption expenditures, which account for about 70% of the total U.S. economy, increased by 4.6% quarter-on-quarter, driving economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumption expenditure and investment drove economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment fell by 6.3 percent from the previous quarter in the second quarter, dragging down the economic growth of the quarter by 1.16 percentage points, while exports fell by 5.7 percent from the previous quarter, and net exports dragged down the economic growth of the quarter by 0.68 percentage points.
Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ironside Macroeconomic Consulting, said that private sector investment not only failed to maintain the momentum of last year's growth, but fell sharply, as economic and trade frictions and rising uncertainty hit business confidence.
Knapp believes that under the influence of policy uncertainty, U.S. corporate capital spending is expected to remain in a downward trend next year.
Analysts believe that although consumption growth has formed a strong support for the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are more and more signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty brought by them have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected the outlook for U.S. consumption.
Richard Curtin, the head of the survey and a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, said a few days ago that in the latest survey, 38% of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, a new high in a year and a half.
As for the future trend of the U.S. economy, analysts generally believe that the U.S. economy will continue to slow down.
However, some experts said that if economic and trade frictions are eased, the performance of the US industrial sector and financial markets will improve.
Kelyn Burch, a global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit in the UK, predicts that the US economy will continue its gradual downward trend since the beginning of this year, and the growth rate will fall to a lower level than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, predicts that the U.S. economy will grow by 2.3 percent this year and slow further to 1.6 percent next year, assuming that economic and trade frictions do not continue to escalate.
Ellen Hutzen, investment manager at Putnam Investments, pointed out that the biggest concern of companies at present is the economic and trade disputes and the uncertainty they bring, and if the economic and trade disputes can be resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced, and the performance of the industrial sector will be much better than it is now.
Matt Melly, equity strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said that economic and trade frictions are still the "primary problem" and the main reason for the sharp volatility in the U.S. capital market this year, and whether the economic and trade frictions can be properly resolved will be the key to affecting the direction of the U.S. capital market for the rest of the year.
Ningxia pioneered joint parental leave for couples, and parents of children aged 0 to 3 can take 10 days per year
Protecting women's legitimate rights and interests is an embodiment of respecting and protecting human rights, and is also an important symbol of social civilization and progress.
On September 27, at the 15th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the "Regulations on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region" was passed by a large majority.
This is the first provincial-level local regulation in Ningxia to comprehensively and systematically safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of women, which will be officially implemented on November 1, 2019.
It is understood that the "Regulations" adopted this time are revised on the basis of the 2007 "Measures for the Implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests in Ningxia", which is divided into 9 chapters and 65 articles, including general provisions, political rights, cultural and educational rights, labor and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, marriage and family rights, legal responsibilities, and supplementary provisions.
In the "Regulations", Ningxia encourages the exploration of the implementation of joint parental leave between husband and wife, which is the first in the country.
In April this year, the General Office of the State Council promulgated the "Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Development of Infant and Child Care Services for Children Under the Age of Three", which has a relevant description of joint parenting between husband and wife.
In the process of revising the "Regulations", Ningxia innovatively proposed to "encourage employers to grant 10 days of joint parental leave to both husband and wife each year during the period between the children and the age of 3 for couples who have children in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations".
At the same time, the Regulations highlight anti-sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative achievements in the personality rights section of China's current Civil Code, and provides detailed provisions on the constituent elements of sexual harassment, the subject and mechanism of counter-sexual harassment, etc.
Article 44 of the Regulations explicitly prohibits frequent incidents of sexual assault against girls, and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and prevention work, becoming a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
Article 35 of the Regulations clearly stipulates women's right to know about joint property and the obligations of property registration agencies and related subjects, so as to provide solid institutional support for women's rights protection.
In addition, in response to the hot issue of gender discrimination in employment, Article 26 of the Regulations not only prohibits direct discrimination, but also orders the prohibition of indirect discrimination, and absorbs the latest practical experience of joint interviews, strengthens the punishment of gender discrimination violations, and more effectively protects the legitimate rights and interests of women.
In recent years, the Ningxia Women's Federation, together with the Department of Public Security, Procuratorate, Civil Affairs and other departments, has achieved remarkable results in promoting and introducing social professional forces to participate in the mediation of marital and family conflicts and disputes and anti-domestic violence.
The Regulations summarize and improve this, and in a number of laws and regulations, they encourage the mobilization of social forces and the accumulation of social resources to jointly protect women's rights and interests, and require the people's governments at or above the county level to provide stable and institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services and other means.
Academician Yuan Longping of Inner Mongolia Xing'an League, salt and alkali tolerant rice, and the yield of rice per mu exceeded 1,000 catties
The reporter learned from the Administrative Office of the Xing'an League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on the 27th that the "Xing'an League Academician Yuan Longping Workstation On-site Yield Measurement and Acceptance Appraisal Meeting" held by the league a few days ago came with good news, and the average yield of saline-alkali tolerant rice per mu exceeded 1,000 catties.
The yield measurement expert group composed of six experts from the Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yangzhou University and the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs sampled and harvested the "Xingyan series" rice on the spot.
According to expert evaluation, the average yield of saline-alkali tolerant rice per mu in land with a pH value of 8.8 to 9.6 and a salinity content of 5‰ to 6‰ reached 508.8 kg.
Wang Shigang, executive director of the Yuan Longping Academician Workstation of the Xing'an League, said: "Our next step is to innovate and reform on the basis of this year's experiment, and cultivate and optimize the saline-alkali tolerant rice varieties again, so as to make the quality better and the yield higher." ”
Lai Yongcai, the leader of the yield measurement expert group, vice president and researcher of the Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said: "Under the premise that the factors of production remain unchanged, I believe that we will continue to strengthen scientific and technological research, and saline-alkali tolerant rice will continue to produce miracles on saline-alkali land." ”
The Xing'an League belongs to the concentrated contiguous poverty-stricken areas at the southern foot of the Great Khing'an Mountains.
In October 2018, Yuan Longping Academician Workstation was unveiled in Xing'an League.
Academician Yuan Longping led a team of experts to speed up the introduction and promotion of the latest cultivation of "saline-alkali tolerant hybrid rice" varieties and advanced technology, and built a 960-acre saline-alkali tolerant rice base in the Horqin Right Wing Central Banner.
The on-site yield measurement of saline-alkali tolerant rice not only injected hope for the promotion of saline-alkali medium and low-yield fields in Xing'an League to medium and high-yield fields, but also provided a scientific basis for rice planting in saline-alkali land under the same conditions in China.
According to the Australian Network, after marathon debates and weeks of protests, on September 26, local time, New South Wales, Australia, passed the abortion legalization bill.
It is reported that the bill has sparked political debate in the past eight weeks, and since independent MP Greenwich announced the introduction of the bill, there have been serious divisions within the Australian Liberal Party.
According to the report, after nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Australian New Zealand Senate passed the abortion legalization bill by 26 votes to 14 on the evening of the 25th, making it the third longest bill in the NSW Senate.
On the morning of the 26th, after a final vote in the House of Representatives of NSW, abortion was legalized in NSW.
The bill allows women to terminate pregnancies at 22 weeks of pregnancy and also allows women to have an abortion later in pregnancy if two doctors agree.
The Senate passed an amendment on the evening of the 25th that doctors can seek advice from the multidisciplinary panel of the hospital advisory committee before performing an abortion for a woman after 22 weeks of pregnancy.
In addition, the amendments passed by the Senate include that doctors must provide proper care for babies who survive the termination of pregnancy.
The NSW Premier has faced public criticism from conservatives on the bill, and she did not attend the final vote after she stepped in on several occasions to buy more time for the bill.
Berry Jiklian defended his absence from the vote, saying: "I need to spend time managing the whole NSW. ”
It is reported that Davis, a Liberal MP from Australia, was once the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, and once threatened to quit the NSW government because of the bill, and said that the bill had triggered a "government crisis".
But after that, Davis made a concession.
Davis said: "The content of the amendment to the bill to legalize abortion, which was submitted to the House of Representatives on the morning of the 26th, actually provides more protections for women and doctors. ”
Meanwhile, Barilaro, leader of Australia's NSW National Party, said he was proud to be part of the government that legalised abortion.
"What we achieved last night was historic for NSW in that it legalised abortion, where abortion was no longer a crime and women who had abortions were not treated as criminals. ”

Liu Kun, Minister of Finance: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred 860.1 billion yuan of state-owned assets to enrich the social security fund.
Liu Kun, Minister of Finance, said on the 27th that up to now, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, with a total transfer of state-owned capital of about 860.1 billion yuan.
Liu Kun made the above statement at the national task deployment meeting for the transfer of part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund jointly held by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission on the same day.
"The transfer of part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, is an important measure to reform and improve the basic pension insurance system, is the development of state-owned enterprises to share the results of the whole people and the basic pension insurance system intergenerational fairness of the full embodiment, is a based on the current, taking into account the long-term policy measures. ”
In 2017, the State Council issued the "Implementation Plan for the Transfer of Part of the State-owned Capital to Enrich the Social Security Fund", requiring the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to carry out pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, the preliminary work of the transfer has achieved positive results.
At the central level, three batches of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been transferred, with a total of about 860.1 billion yuan of state-owned capital.
Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions in which the Ministry of Finance performs the duties of investors has been basically completed.
The transfer of central enterprises has a certain scale.
At the local level, the preliminary work of enterprise transfer has been carried out one after another.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had been basically completed, with 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan of state-owned capital transferred respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also carried out preparatory work for the transfer, laying the foundation for the next step of the transfer.
According to the notice jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the transfer of part of the state-owned capital by the central and local governments to enrich the social security fund will be fully launched in 2019 and basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on the same day made specific arrangements for the comprehensive implementation of the transfer work.
The meeting stressed the need to complete the transfer work in a pragmatic and efficient manner.
"According to the schedule, the transfer work should be basically completed by the end of 2020.
The transfer work time is tight and the task is heavy. ”
Liu Kun said: All localities and departments should make meticulous organizations and careful arrangements to ensure that the transfer work is completed as required; promote the work in a down-to-earth manner, accurately grasp the content of the transfer policy; strengthen communication and coordination, and promptly resolve difficult problems.
State-owned assets transfer to enrich the social security fund - starting from the starting point of "enriching the social security fund money bag", the destination is to provide strong support for the old-age security.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple "physical displacement" of equity, but a "mathematical addition".
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation and the China Securities Regulatory Commission jointly issued the "Notice on Comprehensively Promoting the Transfer of Part of the State-owned Capital to Enrich the Social Security Fund", clarifying the timetable for the transfer of state-owned assets to the social security fund, that is, the central and local transfer of part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund will be fully launched in 2019.
After the document was released, the Ministry of Finance and other departments also implemented it quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10% of the shares held by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China to the Social Security Fund, with a total value of more than 115 billion yuan.
According to the regulations, the social security fund and other undertaking entities, as financial investors, enjoy the right to income, the right to dispose of and the right to know about the state-owned equity.
ICBC and ABC stated in the announcement that the change in equity will not lead to a change in the controlling shareholder and actual controller of the Bank.
In this regard, the author believes that similar equity transfer of state-owned enterprises is not a simple change of equity ownership, but an "addition operation" that can stimulate a series of effects.
The first step of the transfer of some state-owned assets to social security, the "addition result", can naturally reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises and the sharing of development results.
After years of reform and development, most of the state-owned enterprises, especially the central enterprises, are in important industries and fields in China's economy, and the overall profitability is strong and stable.
Among them, the leading enterprises continue to achieve excellence, bigger and stronger.
On July 10, the executive meeting of the State Council decided to comprehensively promote the transfer of part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately said that it would work with relevant departments, according to the deployment of the executive meeting of the State Council, to do a good job in comprehensively promoting the transfer of part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, fully reflecting the intergenerational fairness of the basic pension insurance system and the development of state-owned enterprises to share with the whole people.
The second step of the transfer, the "addition result", is to enhance the sustainability of China's social security fund and further consolidate the foundation of the pension and social security system.
With the aging of the population, China's social security funds are under pressure, and most of the state-owned assets as the main body of the transfer have the ability to make sustained profits and dividends, which can not only effectively supplement the social security fund, but also provide a source of living water for the social security fund.
Some estimates show that for every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital transferred, the contribution ratio of basic pension insurance of enterprises can be reduced by 1 percentage point.
The third step of the transfer, the "addition result", is to add a stabilizer to the capital market.
The way to obtain income from the main body of this transfer is "dividends as the mainstay, supplemented by operation".
As a financial investor of state-owned capital, the social security fund is indeed mainly based on equity dividend income.
However, as a value investor in the capital market, the social security fund has a strong capital operation ability.
For the listed assets in the state-owned capital, the participation of the social security fund in the shareholding will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, which is conducive to improving the level of enterprise operation and has a positive impact on listed companies and the capital market.
At the same time, as an investment vane, the increase in the weight of social security funds is conducive to further enhancing its influence in the market and playing a "stabilizer" role in the market.
In addition, it is also conducive to giving full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors and guiding investors to invest rationally and value.
At the age of 18, Karl Hartmann entered the Leipzig Conservatory, where he studied with Webern.
After the Nazis came to power, Hartmann first resisted by not publishing his works in Germany, and later even stopped writing.
In 1933, he composed the symphonic Miserae and dedicated it to "My Sleeping Friends".
In 1935, the symphony premiered in Prague, but was harassed by the Nazi bureaucracy.
After that, Hartmann was determined not to play any of his own compositions under the Nazis.
Hartmann's Funeral Concerto is a concerto for violin and strings when the manuscript of the piece was smuggled out of Germany for its premiere in Switzerland.
Listen to the funeral concerto performed by the Bern Chamber Orchestra at the Beethoven Festival in 2018.
The U.S. Senate approves Scalia as Secretary of Labor-Xinhuanet
Washington, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate voted on September 26 to approve President Trump's nomination of Eugene Scalia to be Secretary of Labor.
The vote was 53 in favor and 44 against, with no Democrats voting for Scalia.
Republicans believe Scalia's resume makes him a good fit for the post of labor secretary.
But in the eyes of Democrats, Scalia has long been on the opposite side of workers and unions during his career as a lawyer.
Scalia will succeed Alexandre Acosta.
Acosta, then Secretary of Labor, announced his resignation in July this year under huge public pressure after allegedly giving "leniency" to American billionaire Jeffrey Epstein for alleged sexual assault and trafficking of teenage girls.
Scalia, 56, is a partner at a well-known law firm in the United States, and his father is the late Justice Antonin Scalia of the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Department of Labor is a cabinet-level department of the U.S. federal government that oversees labor-related matters.
The White House also issued a statement on the same day saying that Trump had nominated Peter Geyner, acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to formally lead the agency.
According to the procedure, Gainner's nomination must also be approved by the Senate.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and coordinates federal government resources to deal with emergencies such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks in the United States and their aftermath.
Since the debut of the military parade marking the 35 th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the "jumboum" phalanx of the Strategic Missile Forces has appeared every time a major military parade has been organized.
"This National Day military parade is the first appearance of the Rocket Army on Chang'an Avenue after the 'soldier' changed from 'army' to 'army'. ”

Iran has been confirmed to have developed advanced centrifuges and further suspended the implementation of the JCPOA
Chinanews.com, September 27 According to the "Central News Agency", the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on the 26th that Iran has once again violated the JCPOA by using advanced centrifuges to make enriched uranium.
Iran is reportedly progressively violating JCPOA restrictions in response to US President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA in May 2018 and reinstatement and tightening sanctions on Iran.
Iran has suspended two other commitments in July, namely to keep its stocks of enriched uranium below 300 kilograms and to enrich uranium to no more than 3.67 percent pure, and is now taking it further.
Under the nuclear deal, Iran will be able to accumulate enriched uranium by installing only about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz, and will only allow Iran to use a small number of more advanced models for research purposes, but will not produce enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, potentially for use in the manufacture of nuclear bombs.
According to the report, the IAEA report states: "On September 25, the agency confirmed that Iran has developed advanced centrifuges of Model 2 and Model 3... Accumulation or preparation for accumulation of enriched uranium. ”
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented the report to member states on the 26th, and a diplomat responded: "They are busy on the (Natanz enriched uranium) facility." ”

Italy's education minister has proposed a sugar tax to protect people's health.
Lorenzo Fioramonti, Minister of Education of Italy's new government and a member of the Five Star Movement, recently submitted a motion to parliament proposing that the Italian government implement a new tax policy on sugary drinks, snacks and air tickets.
According to reports, according to the bill motion proposed by Education Minister Fioramoni, the Italian government will impose a snack tax on sugary drinks, snacks and other unhealthy food and beverage goods, and at the same time impose a strict environmental tax on air tickets, with 1 euro for domestic flights and 1.5 euros for international flights.
Fiora Monti said that through this seemingly small series of tax measures, the Italian government is expected to receive 3 billion euros in tax revenue.
The proceeds of this tax will be used in the fields of education, health and environmental protection.
In response, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said he thought it was a viable option, while Italian parliamentarian, European parliamentarian and League leader Salvini tweeted sarcastically, asking everyone to hide desserts, biscuits, bread and sweets as soon as possible, because the new government is going to start a snack tax.
The report pointed out that the snack tax generally refers to a special tax on sugary drinks and high-calorie foods.
The imposition of this tax would contribute to the public health benefits.

Baidu's first fleet of robotaxis began trial operation
Yesterday, Baidu announced in Changsha that the trial operation of the Robotaxi fleet was officially launched.
The first batch of 45 Apollo and FAW Hongqi jointly developed the "Hongqi EV" Robotaxi fleet in Changsha and started trial operation in some of the open test sections in Changsha.
From now on, ordinary Changsha citizens can log on to the official website of Apollo to apply to become seed users and have the opportunity to test ride the experience.
One of the experience passengers said that he sat in the back of the vehicle, clicked on the screen in front of the passenger seat, and started the vehicle's autonomous driving trip with one click.
In the car, for the safety of passengers and the requirements of current policies and regulations, the trial operation vehicle is equipped with a safety officer in the driver's seat to maximize the safety of passengers.
In the process of driving, the vehicle can intelligently change lanes according to the road conditions, and can also judge the driving conditions of surrounding vehicles, and make automatic avoidance for short-range overtaking.
Throughout the experience, the screen in the passenger area shows the road conditions of pedestrians, cars, and even some traditional blind spots on the road in real time.
Even if the vehicle is blocked, you can see the traffic light changes ahead and the waiting time in advance, so you can see all the road conditions at a glance.
I've heard about autonomous driving on TV before, and I thought it was far away from us, but today I found it in our lives, and it feels amazing.
We look forward to it truly entering the lives of ordinary people in the future.
In June 2019, Apollo obtained 45 Manned Test Licenses issued by the Changsha Municipal Government.
At present, Changsha's autonomous driving test open road, passing through Changsha Artificial Intelligence Science and Technology City, Meixi Lake, Yanghu, Dawang Mountain, High-tech Zone and other sections, with a total length of 135 kilometers and a demonstration area of 70 square kilometers, is currently China's longest road mileage, the largest area, the most complex coverage scene, the most advanced vehicle-road collaborative infrastructure intelligent driving demonstration area.
It is expected that by the end of 2019, the Apollo Robotaxi fleet will cover about 50 kilometers of trial roads in Changsha, and in the first half of 2020, it is planned to cover 135 kilometers of roads currently open in Changsha.
The women's volleyball team won Lang Ping is still dissatisfied: it will be difficult to play a strong team with so many mistakes
On the afternoon of the 27th, Beijing time, the Chinese women's volleyball team ushered in the ninth game of the 2019 Women's Volleyball World Cup, the opponent was the strong Dutch women's volleyball team, and finally the Chinese women's volleyball team defeated the Dutch women's volleyball team 3:1, ushering in nine consecutive victories in the Women's Volleyball World Cup.
But after the game, the head coach of the women's volleyball team, Lang Ping, still expressed his dissatisfaction with the team's performance in the third game.
"In the third game, the opponent strengthened the aggression of the serve, and we couldn't attack the ball in place (one pass), and we made a lot of mistakes. ”
"It's hard to play against a strong team and make so many mistakes. ”
Lang Ping said in an interview after the game.
"We told the players to be focused, if the first pass is not attacked, we have to adjust the attack well, and we have to defend with the opponent. ”
Lang Ping also commented on Zhang Changning's performance, saying that she encountered some difficulties in attacking, was in a hurry, and wanted to kill the ball too much, and her movements would be deformed.
I hope she will be patient, "we will all protect her".
China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
(70 Years of the People's Republic of China) White Paper: China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
The white paper points out that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
The white paper says that with the rapid increase of China's comprehensive national strength and international influence, some people in the international community are worried that China will take the path of "a strong country must be hegemonic," and some people have put forward the so-called "China threat theory."
This is not only a cognitive misreading, but also a deep-rooted prejudice, a psychological imbalance caused by the growth and decline of power, and a deliberate distortion to protect one's own vested interests.
Realizing national prosperity and strength, national rejuvenation and people's happiness is not only the dream of the Chinese people, but also the common dream of the people of all countries.
"China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge. ”
The white paper points out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, China's scientific and technological innovation has injected new momentum into world economic growth, and the role of China's economy as a stabilizer and power source in the future will be more prominent.
At present, the world's economic growth momentum is insufficient, and a stable Chinese economy is becoming more and more important to the world.
China's economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development, with new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization accelerating, in-depth adjustment of the economic structure, continuous upgrading of industrial optimization, and the emergence of new economic growth points.
According to a research report by the McKinsey Global Institute, by 2040, the integration of China and the rest of the world's economies is expected to create $22 trillion to $37 trillion in economic value, equivalent to 15% to 26% of the global economy. ”
The white paper stresses that China's economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and are deeply integrated.
China's more stable economic operation, higher quality growth, and promising growth prospects are good for the development of the world economy in the long run.
It is not feasible and harmful to regard China's economic development as a "threat" and "challenge", and to try to squeeze China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain, and value chain, so as to "decouple" China from the world economy.
The white paper points out that all-round opening-up has created more opportunities for countries to share the "China dividend".
China unswervingly pursues a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening-up, and achieves greater efforts and a higher level of opening-up.
"Openness should be two-way and mutually beneficial, not one-way and mutually beneficial.
Mutual benefit and two-way can be long-term and lasting. ”
The white paper says that China is committed to continuing to expand imports, relax market access, improve the business environment, and strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights.
Only when all parties work together can we create an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment, jointly make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger, and form a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests.
The white paper points out that China provides more public goods to the international community.
This includes promoting high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, building a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively carrying out foreign assistance.
"China's development has benefited from the international community, and it has never forgotten to give back to the international community and provide more and better public goods to the international community. ”
In a recent written interview with Xinhua News Agency, Andrei Slepniov, general manager of the Russian Export Center, said that Russia is willing to strengthen cooperation with China in the economic and trade fields, further optimize the export structure, and promote the diversification of Russian exports to China.
Srepniov pointed out that forestry, machine-building and chemical industries account for a large proportion of Russia's exports to China, while at the same time, the export of agricultural products is also very important, including oil products, meat products and dairy products, as well as cereals, fish and seafood.
In recent years, Russia's exports of non-raw materials and non-energy products to China have also shown a good and stable development trend.
Talking about Russia's optimization of the structure of its exports to China, Srepniov said that Russia has set the task of expanding the export of high-tech products to meet the import needs of various countries and regions in the world, including China, for high-tech products.
In the future, the Russian side will improve financial and non-financial support measures to promote further growth in the number of high-tech enterprises.
Srepniov said that Russia is willing to export construction technology and high-tech building materials to China and develop cooperation with China in the fields of medicine and aviation manufacturing.
There is also great potential for cooperation between Russia and China in the field of urban environmental development.
He stressed that Russian products in many areas are "superior in quality and competitive in price" compared with similar Western products.
Referring to the two countries' goal of achieving a bilateral trade volume of 200 billion US dollars by 2024, Srepniov said that the fields of agriculture, machinery manufacturing, chemical industry and forestry will play an important role in achieving this goal.
The Russian side intends to diversify supplies in these areas and promote the export of deep-processed products.
He stressed that the Russian side intends to promote the entry of its exporters into the global value-added chain, of which China is one of the development directions.
Russian manufacturers in the fields of agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas, and chemicals are well positioned to participate in this process.
At present, the two countries need to continue to deepen cooperation between enterprises, "create more Russian-Chinese joint ventures and jointly develop exports to third countries".
Srepniov said that the Russian Export Center is taking a variety of measures and services to support the export of Russian products to China through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Export-Import Bank of Russia.
At the same time, the Russian export center will continue to deepen cooperation with relevant Chinese departments to promote more convenient access to the Chinese market for Russian goods and develop new categories of export products to China.

The protests have bombarded the resignation of the president and the rain is about to come in Egypt, and the authorities have shown strong repression
Twitter hashtags and social media are urging Egyptians to take to the streets today to peacefully demand President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's resignation.
But the authorities have already indicated their intention to use force to suppress it.
Since then-military chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi seized power in a military coup in 2013, the expression of dissent has all but disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest would be extremely dangerous.
The Guardian reported that the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a nongovernmental organization in Cairo, noted that more than 1,900 people have been arrested since a rare outbreak of protests demanding Sisi's resignation last weekend.
Corruption allegations surrounding Sisi and his family's squandering of public money in pursuit of vanity led thousands of people to take to the streets on the 20th.
Egypt's Ministry of the Interior took a firm stand yesterday and said that it would resolutely face any attempt to destabilize the country and would not be relentless.
The center of Cairo is already heavily guarded, with riot police, security agency vehicles and plainclothes police lining the streets around Tahrir Square, the flashpoint of Egypt's 2011 revolution.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of important academics and social leaders on the 25th, including Nafa, a professor of political science at Cairo University and a well-known columnist.
He tweeted on the 24th: "Continuing to let Sisi rule absolutely will cause disaster, I have no doubt about that. ”
"It is in Egypt's interest that he step down immediately. ”
Prior to Nafa's arrest, Hosni, who had served as spokesman for Egypt's former military chief of staff, Annan, was detained.
Annan was arrested last year after trying to compete with Sisi for the presidency.
The president of the Constitution Party, Dawud, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians argue that at a time when the economic woes of the poor and middle class are intensifying, sweeping dissent reflects the government's instability and fragility.
Opposition leader Ayman Nour, a former presidential contender, said: "The arrests underscore the regime's disregard for the Egyptian people and how much fear it has of its own." ”
"With the economy already in shambles, and widespread political repression, Sisi is trying to get a clear message to key generals and politicians who could replace him. ”
Knoll pointed out that the government's heavy-handed approach will only increase people's anger as the socio-economic situation continues to deteriorate.
Now that the fear barrier has been breached, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor currently living in exile in Spain and a former Egyptian military construction contractor, began uploading a series of videos earlier this month in which he claimed to have benefited from government corruption, sparking a wave of small demonstrations in various cities last weekend.
Ali said his company, Amrak General Contractor, could get lucrative contracts without having to go through a statutory bidding process, stressing corruption among the military and Sisi's relatives, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply remorseful that he had been involved.
Ali claimed that he had helped Sesigai with the opulent palaces and luxury hotels in contrast to the abject poverty of Egyptians today, and that he had not yet paid.
On Twitter, hashtags such as "Stand up and you're not alone", "Sisi you're done", "Sisi have to", "Next Friday" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and tweets, with content calling on people to take to the streets peacefully to demand Sisi's resignation.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Amarwick has nearly 7 million followers on Twitter.
He tweeted yesterday in Arabic: "Sisi is doomed... He's finished, and those who support him are now going to make a big mistake. ”
The Hong Kong Government has launched a free special training scheme to help employees who have recently been affected by the economy to tide over the difficulties

There are many boutiques in Harbour City, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, with few customers.
Affected by the recent social strife in Hong Kong, the number of visitors to Hong Kong has dropped sharply recently, and in addition to the tourism industry, the hotel, catering and retail industries have also been affected.
The Secretary for Labour and Welfare of the HKSAR Government, Mr Law Chi-kwong, and the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Edward Yau, met with the media on entrusting the Employees Retraining Board (ERB) to implement a special training programme and measures to support the tourism sector.
Law said that the challenges facing Hong Kong's economy are imminent and should not wait for the situation to calm down.
That's why the HKSAR Government has launched this free training programme called "Love Added Special".
According to reports, people who have lost their jobs or have been required by their employers to take unpaid leave since June 1 will have the opportunity to participate in the scheme as long as they meet the relevant requirements.
According to Law, the most important part of the courses is "vocational skills", covering 19 industries, including tourism, retail and catering, as well as some new "innovation and technology" courses and cross-industry "generic skills" courses.
The Chairman of the Employees Retraining Board, Mr Yu Pang-chun, said that the programme is free of charge and is expected to support about 10,000 people in need.
Participating trainees who complete each full-time or part-time course and have an attendance rate of 80% will receive a special allowance of up to HK$4,000 per student per month.
According to reports, the training course lasts for 2 to 3 months and is provided by about 50 training institutions, and the public can apply for the course from October 3 to March 31 next year, and each person can apply for a maximum of 4 courses.
In addition, the HKSAR Government has also announced a series of measures to support the tourism industry to tide over the difficulties.
These measures include easing the funding for the Travel Industry Council, subsidising 6,000 tourist guides to renew their licences and waiving annual fees for travel agents.
Exercise is tiring and brain-tiring?
According to Sputnik, a study of athletes has shown that the brain also shows signs of fatigue after high-intensity exercise.
The study, led by Marseas Pessiglion, an expert at the Pétier-Salpetrier hospital in France, shows that there is a subtle link between mental and physical work: both require cognitive control of activity.
Pesciglion explains: "You need to control the voluntary processes that can force yourself to stop when you have pain in your muscles and joints. ”
The study was initiated by the French National Institute of Physical Education and Sport (INSEP).
The school's specialists are responsible for guiding athletes in their preparation for the Olympic Games.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from overtraining syndrome, which is an irrepressible feeling of fatigue after a high load of exercise, unable to recover and declining performance.
INSEP asks the question: Could part of this condition be caused by nervous fatigue, the kind of nervous fatigue caused by excessive mental effort?
The study was published in the journal Current Biology.

Cui Aimin, director of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency that the film aims to further let the public feel the feelings and warmth of "diplomacy for the people", and let Chinese citizens feel that no matter where they are in the world, Chinese diplomats will lend a helping hand to them, give them help, strength and hope.
Overseas safety is no trivial matter, and every branch and leaf is always a matter of love.
Cui Aimin said that over the past 70 years, the number of Chinese citizens "going out" has increased dramatically, from "less than one million per year" before the reform and opening up to more than 100 million per year today.
According to statistics, since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, we have organized and implemented more than 10 major operations to evacuate or relocate Chinese citizens overseas, and safely evacuated more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.
Accepted and coordinated the handling of about 500,000 cases of various types of help, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.
In times of danger, the motherland can take you home, and the desire to go on a "walk-and-go" trip is no longer a dream.
According to Cui Aimin, as of the end of August this year, China had concluded visa exemption agreements with 14 countries covering ordinary passport holders.
In addition, more and more countries are unilaterally granting entry facilitation such as visa-free or visa-on-arrival to Chinese citizens.
42 countries and regions, including Thailand and Egypt, unilaterally granted visas on arrival to Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports, and 15 countries and regions, including Indonesia, unilaterally allowed visa-free entry for Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports.
In addition to visa-free and visa-on-arrival arrangements, it is becoming more and more convenient for Chinese citizens to apply for visas, and the procedures are becoming more and more simplified.
As of the end of August, China had reached agreements or arrangements with 41 countries to simplify visa procedures.
These include the 10-year multiple-entry visas issued to tourists and business personnel with the United States, Canada, Israel and Argentina, and the two-year multiple-entry visa arrangement with the United Kingdom for each other's tourism, business and family visitors.
The United Kingdom and Belgium jointly launched a "one-stop shop for visas", while France, Italy and Singapore have shortened the visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours respectively.
For business people who often go abroad, the APEC business travel card with multiple entries and convenient customs clearance is a good choice.
According to Cui Aimin, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining a five-year multiple visa for 16 economies around the Asia-Pacific region, which is of great significance to business personnel, especially those of private enterprises, to "go global".
At present, China ranks first among APEC economies in terms of the number of valid card holders.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, encourage more countries to adopt visa facilitation measures for Chinese citizens, so that more diplomatic achievements can be translated into measures to benefit the people and facilitate the people, and continuously improve the 'gold content' of Chinese passports.

"One delivery has been" two UHV projects put into operation
On the 26th, the 1100 kV UHV DC transmission project and the Sutong 1000 kV AC UHV GIL comprehensive pipe gallery project were put into operation from Zhundong to ±southern Anhui.
These two projects occupy the commanding heights of the world's power transmission technology in their respective fields, and will greatly improve China's large-scale energy optimization allocation after they are put into operation.
Guo Zhi, chief economist of the National Energy Administration, said that the Zhundong to southern Anhui project is the world's largest transmission capacity and the farthest transmission distance.
Its operation is of great significance to promote the development of Xinjiang's energy base and ensure the power supply in East China.
GIL, or Gas Insulated Metal Enclosed Transmission Line.
The Sutong Pipe Corridor Project has created a record of the highest voltage level and the strongest transmission capacity in the world for the GIL project, and has realized the 'AC double ring network' with the highest voltage level of the backbone power grid in East China.
According to the State Grid Corporation, the transmission distance from Zhundong to southern Anhui is 3,324 kilometers.
If conventional technology is adopted, more than 15% of the electric energy will be lost on the way, and the project has been researched and developed, so that the economic transmission distance has been greatly increased to more than 3,000 kilometers.
After the project from Zhundong to southern Anhui is put into operation, 100 million kWh of electricity can be transmitted every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which can help solve the problem of absorbing existing new energy in Xinjiang.
According to the full load estimate, the annual power transmission of this line alone will reach 600 to 85 billion kilowatt hours, which can meet more than half of Shanghai's annual electricity consumption.
Sutong GIL comprehensive pipe gallery project is a control project of UHV AC ring network across the Yangtze River.
If the conventional overhead line is used to cross the river, two giant towers of more than 450 meters will need to be erected on the surface of the Yangtze River, and an artificial island of more than four football fields will be built for each tower.
In this regard, the State Grid has made bold innovations and developed a compact ultra-high voltage AC GIL transmission technology, which crosses the river from underwater through a tunnel to avoid the impact on the golden waterway.
The two projects have promoted a new leap in China's electrical equipment manufacturing capacity.
At present, the State Grid has built a total of "10 interchanges and 11 straight" UHV projects, and "4 interchanges and 3 straights" are under construction.
Foreign Exchange Bureau: China's Foreign Debt Structure Continues to Optimize The stability of foreign debt has been enhanced
On the whole, the structure of China's foreign debt has been continuously optimized, and the stability of foreign debt has been enhanced. ”
Wang Chunying, spokesperson and chief economist of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said on the 27th that the main indicators of China's foreign debt are within the internationally recognized safety line, and the risk of foreign debt is generally controllable.
Wang Chunying made the above remarks when the foreign exchange bureau released the external debt data at the end of June 2019 on the same day, and answered a reporter's question.
According to the data, as of the end of June 2019, China's full-caliber (including domestic and foreign currencies) external debt balance was US$1,998 billion, an increase of US$26.3 billion, or 1.3%, from the end of March 2019, mainly due to the growth of debt securities balance.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70% of China's full-caliber foreign debt increase was driven by non-residents' purchases of onshore RMB bonds, and non-residents were mainly medium and long-term investors such as the central bank.
At the end of June 2019, the proportion of medium- and long-term external debt increased by 3 percentage points from the end of March 2019, and the proportion of local currency external debt increased by 1 percentage point from the end of March 2019.
Wang Chunying said that with the inclusion of China's domestic RMB bonds in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index in April 2019, international investors' recognition of China's bond market has further improved, and they have continued to increase their holdings of domestic RMB bonds.
"China's balance of payments remains generally balanced, and the risk of external debt is controllable. ”
The reporter learned from the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences on the 27th that at present, fall armyworm in Yunnan has been effectively prevented and controlled, and no large-scale outbreaks have been caused, and the prevention and control work has achieved phased results.
In January this year, fall armyworm was first detected in Jiangcheng County, Pu'er City, Yunnan Province, and then confirmed in 129 counties in Yunnan, and the fall armyworm gradually spread from Yunnan to Chinese mainland, posing a direct threat to China's grain production.
Fall armyworm is a polyphagous long-distance migratory important agricultural pest native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, and is a major migratory pest of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) for global warning, with the characteristics of "international, migratory, explosive and destructive".
The pest harms more than 80 crops such as corn, sugarcane and sorghum, and can cause up to 70% yield loss due to large feed quantities.
It is difficult to control and control, and there is no registered pesticide for the control of this insect in China.
Since the invasion of fall armyworm into Yunnan, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences selected researcher Chen Aidong to lead the provincial innovation team of the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences to go to the front line, conduct field investigations, collect samples, and carry out technical guidance and experimental demonstrations.
Chen Aidong's team has preliminarily grasped the population characteristics, natural enemy insect resources, overseas insect source characteristics, population migration trajectory, pesticide virulence and field control effect of fall armyworm in Yunnan.
Through the implementation of new green prevention and control technologies such as population monitoring, adult trapping, scientific medication and agronomic measures, the prevention and control effect in the demonstration area has reached more than 90%, and at the same time the use of chemical pesticides has been reduced, natural enemy resources and ecological environment have been protected, and technical support has been provided for the effective control of fall armyworm outbreaks and sustainable management in Yunnan.
At present, fall armyworm in Yunnan has been effectively prevented and controlled, and no large-scale outbreaks have been caused, and the prevention and control work has achieved phased results.
In the next step, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on the ecological mechanism of population migration and invasion outbreaks, and break through the construction of biological control and green prevention and control technology systems.
At the same time, we will actively promote cross-border international cooperation, and strive to establish joint key laboratories and joint monitoring networks and demonstration areas overseas, so as to improve the all-round monitoring and early warning capabilities of fall armyworm in Yunnan.

The white paper pointed out that over the past 70 years, the Chinese people have made arduous explorations and forged ahead, successfully opened up the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and made development achievements that have attracted worldwide attention.
The white paper says that China's development depends on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development relies on the hard-working spirit of "800 million shirts for one Boeing"; several generations of people have been galloping unceasingly, continuing to struggle, and paying unimaginable hard work and sweat of others; relying on the spirit of "shouldering one's own burden"; no matter in good times or bad, it does not export problems, does not pass on contradictions, does not develop itself through forced buying and selling, and plunders other countries; and relies on the spirit of exploration of "crossing the river by feeling the stones", and does not follow the old road of imperialism and colonialism, and does not copy the development model of Western countries, but combines it with China's actual conditions. Sum up lessons and lessons, learn from human civilization, dare to try, and forge your own path.
According to the white paper, China has developed in the process of interconnection and interaction with the world, China's development has injected positive energy into world peace and development, and China's path is in line with China's national conditions and adapts to the requirements of the times.
China has taken concrete actions to safeguard world peace.
Over the past 70 years, China has not taken the initiative to provoke any war or conflict, nor has it invaded an inch of land of other countries.
The white paper points out that over the past 70 years, China has achieved great success in development, and the fundamental reason is that it has found the correct development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and unswervingly followed this path.
This is a path established based on the national conditions of the country, putting the interests of the people in the first place, reforming and innovating, seeking common development in the course of opening up, and comprehensively governing the country according to law.
Without a centralized, unified, and strong leadership, China will be divided and disintegrated, bringing disaster to the world.
The white paper says that over the past 70 years, China has overcome various risks and challenges and created one Chinese miracle after another that has attracted worldwide attention.
Especially since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China has made historic achievements and undergone historic changes in its development, and the Chinese nation has ushered in a great leap from standing up, getting rich to becoming strong, and is closer to the great goal of national rejuvenation than ever before in history.
China's development path will show more and more bright prospects for development as the times progress.

A Taiwanese scholar suggested: In the "era of uncertainty," Taiwan businessmen need to keep up with the mainland in developing mainstream industries
The "2019 Taiwan Business Innovation Business Model Forum" was held in Taipei for two days on the 26th and 27th.
The event invited a number of Taiwanese business representatives and scholars to share their experience on enterprise transformation, innovation, succession and market development.
The forum was hosted by the Taipei Institute of Business Management and co-organized by Qunyi Jinding Securities, Outstanding Mainland Taiwanese Business Association and other organizations.
The two-day conference was divided into a number of seminars on transformation and upgrading models, business strategies, etc., and more than 100 people attended.
Chen Mingzhang, president of the Taipei Business Management Research Institute, said that the Sino-Chinese mainland and US trade frictions continue, and Taiwanese companies are facing "uncertain times".
He believes that Taiwan businessmen need to keep pace with the times, keep up with the mainstream industries developed by the mainland, and pay special attention to innovative products related to science and technology, culture, tourism, and health.
"In the past, Taiwanese companies paid attention to quality, effectiveness and delivery. ”
Chen Mingzhang believes that the above-mentioned conditions for Taiwan businessmen are no longer sufficient at present.
He pointed out that Taiwan-funded enterprises should have both speed and service, speed up the supply chain, and attach importance to extended services and life product services.
In addition, "value-added services" is also a new area that Taiwan businessmen can vigorously develop.
In the speech session of the representative of Taiwanese businessmen, Xu Wentang, chairman of the Taiwanese Yayi Electronics Co., Ltd. from Guangdong, said that Yayi Electronics had operational difficulties due to the sharp decline in orders, and the group began to improve its operating conditions from multiple aspects such as adjusting the structure and activating assets.
It took three years for the company to achieve revenue after taking away the traditional electrical appliance business, transforming automotive electronic equipment, and entering the smart home appliance industry.
Bai Hongzhang, general manager of Helios (Zhuhai) Electronics Co., Ltd., proposed that if it is difficult to develop new customers, it is better to focus on the "one-stop" service provided by the original customers.
As long as these six points are solved, coupled with the timely transformation of production lines and the expansion of product categories, enterprises will become irreplaceable suppliers for customers.
On the 27th, the award ceremony of the "2019 Outstanding Mainland Taiwanese Business Award", also hosted by the Taipei Institute of Business Management, was held in Taipei.
According to Taiwan's "Economic Daily", Lu Zhengzhang, general manager of Golden Land Company, whose operation center is located in Shanghai, won the "Outstanding Taiwan Businessman and Cross-Strait Contribution Award".
Solicitation of opinions on the new regulations: Social capital must have qualifications to obtain rural land management rights
Social capital must have qualifications to obtain rural land management rights
The "Administrative Measures for the Circulation of Rural Land Operation Rights" is open for public comment It is proposed to supervise the circulation of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises to obtain land operation rights
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued a notice on the "Administrative Measures for the Circulation of Rural Land Management Rights (Revised Draft for Solicitation of Comments)" (hereinafter referred to as the "Draft") for public comment, increasing the supervision and risk prevention of industrial and commercial enterprises and other social capital circulation to obtain land operation rights.
The "Draft Opinions" are open to the public for comments today.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, in order to implement the newly revised "Rural Land Contracting Law", further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system, and implement the "separation of powers" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the "Administrative Measures for the Circulation of Rural Land Contracting and Management Rights" and formed the "Opinion Draft".
A reporter from Beijing Youth Daily learned that there are many important revisions to the "Draft Opinions" released for the first time.
The newly revised Rural Land Contract Law clarifies the scope of land circulation, implements the concept of "separation of powers", and sets up "land contracting and management rights" and "land management rights" in a special section, making a clear distinction between the transfer and exchange of land contracting and management rights and the circulation of land management rights (leasing, subcontracting, shareholding or other means).
In the Draft Opinions, in order to implement the concept of "separation of powers", effectively respond to the gist of the amendment to the Rural Land Contract Law, and take into account the great differences between the transfer of land management rights and the exchange and transfer of land contract management rights in terms of parties, procedures, supervision, etc., the revised draft defines the scope of circulation, focuses on the circulation of land operation rights, and the circulation methods include leasing and shareholding, and amends the name of the regulations from the Administrative Measures for the Circulation of Rural Land Contracting and Management Rights to the Administrative Measures for the Circulation of Rural Land Management Rights.
For the transfer and exchange of land contracting and management rights, separate administrative measures will be promulgated.
The Draft Opinion points out that in the context of the "separation of powers", farmers only have the right to operate land for a certain period of time.
Theoretically speaking, even in the event of bankruptcy liquidation, the peasants only have the risk of losing their management rights for a certain period of time, so it is no longer necessary in legal theory to stipulate that the contracted land should be returned to the original contractor, and it is also in conflict with the Bankruptcy Law.
In view of the problem of preventing the risk of peasants losing land, in practice, methods such as preferred shares, lease-to-shares, and buy-back have been developed.
Considering that preferred shares have been discussed in a relatively mature theory in the Company Law, it is suggested that they should be used as an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of losing land in shares.
