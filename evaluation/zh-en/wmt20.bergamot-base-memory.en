The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a report on the 26th, saying that Iran has begun to use advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, further violating the nuclear agreement with world powers in 2015.
The IAEA report said that advanced centrifuges at Iran's Natanz Nuclear Facility "are accumulating or are ready to accumulate enriched uranium."
Since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal in May last year and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the 2015 nuclear deal with major powers.
The agreement stipulates that Iran can only use the first generation of IR-1 centrifuges to refine uranium.
Other signatories to the deal, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to salvage the deal, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.

The women's volleyball team is expected to defend the World Cup in advance!
On the 27th, in the game against the Dutch women's volleyball team, the Chinese team was pulled back from the city by the opponent in the case of winning two consecutive games, and finally won nine consecutive victories with the Netherlands with 3:1.
The schedule of the World Cup is nearing the end, although the defending is in sight, but in the face of Serbia, the Chinese women's volleyball team can not be taken lightly.
In the first two games with the Netherlands, the performance of the Chinese women's volleyball team was as strong as ever, with 25:19, 25:16, and the team suffered setbacks until the third game.
The Dutch women's volleyball team strengthened the attack on the service, the Chinese team was hit by a pass, and the girls attacked, and the mistakes began to increase, and finally were pulled back to a city by the opponent at 21:25.
After the game, Lang Ping also pointed out in an interview: "Third game, because of the mistake we sent about 8 points."
Of course, the strength of the Dutch women's volleyball team should not be underestimated, China's women's volleyball before the preparation of difficult, although lost a game, but everything is still in the hands of Lang Ping, "and the strong team to win and lose is very normal, play five games is also very normal, so we said to the players to focus," Lang Ping said.
In the fourth game, the players actively adjusted their status, Zhang Changning opened in the offensive end of the fire, and the single game scored 8 points, making great achievements for the team to win.
Since the game, 11 rounds of confrontation is currently only two rounds, although the Chinese women's volleyball team has touched the championship trophy with one hand, but in the game against the Netherlands team did sound the alarm to the Chinese women's volleyball team: the more critical moments, the more to go all out.
In another game on the 27th, the Russian and American women's volleyball team played 5 sets, and the United States failed to take all three points from the opponent, so that the Chinese women's volleyball team could defend the line as long as it took three points in the game against Serbia.
All these situations are moving towards a favorable situation for the Chinese women's volleyball team.
However, although the Serbian team's six main players are all absent, this does not mean that they will easily give three points to the Chinese team.
From the current form of the standings, the Serbian team has basically missed the medal, which means that they can be in the game against the Chinese women's volleyball team "lightly loaded", put down the burden to hit the opponent, and the Chinese team is burdened with the pressure to win the championship, the state may appear ups and downs.
In addition, the replacement of the Serbian team is not "manned" lamb, before the battle with the Dutch team, the two sides fought 5 games, Serbia's second team finally 3:2 reversed the Netherlands' all-force lineup, which shows the depth of its lineup.
Before the third stage of the game, Lang Ping also said that the Dutch and Sai teams are not good to deal with: "Osaka's game will be very difficult, we still have to be as usual, seriously prepare."
Now the defending trumpet has been sounded, the game has really entered the "white heat stage."
On the strength of the lineup, the Chinese women's volleyball team is above the opponent, but the last critical moment, but also depends on whether the women's volleyball girls can play the normal level, in the field to release themselves.

On September 24, the "A ticket to take me to see" love disability activities were held in Changsha Orange Zhoutou, and more than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to board the Orange Star Cruise to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Xiangjiang River and jointly celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Most of the more than 100 people with disabilities who participated in the event were on board the cruise for the first time.
56-year-old Zhao Zhengang is a disabled person, because of the lack of movement of his feet, usually rarely go out.
He said: "Today for the first time on the cruise, close to enjoy the Xiangjiang wave, feel the pulse of Changsha's development, the mood is very excited, unforgettable."
Volunteers from the Fukang Social Work Service Center and the Blue Sky Rescue Team in Changsha City provided meticulous services to people with disabilities.
Especially for the service objects with severe physical disabilities, volunteers will carry them on the cruise.
The relevant person in charge of the Fukang Social Work Service Center said that in the past 70 years, with the support of the party and the government, the cause of disabled people in Changsha has continued to develop and progress, and more and more disabled people have truly become participants, contributors and enjoyers of social and economic development, and caring for and supporting the cause of persons with disabilities has gradually become the consensus of the whole society.
The Republic is about to usher in the 70th anniversary of the celebration, the spotlight of all the media suddenly brightened, so that many of the usual images we do not remember, glittering - it is they, for our shining days, silk and wispy to bring heat, bring light sources.
However, if the hero walks around, it seems as ordinary as you are like me.
Yuan Longping, painstaking rice research, breeding good seeds all over the world, so that more than a billion people do not have the risk of hunger, great work, this on the day is also like an old farmer who likes to walk in the field; Nan Rendong, exhausted to make China's "Heavenly Eye" angry chief scientist, a person, a lifetime, a pot, a life only one thing, in Guizhou deep mountains gnawing cold buns, and the old man in the cottage.Yuchang, a red scientist, a village boy who was very late in the moon, still like a bare son, learning to the west, with a unkempt white hair, talking about learning to the heart, like to laugh; Qin Yi, a film artist who is red and half-sided, after the age of ninety, is still willing to play in the plateau for six or seven hours a day, and is happy to play in the "Demon Cat".
They, seeking kindness, living simple, simple and persistent, as long as they are immersed in the unfamiliar and their self-deprecation career, it is easy to be happy, do not care about the famous Lisuo, rich and glorious.
Like the Jin Yong novel, the sweeping monk of the Shaolin Temple, although he has a world-screed, he does not show off, and there is no joy and no sadness.
Every "sweeping monk", every pair of children's hearts, behind there is a share of my own home country.
The national responsibility is not only carried on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the hands of hundreds of millions of people.
Once, a female middle school student's words, by the netizens crazy, "when the hero passed, always have someone sitting on the roadside clapping ... ... I do not want to become a hero, I want to be sitting on the roadside applauding people."
In fact, when the hero and the hero applaud, there is no contradiction.
People who applaud on the side of the road are also transmitting heat and light, and they are also luminous.
Ordinary like you and me, there are always some opportunities in life, there are some moments, there is a kind of accumulation, but also to shape the appearance of heroes.
Shanghai excellent judge Zou Bihua, shoulder the heavy responsibility of judicial reform, but at the annual meeting let the communication room teacher Fu on the stage to tell their own story, a year to receive and receive countless newspaper letters, from the error-free, "doing simple things well, is not simple", Zou Bihua led the judges to give applause to the "sweeping monk" style of old send and receive.
This is a pity between the heroes, a hero is giving a clap to another hero.
The sweeping monk has the Shaolin Temple Tibetan Pavilion, Yuan Longping has a vast rice experimental field, Nanrendong has a "eye", Qin Yi has a stage, Zhou Yuchang has a pulpit... Can you be a hero, not alone, more on your own efforts, more good environment and positive incentive mechanism.
For example, "Chinese Eye", now seems to be a myth.
In the 1990s, China's science and technology community was still climbing hard, and novelist Liu Cixin had not yet written "Three Body".
At that time, the most cattle "eye" was the single-sided radio telescope in the valley of Puerto Rico Island, Arecibo, 350 meters in diameter, which is considered to be the most "unbe surpassed" in the world.
At that time, the diameter of the Chinese radio telescope was not as large as one-tenth of the people.
Nan Rendong, who enjoys world-class scientific research conditions and salary in Japan, insisted on returning home, bringing back an almost crazy idea: building a new generation of radio "big telescopes" in China and receiving more information from outer space!
China is still to be happy, invest a lot of money to play with the stars?
The motherland trusts Nan Rendong, and the "eyes of heaven" project opens with a great deal.
The site was selected for 12 years, and the project was completed in 9 years.
500 meters of caliber of the "eyes of the sky" opened, China has made no precedent to follow, "the world's unique big scientific project."
Therefore, the "eyes of heaven" are great, the South Rendong are remarkable, and there is a large, lofty republic that is remarkable.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, the South Rendong side has the opportunity to become the soul of the country.
There are young talents, white-haired heroes walked gierably, and there were people who applauded softly on the roadside, such a country, which was very beautiful and harmonious.
Garbage classification education first into Jilin kindergarten environmental protection concept from the doll to catch up

It is reported that this is the first time that garbage classification has entered the local early childhood education classroom.
A few days ago, nine departments of Jilin Province jointly issued the "Jilin Province to promote the prefecture-level municipal domestic waste classification and treatment work plan."
In 2019, on the basis of the pilot of compulsory classification of domestic waste in Changchun, the province decided to carry out the classification of domestic waste in prefecture-level cities.
Jilin City is one of them.
We hope that through this event, we can realize the effect of promoting the family with young children and the society driven by kindergarten, and advocate the concept of environmental protection.

On the same day, the director read out the environmental initiative, hoping that the garbage classification should start from the children.
After performing the "Low Carbon Babe" dance, the children started a small game of garbage classification.
The instructor also issued “recyclable” and “other garbage” labels, advising children to go home and glue the label to the trash can and record small videos.
Liu Lijuan introduced that the kindergarten has always advocated the concept of low-carbon and green environmental protection, and regularly opened an environmental protection lecture hall.
In the park, a cortable garbage can is also set up at the garbage delivery site, which is marked with the category of delivery.
Teacher teaches children what can be recycled garbage 苍雁 摄

Among them, sanitary landfills 3,292,900 tons, incineration of 2.0923 million tons, and comprehensive utilization process 80,100 tons.
After years of efforts, all cities and counties in the province have the ability to deal with domestic waste harmlessly.
In the "Jilin Province to promote the classification and treatment of prefecture-level urban domestic waste", it is explicitly required to carry out in-depth activities such as garbage classification into the campus, textbooks, and classrooms, and strengthen the interaction between students and parents by creating garbage classification songs, songs, cartoons, micro-videos, etc., so as to achieve the effect of "educating a child, affecting a family, driving a community, and cultivating a new generation of people".

Chirac's death The legacy of politics
On the 26th local time, former French President Jacques Chirac died at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is in a century of unprecedented changes, the French politician's many political legacies left in power still deserve our praise.
Chirac served as president of France for 12 years in a very charismatic way.
He inherited the spirit of independence and autonomy of the Gaullism, but also firmly supported European integration, and was the representative of the pursuit of the "European dream".
At the same time, he also vigorously advocated the world's multipolarity and multilateralism, and is a politician with a strategic vision.
That is why the French media described him as "an outstanding representative of France on the world stage".
One of Chirac’s relishing political decisions was his opposition to the U.S.-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France and Germany have withstanded the pressure of the United States and are at the forefront of the anti-war.
A year after the outbreak of the war, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to increased terrorist activities and make the world more dangerous.
Later, it turned out that Chirac’s warning was quite correct.
In the current situation of European integration, the unilateralism of the United States is becoming more and more prominent, and Chirac is pursuing the past, Chirac's strategic thinking and choice of international politics and global affairs undoubtedly has strong inspirational significance.
Chirac is also a French politician who makes the Chinese feel familiar and kind.
He is one of the advocates and creators of the "Golden Decade" of China-France relations, and after being elected as the French president for the first time in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of China-France relations with the strategic vision of politicians.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges between China and France entered a new stage.
During the Chirac administration, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and the cooperation between the two countries in various fields such as aviation, nuclear energy and railway transportation has made breakthrough progress.
The year of Chinese-French culture initiated by Chirac has created a new model of cultural exchange in the history of China and France.
Chirac’s lifelong love for Chinese culture was particularly impressive.
It is understood that his Chinese diplomats introduced that Chirac can carry some of the poems of Li Bai and Du Fu, and even accurately judge the historical era of Chinese bronzes.
"It doesn't really go to Egypt without looking at the pyramids, and it's not really going to China without looking at Qin Jun." - This golden sentence comes from Chirac.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Chirac said: "The West has concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems caused by China's economic growth, and China's political position in the international arena.
But I have full confidence in China.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is enough to help it build the concept and values for harmonious development and assume its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time.”
I also believe that China's rejuvenation will bring new creative vitality to world culture and enrich world culture.
The S. is gone, but the political legacy and revelations that Chirac has left to the world will live on.

The statement, signed by 40 formed lawmakers, said that at present, Hong Kong's rights are granted by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, including maintaining the status of a free trade port and a separate customs territory, signing and implementing bilateral and multilateral agreements in the name of "Hong Kong, China" in different fields, such as economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, sports, etc., and the trade, cooperation and development relations between different countries and regions around the world.
These rights are not given by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always strictly abided by international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, and has participated in many related fields of cooperation with different countries and regions, and has achieved remarkable results and is obvious to all.
The statement said that the move by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States to pass the relevant bill is not necessary, but in response to the call of its agents who are evil, as a means of grossly interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs and fighting for political leverage for its agents in Hong Kong.
The establishment lawmakers deeply regret the US meeting and strongly oppose it.
Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the source of the largest trade surplus.
Hong Kong's excellent rule of law, fair and free business environment, and an incorruptible society make it a good location for American businessmen to do business.
If the United States adopts this bill, in addition to cracking down on the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself, it will make Sino-US relations worse, and have no benefit, and harm others.
The statement said that Hong Kong will, as always, unswervingly implement the "one country, two systems" policy, continue to enjoy the rights granted by the Basic Law, and earnestly fulfill its obligations.
Whether in the past, present or future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and international trade.
According to the European Times on the 26th, the two houses of the French parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week.
French President Emmanuel Macron recently said that France cannot "accept everyone", but at the same time, it must strive to "accept it properly".
Macron is trying to find a compromise on immigration to slow the upcoming debate.
Recently, Macron said in an interview during the general debate of the UN General Assembly in New York, the United States, that he hoped to have a real "two-pronged" plan on immigration policy to find a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
“If France wants to be able to properly accept (immigraters), it cannot accept everyone,” Macron said.
Macron cites four priorities in immigration policy: granting asylum status to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; promoting the integration of migrants more efficiently; receiving and protecting all migrants entering French territory; and more efficient resettlement of people who enter France illegally and are not suitable for staying.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the “National Medical Assistance” (AME) system is the most discussed topic in the past.
Macron said he wanted to "evaluate" the system, but did not remove it, but imposed some restrictions.
After Macron's remarks, Le Pen, the leader of the far-right "National Alliance", tweeted that Macron's statement was "empty talk".
Rascher, a member of the right-wing Republican Party and president of the Senate, also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a "de-escalation" but "face to reality" way, and Macron should be indirectly criticized.
On immigration, France should be “more and better” and criticized Macron for “manufacting” the issue.
The new asylum and immigration law, which has been in place for a year, has led to differences of opinion within the ruling party, but at the same time it has not been able to appease the right-wing opposition.
In the next 2022 election, the topic of immigration policy will once again be the focus of far-right attacks, and Macron needs to make a difference on this issue, but it will also risk angering the ruling party's inner leftists.
According to reports, the lower house of the French National Assembly will debate immigration policy from September 30, and the Senate will debate from October 2.
There are signs that China's A-shares are ushering in a "repurchase tide", and many listed companies have come up with "real money and silver" to buy back the company's shares.
According to the statistics of Oriental Wealth, a financial data service provider, as of the 27th, the total amount of repurchase implementation of A-share listed companies in 2019 has exceeded 100 billion yuan (RMB, the same below), far exceeding the data of the same period of previous years, setting a record high in the amount of A-share share repurchase funds.
In this regard, Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Mai Kerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said that the overall valuation of the A-share market this year is low, and the repurchase of shares at a relatively low price is conducive to the efficiency of the use of funds by listed companies, and also reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage market value and abundant cash flow, which is conducive to boosting investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the share repurchase system has also promoted listed companies to actively carry out share repurchases.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued the implementation rules for the repurchase of shares by listed companies, providing detailed stock repurchase standards and guidelines for listed companies.
According to media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented an increase in repurchase plans have mainly focused on the infrastructure industry, real estate industry, information technology industry and electronic equipment manufacturing industry.
In addition, from the perspective of the amount of repurchase payment, the repurchase amount of six listed companies this year exceeded 1 billion yuan.
Among them, the first place is Yili shares, whose repurchase amount is more than 5 billion yuan.
How will the repurchase of shares of listed companies affect the market?
Zhao Xijun, vice president of the School of Finance and Finance of Renmin University of China, said in an interview with the China News Agency that on the one hand, the repurchase shows that the listed company has strong economic strength and good financial situation, and has the ability to maintain the stability of the stock price and give investors confidence; on the other hand, it also shows that the listed company and its controlling shareholders are responsible for the company, the market is responsible for the consideration of investors.
The former is based on the company's good business performance, while the latter requires listed companies and their controlling shareholders to have high quality.
For the capital market, these are the core basic elements.
Repurchased shares by listed companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence and supporting the stock prices of listed companies.
In addition, according to the Oriental Securities Research Report, according to the expected number of share repurchases set by A-share listed companies as a whole since the beginning of this year, and the average price of shares that have been repurchased, the incremental funds brought by the repurchased shares for the A-share market this year are expected to exceed 150 billion yuan.
In the past two months, the restoration of the large-scale mural "Tiantian Sanctation Map" of Tianjin Tiangong, a key national cultural protection unit, was announced on the 26th, and will be reopened to the public during the National Day this year.
The "Sand of the Day" is a large-scale traditional mural that fully reflects the life of Mazu.
With the approval of the relevant state departments, Cai Changkui, director of the former Tianjin Civic Museum (Tianguo Palace), was drawn from 1991 to 1994.

Cai Changkui said that in recent years, Tianjin summer rain, dry winter, this "wet and dry" led to the rubble of the murals, the rupture part of the total mural area of 60%.
In order to protect and rescue the murals of the Mazu deeds, the Ancient Cultural Street Management Committee and the Tiangong Palace of Nankai District of Tianjin City launched the restoration project of the Temple of Tin Hau and the murals in the Temple.
The restoration project was led by Cai Changkui and invited four famous national painters to participate.
The restoration work is based on the principle of "repairing as old as old", and at the same time, the original murals have been adjusted to adjust the local content, and the original imperfect place of the murals has been supplemented and restored.
In the process of repair, we have also made innovations and attempts in color, materials, pen and ink.
After the restoration, the style, spirituality, spirit and artistic style of the original murals were maintained.
The Tin Hau Palace was built in 1326, formerly known as the Tianfei Palace, commonly known as the Mother's Palace, after many renovations, is the oldest building complex in Tianjin, and is also one of the earliest existing Mazu Temple in China.

Wang Boxiang, Party Secretary of Shandong Yuan Shouguang County - Qiang County Fumin Akiko Heart - Xinhua.com
Wang Boxiang, a Shandong Shouguang man, was born in February 1943, joined the work in 1967, and has successively served as the party secretary of the township party committee, the county party secretary, the mayor and other positions.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang served as the party secretary of Shouguang County in Shandong Province, and at that time, Shouguang was the poor county of Weifang.
In the five years of Shouguang's tenure, Wang Boxiang concentrated on three things with his heart for the people: one is to promote the industrialization of vegetables; the other is to develop the North Salt and Alkali Beach; the third is to lay the foundation for the industrial rollover, so that the Shouguang people have raised their pockets and raised their waists since then.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables and have learned the lessons of growing vegetables.
In the early 1980s, the harvest of vegetables by Shouguang farmers could not be sold and rotten in the ground.
Wang Boxiang's research found that the key to catching vegetables is to do a good job in circulation.
Shouguang took the lead in building a wholesale vegetable market and opened the prelude to the development of a market economy.
Party members and cadres should take the lead, screw up, and bear all the losses in the county.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Boxiang, 17 party members such as Wang Leyi of Sanyuan Zhu Village set up 17 winter-style vegetable greenhouses, and 17 "double-yuan households" appeared in the village.
Subsequently, the county set up a promotion group, with the mobilization of Wang Boxiang, Wang Leyi in various townships tour guidance; the first year of the promotion of more than 5,000 vegetable greenhouses, after the vegetable greenhouse like the Yanyuan trend to the whole county and even the whole country.
For thousands of years, 1.6 million acres of land in the north, in addition to the salt-alkali beach, is the shallow beach.
Local people’s lives are very difficult.
How about a vegetable greenhouse in South Africa, and what about the north?
Wang Boxiang organized more than 100,000 people to engage in the conference battle, set up camp on the desert beach, one work is 40 or 50 days.
Wang Boxiang and the county's leading cadres eat and live on the site, with migrant workers like the cart pick, wind and dinner sleep, the people see them all thumbs up, heart-to-heart admiration ... ... ... ... ... at that time, Shoubei developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, in the salt-alkali beach coating the development of "corner pot".
In July 1986, Wang Boxiang participated in the Weifang City Industrial Conference for the first time as the secretary of the county party committee.
During the meeting, issued a "Weifang City, twelve counties urban industrial economic digital comparison table", at first glance, the total industrial output value, Shouguang is not bad, ranked fourth.
But if the original salt is removed, the pure industrial output value of Shouguang is only 119 million yuan, ranking third from the bottom.
Wang Boxiang with more than 70 people of the group, ran to the field "change of brain."
Less than a year later, the county invested 150 million yuan and embarked on 77 projects.
Since then, the organization of "learning group" every year, to Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai and other places to learn.
There is a shortage of businesses and a lack of entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang presided over a special meeting: in the county's open selection of factory manager managers, 40 "career-minded people" stood out, was pushed to the industrial line.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the top 100 counties in the country, and Wang Boxiang was transferred to the deputy mayor of Weifang City.
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable greenhouses, is 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, is 4,854 enterprises, is more than 100,000 "million households", is the people's recognized cadres. Shouguang people still affectionately called him "our secretary of Boxiang".
On September 26, local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presided over the meeting of foreign ministers of China and the African members of the Security Council at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The current African Security Council members of Côte d'Ivoire Foreign Minister Tano, Equatorial Guinea Foreign Minister Oyono, South African Foreign Minister Pandor and the member Niger, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Niger, and Tunisian Foreign Minister Jeshinawi attended the meeting.
Wang Yi put forward four suggestions on strengthening cooperation between China and Africa in the Security Council.
First, by strength.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, and the immediate consequence is that the basic norms of international relations are challenged, and the role of the United Nations is affected, which harms the interests of developing countries and small and medium-sized countries, including African countries.
To deal with this challenge, China and Africa need to hold hands, shoulder to shoulder, and unity to have strength.
In the Security Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, focusing on the weight is not just three votes, but the entire African continent.
China and Africa stand together not only with four votes, but will lead other countries to follow up, influence and shape the agenda of the Security Council.
Since 2018, China and African members of the Security Council have established a "3+1" coordination mechanism, and this coordination mechanism should be fully utilized.
Second, the dispute is settled through consultation.
China has always advocated the political settlement of hotspot issues, and Africa has a good tradition of consultation and the experience of successful mediation by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex challenges on the Council's agenda, especially in Africa, are mostly the banes of colonialism, some directly related to external factors.
We must make good use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and play a good role in the good offices and mediation of the United Nations.
Third, rely on self-reliance.
African countries and people know the problems of Africa best, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
When the Council addresses the hot issues in Africa, it should focus on listening and respecting Africa's will, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is willing to strengthen coordination with Africa and firmly promote the capacity-building of independent peace operations in Africa.
Fourth, it is based on development.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries, and we must adhere to putting economic and social development first and support each other's choice of development path.
China is willing to work together to build the Belt and Road Initiative with the African Union's Agenda 2063, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries enhance their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflict.
We must jointly promote the United Nations to increase investment in Africa's development.
With the outbreak of the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) again, China has made every effort and will continue to do its best to provide human and material assistance within its capacity, and is willing to coordinate actions with African countries to mobilize the United Nations, WHO and other countries to increase assistance and play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

Zhang Hong introduced that at present, the city is organizing the implementation of 373 intelligent transformation projects, with a total planned investment of 29.76 billion yuan, Hongxin Communication Huazhong's first 5G intelligent production line, Motorola's national leading intelligent mobile phone production line, Wuhan Siemens transformer digital unmanned factory, aerospace science and technology industry's first batch satellite production line, Huisheng biological world's leading new veterinary drug intelligent production line, Oubang smart home Internet of Things intelligent production line and a number of leading intelligent workshops and smart factories in the industry have started construction.
In addition, Wuhan has also increased financial support for intelligent transformation projects.
Among them, including the implementation of intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises, according to their actual completion of investment; including equipment hardware investment, research and development soft investment, given 8%, up to 20 million yuan of transformation subsidies.
At the same time, financial institutions such as the Wuhan branch of the Joint Exchange and the Zhejiang Commercial Bank have been actively cooperating to provide personalized financial services for the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises, and vigorously alleviate the pressure on corporate financing.
Trudeau "man to collapse", he can still be re-elected?
This time, Trudeau tripped out a "big pit", it is Trudeau himself dug out a little bit.
Recently, the Canadian media successively exposed a number of old photos of the current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which Trudeau dressed himself as a black person.
This is considered to be a clear act of racial discrimination, which has caused an uproar in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, the Canadian people do not buy much.
Trudeau took the stone and hit his own feet.
As the political commentator Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the "anti-blackface movement" in the United States, Trudeau and the federal Liberal Party have been high-profile accusations that the opposition party or dissenters in the party have "a big loss" in this regard, and repeatedly threatened that "no one who makes this mistake should be immediately dismissed".
In short, this time, Trudeau tripped out a "big hole", it is Trudeau himself dug out a little bit.
Trudeau is the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, a young and handsome man who just made his debut with a whirlwind of “political idols.”
Originally a "political amateur", he took over as the head of the Federal Liberal Party and fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the 2015 Canadian federal legislative elections - the Federal Liberal Party won more than half of the seats in the federal lower house, gaining valuable separate government.
At that time, Trudeau put forward many deafening political platforms and ideas, such as "ethnicity and gender equality", "eco-environmental protection", "economic revitalization", emphasizing the elimination of corruption and "injustice" and so on.
However, in the past five years in power, he has been in power in almost all of these aspects, "going high and low".
Take the "ethnic and gender equality" issue, leaving aside the "blackface" incident, after he "glossed" on a series of issues related to Aboriginal people, so that the indigenous groups, leaders in the 150th anniversary of the founding of Canada to the protest tent to the gate of the Capitol.
In terms of eliminating corruption, at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, Trudeau was involved in the "Langwan spirit incident".
It was exposed, on their hometown of the construction engineering company "Lan Wanling" major violations of the case of private fraud, to the department and officials responsible for investigation and punishment of the pressure, asked the latter "lift your hand."
Moreover, after the incident, Trudeau was angry with the officials who disclosed the case of the evil case, Wang Zhoudi, who was the first to disclose the case, and the Canadian Attorney General, who directly handled the case.
Although the case itself still has doubts, its suspicions are difficult to wash away.
Many observers pointed out that the collapse of the people in Trudeau's five years in power is mainly caused by his own "shaving pit", and the biggest "pit" is "tiger head and snake tail", "self-inflicted" and "broad than self-discipline, strict with the law" three.
Canada's most authoritative Angus-Red poll data show that since 2015, the number of respondents supporting Trudeau has slipped from more than 60% to more than 30%, while opponents have soared from less than 30% to more than 60%.
Although other opposition parties and their leaders have performed equally poorly, even a significant number of voters who are still willing to vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now dismissing the federal prime minister and the leader of the ruling party.
On October 21, the new Canadian federal legislative election is about to begin, can Trudeau repeat the drama of the big victory five years ago?
The answer may be in one word: difficult.
Whether from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or from the regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration level, have far-reaching impact and positive significance.
On September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially opened.
The Beijing News reporter learned from the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission that the capital airport is already in a supersaturated operation state, and the opening of Daxing International Airport will enhance the air service capacity of the capital.
After Shanghai, Beijing has become the second city with two airports in China, and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport mainly serves domestic aviation affairs, Pudong Airport is similar to international shipping aviation, and the future Capital Airport and Daxing Airport will also serve the differentiated positioning of different domestic and international aviation services to provide more segmented services.
From the perspective of business development, the opening of Daxing Airport is more positive for the capital airport.
Capital Airport in 2018 passenger throughput exceeded 100 million people, ranking first in the country, but compared with the rapid growth of business demand, there is still a significant poor capacity, especially the international route demand has a large gap.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passenger travel, business travel and so on, to adapt to Beijing's increasingly open, international-in-line urban development trend, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub airport, plans to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million people, cargo and mail throughput of 4 million tons in the future.
Therefore, the two airports do not have overlapping positioning, and they also have enough market space for different customer groups.
From the perspective of economic accounting, the navigation of Daxing International Airport will obviously form a win-win effect, alleviate the tension in Beijing's air capacity, accelerate the growth rate of passenger and cargo throughput, and create an incremental cake for the dual-core operation of the capital aviation.
From the user's point of view, with the opening of Daxing International Airport, the future does not have to be concentrated in the capital airport travel, but also to reduce the route too concentrated caused by a series of problems, such as the station security time, passenger boarding speed is slow, indirectly increase the aircraft and passengers in the airport detention time, increase the burden of airport operation, through the capital airport shipping burden, in fact, also improve the passenger travel experience.
According to the media's calculation of the time and cost of various transportation routes to large international airports, such as starting from the South Fifth Ring Road, the Beijing Kai Expressway directly to the Daxing Airport Expressway, driving 50 minutes can be reached, the oil money is about 40 yuan, and the high-speed fee is 15 yuan; while the choice of the rail transit subway Daxing Airport Line, the distance is limited to 20 kilometers and 30 kilometers, the fare is divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan three tranches; the public can also take the Jingxiong Intercity, from Beijing West Station to Daxing Airport Station.
In general, the public to Daxing Airport has a variety of means of transport to choose from, and the cost and time are also within a more reasonable range.
From the perspective of trend development: Daxing Airport is positioned as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei transportation hub, so it is a little farther from the Beijing District, but it has strengthened the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, which has facilitated more people's travel, which is of great significance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, Hebei and Tianjin passengers can enjoy more international air route services provided by Daxing International Airport, which can be seen from the traffic planning of Daxing Airport.
The supporting transportation facilities of Daxing Airport are very perfect, in addition to the new airport line directly to Daxing Airport in Beijing, there are also a number of highways connecting Daxing Airport and surrounding areas.
Just as passengers from Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other cities in Guangdong can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport through highways such as Guangfo and Guangshen, residents of Langfang and Xiong'an New Area around Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport and obtain convenient and efficient air services.
It can be seen that the navigation of Daxing International Airport not only adds a few runways and several aircraft, whether it is from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or from the regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration, have far-reaching impact and positive significance, not only related to the long-term layout and development of Beijing's shipping industry, but also to provide diversified choices for the travel of the majority of residents of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, promote the further improvement of the quality of service in Beijing's shipping industry.
Therefore, for the navigation of Daxing Airport, we must not only count the small account of individuals in the economy, but also the large account of the overall development.

2019 Vietnam Economic and Social Issues Forum Held in Hue Province
Deputy Director of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam Nguyen De Jian revealed that at the beginning of this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new improvements and continued to maintain growth.
The forum focused on the prominent economic and social issues in the first few months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development in the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the forum, the participants exchanged in-depth views and views on four topics: economic development in 2019 and the impact of some free trade agreements, some outstanding issues of Vietnam's economy in 2019, prominent problems in Vietnam's social culture in 2019, and forecasts and suggestions for Vietnam's economic and social development in 2020.
Delegates generally agreed that in the first few months of 2019, global economic growth slowed, risks and challenges increased.
Trade frictions between major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded that despite the uncertainty of the global economy, with 70% of the world's economies falling into a state of stagnation, Vietnam's economic development has achieved many gratifying achievements, the stable macroeconomic operation, inflation has been effectively controlled, and the consumer price index increased by an average of 2.64% in the first half of 2019, the lowest increase in nearly three years.
In the first half of 2019, GDP grew by 6.76%, which is lower than the 7.05% in the same period last year, but it is still a high level compared with the level of the same period in 2011-2017.
In making a forecast of Vietnam's economic development trend in 2019-2020, Deng Deying, deputy director of the National Economic and Social Forecasting Center of Vietnam, said that in the context of world economic turmoil, Vietnam's economy has shown a high growth momentum in 2019.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macro economy will continue to remain basically stable, the implementation of various free trade agreements will promote trade development, economic restructuring and improvement of the business environment will be further strengthened, due to the impact of trade frictions, Vietnam's foreign export activities will show a downward trend.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring and forecasting early warning mechanism, take the initiative to find trade remedy measures for Vietnamese exports, find opportunities to expand new export markets, and create convenience for the export of various commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, the inflation rate is kept at a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of auxiliary industries and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and ecological agriculture.

In Yunqi Town to witness the decade of digital China "cloud" - Xinhua
If the 2009 local website forum is taken as the origin, the 2019 Yunqi Conference held in Hangzhou from 25 to 27 has gone through a full decade.
From the concept of "cloud in the fog" to the practice of "up the cloud", big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies supporting China's economic development, social management and public services in the past 10 years.
In the Zhengtai new energy photovoltaic cell workshop located in Haining, Zhejiang Province, the recent quality inspectors next to a new "colleague" loaded with Aliyun artificial intelligence.
It is 24 hours, the recognition speed is more than twice that of manual, and the quality inspection accuracy is stable at more than 95%.
According to the person in charge of the company, the "quality inspector" with the camera has concentrated on learning more than 40,000 blemish samples, with the cloud computing power behind, it can quickly convert the infrared image into binary language, there will be blemished battery cells classified placement.
This company is just a microcosm of today’s cloud computing-assisted manufacturing transformation.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the "Guideline for Promoting the Implementation of the Cloud in Enterprises (2018-2020)", proposing that by 2020, we will strive to achieve a significant increase in the awareness and enthusiasm of enterprises on the cloud, and the proportion and application depth of the cloud will be significantly improved.
Wang Jian, founder of Alibaba Cloud, said that today, data-centric cloud computing has built a bridge and opened up a road for the digital economy of data for key elements.
At the same time, in the past 10 years, the scale of China's cloud computing industry has also continued to expand.
The "White Paper on Cloud Computing Development (2019)" released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology in July this year shows that the overall market size of cloud computing in China in 2018 reached 96.28 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2% over 2017.
In addition to becoming a key technology to support industrial transformation and digital economy development, the invisible "cloud" has also unknowingly changed urban management and social life.
At this year's Yunqi Conference, the "city brain" that has appeared for three consecutive years is still attracting attention.
At present, the city brain has become the center of urban management from a traffic management tool, and the relevant cooperation applications have expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through the camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithm, the city brain through the strong computing power, so that "stop the first to pay", "the number of visits real-time perception", "travel line design" and other new city management service functions can be realized.
In the field of government services, with "one cloud" docking "one thing", the "hands-on office", "hands-on" to promote, cloud computing for the supply of government services at both ends of the convenience.
At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform in the province through the cloud of government affairs.
As of September 11, the platform has covered more than 57 million resident population and more than 15 million legal entities in the province, and gathered 19.08 billion data in 3066 categories.
The average monthly data transferred and shared by the Zhejiang provincial government departments has reached 12 million, and the flow of data on the "cloud" may mean that the masses do less errands.
Be careful with plastic tea bags!
According to the Central News Agency, a recent Canadian study found that a package of plastic tea bags may release billions or even tens of billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than a person's estimated annual intake of microplastics, but so far there is no evidence that the intake of plastic particles will pose a threat to humans.
Researchers at the University of Margill in Canada found that dipping plastic tea bags into a cup of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius), tea bags will release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into cups.
This amount is significantly higher than the amount of microplastics a person estimates to be ingested throughout the year.
According to research published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 microplastics a year and inhales the same amount of microplastics.
It is reported that the study was published in the "Journal of Environmental Science and Technology", and the researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montreal stores and cafes, opened tea bags, and immersed the tea bags in almost boiling water for 5 minutes after cleaning, and then analyzed them with electron microscopes and spectrometers.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, "a few more than the previous plastic load of other foods."
Most tea bags are made of natural fiber, but many tea bag brands that use natural fibers still use plastic to seal.
Some branded tea bags have been made of paper instead of plastic, and these plastic tea bags are the subjects that researchers have tested.
Microplastics are tiny fragments of plastic that the researchers define as being between 100 nanometers and 5 millimeters in size, mainly from the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of microplastics in air, soil, rivers and deepest trenches around the world, and these microplastics can also be found in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
For the first time in October 2018, researchers found microplastics in human fecal samples in several countries in different regions of the world.
To test the potential toxicity of the tea bag to release microplastics, the Canadian team put water fleas into contaminated water and found that microplastics affected the behavior of these fleas and caused them to develop deformities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence so far that ingesting microplastics poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO said more research was needed to fully understand how these plastics spread to the environment and what impact it has on humans.
The researchers speculate that the reason why these tea bags release a large number of plastic particles may be that these plastic tea bags are in contact with boiling water, and even when the "edible grade" plastic is heated to more than 40 degrees Celsius, it may break down or ooze toxic substances.
Guterres said the climate emergency is the biggest threat to the survival of small island states.
There, a natural disaster erodes the development of a generation.
The hurricane-hit Babuda, Dominica and the Bahamas this year all illustrate this.
About a quarter of small island developing States live at an altitude of 5 metres or less.
Relocations can have serious implications for their societies and ways of life, and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At the Climate Action Summit on Monday, small island nations are working together to achieve carbon neutrality and 100% renewable energy by 2030, allowing them to once again lead the world in the right direction.
“The climate crisis is piling up new injustices over old injustices.
Although the contribution of small island developing States to global warming was small, it paid the highest price.
Because these countries are middle-income, many countries are also trapped in a cycle of disaster and debt acceleration and unsustainable debt.
The world must act, and it is time to make big decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States.”
Today ' s high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for assistance in the management of disaster risks in small island developing States, investment in climate-resilient infrastructure and ways to transition to renewable energy, and urged international agencies to help small island developing States, particularly heavily indebted middle-income countries, to secure funding.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the Earth's lifeline, the ocean.
The latest special report released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have already suffered the “engulfing” severe consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, extreme sea level rise may occur in many areas every year, which is not only once a century.
The report warns that some island nations are likely to become uninhabitable without investing heavily in adaptation.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused huge losses.
The world has lost half of all living corals in the last 150 years, and plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the past 40 years.
Demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a reduction in resources, including the maintenance of fishing grounds for many island communities.
Small island States also face high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, subjecting them to price fluctuations.
Some States are also working to address the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons, weapons and drugs.
“By solving one of the most challenging environments, this problem can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with the tools, lessons learned and examples that the world can learn from.”
He stressed that small island developing States were a special case of sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
India’s finance ministry said the financial system was liquid.
Indian Finance Minister Sitharaman said on the 26th that the current liquidity of the financial system is sufficient, and driven by the holiday consumer demand, India's economic growth is expected to recover in the second half of this fiscal year.
Sitharaman made the remarks after a meeting with representatives of private banks, non-banking financial institutions, housing banks and other institutions in India.
Sitharaman did not specify the specificity of these remarks.
Some Indian media and overseas media have blamed the continued slowdown in India’s economy on liquidity constraints in non-bank financial institutions.
Sitharaman cited the decline in car sales as an example, denying that liquidity is the main reason for the decline in sales.
Sitharaman pointed out that the decline in car sales was mainly caused by cyclical factors.
Sitharaman expects India’s economic growth to recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday spending.
The annual shopping season in India starts in September and will run until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping consumption will greatly boost India’s economic growth.

Support pig production to ensure market supply
Sui Loyalty requires the implementation of various measures from six aspects
The province's video conference to promote pig production guarantee market supply was held today, and the policy measures of the central and provincial committees and provincial governments on supporting pig production to ensure market supply were mobilized and re-deployed.
Sui loyalty requirements, from six aspects to grasp the implementation of pig production measures.
To grasp the implementation of the "vegetable basket" mayor's responsibility system, this year the province's clear 45 million pigs out of the task has been decomposed into the city and state, into the responsibility system assessment.
We will do a good job in implementing various policies and measures, and effectively solve the problem of implementing the "last mile" of policies.
We can do a good job in the implementation of breeding sow production, earnestly implement the subsidy policy for breeding sows, encourage breeding pig enterprises to expand the breeding scale of breeding pigs, and systematically select excellent sows from the commodity pig group.
Do a good job in the implementation of investment attraction, and take the well-known large-scale breeding enterprises that have not yet entered our province as the top priority of investment attraction.
We will do a good job in the implementation of the market circulation system, accelerate the construction of cold chain logistics facilities for pigs, and comprehensively promote the change from "pig adjustment" to "meat adjustment".
To do a good job in the implementation of the modern epidemic prevention system, all localities should be equipped with grass-roots epidemic prevention and quarantine personnel who are compatible with the scale of breeding and work tasks, and build the first line of defense for epidemic prevention and control.
Sui loyalty requires that all efforts be made to ensure the supply of meat market, ensure that there is no large-scale shortage, and a large-scale supply is cut off, and ensure that the supply of pork market is stable on major holidays.
The meeting also deployed on the continuous efforts to prevent and control the African swine fever epidemic, the prohibition of fishing and recapture in the important waters of the river basin of our governor, and the acquisition of late rice in the province.

“Overage migrant workers on some sites are estimated to account for more than half.
Where to find young workers now?
There is no way to use so many "old people" on the construction site.
Recently, for the construction site there are many over-age migrant workers (more than the retirement age) phenomenon, for many years in the construction industry as a project contractor Zou Kui lamented.
Recently, the author's university in the city of rain pollution diversion project, there are a lot of migrant workers on the campus, if you pay attention to observe, you will find that there are many over-age migrant workers.
Over-age migrant workers go out to work is not "idle", but because "can't idle", with "have to be so" helpless and hard - whether it is to save money to solve their own pension and medical problems, or to help children, are driving these old people who should have "idle" to continue to work hard.
The "old dependence" of over-age migrant workers is not as easy as we think.
Raising children, feeding the elderly, reading for children, helping children build buildings to buy cars, helping children to start a family, raising grandchildren from generation to generation, when these migrant workers have completed the "life task", the money bag has been hollowed out and even a lot of debt, most of them lack wealth accumulation.
In order not to drag the children and to save more wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "doing until they can't do it."
Many "post-80s", "post-90s" and even "post-00s" new generation of migrant workers are not willing to engage in hard-to-dister secondary industries or low-end service industries with high labor intensity, resulting in a structural "labor shortage", which is unattractive, providing opportunities for over-age migrant workers.
Due to the lack of a skill, physical function and labor capacity have declined, and many over-age migrant workers are doing work with high intensity, low income, high risk and less protection.
Able to do a day is a day, can earn a little more is a little, "can not idle" behind the survival of migrant workers' survival dilemma, can not be ignored and ignored.
Solving the problems of unpaid wages and asking for wages, improving labor protection, reducing safety risks, increasing labor income, and improving the survival of over-age migrant workers, in addition to their "self-salvation", they are also inseparable from the institutional protection and humanistic care of the public sector.
Some scholars pointed out that overage migrant workers are unlikely to rely on returning home to solve their own old-age care and medical treatment and other issues, and they must provide for their families through other methods.
Reading the helplessness and strength of over-age migrant workers who cannot be idle helps us better understand the love and pain of over-age migrant workers.
Seeing the back of the over-age migrant workers, hearing their sighs, trying to find ways to return to the countryside, they really achieve "old and dependent", the need for the public sector, the market and society to share responsibilities in the benign interaction, the need for multiple efforts.
Chemezov said that Russia will not export the system in the next five years, because "the first supply of the national army, after that will be the export production."
This approach is fully in line with international practice.
Major producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure their own defence needs first before processing export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Grekhov, deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian Air Force, said the development of the system was about to be completed.
The S-500 system was developed by "Diamond-Aeta" space defense Kang Tsean.
This is a new generation of air defense systems that employ the working principles used to destroy ballistics and aerodynamic targets.
The main role of the S-500 is to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles with a range of less than 3,500 kilometers.
In addition, according to some data, the S-500 can also destroy hypersonic cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles that exceed five times the speed of sound, and even targets in near space.
Such weapons can also be integrated with other air defense systems into a unified network, especially the S-400 system, which is very important from a defense point of view.
Sergey Chemezov expressed special attention to the S-400.
He said the system is currently in great demand in the world, but the Russian military also needs it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 air defense system entered the Arctic Air Defense Regiment.
According to the news on September 15, the work of the New Island Arctic Air Defense Mission to modify the S-400 air defense missile system has been completed.
This is not Russia’s militarization in the Arctic.
The Russian Defense Ministry said that this is entirely a process in the transition plan to a more advanced defense tool in the strategic direction of the north.
"With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controllable airspace of the Arctic region has increased significantly," said the Russian Northern Fleet Information Service.
It is very important that, according to military assessments, the system was used successfully in the Far North and Arctic regions.
Air defense regiment officers and men were trained on the new system and prepared to enter combat duty.
Previously equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system, part of it is still retained.
When it comes to air defense systems, they must have weapons that can destroy a variety of air targets, whether it is targets of high-speed flight at the outer altitude layer, or "fish that leaks" close to the protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by the Golden Diamond-Aetan air defense, is designed for use in attack strategies and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other aerial attack weapons.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 kilometers and shoot down ballistic targets flying at a distance of 4.8 kilometers per second within 60 kilometers.
Russia has never concealed its additional air defenses in the Far North to ensure the security of its airspace on the Northern Sea Route.
Not long ago, the first 12 Tor (Tor)-M2DT air defense missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, enough to form an air defense battalion to strengthen the Arctic air defense system.
At that time, the Russian Ministry of Defense said that the Arctic "Tor" force will be expanded to a complete brigade-level system in the future.
Coupled with the new S-400 long-range system deployed to the New Land Island and the Kola Peninsula and the “Pantsir-SA” short-range system deployed in the Far North, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons strongly defend Russia’s polar skies.
Enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles will have a hard time breaking through this defense.
According to the Russian government's idea, the flagship store will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complicated and long process of opening their own stores.
As the operator of Russian stores, the Russian company focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
Russian products in Tmall (Tmall), JD (JD), 1688, Pinduoduo (Pinduoduo), Hand Q (ShouQ), multi-functional instant messaging software WeChat (Wechat) and other Chinese largest trading platforms have online stores, and have their own online platform Edupino.com and Russian commodity retail chain stores.
The Russian Export Center will work with Russia to develop store marketing strategies and participation standards, and screen virtual shelves to list products to enterprises.
The store plans to open and list at least 10 products from Russian manufacturers by the end of the year.
According to the Russian Export Center, the total number of visits per month for Chinese e-commerce platforms is as high as 1 billion.
At the same time, food exports to China have been showing steady growth since 2014, surpassing $1 billion in 2018.
Alibaba Group will also open a pilot store to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of the global import strategy.
According to Alexei Kozhevnikov, the new store will display the goods of enterprises with sales of at least 500 million rubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and sales of 500 million rubles are not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers are quite positive about Russian goods, and regard our products as high-quality and green environmental protection products."
Kzevnikov said that the competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and increasing.
“Our goal is ambitious, with 500 businesses launched through this store in three years,” he said.
At the same time, the platform will also be listed on the products of enterprises in the Russian Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor in the basic study of trade policy at Plekhanov Economic University in Russia, said: “This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export center is a state-owned, not a private institution,” said Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor at the Trade Policy Basics Department at Plekhanov Economic University in Russia.
"I don't see a lot of very competitive Russian goods in the market."
He believes that the project will probably not be implemented, but it will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to RIA Novosti, Andrey Slepnev, president of the Russian Export Center, said during the Eastern Economic Forum that product information for more than 170 Russian companies has been published on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform, and can be purchased in both China and other countries.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, that is, the training program of experts from Taobao University for Russian companies, the first of which was held in July this year.
In November this year, the Russian Export Center at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai will also serve as the organizer of Russian enterprises to participate in industry exhibitions and commercial projects.
A large-scale exhibition will be held in the 1,000-square-meter exhibition hall, which will also be the center for holding business project activities, signing the agreement, promotion meeting and talks with Chinese business representatives.
About 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
“In addition to the agricultural stand, we will definitely hold a business meeting, that is, direct contact between entrepreneurs.”
“This is another direction of our efforts to support businesses and ensure dozens of special meetings are arranged for them.”
In addition, the fair will also host master classes, cooking competitions and Russian celebrity chefs cooking Russian food tastings for the “Exploring the Shanghai Station for Russian Food” project.

New China Times Review: Unswervingly Take Our Own Road
The white paper "China and the World in the New Era" released on the 27th answers: In the past 70 years, China's development has been successful, and the fundamental reason is that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the correct development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and have unswervingly followed this path.
China's development path is suitable for its own development, which is the choice of history and the choice of the people.
Since modern times, in the environment of poverty and weakness and internal and external troubles, generations of benevolent people have sought and gone on to seek and succeed in the search for national salvation.
However, "the constitutional monarchy, the restoration of the imperial system, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, the presidential system have been thought of, tried, and the result is not feasible."
It was not until the Chinese Communist Party and the new China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The road that China has taken is the road of happiness of the Chinese people and the road to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and it is also the same path for the common development of China and other countries in the world.
It is precisely because we are on the right path that China can do its own thing well, and only by becoming the world's second largest economy and the country that contributes the most to global economic growth can continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As pointed out in the white paper, China's development path, in line with China's national conditions, to adapt to the requirements of the times, will be as the times forward more and more show a bright development prospect.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how easy it is to find the right path; looking around the world, the Chinese people cherish this right path more.
The Chinese people understand the truth of the southern orange porch, and understand that it is not necessarily suitable for others, only the right one is the best.
It is with this kind of road confidence and strategic determination that China has created a remarkable miracle.
In the tortuous process of human progress, the "final conclusion of history" has been famous.
Today, the success of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics has announced the end of the "ultimate conclusion of history", the collapse of the "China collapse theory", and the failure of the "socialist failure theory".
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries to achieve prosperity and strength, expanded the way for developing countries to move to modernization, and provided experience and reference for those countries and peoples in the world who both want to accelerate development and maintain their own independence, and take the road that suits their national conditions.
The world is rich.
China has always respected the right of all countries to choose a development path that suits their own national conditions.
China does not "import" the foreign model, nor "exports" the Chinese model, but will unswervingly take its own path, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen governance exchanges with other countries, and make due contributions to the common realization of good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that a Foodworks supermarket owner fired a 66-year-old woman by text message because he preferred to hire employees from Asian-American backgrounds, and the boss's practice was slammed as "disgraceful."
The commission said the way Ms. Gail Ayton, who has worked at the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, was “extremely unfair” and could violate anti-discrimination laws.
Ms. Ayton told the committee that Mr. Wang had taken over the store in 2016 and that he had been "wanting to fire me" because she was not Chinese.
In this case, Deputy Chairman Peter Sams conducted a search on the Internet and found that "Mr. Wang has published some job advertisements on various Chinese employment forums in Australia in the past".
Among the job requirements listed for these positions, one said "Preferred Asian Lady" and the other said "Preferred Asian Employee".
The third post said that he "prefers to be overseas people (sic)".
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton via text message in April, which he later said was due to her absence and a small cash deficit from the cash register allegedly from $5.10 to $30.
But Mr. Sams said Mr. Wang had weak reasons for dismissing Ms. Ayton and lacked evidence.
In the past three years, she has only been absent from one shift, and the "missing amount" totals a few Australian dollars.
He said Ms Ayton's dismissal "has nothing to do with her behavior or performance in fact".
"In my opinion, with the support of the evidence from the job ads issued by Mr. Wang, the real motivation for the debate to fire her is that he prefers to hire employees with Asian backgrounds," he said.
Under section 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's actions ostensibly constitute a violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or dismissal of the applicant are unlawful.
Mr Sams said it was inappropriate for Mr. Wang to consider reinstating her post, given Mr. Wang ' s "horrible" treatment of Ms. Ayton.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, a temporary worker with a salary of $26 an hour.
Given possible violations of anti-discrimination and labor relations legislation, Sams said he would refer his decisions and documents to the committee’s supervisor to consider whether Mr. Wang’s actions should be turned over to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
He said Mr. Wang had not given Ms. Ayton any chance to respond to the reasons allegedly fired from her.
"I think that the debate should take an incorrigible injustice and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant, and Mr. Wang 'waits' for this opportunity, which he believes will 'prove' that it is justified to terminate the applicant's employment," he said.
“He is wrong ... the debate should be dismissed completely disregarding any natural and fair treatment given to her, and it is shocking that he is indecent and extremely unfair perfunctory.”
Mr. Sams said that while Foodworks is a small business, “it must be frank that no decent employer will be able to lay off employees in the way that they acknowledge in this case in a way that is extremely unfair and perfunctory.”
He said, "It's shameful, and it's extremely unfair."

6 people deny the sale of fake Maka newspaper paper case to the high court trial
Six men suspected of forgery and selling China's passports, newspaper papers and identity cards, including an assistant director of the State-name registration bureau, and a datuk-level businessman, passed the case on Thursday, and the magistrate approved the allegations of anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking immigration and transferred them to the high court for trial.

He said that he had attracted criticism of political opponents because he had attracted political opponents on behalf of the defendant, and his party was also implicated.
He stressed that he was not afraid of any threat, but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to stigmatize the PAP and the Pakatan Harapan government or other Pakatan Harapan leaders, so this decision was made after careful consideration.
He also said that there was no conflict of interest between representing the defendant and being a member of Congress, and that he had not been legally prohibited from representing any of the defendants, and that the defendant, Li Zhenhua, had not yet been convicted.
The six defendants were charged in court on 12 September this year, and in the face of a number of anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking immigration laws, Section 26E, and the criminal code of Section 466 (forgery of documents) charges, all denied guilt, and did not obtain court approval to be released on bail pending trial.
On Thursday, two magistrates, Nosaha, and Mazlan, after statements by both sides of the prosecution, approved the prosecution’s application to transfer the charges of the anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking immigration decrees involving the six defendants to the high court, and the charges of falsifying documents will be heard in court on October 3, waiting for the prosecution to hand over documents to the defense.
The six defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (SOSMA) and the judge did not grant bail.

World's oldest barber dies at 108, haircuts 96 years old
Anthony Mancinelli, the world's oldest barber certified by the Guinness World Record in New York, has never retired to cut a haircut for guests every day at the age of 108, but on the 19th, Mancinelli died of complications from jaw cancer and bid farewell to his 96-year-old haircut.
According to CNN, Mansinelli immigrated to the United States at the age of eight, not long after he helped clean the floor at a barbershop, and at the age of 12, he began to pick up scissors to serve his guests, thereby reducing the economic pressure on his family.
Mancinelli had a primary school at the time, but he did not graduate.
Mancinelli's son, Robert, revealed that his father loved work and people from all over the world liked him, but although his father had always been healthy, he was diagnosed with cancer in February this year, and finally could not work due to physical factors six weeks before his death, but this was not retirement, because he planned to wait for his own good to get better and get back to cut his hair.
Robert, 82, says he now has to find a new barber after his father's death, because he's been asked to help with hair cuts throughout his life.
During the year, the repurchase scale of listed companies exceeded 100 billion yuan, a record high - Xinhua
In order to stabilize the company's stock price and maintain the company's image, listed companies have begun to repurchase shares frequently in the past two years, and hope to pass the information on the undervaluation of the company to the market through targeted repurchases and collective bidding transactions, so as to stabilize the stock price and enhance investor confidence.
Oriental Wealth Choice data show that in 2017, the funds used by listed companies to repurchase shares were 7.9 billion yuan, which soared to 51 billion yuan in 2018, and since 2019, the total amount of repurchase implementation of A-share listed companies has exceeded 100 billion yuan, setting a new high in the amount of A-share repurchase funds, and far exceeding the previous year.
From the perspective of the purpose of repurchase, the company's repurchase of shares seems to be the same as the increase in the shareholding of major shareholders, but there are great differences in the implementation of the main body, the source of funds, the use of repurchase, and the equity of the stock itself.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Mei Kerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said in an interview with the "Securities Daily" reporter that in November 2018, the "Opinions on Supporting Listed Companies to Repurchase Shares" was revised in response to the existing system such as narrow share repurchase range, complex decision-making procedures, and incomplete inventory system.
In January this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange officially released the "Implementation Rules for Repurchase Shares by Listed Companies", which broadened the source of repurchase funds for listed companies, appropriately simplified implementation procedures, guided and improved governance arrangements, and encouraged all kinds of listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee stock ownership plans.
After the introduction of the opinion, the operation of the share repurchase by the listed company has more applicable circumstances, the repurchase process is simpler, and the enthusiasm for share repurchase is greater.
Repurchasing shares in a relatively low position is also conducive to listed companies to improve the efficiency of the use of funds, thereby increasing the level of profit per share, increasing the return on net assets, and reducing the pressure on the company's profit indicators.
Compared with the increase in the holdings of major shareholders, the significance of repurchased shares by listed companies is greater, which also reflects the willingness of listed companies to manage their active market value and cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that the undervaluation of the stock price is the main factor of the repurchase of listed companies, the company's stock price has not been able to reflect the future development prospects of the company, so such companies are worthy of investors' attention, but can not blindly invest, need to pay attention to the financial reports of such listed companies and the specific operation.
Listed companies with large-scale repurchase behavior at least show the company's development confidence and financial strength.
The enthusiasm for repurchases of A-share listed companies has gradually warmed up, and the repurchase behavior has also been normalized, and the data shows that nearly 1,000 listed companies have implemented share repurchases this year, and the leading companies in various industries have become the main force in the repurchase market.
China Ping An recently disclosed the progress of repurchases, saying that the company has repurchased 57.59 million shares of A shares through centralized bidding transactions, accounting for 0.315% of the total share capital of the company, and the total amount of funds paid is 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction fees), and the repurchased shares will all be used for employee stock ownership plans, including but not limited to the long-term service plan that the company's shareholders' meeting has considered and adopted.
Yili shares have paid 5.792 billion yuan for share repurchase, and in the near future to adjust the use of repurchase shares, the original plan "repurchase shares will be used as a source of late-stage implementation of equity incentives of the stock" to "accumulative repurchase of 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares for the implementation of equity incentives of the stock source, the remaining 30.49 million shares will be used to cancel to reduce registered capital."
Yili said that the cancellation of some of the shares that have been repurchased is conducive to further improving the level of earnings per share and effectively improving the return on investment of the company's shareholders.
TCL Group released a repurchase progress announcement on September 25, showing that TCL Group has repurchased 3.59% of the company's shares, at a total cost of 1.65 billion yuan.
The office of the board of directors of TCL Group told the Securities Daily reporter that the repurchased shares will be used for employee stock ownership plans, equity incentives or corporate bonds that can be converted into stocks issued by listed companies.
TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy, continuously improves competitiveness and sustains healthy development.
Based on the confidence in the future development of the company and the maintenance of investors' interests, combined with the performance of the company's stock in the secondary market in the past year, and taking into account the company's operating conditions and financial situation, the company plans to use its own funds, self-financing and other financing methods to buy back the company's shares.
Yang Delong, chief economist of Qianhai Open Source Fund, said that the operation of listed companies to buy back shares can on the one hand reduce the number of shares in circulation in the market, increase the earnings per share of listed companies, which is an important benefit to the share price of the secondary market; in addition, listed companies are willing to take the initiative to pull out real money and buy back shares from the stock market, which greatly boosts market confidence.
The repurchase of domestic listed companies has gradually increased in recent years, especially the performance of the stock, through the share repurchase to boost the confidence of investors is a very good way, but also worthy of recognition and encouragement of the practice.
Hu Henghua, Secretary of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and the Changsha Municipal Party Committee, and the four leaders of the Xiangjun Manufacturing of Construction Machinery - Zhan Chunxin, Liang Shuanggen, He Qinghua, Liu Feixiang, set a "small goal" around "Changsha from construction machinery to intelligent manufacturing" - three or five years to build the world's leading level of construction machinery industry cluster.
In Changsha to build the world's leading level of construction machinery industry cluster, in the current fashionable words, is to create "the strongest surface".
As an inland capital city, Changsha shouted out this grand word, what is the bottom of the road?
It is based on the power of domineering side leaks.
The four construction machinery enterprises participating in the dialogue have been developed, covering all fields in the sky, underground, sea and land: the light aircraft of Shanhe intelligent, the concrete transmission pump of Zoomen, the full ground crane of Sany Heavy Industry, the tunnel shield machine of the Iron Construction Heavy Industry, and its "hard strength" can be described as a unique step in the world and a proud group of heroes.
Once upon a time, China basically had no say in the field of construction machinery manufacturing.
When the world is changed, Chinese enterprises "bring in" and "going out" two-wheel drive, taking the east wind of the "Belt and Road" initiative, acquisitions, mergers, factories and other measures, leaping into the global construction machinery industry leader.
Among them, Sany Heavy Industry, MOJ, Iron Construction Heavy Industry, Shanhe Intelligent and other construction machinery leading enterprises, its output value, market share, sales and other major economic indicators, has been significantly ahead of similar enterprises.
It is a time of driving with the camera.
Construction machinery Xiangjun "four King Kong", is the leader of the Changsha construction machinery industry cluster, but also the global construction machinery industry head of the enterprise.
In the world of industry, who lives and lives well is the hard spirit to speak.
In the early years, the global construction machinery industry suffered a cold winter, many internationally renowned construction machinery manufacturing enterprises have fallen down, but Changsha's construction machinery manufacturing enterprises to "cat winter" as "winter swimming", self-pressure, self-breakthrough, through the transformation of industrial structure, from manufacturing to intelligent transformation, not only survived the past, and the body bones are more robust.
It is with the stars that the government and enterprises of the moon are given the same force.
The development of advantageous industries requires both the enterprise to be proactive and the government to act positively.
The reason why Changsha has the reputation of "construction machinery capital" is that it brings together the whole industrial chain from upstream to downstream, creates many related industrial clusters, and greatly reduces the cost of enterprise research and development, manufacturing and sales by optimizing the business environment, improving supporting services, and simplifying the approval process.
A good business ecology, so that construction machinery manufacturing enterprises come and go.
History has pushed Changsha to the front desk to build a global construction machinery leading level, not to be left.
Whether it is the government, or enterprises, and even the relevant industry, university and research enterprises and other links, should seize the opportunity, follow the trend, set the goal, continue to work hard, to build a strong country to contribute to the strength of Hunan.
Wang Yi presided over the meeting of the foreign ministers of China and the African member states of the Security Council.
Wang Yi said that China and African countries are good brothers and partners.

The two sides should rely on unity and strength, rely on consultation to solve disputes, rely on self-reliance, and rely on development to govern the fundamentals.
The foreign ministers of the participating African member states thanked China for its initiative to hold this meeting and congratulated New China on its 70th anniversary.
The foreign ministers said that Africa-China relations are based on equality and mutual respect, and Africa and China have always been each other's most reliable and reliable partners.
The African side appreciates China's important and positive role in African affairs as a permanent member of the Security Council, which has effectively promoted a just and reasonable settlement of African issues and made great efforts and contributions to safeguarding Africa's interests and promoting peace and security in Africa.
At present, Africa is facing the threat of terrorism and extremism, and only by addressing security issues can Africa truly achieve long-term peaceful development.
We look forward to further coordinating positions with China in the Security Council and strengthening solidarity and cooperation.
Wang Yi said that today's meeting reached an important consensus.

Gansu Qingyang: Lake sheep to "poverty alleviation".
The autumn of September renders the Loess Plateau.
In the Yimin breeding professional cooperative in Yima Town, Chavili, a 58-year-old villager, filled the trough in the sheep pen with the last shovel grass, guarded by the trough, and watched the white lake sheep chewing.
"Eat well, wait until autumn and winter is full, out of the market to sell a good price."
Shavili said that he feeds sheep a "special nutritious meal" every day, regularly cleans and disinfects, and carelessly does not dare to slack off.
Shavili raised sheep for more than 20 years, until he came to the cooperative to work, he knew how extensive sheep was in the past.
Shavili is a native of Xiayuchi Village, Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His left neighbor and right are sheep farmers, but adhere to the traditional free-range mode, the quality of the sheep is poor, and the amount of the market is small.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative, and everything began to change.
Shavilli buried his head all day to study farming, because he always held a breath in his heart.
The people who invested in the shares are all poor households, and they all trust the sheep to the cooperative, and whether they can pay dividends and sell the price at the end of the year can count on him.
Fortunately, under the guidance of technicians, he slowly learned to engage in epidemic prevention, mastered scientific feeding, and became one of the few breeding "good style" in the village.
Yimin breeding professional cooperative is a standardized cooperative, a total of 16 sheep sheds, breeding nearly 1,400 lake sheep.
Zou Tao, the head of the cooperative, said that there are many doorways inside and outside the standardized sheep shed.
"The wool is thick, easy to breed bacteria, the lake sheep in the sweltering and wet place to stay, the sheep shed must be built in the three sides of the ditch, but also have to install a change of fan to ventilate and dissipate heat."
Zou Tao said that in order to prevent the epidemic, it is also necessary to regularly disinfect the sheep shed spray, and give the sheep three to four epidemic prevention injections in the first quarter.
In addition to living well, the "little fat sheep" also have to eat grass mixed with silage corn, wheatgrass, alfalfa, etc., and have a wide enough " playground" to stretch the bones.
The cooperative adopts the method of trusteeship and maintenance, guides local farmers to put good-growing lake sheep here, unified breeding, management and sales, and realizes good seeding, scientificization, standardization, and intensive breeding.
Today, 140 poor households with sheep shareholds have a dividend of more than 6,000 yuan per household per year, and 4 poverty alleviation targets are working in cooperatives.
From "full mountain grazing" to "accurate feeding", from "local mating" to "artificial insemination", from "looking at the body type, touching the belly" to "doing B super"... In Qingyang, Gansu, sheep farming is not only a change in the way of feeding, "leading enterprises + cooperatives + farmers" model is to change the scene of "raising sheep on the hillside, selling sheep in the market", overcoming the weakness of traditional agriculture and animal husbandry.
Zou Tao said that if the market price is weak, the local leading enterprise Gansu Zhongsheng Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd. will be acquired with a market protection price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers disperse market risk.
Xu Jianfeng, general adviser of Gansu Zhongsheng Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd., said that enterprises have driven more and more poor households to read "sheep" by providing loan guarantees, sheep supply, order farming, quotation acquisition, unified processing and sales services for poor households.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have achieved stable income through forage breeding, good seed breeding, large-scale breeding, slaughtering and segmentation, and market sales through "joining" the forage breeding, breeding, large-scale breeding, slaughtering and segmentation, and market sales.
Qingyang City is located in the northern agricultural and animal husbandry staggered belt, and the forage resources are rich.
At present, there are 913 large-scale farms and cooperatives in the city, with more than 5 million sheep breeding, and two processing production lines of 1.3 million sheep slaughtered, and the flock is becoming the "leader" of poverty alleviation in the local industry.
French finance minister says more than 10 billion euros cut next year, calls on Germany to follow
PARIS, Sept 26 (Reuters) - France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday, while Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revive a sluggish economy.
Speaking on France’s 2020 budget, Le Maire said the ECB’s latest monetary easing initiative has created an opportunity to increase investment for those governments of member countries with the ability to afford it.
The European Central Bank cut interest rates to a record low on September 12 and plans to restart bond purchases to drive down borrowing costs, hoping to stimulate economic recovery and push up inflation.
“Low interest rates will not allow Europe to boom again, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough,” Le Maire told reporters.
"Germany needs to invest, it needs it now, the sooner the better. Don't wait until the situation gets worse before it takes action," he added.
He has made repeated appeals to Germany.
France has already implemented tax cuts of more than 10 billion euros this year, which has brought a big boost to France's economic growth.
The global economy has lost momentum, and the German economy, which relies on exports, has borne the brunt.
Le Maire pointed out that the tax burden on French families will be reduced by 9.3 billion euros next year, including a 5 billion euro income tax relief.
In addition, with the gradual implementation of the corporate tax rate will be reduced from 33.3% to 25% over a five-year period, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly 1 billion euros.

Study: U.S. National Healthy Eating Index Grows Slightly, but Still Challenging
According to the American Overseas Chinese Daily Network reported on September 27, recently, a new study in the United States shows that in the past 16 years, the U.S. government's healthy eating index has increased moderately, from 56 to 58.
But with a score of 100, it’s not worth celebrating.
Americans still face “significant challenges” in their diet.
Dr. Fang Fang Zhang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts and one of the authors of the study, said that Americans still consume too much food that may cause diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, which are the most common diseases of the American people.
The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on the 24th.
The study is based on findings from the U.S. government’s health survey of 44,000 adults conducted between 1999 and 2016.
The authors write that “significant dietary challenges persist despite considerable improvement.”
These challenges include allowing Americans to reduce their intake of foods that contain saturated fat, such as snacks, hot dogs, fat cows, and butter.
The study found that people's daily diet intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended upper limit of 10%.
The biggest improvement in the American diet was a reduction in sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but the intake was still too high.
Officials believe that the daily diet, added sugar intake should be less than 10%.
For the reasons for the reduction in sugar intake, the researchers believe that it is related to the reduction in people drinking sweet soda, but Zhang Fangfang stressed that sugar is often added to even not sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
U.S. adults had a small increase in the intake of fruit, nuts, oats, and other whole grains.
However, data from 2016 show that these foods still account for less than 5% of their daily diet.
Although people's intake of salt is slightly reduced, and the reduction in drinking juices leads to low-quality carbohydrate intake, Zhang Fangfang said that they still account for as much as 42% of daily calories, many of which come from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on a two-year-old survey of personal health that causes adults to recall what they have eaten in the past 24 hours.
These health surveys have asked this question twice every few days since 2003.
The government's Dietary Guidelines for U.S. residents recommend a "healthy eating pattern" to reduce the likelihood of chronic disease.
The guidelines state that people should consume more nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs, and seed foods that can provide protein.
The number of Americans living with diabetes has nearly doubled to more than 7 percent during the survey period, and obesity rates have increased over many years - about 70 percent of U.S. adults are overweight or obese today.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among Americans.

Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said that strengthening the docking is part of the above-mentioned proposition, because it brings benefits to the peoples and economies concerned.
The above-mentioned relations have helped to bring stability and prosperity to all parties concerned.
He also believes that the EU wants to convey the message about increasing participation and consolidating the mutually beneficial relationship between Europe and Asia.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is a guest of honor for the forum and will deliver an important speech at the plenary session.
The country's first joint-stock bank wealth management subsidiary was established with science and technology to enable asset management business
On the 26th, Everbright Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary Everbright Financial Management Co., Ltd. was officially established in Qingdao, which is the first joint-stock bank wealth management subsidiary established in China.
Experts said that asset management is an important area for the development of financial technology, and the establishment of financial management subsidiaries by banks is conducive to the use of scientific and technological means to enhance asset management business.
In April this year, Everbright Bank and China Merchants Bank respectively announced that they had been approved by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission to build a wealth management subsidiary.
On September 24, Everbright Bank announced that Everbright Financial Management had been officially approved to open.
Just two days later, Everbright Bank led many joint-stock banks and took the lead in establishing Everbright Financial Management in Qingdao.
Li Xiaopeng, chairman of Everbright Group, said that Everbright Group will accelerate the pace of innovation, use modern scientific and technological thinking and means, rely on big data, the Internet of Things, and cloud computing to improve the coverage, utilization rate and penetration of financial capital, and improve the customer's sense of gain, happiness and security.
By 2021, we will establish and improve the "four beams and eight pillars" of China's financial technology development, further enhance the scientific and technological application capabilities of the financial industry, realize the deep integration and coordinated development of finance and science and technology, and significantly enhance the people's satisfaction with digital, networked and intelligent financial products and services.
Zhang Xuyang, chairman of Everbright Financial Management, introduced that the asset management platform of Everbright Financial will use intelligent investment, intelligent investment research, big data and other technologies to help Everbright Financial better judge the macroeconomic situation.
In the future, new technologies such as blockchain will also be applied to grasp the direction and trend of everything from traditional assets to alternative assets to digital alternative assets.
Dong Ximiao, a special researcher of the National Finance and Development Laboratory, said that in the face of a new competition situation in the asset management industry, financial technology companies and asset management institutions will use asset management technology to jointly explore new growth paths.
Financial technology to enable the asset management industry, not only the financial technology its own transformation and development needs, but also for the asset management business development into a new vitality and vitality.
At the beginning of this year, Jingdong Digital Technology launched a new asset management technology system to improve the product development and risk control capabilities of asset management with the help of technology and digital means.
The new system starts from the four major capabilities of product design, sales transactions, asset management and risk assessment, and enhances the overall intelligent operation level of the asset management industry.
Experts believe that asset management technology in improving customer service capabilities, innovation and rich products at the same time, but also to enhance the ability to prevent risks, improve the efficiency of asset management management.
Zhang Xuyang said that in the past, it was easy to identify customers' risk appetite through questionnaires, but now the use of artificial intelligence for user portraits helps to better locate customers and launch corresponding products according to customer's investment preferences, which helps to resolve risks.
"E-commerce, space-time data and other alternative big data can help us better portray a region, an industry's activity, prosperity."
Zhang Xuyang said that while resolving risks, big data technology will also help improve risk control capabilities.
The deepest record of China's railway tunnel shaft has been set
China New Social Security Mountain September 27th (Zhang Weiming Xuweizhou Jingbo) after more than 1200 days of day and night construction, in the construction of Da (Li) Rui (Li) railway Gaoligongshan Tunnel No. 1 shaft completed excavation on the 27th, the well depth reached 762.59 meters below the ground, breaking the Chinese railway tunnel shaft record, and this record is created in a large amount of water.
The 34.5-kilometer-long Da Rui Railway Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel is located in Yunnan, and the tunnel crosses the Gaoligong Mountain Mountains on the west bank of the Fur River, making it the longest tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel passes through 19 fracture zones with a maximum depth of 1,155 meters, as it covers almost all the bad geology and major risks that may be encountered in tunnel construction, and the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel is known as the "geological museum" of tunnel construction.
The shaft is the most important auxiliary pit lane of the Gaoligongshan Tunnel, and it is an important task to increase the operation surface to achieve "long tunnel short fight" and the ventilation of railway operation in the later period.
The successful excavation of the No. 1 shaft to the bottom of the well marks the official entry of the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel into the horizontal tunnel construction, and after the excavation and equipment replacement of the well bottom yard, the underground can add 4 operating surfaces to speed up the excavation speed of the tunnel.
"The shaft is all in the granite formation, because the granite slattice cracks are more, can not stop the water, from top to bottom non-stop, basically how deep the well has how much deep water pressure is how big."
Shi Jingzhao, chief engineer of the Da Rui Railway Project Department of the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, told reporters that in the construction of the shaft, there have been many dangerous situations such as sudden mud and water, collapse, etc. The construction party invited experts to put the pulse on the spot and discuss the treatment plan more than 20 times.
"When the maximum water in the shaft is up to 300 cubic meters per hour, the bottom of the well with a depth of more than 700 meters, the water pressure is equivalent to 700 meters deep at the bottom of the sea."
"If you don't drain in time, you'll flood the well 10 meters in an hour, we're going to spend almost 85% of our time on water and 15% of our time digging."
In order to overcome the geological problems such as longitudinal development, sudden mud surge water, and water-rich granite, tunnel construction adopts systematic water treatment measures combined with "exploration, injection and excavation" to reduce construction risks.
After many improvements, the construction of the No. 1 shaft has formed a mechanized assembly line such as excavation system, lifting system, suspension system, and winch lifting system, which has realized the full process mechanization operation of eye-booling, blasting, billing, template installation, concrete pouring, and accelerated the construction progress.
Finally, after more than 1,200 days of day and night construction, the shaft successfully completed the excavation of 762.59 meters.
With a total length of 330 kilometers, the Darui Railway is an important part of the China-Myanmar international channel and an important transportation infrastructure for the implementation of the “Belt and Road” construction.
After the completion of the opening of the car, Dali to Ruili's driving time will be shortened from the current six hours of the road to 2 hours, which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in the Dianxi region and promote economic and trade cooperation and personnel-friendly exchanges between China and South Asian countries.

Stir of the spirit, said to the dog Nana: Mom took you out.
Write down a few things to do out of the house, the character characteristics of type A blood are getting stronger and stronger, and they all feel very uncomfortable.
Take a suit, buy a nutritious grain, pay, buy raw sashimi, Nana's small snacks.
This is the reason for going out.
On the phone, just for my sister love to finish thanks to Nana, otherwise even the excuse to buy small snacks is gone.
There he smiled a few times and said that the child had come to the phone and hung up.
Nana light car well-known road jump on the assistant's seat, honestly lying down, she knows that she is car smorren, afraid of anxiety, and unwilling to accompany me.
Her husband, Boo, came back early.

The circle of friends is in the invention of the moon, it turns out that today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.
Wash a string of grapes from friends, leave half for Boo, and leave the rest in a small flower bowl that they like to go out to see the moon.
And Nana sat on the ground, and I ate the grapes, and she ate the skin, and I vomited the seed of the grapes far away.
The moon is hiding in the clouds, so that the clouds are walking, and the moon suddenly arises, and the light and darkness are a little blinding.
The mind is full of various poems about the moon, but only clearly like this sentence: every three or five minutes of reunion / full of the light jade fence / a round of heaven to hold out / people look up.
Perhaps we give too much emotion to the moon, for now I come to the truth, in fact, that God's return to God, Caesar's return to Caesar is the best.
The moon is moon, the mood is your own.
After eating the grapes, this group of cold moons is cold.

Will MCA go to the By-election of the National Assembly seat of Tanjung Biai in Johor Oblast?
MCA President Datuk Seri Wei Jiaxiang: "Consideration of the Supreme Council of the Foreign Relations BN!"
Tanjung Biai's by-election is imminent, and whether the MCA of the Barisan Nasional member party is playing this traditional seat is of great concern.
However, after the meeting of the MCC, it was announced that it would be handed over to the Supreme Council of the Barisan Nasional to decide whether the MCA traditional seat would continue to be handed over to the MCA or to be replaced by other members of the party.
Wei Jiaxiang told the media after presiding over the meeting of the Central Committee of the Central Committee of MAC on Thursday afternoon that any by-election, the Barisan Nasional will be conducted according to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), that is, it will need to be held through the BN Supreme Council meeting before it can be finalized.
He said that since the Election Commission will meet only next Monday (1st) to finalize the by-election for Tanjung Bii, the meeting of the BN Supreme Council is expected to be held in early October.
"Yesterday (26th) morning, I also met with BN Chairman Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid, and we all agreed that this seat must be re-received from the Pakatan Harapan."
"We have finalized a special Barisan Nasional leaders' meeting in early October, and the leader of the Barisan Nasional three parties will determine which member party will play."
Asked whether MCA would insist on holding this traditional seat to the BN Supreme Council, Wei Jiaxiang reiterated that he, as MCA president, must act in accordance with standard operating procedures, so any decision must be reached by the BN consensus.
"In any by-election, some people are willing to go out, there are political parties, there are some parties who think they should come out, this is a common thing."
“What’s more important is what organization and political coalition we’re from?”
"This is a big test of our formation of political alliances for many years, and we believe that BN has come all the way and has some valuable values."
“In the process, someone might say something, and that’s not a surprise.”
"But once the BN Supreme Council has made a decision, we must make every effort to prepare for war, which is the most valuable."
In any case, Wei Jiaxiang said that MCA will be on three levels, namely the district meeting, the state committee and the central government, to make every effort to prepare for the upcoming Tanjong Biai national by-election.
“The district council will be led by Datuk Seri Wong, Chairman of the (Tanjong Biai) District Council; the State Board will be led by Datuk Lin Peixing, Chairman of the Joint Board of Joo; and the Central Committee will be personally deployed by the Managing Director, Datuk Mahanshun, and the General Secretary, Datuk Shengwen.”
On Saturday (21), Datuk Mohd Farri, a member of the National Unity Party, died at the Kunzhen government hospital at the age of 42 due to a heart problem.
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province, was ordered to hunt wild animals.
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province, was sentenced for hunting wild animals and ordered to compensate for the cost of ecological resource environmental damage repair of 15,420 yuan (RMB, the same below).
Due to the poverty of the defendant's family, the procuratorial organs used alternative labor to compensate for the cost of ecological restoration, and realized the organic unity of legal and social effects.
Wang Zhongliang, deputy procurator general of Baokang County Procuratorate, introduced on the 27th that through three months of alternative labor such as "commitment to patrol the mountain", the defendant Zhou has established deep feelings with wild macaque monkeys, and deeply blames himself for the previous animal hunting behavior.
On June 21 this year, a criminal incidental civil public interest lawsuit in the field of ecological resources filed by the Baokang County Procuratorate was heard in public and pronounced in court in the county court.
The defendant Zhou was sentenced to 3 years in prison, suspended for 4 years, and fined 3,000 yuan, while ordering him to compensate for the cost of ecological resource environmental damage repair of 15,420 yuan.
After investigation, Zhou began to set up a power grid at the cliffs in late January 2014, and has hunted more than 20 wild animals, including antelopes, small lanterns, and hairy crown deer.
The antelope belongs to the national second-class endangered wild protection animals, and the small lut and the hairy deer are listed in the National Terrestrial Wildlife Protection List.
During the trial, Zhou confessed to his illegal facts and behavior, and was willing to bear incidental civil liability.
However, considering the poor economic situation of Zhou's family, under the coordination of the Baokang County Procuratorate, the local village committee, forest station and Zhou reached an agreement on alternative labor compensation for ecological restoration costs: that is, Zhou Mou provided public welfare services to offset the ecological restoration costs by carrying out macaque macaques care work in the village macaque protection area, compulsory mountain patrol, and forest protection for one year.
For the prosecutor's proposal, the court expressed its approval, agreeing to Zhou's execution of the suspended sentence while actively fulfilling the obligation of "alternative labor to compensate for ecological restoration costs".
At present, Zhou has been working in the macaque reserve for 3 months, and the mountain is active and performs well.
In recent years, the Baokang County Procuratorate has organically integrated procuratorial functions and social governance behavior in practice, and scientifically used supervision methods such as procuratorial recommendations, investigation supervision, and litigation supervision to minimize the damage caused by criminal acts to the ecological environment through judicial means.
UN Presents ‘Defender of the Earth Award’ for Ant Forest
In the warm applause and grand music, Xu Di, the project leader of the "Ant Forest", and the user representative Shen Junliang went to the podium to receive the trophy of the 2019 United Nations "Defender of the Earth Award" from the host.
The 2019 "Defender of the Earth Award" award ceremony was held in New York, USA on the 26th, and the "Ant Forest" project with mobile phone mini-programs to promote hundreds of millions of people to participate in environmental protection actions won the "Incentives and Action Award" award.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced the winners at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but the people who attended the ceremony on the same day were still hard to hide their excitement.
In an interview with Xinhua, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Inge, said that the "ant forest" is an exciting innovation that allows hundreds of millions of people to take action to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans can do for the environment.
It uses technology to connect people and the environment so that each individual can participate in the protection of the earth, which will have a huge impact.
"Ant Forest" by China Ant Financial Services Group (referred to as Ant Financial Service) launched in August 2016 on the Alipay platform, users through the "ant forest" in the record their daily life of green travel, online payment of electricity and other low-carbon action to accumulate "green energy", in the mobile phone "planting trees".
For every virtual tree developed by the user, the "ant forest" and the public welfare partner will plant a real tree in the desertification area.
As of August this year, 500 million "ant forest" users have reduced their carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in desertification areas.
In the "Defender of the Earth Award" awarded on the same day, Costa Rica won the national environmental efforts and won the award, Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado praised the contribution of the "ant forest" at the scene, "can inspire so many people to participate in green action, impressive".
Jing Xiandong, chairman and chief executive officer of Ant Financial, said that the "Guardian of the Earth Award" is an affirmation of the "Ant Forest" project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for everyone to participate in a low-carbon life, and this honor belongs to all participants.
In the past three years, the "ant forest" has affected 500 million people, and the goal of "ant forest" in the next three years is to promote 1 billion people in the world to participate in low-carbon action.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how to make farmers' income more from green mountains and water.
In addition to providing employment opportunities through planting trees, it is also hoped that farmers will be able to increase their income through agricultural product development projects and e-commerce platforms.
The public welfare and environmental protection model created by "Ant Forest" based on digital technology has also successfully gone to sea and has been borrowed by other countries.
In June this year, the Philippines' largest "e-wallet" GCash launched the Philippine version of "Ant Forest" to encourage Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon life.
According to reports, GCash will work with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, environmental welfare organizations, etc., and plan to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the project.
The Champions of the Earth Award is the highest award in the field of environmental protection of the United Nations, awarded annually.

Economic and trade frictions affect the "report card" of the US economy.
The U.S. economic "report card" in the second quarter of this year showed that the growth rate of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) slowed significantly from the previous quarter due to a sharp decline in private-sector investment and exports.
Analysts pointed out that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they brought about were the main reasons for the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data released by the US Department of Commerce on the 26th showed that the US GDP grew by 2% year-on-year in the second quarter, which was the same as the previously released revised data, but significantly lower than the 3.1% in the first quarter.
The data shows that consumption growth has become a major factor supporting the economic growth of the United States in the second quarter.
Personal consumption expenditure, which accounts for about 70% of the total U.S. economy, increased by 4.6% quarter-on-quarter, driving economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumption expenditure and investment drove economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment in the second quarter fell 6.3% from the previous quarter, dragging down the quarter's economic growth by 1.16 percentage points; exports fell 5.7% from the previous quarter, and net exports dragged down the quarter's economic growth by 0.68 percentage points.
Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ainside Macroeconomics Consulting in the United States, said that private sector investment not only failed to maintain the momentum of last year's growth, but also fell sharply, because economic and trade frictions and rising uncertainty hit business confidence.
Knapp believes that under the influence of policy uncertainty, US corporate capital expenditure is expected to remain in a downward trend next year.
Analysts believe that although consumption growth has formed a strong support for the US economy in the second quarter, there are increasing signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they bring have affected consumer confidence and adversely affect the US consumption prospects.
Richard Curtin, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan and the head of the survey, said that in the latest survey, 38% of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the US economy, which is the highest in a year and a half.
For the future trend of the US economy, analysts generally believe that the US economy will continue to slow down.
However, some experts said that if the economic and trade frictions were eased, the performance of the US industrial sector and financial markets would improve.
Kathleen Birch, a global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, expects that in the future, the US economy will continue the gradual downward trend since this year, and the growth rate will fall to a lower level than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, predicts that the U.S. economy will grow at a rate of 2.3% this year and 1.6% next year, assuming that economic and trade frictions will not continue to escalate.
Ellen Hazen, investment manager of Patnam Investment Company, pointed out that the biggest concern of enterprises at present is the economic and trade disputes and the uncertainties they bring, if the economic and trade disputes can be resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced, and the performance of the industrial sector will be much better than now.
Miller-Thaback Asset Management stock strategist Matt Meley said that economic and trade frictions are still the "primary problem", but also the main reason for the sharp fluctuations in the US capital market this year, whether economic and trade frictions can be properly resolved, will be the key to affecting the direction of the US capital market for the rest of this year.
Parents of children 0 to 3 years old can take 10 days off per year in Ningxia
Protecting the legitimate rights and interests of women is a manifestation of respecting and protecting human rights, and it is also an important symbol of the progress of social civilization.
On September 27, at the 15th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the "Regulations on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region" was passed with a high ticket.
This is the first provincial-level local regulations formulated and promulgated by Ningxia Province to comprehensively and systematically safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of women, which will be formally implemented from November 1, 2019.
It is understood that the "Regulations" adopted this time were revised on the basis of the "Ningxia Implementation of the "People's Rights and Interests Protection Law of the People's Republic of China" in 2007, divided into 9 chapters and 65 articles, including general principles, political rights, cultural and educational rights and interests, labor and social security rights and interests, property rights and interests, personal rights, marriage and family rights, legal responsibilities, and by-laws.
In the Regulations, Ningxia encouraged the exploration of the implementation of joint parental leave for husband and wife, which is still the first in the country.
In April this year, the "Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Development of Care Services for Infants and Young Children Under 3 Years of Age" promulgated by the General Office of the State Council has a relevant description of the common parenting of husband and wife.
In the process of revising the Regulations, Ningxia innovatively proposed to "encourage employers to give each of them 10 days of joint parental leave each year between the children of children and couples who have children in accordance with the provisions of the law and regulations."
At the same time, the Ordinance highlights the protection against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative achievements in the current human rights of the Civil Code of China, and refines the elements of sexual harassment, the subject and mechanism of anti-sexual harassment.
Article 44 of the Ordinance prohibits frequent sexual assault of girls, and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and prevention work, which has become a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
In response to women's right to information and treatment of common property in marriage and family, Article 35 of the Regulations clearly stipulates that women's right to know and the obligations of property registration agencies and related subjects on common property clearly stipulate that women's rights to protect their rights provide solid institutional support for women's rights.
In addition, in response to the hot social issue of gender discrimination in employment, Article 26 of the Regulations not only prohibits direct discrimination, but also orders the prohibition of indirect discrimination, and absorbs the latest practical experience of joint interviews, strengthens the punishment for gender discrimination violations, and more effectively protects the legitimate rights and interests of women.

The Regulations summarize and enhance this, and a number of laws encourage the mobilization of social forces, the accumulation of social resources to jointly safeguard women's rights and interests, and require people's governments at or above the county level to provide stable and institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services.
Inner Mongolia Xing UNITA Yuan Longping academician workstation resistant to salt and alkali rice per mu rice production rice broke thousands of pounds
The reporter learned from the administrative office of Xing UNITA in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on the 27th that the "Announcement of Salt-Resistant Rice On-site Measurement and Acceptance of Salt-based Rice Workstation" held by the Union recently uploaded good news, and the average yield of salt-tolerant rice per mu of rice exceeded 1,000 pounds.
The six experts of Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yangzhou University and Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs conducted a sampling and harvesting of "Xingyan series" rice on the spot.
After expert evaluation, in the pH of 8.8 to 9.6, the salinity content is in the land of 5‰ to 6‰, and the average yield of salt-tolerant rice per mu reaches 508.8 kg.
Wang Shigang, executive station manager of academician Yuan Longping, said: "Our next step is to innovate on the basis of this year's experiment, but also to reform, the salt-tolerant rice varieties are cultivated and optimized again, so that the quality is better and the yield is higher."
Lai Yongcai, leader of the expert group on the measurement and production of production, and a researcher, said: "Under the premise of unchanged production factors, I believe that we will continue to strengthen scientific and technological research, and salt-tolerant rice will continue to produce miracles on the saline and alkali land."
Xing UNITA belongs to the special hardship area of the southern foothills of Daxing'an Lingnan.
In October 2018, academician Yuan Longping's working station was unveiled in Hing UNITA.
Academician Yuan Longping led the expert team to accelerate the introduction and promotion of the newly cultivated "salin-alkali hybrid rice" varieties and advanced technologies, build a 960-acre salt-tolerant rice base in the right-wing Chinese flag of Korqin, adopt the side test demonstration, promote the technical route of the promotion, and promote the local poor to increase production and increase income, get rid of poverty and get rich.
The on-site measurement of salt-tolerant rice not only injects hope into the promotion of low-yield fields in salt and alkali in Xing UNITA into medium and high-yield fields, but also provides a scientific basis for the cultivation of saline-alkali rice under the same conditions in China.
After marathon debate and weeks of protests, New Zealand passed the abortion legalization bill on September 26 local time.
The bill has sparked political debate in the past eight weeks, and there have been serious divisions within the Liberal Party since independent MP Greenwich announced the introduction of the bill.
After nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Australian Senate passed the abortion legalization bill by a vote of 26 to 14 on the evening of the 25th, making it the third longest bill in the NSW Senate to consider.
On the morning of the 26th, after the final vote in the NSW House of Representatives, abortion was legalized in NSW.
The bill allows women to terminate a pregnancy at 22 weeks of pregnancy, and if two doctors agree, they also allow women to have abortions later in pregnancy.
The Senate passed an amendment late on the 25th, and doctors can seek advice from the multidisciplinary team of the hospital advisory committee before performing abortions for women after 22 weeks of pregnancy.
In addition, the amendments passed by the Senate also include that doctors must provide appropriate care for infants who survive after termination of pregnancy.
Previously, NSW Premier Berrigiklian had faced public criticism from conservatives over the bill, and Beregiclin had repeatedly stepped in to secure more time for debate about the bill, but she did not attend the final vote.
"I need to take the time to manage the whole NSW," Berrigiklian defended his absentee vote, saying, "I need to take the time to run the whole NSW."
It is reported that Australian Liberal MP Davis was the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, which threatened to withdraw from the New Government, and said that the bill triggered a "government crisis".
But then Davis made concessions.
"The amendment to the 26th morning's bill to be submitted to the House of Representatives to legalize abortion actually provides more guarantees for women and doctors," Davis said.
Meanwhile, New South Australian National Party leader Bari Laro said he was proud to be part of a government that legalized abortion.
“What we accomplished last night is historic for the new state, which legalizes abortion, which is no longer a crime and does not treat women who have abortions as criminals.”

Liu Kun, Minister of Finance: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred 86.01 billion yuan of state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund.
Finance Minister Liu Kun said on the 27th that as of now, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, with a total transfer of state-owned capital of about 861 billion yuan.
Liu Kun made the above statement at the national transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the work task deployment of the Social Security Fund jointly held by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the SASAC on the same day.
"The transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund is an important measure to reform and improve the basic pension insurance system, is the development of state-owned enterprises to share the results of the national people and the basic pension insurance system in the generational fairness of the full embodiment, is a based on the current, take into account the long-term policy measures."
In 2017, the State Council issued the "Implementation Plan for the Transfer of Some State-owned Capital to Enrich the Social Security Fund", requiring the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to carry out pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, the preliminary work of the transfer has achieved positive results.
At the central level, three batches of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been transferred, and the total capital of the transfer is about 860.1 billion yuan.
Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions by the Ministry of Finance to perform the duties of investors has been basically completed.
The transfer of central enterprises has a certain scale.
At the local level, the pre-relocation work of enterprises has been carried out one after another.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces was basically completed, transferring 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan of state-owned capital respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also successively carried out preliminary preparatory work for the transfer, laying the foundation for the next step of the implementation of the transfer.
According to the joint issuance of the notice by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, and the Securities Regulatory Commission, the central and local governments transferred some state-owned capital to enrich the Social Security Fund in 2019 and was basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on the same day made a specific deployment for the comprehensive implementation of the transfer work.
The meeting stressed the need to complete the transfer work pragmatically and efficiently.
"According to the schedule, the transfer work should be basically completed by the end of 2020.
The rotation work time is tight, the task is heavy.
Liu Kun said that all regions and departments should carefully organize and carefully arrange to ensure that the transfer work is completed as required; solidly promote the work, accurately grasp the content of the transfer policy; strengthen communication and coordination, and solve difficult problems in a timely manner.
State-owned capital transfer to enrich the social security fund - from the starting point of "enriching the social security fund money bag", the destination is to provide strong support for pension security.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple equity "physical displacement", but opened the "mathematical addition".
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation and the Securities Regulatory Commission jointly issued the "Notice on Comprehensively Pushing and Transferring Some State-owned Capital to Fill the Work of the Social Security Fund", clarifying the timetable for the transfer of state-owned capital to the Social Security Fund, that is, the central and local transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the work of the Social Security Fund in 2019.
After the publication of the document, the Ministry of Finance and other departments have also implemented it quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred all 10% of the shares held by the Industrial and Commercial Bank and the Agricultural Bank to the Social Security Fund, and the total value of the two equity transfers exceeded 115 billion yuan.
According to the regulations, the social security foundation and other undertaking entities, as financial investors, enjoy the right to income, disposal and the right to know the transfer of state-owned equity.
The ICBC and the Agricultural Bank said in the announcement that this change in equity will not lead to changes in the controlling shareholders and actual controllers of the Bank.
In this regard, the author believes that the transfer of similar state-owned enterprises is not a simple change in equity ownership, but can stimulate a series of effects of "addition operations".
The first step of some state-owned transfer of social security "addition results" can naturally reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises by the whole people and the development results shared by the whole people.
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in China's economy, and their overall profitability is strong and relatively stable.
Among them, the leading enterprises continue to achieve better and stronger.
On July 10, the executive meeting of the State Council decided to comprehensively promote the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the work of the Social Security Fund this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately said that it will work with relevant departments, according to the deployment of the executive meeting of the State Council, to comprehensively promote the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, fully reflecting the intergenerational fairness of the basic pension insurance system and the sharing of the development results of state-owned enterprises.
The second step of the transfer, "addition results", is to enhance the sustainability of China's social security fund, to further consolidate the foundation of the pension social security system.
With the aging of the population, China's social security funds are under pressure, and most of the state-owned capital, which is the main subject of the transfer, has the ability to continue to make profits and dividends, which can not only effectively supplement the social security fund, but also provide the source of living water for the social security fund.
It is estimated that each transfer of 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital can support the proportion of basic pension insurance in enterprises by 1 percentage point.
The third step of the transfer, "adding results", is to add stabilizers to the capital market.
The transfer of the main body to obtain income is "dividend-based, operating as a supplement".
The social security fund, as a financial investor of state-owned capital, does obtain equity dividend income.
However, as a value investor in the capital market, the social security fund has a strong capital operation ability.
For listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of the Social Security Fund in shareholding will further optimize the governance structure of listed corporate legal persons, which is conducive to improving the level of enterprise operation and has a positive impact on listed companies and the capital market.
At the same time, the social security fund as an investment vane, the increase in the weight of shareholding is conducive to further enhancing its influence in the market, and play a "stabilizer" role in the market.
In addition, it is also conducive to giving full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors, and guiding investors to invest rationally and value.

Iran Confirmed to Develop Advanced Centrifuges to Suspend Implementation of Iran Nuclear Deal
According to the Central News Agency, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on the 26th that Iran's use of advanced centrifuges to make enriched uranium has once again violated the Iranian nuclear agreement.
According to reports, Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the Iranian nuclear agreement in response to US President Trump's withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement in May 2018, the restoration and strengthening of sanctions against Iran.
Iran suspended two other commitments in July to keep its stockpile of enriched uranium below 300 kilograms and enrich uranium to no more than 3.67% purity.
Under the nuclear deal, Iran could only set up about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to accumulate uranium enrichment, and only allowed Iran to use a small number of more advanced models for research, but did not produce enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for the production of nuclear bombs.
According to the report, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported: "On September 25, the agency has confirmed that Iran's advanced centrifuges with models 2 and 3 ... are accumulating or are ready to accumulate enriched uranium."
The U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented the report to Member States on the 26th, and a diplomatic official responded: "They are busy at [Natanz enriched uranium] facilities."

China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
White Paper: China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The white paper pointed out that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The white paper said that with the rapid increase of China's comprehensive national strength and international influence, some people in the world are worried that China will take the road of "national strength must dominate", and some people put forward the so-called "China threat theory".
This is both cognitive misreading, deep-rooted prejudices, and psychological imbalances brought about by the development of strength, as well as deliberate distortions to safeguard their own vested interests.
To realize the prosperity and strength of the country, the revitalization of the nation, and the happiness of the people are both the dreams of the Chinese people and the common dreams of the people of all countries.
"China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge."
The white paper pointed out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, China's scientific and technological innovation has injected new momentum into world economic growth, and the role of China's economic stabilizer and power source in the future has become more prominent.
At present, the world's economic growth momentum is insufficient, and a stable Chinese economy is becoming more and more important to the world.
China's economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development, new-type industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization are accelerating, the economic structure is deeply adjusted, industrial optimization continues to upgrade, and new economic growth points continue to emerge.
“The McKinsey Global Institute study believes that by 2040, the integration of China and the rest of the world economy is expected to create economic value of 22 trillion to 37 trillion US dollars, equivalent to 15%-26% of the global economy, and the cooperation between other economies in the world and China will create great economic value.”
The white paper emphasizes that China's economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and are deeply integrated.
China, which has more stable economic operation, higher quality of growth and promising growth prospects, is a long-term positive for the development of the world economy.
It is neither feasible nor harmful to see China’s economic development as a “threat” and a “challenge” that seeks to squeeze China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain and value chain to “decouple” China from the world economy.
The white paper pointed out that all-round opening-up creates more opportunities for all countries to share the "China dividend".
China unswervingly pursues a mutually beneficial and win-win opening-up strategy, achieves greater strength and a higher level of opening up, China has the world's most potential consumer market, China is the most attractive investment destination, and a larger scale "going out" benefits more countries.
"Openness should be two-way, mutually beneficial, not one-way, one-sided and beneficial.
Mutually beneficial two-way can be long-term and lasting.”
The white paper said that China is committed to continuously expanding imports, easing market access, improving the business environment, and strengthening intellectual property protection, and other countries should also expand opening up and take corresponding measures to improve their business environment.
Only when all parties meet each other can we create an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment, and jointly make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger, forming a community of mutually beneficial and win-win interests.
The white paper pointed out that China provides more public goods for the international community.
This includes promoting high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, building a multilateral dialogue and cooperation platform, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively carrying out foreign aid.
"China's development benefits from the international community, and has always given back to the international family, providing more and better public goods for the international community."

Demonstrations bombed the ouster of the Egyptian mountain rain, the authorities showed a strong crackdown
The Twitter hashtag and social media are advocating that the Egyptian masses take to the streets today to peacefully demand the resignation of President Sisi.
But the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress it.
Since the then military chief of the military, Sisi, seized power in a military coup in 2013, the expression of dissent has almost disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest has been more extremely dangerous.
The Guardian reported that Cairo’s NGO, the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, said more than 1,900 people had been arrested since a rare protest over the weekend called for Sisi’s ouster.
Accusations of corruption surrounding Sisi and his family’s profligate pursuit of vanity have led thousands of people to take to the streets since the 20th.
Egypt's Interior Ministry said yesterday that any attempt to destabilize the country will be decisively attacked and will not be soft.
Cairo’s city centre has been heavily guarded, with riot police, security agency vehicles and plainclothes police officers visible on the streets around Tahrir Square, Egypt’s revolutionary tipping point in 2011.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of important scholars and social sages on the 25th, including Nafa, a professor of political science and a well-known columnist at Cairo University.
He tweeted on the 24th: "I have no doubt that continuing to allow Sisi's absolute rule will be a disaster."
“It is in Egypt’s interest to step down immediately.”
Before Nafa's arrest, Hosni, who had served as a spokesman for An Nan, the former head of the army's military staff, was detained.
Anan was arrested last year after trying to race against Sisi for the presidency.
The president of the Constitutional Party, Davud, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that at a time when the economic hardships of the poor and middle class are increasing, the practice of sweeping away dissent reflects the government’s instability and fragility.
“The crackdown underscores the regime’s disregard for the Egyptian people and how much it fears itself,” said Ayman Nour, the opposition leader who ran for president.
“Because the economy has been brought to a mash by him, and because of the widespread political repression, Sisi is trying to send a clear message to key generals and politicians who may be replacing him.”
Knoll pointed out that under the premise of the continuous deterioration of the socio-economic situation, the government's high-pressure approach will only increase the anger of the people.
Now that the fear barrier has been broken, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor currently in exile in Spain who was a former construction contractor for the Egyptian military, began uploading a series of videos earlier this month, self-proiting to benefit from government corruption, detonating a wave of small-scale demonstrations in different cities over the weekend.
Ali said his company, the Amrack General Contracting, did not have to go through a statutory bidding process to get lucrative contracts, underscoring the corruption of the military and Sisi's relatives, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply remorseful for his participation.
Ali claims that he helped Sisigai’s magnificent palaces and luxury hotels in stark contrast to the current lives of Egyptians in abject poverty, and that the other side has not yet paid.
On Twitter, hashtags such as "Stand Up You're Not Alone", "Sisi You're finished", "Sisi Roll", "Friday Next Friday" and other hashtags have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and tweets, calling for people to take to the streets in a peaceful way to demand Sisi's ouster.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Amarwick has nearly 7 million followers on Twitter.
He tweeted yesterday in Arabic: "Sisi is doomed... He's done, and the people who support him are going to make a big mistake now."

Is the exercise tired and tired?
According to the Russian satellite network, a study of athletes shows that after high-intensity exercise, the brain will also show signs of fatigue.
The study, led by Mathias Pessigrion, an expert at the Pittier-Salpetril hospital in France, shows that there is no obvious link between mental and physical labor: both require cognitive control of activity.
“You need to control the autonomous process that forces yourself to stop when your muscles and joints are in pain,” Pesigrion explains.
The study was initiated by the French National Institute of Sport (INSEP).
The school’s experts are responsible for guiding athletes in preparing for the Olympics.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from overtraining syndrome, that is, there is an irrepressible feeling of fatigue after high-load exercise, the body can not recover, and the performance has declined.
INSEP asks the question: Will part of the cause of this condition be nerve fatigue, the kind of nerve fatigue caused by excessive mental labor?
The study was published in the journal Current Biology.

Let Chinese citizens "go out" more at ease - visit Cui Aimin, Director of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Wherever you go, your country is behind you.
On the 25th, the first public service video of consular protection of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was launched, and the words at the end of the short film aroused the resonance of the majority of netizens.
Cui Aimin, director of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency that the short film aims to further let the people feel the feelings and temperature of "diplomacy for the people", so that Chinese citizens can feel that no matter where they are in the world, Chinese diplomats will lend a hand to them, give help, strength and hope.
There is no small thing in overseas safety, one leaf and one leaf.
Cui Aimin said that in the past 70 years, the number of Chinese citizens "going out" has increased dramatically, from the "less than one million per year" before the reform and opening up to more than 100 million people a year; at the same time, the safety of Chinese citizens' overseas travel is more secure, and the work objects of consular protection work and assistance have also expanded from overseas Chinese to overseas Chinese, tourists, students, migrant workers and other groups.
According to statistics, since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, we have organized and implemented more than 10 major actions to evacuate or transfer overseas Chinese citizens, and safely evacuated more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.
About 500,000 cases of various types of requests for help were accepted and coordinated, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.
In dangerous times, the motherland can take you home; want to come to a "walking trip", now is no longer a dream.
According to Cui Aimin, as of the end of August this year, China has concluded mutual visa exemption agreements with 14 countries covering ordinary passport personnel.
In addition, more and more countries are unilaterally granting Chinese citizens access to entry such as visa-free or visa-on-arrival.
Thailand, Egypt and other 42 countries and regions unilaterally grant visas to Chinese citizens with ordinary passports, and 15 countries and regions, such as Indonesia, unilaterally allow Chinese citizens with ordinary passports to enter the country visa-free.
In addition to visa-free, visa-on-arrival and other arrangements, Chinese citizens' visa applications are becoming more and more convenient and the procedures are becoming more and more simplified.
By the end of August, China had reached agreements or arrangements with 41 countries to simplify visa procedures.
These include the United States, Canada, Israel, Argentina to each other for tourism, business personnel issued a 10-year valid multiple visa, and the United Kingdom to each other for tourism, business, family visiters issued two years of multiple visa arrangements.
The United Kingdom and Belgium jointly launched the "Visa One-Stop" service, and France, Italy and Singapore reduced the visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours respectively.
For business people who often go abroad, the APEC business travel card that has been inbound and convenient customs clearance is a good choice.
According to Cui Aimin, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining a five-year multiple visa for 16 economies around the Asia-Pacific region, which is of great significance to business personnel, especially private enterprise personnel.
At present, China's effective card holdings rank first among APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, promote more countries to take visa facilitation measures for Chinese citizens, make the results of diplomatic work more into measures to benefit the people and people, and continuously improve the "golden content" of Chinese passports.

"One hand" two UHV projects put into operation
On the 26th, the quasi-east to the south of the South ±1100 kV high-voltage direct current transmission project, Sutong 1000 kV AC UHV GIL integrated pipe gallery project put into operation.
Both projects occupy the commanding heights of the current world's transmission technology in their respective fields, and after commissioning, it will greatly improve the large-scale optimization of China's energy.
Guo Zhi, chief economist of the National Energy Administration, said that the Qiandong to Wannan Project is the world's largest power transmission capacity and the farthest transmission distance.
Its operation is of great significance to promote the development of Xinjiang's energy base and ensure the power supply in East China.
GIL, that is, gas-insulated metal closed transmission lines.
The Sutong pipe gallery project has created the record of the highest global voltage level and strongest conveying capacity of the GIL project, and realized the "AC double ring network" joint operation of the highest voltage level of the backbone power grid in East China.
According to the State Grid Corporation, the transmission distance of the Qiandong to the southern project is 3,324 kilometers.
If conventional technology is used, more than 15% of the power will be lost on the way, and the project has been researched and developed to greatly increase the economic transmission distance to more than 3,000 kilometers.
After the Qiangdong to Wannan project is put into operation, 100 million kilowatts of electricity can be transported every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which can help solve the problem of the consumption of existing new energy in Xinjiang.
According to the full load estimate, the annual power transmission of this single line will reach 60 to 85 billion kWh, which can meet more than half of Shanghai's electricity consumption throughout the year.
The Sutong GIL integrated pipe gallery project is a control project of the UHV communication ring network across the Yangtze River.
If you use the conventional overhead line across the river, you need to set up two giant towers of more than 450 meters on the Yangtze River, and build an artificial island of more than four football fields for each tower.
In this regard, the national power grid bold innovation, the development of compact UHV AC GIL transmission technology, through the tunnel from the underwater across the river, to avoid the impact on the golden channel.
The two projects have promoted a new leap in China's electrical equipment manufacturing capacity.

Taiwanese scholars suggest: "Indeterminate years", Taiwanese businesses need to keep up with the development of mainstream industries in the mainland
The "2019 Taiwan Business Innovation and Operation Model Forum" was held in Taipei for two consecutive days on the 26th and 27th.

He believes that Taiwanese businesses need to keep pace with the times and keep up with the mainstream industries developed on the mainland, paying special attention to innovative products related to science and technology, culture, tourism and health.
"In the past, Taiwan businessmen paid attention to quality, effectiveness and delivery."
Chen Mingzhang believes that the above conditions of Taiwanese businesses alone are no longer enough.
He pointed out that Taiwan-funded enterprises should have both speed and service, speed up the supply chain, and attach importance to extended services and life products and services.
In addition, "service value-added" is also a new area that Taiwanese companies can vigorously develop.

New regulations for comments: social capital needs to be qualified to obtain rural land management rights
Social capital needs to be qualified to obtain rural land management rights
The "Administrative Measures for the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights" is intended to supervise the transfer of social capital to obtain land management rights such as industrial and commercial enterprises.
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs website issued a notice on the "Rural Land Management Measures for the Transfer of Rights to Work (Revised Draft for Comment)" (hereinafter referred to as the "Draft for Comment") for public comments, increasing the supervision and risk prevention of social capital transfer rights to obtain land management rights by industrial and commercial enterprises.
The draft opinion is now open to the public for comment.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that in order to implement the newly revised "Rural Land Contracting Law", further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system, and implement the "three rights separation" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the "Measures for the transfer and management of rural land contracting rights", forming the "Draft of Opinions".
The Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned that the "Draft of Opinions" released for the first time has many important changes.
The newly revised "Rural Land Contracting Law" clarified the scope of land transfer, implemented the concept of "separation of powers", and set up "land contracting management rights" and "land management rights" respectively, and made a clear distinction between the transfer of land contracting management rights, swaps and the transfer of land management rights (rent, subcontracting, shareholding or other methods).
In the "Draft Opinions", in order to implement the concept of "separation of powers", effectively respond to the main purpose of the "Rural Land Contracting Law" revision law, and take into account the large differences between the transfer of land management rights and the exchange of land contracting rights, transfer of land contracting rights, transfer of the parties, procedures, supervision, etc. The revised draft defines the scope of the transfer, focusing on the transfer of land management rights, the means of transfer, including rent, shareholding, etc.
For the transfer and exchange of land contracting management rights, administrative measures will be introduced separately.
The "Draft of Opinions" pointed out that in the context of the "three rights separation", farmers only have the right to land management for a certain period of time.
In theory, even if there is a bankruptcy liquidation, the farmer only has the risk of losing a certain period of business rights, so it is not necessary to provide for the return of the original contractor to the contractor of the contract, and there is a conflict with the Bankruptcy Law.
In order to prevent the risk of land loss for farmers, priority stocks, first-leasing and then-share-back methods have been generated in practice.
Considering that preferred stocks have a more mature theoretical discussion in company law, it is recommended to use it as an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of losing land.
