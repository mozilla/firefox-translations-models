28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who had just moved to San Francisco was found dead this week in a stairwell at a local mall.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to harm him, and said, "Everything is finally getting better."
The San Francisco coroner's office said the body found Wednesday morning at the Nishida Mall was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was determined to be the death and is investigating.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told KGO, a San Francisco-based radio station, that Frank, who was a assembly line chef in Boston, had found an ideal job as an assembly line chef at Sons & Daughters in San Francisco six months earlier.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "extremely shocked" by Frank's death.
“We are a small team of close families, and we will miss him dearly.”
At this sad time, we extend our deep condolences and condolences to Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank first lived in a guest house, but recently "everything is finally getting better."
Louis Galicia told KGO, "Frank found an apartment and was dating a girl."
Louis Galicia said he couldn’t think of anyone who would want to kill his brother.
Frank has a good heart and a broad heart.
According to Louis Galicia, “Frank often cooks dinner for his family.”
He never wanted to argue with his family.
He is a man of everyone’s opinion.
Louis Galicia said, “Everything in the world can go wrong, but Frank is a man who shines every day.”
For those with a clue, please call the San Francisco Police Department on 415-575-4444.
Junior doctors strike: Call for new labour action
The junior doctor representative called on the coalition to approve its new labour action against new contract disputes.
The British Medical Association Junior Medical Council will ask all its members to support more labour action since early September.
The Junior Doctors Committee said ministers had not resolved their concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical scientist in July voted to boycott a contract deal with the British Medical Association.
Fifty-eight percent of the voting members opposed the contract transaction.
Ellen McCourt, chair of the Junior Doctors Committee, said in a letter to members on Twitter late Thursday that the government had “consistently remained silent” on the issues that led to a boycott of contracts.
“In view of this, the Executive Committee of the Junior Medical Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for a renewed formal consultation on all concerns,” she said.
In response to the government’s silence, the Executive Committee of the Junior Doctors Committee has today formally requested an extraordinary meeting of the Board of the British Medical Association to approve a long-term plan to escalate labour action from early September.
The dispute has led to six strikes by junior doctors this year, including the first full-scale strike in the history of the UK’s National Health Service.
Dr Johann Malawana, a junior physician leader at the British Medical Association, resigned after a vote was boycotted on the contractual terms recommended by the British Medical Association.
In a meeting of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students before voting, he told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be enforced in the UK healthcare workers.
Russia and Turkey: “Unreached Alliance”?
A gesture to end a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday as they shook hands and announced the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish president in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I had a strong feeling that this reconciliation was the most desirable thing Ankara would like.
Yes, the two sides shook hands.
However, even by the standards of Mr. Putin’s constant introverts, Putin was just a shallow smile, with little enthusiasm.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan reportedly mentioned “good friends” Putin five times.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to pre-crisis levels, or even higher.
The next day, a newspaper wrote that Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
But I think his enthusiasm hints at something to the contrary.
However, Mr. Putin’s continued indifference shows that he has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow reacted furiously.
Mr. Putin lashed out at the incident, accusing Ankara of plotting Moscow behind its back.
Attacks from so-called friends are even more unacceptable.
It is difficult, if not impossible, for both sides to re-establish real trust.
Since November, Russian public opinion has also reversed.
For months, the government-controlled media has carried out a shocking all-out offensive against Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seemed to be taking responsibility for everything.
Among them, the most serious is the accusation from senior officials: Mr Erdogan's family profited from the illegal oil trade in the so-called Islamic State-controlled Syrian region.
He has categorically denied this claim.
However, the news from St. Petersburg suggests that it is time to look ahead.
After all, the meeting was premised on Putin receiving an apology from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Russia can claim victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are clear.
First, Erdoğan came close to being ousted after last month’s failed coup, so he needs the support of all his friends.
The constant terrorist attacks have clearly hit him hard.
There are also economic motivations.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially by banning charter flights that can transport millions of Russian tourists to Turkish shores every year.
That number has fallen by almost 90%.
With the resumption of flights, Russian travel agencies and charter companies will be sure to breathe a sigh of relief.
They will be on the end of the season for Mediterranean tourism.
State television even predicted this week that the price of fruits and vegetables would fall once Turkish agricultural imports were reopened.
A report in the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti said: "The tourists go, the tomatoes are back."
For Moscow, the visit also has added political value.
Ankara is angry at the weak reaction of the Western world to the intention to take over.
Moreover, Ankara has long been unhappy with the slow progress of EU accession talks and Putin’s meddling, who is keen to take advantage of the political chill and weaken Turkey’s relations with the Western world.
By supporting the elected authorities after the failed coup d’état, the Russian leader is bound to receive an additional score from Ankara.
Note that this is a gift to Moscow, which has always had a deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the meeting in this gilded seaside palace left Russia and Turkey, two countries rejected by the Western world as allies, and one analyst described it as “out of the alliance.”
However, despite the public reconciliation, significant differences remain.
Syria is one of the key factors. Moscow has recently played a thorny role in Syria, while Russia and Turkey have supported opposing factions.
Predictably, after nearly three hours of preliminary talks, the two presidents said at the press conference that they had not yet touched on the topic.
The Turkish president has deliberately avoided the issue of differences between the two sides, while Putin stressed it.
The two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to seek common ground on Syria.
It is certainly a good thing that the two leaders will resume dialogue again amid months of open hostilities and a major disaster brought about by the shooting down of Russian warplanes by NATO member Turkey.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland
According to the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank will be reduced to a logistics unit.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve its clients outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland division that the RBS brand had been committed to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago, on the verge of collapse, he had to accept the bailout from then on and gave up that pursuit.
During that time, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds to sponsor international sporting events, including the Rugby Six Nations and the Wimbledon Tennis Championship champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right thing to do is to bring more national brands to life.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish clients, but will not return to the original.
In England and Wales, all references outside the headquarters and stock exchanges will be changed to National Westminster Bank.
The Ulster Bank brand has been used by customers in the Republic of Ireland and the Autonomous Community of Northern Ireland.
There are also other more prominent smaller private banking brands, such as Gujia Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwen was interviewed during a visit to Inverness County clients and staff.
He told the BBC Scotland: “The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and one of the employee-employed brands, because now we have become a bank with many brands.”
As the bank itself became an international brand, RBS also became a global brand.
For now, I would say that we are no longer focused on the world, we have turned our attention to our own country.
Each brand represents the difference in their industry, and our employees serve our customers through different brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that it will not continue to sponsor the six-nation tournament; at the same time, it has worked to raise the profile of different brands sponsoring at sporting events.
“Now is the time to become a multi-brand bank, because privately we’ve been exploring how to better serve our customers.”
If we had aspired to be a big bank with many brands three years ago, it would have been taunted.
We are currently focusing on customer needs, and I am sure you have noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands, and now the time is right.
De Turley wins 3,000 career with Predilection success in Newmarket
Two wins in Newmarket helped Dai Turing to a career of 3,000 before he sprayed champagne to celebrate
On Friday, professional horse jockey Frankie Detori secured his 3,000th victory in Newmarket.
He coached the Predilection of John Gosden, who trained by the horseman, to rush on the horse road and scored two victories that night, also achieving a career of 3,000 victories.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional horse jockey to achieve this milestone in the field of flat ground.
The top five are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
Dai Tuli, the three-time champion jockey who won in Ghayyar earlier, said: "It's special."
I was excited because my family was there too.
I’m happy with what I’ve achieved in Newmarket, because I started here 30 years ago.
It’s not a massive horse race, nor is it the Royal Ascot, it’s just an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I am happy and humble.
Dai Tuli brought the Predilection after the victory, which caused the whole audience to cheer.
In the field of steeplechase, two jockeys have achieved this feat, including champion jockey Richard Johnson and now retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, with more than 4,300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Pogue is a nine-time Defarer winner with a total of 4,493 wins in his career.
Dai Tuli is one of the best jockeys of our time, so it’s no surprise that he achieved this milestone, which was not much achieved before him.
He is stylish and robust, but what really sets him apart in the weighing chamber is his tactical rationality.
He is an amazing equestrian ambassador and over the years his passion and charisma have attracted a large number of fans to the sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Dai Tuli at Epsom that if he wasn’t just a weekend with a racing jockey, he would have been able to win 6,000!
It’s really important that Dai Turing is the best equestrian winner in the UK in three decades.
He is lively, which is good for English racing, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Dai Turing Celebrates This Milestone with Its Iconic Jumping Down
From jumping to jumping off the horse, De Turley has been a typical representative of the British flat field for two decades.
His career was like a roller coaster.
He won several championships, including the famous "seven-game winning streak" at the Royal Escoring in 1996, but he also suffered a crash and was banned for taking dosing.
Three years ago, when he returned to the game after the end of the six-month ban, he was very hard at one point. However, he showed an amazing personality advantage and finally returned to the top, giving a stick to those who were skeptical.
He may not be able to do it for too long – Dai Turian has said before that he hopes to compete until he is 50.
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismisses Sergey Ivanov as chief of staff
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov as chief of staff.
For many years, Mr. Ivanov has been part of a core group that is deeply trusted by Mr. Putin.
Ivanov, 63, has been appointed as his special representative for environment and transport.
A Kremlin statement said Mr. Putin had “announced the removal of Ivanov’s post as Chief of Staff to the Russian president,” but gave no reason.
Anton Vaino, who began serving as Mr. Ivanov’s deputy in 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he managed the presidential draft and government employees, as stated on the Kremlin website (in Russian).
After his appointment, he said to Mr. Putin: “Thank you for your confidence.”
I believe that the most important task of my Government is to support the Head of State in drafting laws and control instructions.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself had asked to resign and had recommended Mr. Vajno to take over.
Is that a smile convincing?
Moscow is puzzled by this.
Sergey Ivanov has long been one of Putin’s closest aides, and, like Putin, he has worked in the Soviet Security Service (KGB).
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on state television, both said the chief of staff had called for his resignation.
Despite the smiles in front of the camera, almost no one was convinced – especially at this time before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of a defeat in some kind of power struggle?
Not known yet.
But the official narrative – of a once-presidential candidate who suddenly chose to run Russia’s environmental policy – has aroused much skepticism.
The Kremlin website quoted Mr. Ivanov's conversation with Mr. Putin, saying: "Yes, in early 2012, I asked you to give me this difficult position, or even a difficult position, for a four-year term in a conversation."
"As a result, I have been the president's chief of staff for four or eight months."
Mr. Ivanov assumed this position in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, is a former member of the National Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin became director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Mr. Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
After Mr. Putin took office, he appointed Mr. Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
At one point, it was thought that Mr. Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr. Putin’s second term, because three consecutive terms were unconstitutional.
But the position ended up with Dmitry Medvedev, Putin’s other close aide.
Before he returned to office as president after three and a half years, Mr. Putin assumed the post of Russian prime minister.
Mysterious fish spotted Banff in a garden
A resident of Banff found a fish in his garden and then asked for help.
Kevin Bain believes 75 fish may have been sand eels scraped by a tornado at sea.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the strange scene on Periscope, hoping that someone would explain why these two-inch-long fish appeared.
The Queensferi Bridge is now in Fife.
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north and viaducts of the Queensferry Crossing, which means the bridge is now connected to Favre.
The four "bridge-faced fans" near the three bridgeheads of each bridge are now near completion, and the project is the first Helong bridge.
The bridge, which began in Fife, is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 metric tons.
It used 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 cable-stayed tracts.
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today to be one of the first to board the bridge.
"This is a historic moment in the construction of the Queens Ferry Bridge," he said.
We have all witnessed engineering work on such an ambitious project that more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel were used in this section of the bridge alone.
Although the size and weight of the bridge are huge, the completion of the henglong between the viaduct and the bridge deck requires fine work and very precise assembly.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck has now been installed, and the concrete bridge deck of the last stretch of the bridge deck is poured today in Rosyth, which means that all the decks are ready.
Michael Martin, project director at Queensferi Bridge Construction, said: "No matter what the bridge project, the first Helong is a major milestone."
In terms of this remarkable project, Helong showcases cutting-edge civil engineering technology.
After installing the last section of the road panel and connecting it to the expanded North Bridge Fort Road panel, the remaining gap between the north or near the land side needs to be completed.
The completion of the operation requires 700 mm south of the northern elevated bridge.
This is a huge operation, but also a very sophisticated operation.
It is said to be huge because the viaduct is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 metric tons, requiring a slope of about 3%.
It’s said to be sophisticated because the engineering team needed to make sure the bias was very small, just a few millimeters on each side.
Thankfully, everything is going well.
Simon Byers wins women's gymnastics all-around title
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is not affected by all this.
Be energetic when jumping.
The balance of wood is more than enough.
Free gymnastics is amazing.
The overall performance was great.
He has finally become an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast, who won the all-around title Thursday, fully demonstrated her world-leading talent in gymnastics at the Olympics.
She finished with a total of 62.198 over silver medallist, Final Five player Aly Raisman and bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina of Russia.
Simon Byers from the United States performed a balanced wooden performance at the women's individual all-around final of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byers helped the U.S. team achieve four consecutive championships in the Olympic women's gymnastics individual all-around, and she personally won five medals at the Olympics, further demonstrating that she is the generation, and probably probably the best gymnastics player ever.
The moment she saw her total score, Byers couldn't help but shed tears. She finally ended the long journey.
As a result, Byers ranks among “once-in-a-decade athletes” like Michael Phelps, taking their respective fields to new heights in their respective fields:
Byers has dominated the field for the last three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold. She trains hard every day to achieve greater precision. 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said, "Byers is the best gymnast I have ever seen."
There is still a final match in Brazil, but the match is not so much a contest between Byers and other gymnasts as her own battle against the huge expected pressure.
If Byers hadn’t returned to her home in Spring, Texas, without a gold medal, everyone would have been very disappointed.
Simon Byers (left) from the United States and Lesmann embraced each other as they won gold and silver medals in the women's individual all-around final of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August.
Byers won his first gold medal on Tuesday, giving a surprise welcome to Martha Karolyi, the retired national team coach.
Although Byers insists he has no plans for the future in the perennial championship, it is not entirely true.
One of the free gymnastics in Byers, including her signature churning, is accompanied by Latin music, which she often hears in her only street-district residence from the Rio Olympic venues.
This is not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a baby and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother during a field trip to the gymnasium, has grown into the backbone.
Byers hasn’t missed an all-around game since the summer of 2013 and she’s sure to win.
A slightly lead after two rotations of Mustafena was just an illusion.
The reigning world champion of the balance wood and free gymnastics projects, Biles, is waiting.
Her balance wood scored 15.433 and free gymnastics 15.933.
While waiting for the final score, Lesmann gently hugged Byers. When Byers learned that he had achieved his dream results, he left tears.
Lessman’s performance was a bit of a revenge for four years ago, when she tied for third but lost to Mustafina in the tiebreaker.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, dubbed “Grandma” by the Americans, was far ahead.
She kisses the crowd after free gymnastics and announces her return, but such a return has sometimes seemed questionable before.
Byers is only 19 years old. Since earlier this week, news of his has spread virally on Twitter. In the case of Byers, his life has been given a whole new meaning.
6-year-old Mahaj Brown survived the Philadelphia shooting.
A six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the sixth-year-old who was shot in the city this week, police said.
The child’s grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child who was shot was Mahaj Brown.
They said Brown had multiple gunshot wounds in his groin, legs, arms and abdomen, but the child was sober on the way to the hospital.
“He suffered a lot of crimes, and his little body was broken with bullets,” his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told television.
I couldn't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
His family told the television station that the child was expected to recover.
He was going to start a first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Three others who were shot were 29 and one was 32.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims is in critical condition; the other two are in stable condition.
The television station said the child and the 29-year-old victim were found in the front seat of the car.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether the gunman was among the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia it looked like multiple gunmen had exchanged fire.
A number of assault weapon casings were found at the scene, which inferred that they were using different assault weapons.
To put it this, it’s certainly a constant battle.
There are bullet casings on both sides of the street.
“So, there were a number of armed men at the scene in a state of intense fighting,” Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told television.
Many houses and vehicles were damaged in the area.
Arrests have not yet been carried out, and the police are said to be watching surveillance video.
On Tuesday, a six-year-old (girl) was shot in the arm while playing on the doorstep of the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is currently recovering and police are still pursuing the suspect.
Why We Need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie
That’s how I evaluate this year’s women’s Olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, but the United States has never been so dominant.
Second, the gymnastics team features three great gymnasts — Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez — who have inspired many girls of color.
The composition of the team was a source of pride for everyone, as it included Aly Raisman of Judaism and Madison Kocian of the Catholic Church.
The team finally looks like the U.S. team.
It also cemented the pinnacle of black and Latino women in the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabrielle were ranked first and second.
That's great.
At the last Olympics, Gabrielle Douglas became an Olympic champion "unexpectedly", which cheered the United States.
Today, the world has witnessed three world champions Simon Byers, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez. They have captured the way they perform as a regular gymnastics.
On Thursday, Simon helped the U.S. team achieve a four-game winning streak in the women's individual all-around program.
Her teammate, Ali Lesman, won the silver medal.
We reached the top of the sport, but not in the gymnastics classroom.
Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie entered the Olympic team in the same way as Ali and Madison.
They are the Final Five, as the next Olympic gymnastics team will be made up of four gymnasts, the last year of Marta Karolyi coaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, gymnasts mainly train in private gymnastics clubs, their parents have to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotels (including the costs of coaches and gymnasts and their families), and the list of costs is still increasing.
Most gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs that support the industry.
All the gymnasts' training is done in these clubs, which is a long-term expensive expense for the gymnast's family.
Byers's coach Aimee Boorman and Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have coached them since the two gymnasts began practicing gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to countless young girls who have been influenced by Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie.
Twenty years ago, I started my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we provide free, inexpensive gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) in black residential areas, and produce national and even world champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this opportunity to learn and will benefit from this amazing Olympic sport.
Gymnastics helps to cultivate physical strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as to cultivate hard-working spirit, self-discipline and determination.
These can bring lifelong benefits to a person’s health, academic and work success.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sports is significant, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for their “girl power” in winning the Olympic team gold medal, and for inspiring so many young girls of diverse backgrounds to open the road to health, strength and success.
Junior doctors plan further strike after rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers initially hoped to end the change-induced dispute by accepting a contract from British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who voted against it.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose contracts, saying the NHS was currently in a “vacuum zone” and that a slight delay would hurt staff and patients.
The new contract begins with a reference to changes in junior doctors’ overnight and weekend work practices to improve care during irregular working hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Junior Physicians Committee, said in a statement: “Junior practitioners continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly the ongoing labour crisis, and the failure to treat all physicians fairly.”
With only eight weeks left to sign the first doctors, we need to make progress and there is not much time left.
The BMA strives to resolve disputes through negotiations, but people are reluctant to participate, and sometimes the government responds in silence.
Still, just last month we got the promise of Jeremy Hunt, who said his door was always open.
“Jeremy Hunter now needs to act, cancel the enforcement, and address the concerns of junior doctors.”
If he doesn’t, the junior doctors make it clear they are ready for further labor action.
The last strike, which took place at the end of April, led to nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments postponed as nurses and consulti physicians covered doctors on the picket line.
Ministers initially hoped to end the dispute over the change by accepting the BMA’s amended contract.
The BMA wants to fight for better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, has called on junior doctors to stop any strikes.
Mr. Mortimer said, “Labour action has had little effect, but on the contrary it will put pressure on already dedicated teams and services, leading to worries, worries and confusion among patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have been in constant negotiations with the Junior Doctors Council and have worked actively with the Ministry of Health and other departments to respond positively to their concerns about the role of guardianship and whistleblowing.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics – such as deployment, flexibility of training, other training for those who have re-infused after a career break, training costs, shared awareness of the curriculum, retraining leave and gender pay differentials in the medical field – which illustrates the importance employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health have placed in place to the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
£2 a day drug could reduce heart attack threat
Officials recommend rolling out a £2-a-day drug to more patients and longer, after which thousands of heart disease patients will benefit.
Anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of heart disease recurrence in people with heart disease.
The drug, which is taken continuously for 12 months after a heart attack, can reduce the risk of stroke or another attack of heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), a regulator under the National Health Service (NHS), advises patients to take their medication for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now, NHS watchdog NICE recommends giving patients a four-year boost to their risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year, and a quarter of them continue to experience a recurrence of heart disease or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty substances that form plaques in the walls of the arteries.
If the plaque is disconnected, it will cause blood clots, which in turn hinder the flow of blood into the heart and lead to a heart attack.
If the thrombosis moves, it enters the bloodstream, hindering the flow of blood into the brain and causing a stroke.
Patients who have already experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of another heart attack.
Tikagre, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, can reduce the risk of disease by reducing the formation of blood clots.
The NICE draft guidance, released today, recommends that patients take 90 mg of ticagre for 12 months, and 60 mg of tikagrele and twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Centre for Health Technology Assessment, said: “Despite effective secondary preventive treatment, up to a quarter of patients with a history of heart attack will have recurrence or stroke, often with serious consequences.”
Fear of relapse can have a big negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence suggests that taking tikagratoli with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of heart attack recurrence and stroke in those who have experienced a heart attack.
We are pleased that the temporary recommendation for Tikagre will provide more treatment options for thousands of people who have benefited.
Because of limited information about the efficacy and safety of ticagre after three years, especially the risk of bleeding, the draft guidance does not recommend that treatment should continue beyond this period.
Computer culture makes ‘election fraud’ prevail in Muslim areas
Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was sacked last year for corruption, prompting the publication of a government report.
The culture of “political correctness” has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being turned a blind eye, as this deadly government report reveals today.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former cabinet minister, accused the police, the electoral watchdog and the city hall of turning a blind eye to evidence of abuse of elections because of “oversensitivity to ethnic and religious issues”.
The former minister of community affairs and current anti-corruption chief said that the use of religious positions to intimidate voters has a bad impact, and the police should be allowed to set up a cordon outside the polling stations to protect the fearsome voters.
He advised voters to bring identity documents when they cast their ballots to confirm their identity.
Currently, voters only need to give their names and addresses.
The report even recommends that voters’ fingers be coated with ink that cannot be erased to prevent a second vote.
Sir Eric said there should be greater protection for whistleblowers.
He called for increased media access to conference documents and decisions taken by non-official committees or working groups.
“It’s not just about preventing electoral fraud, but protecting local governments from a widespread culture of corruption and the financial fraud associated with them,” he said.
The report comes after the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London, Downing Street requested it.
Last year, a special election court ruled that a series of corruption and violations committed by the current mayor of Rahman should be dismissed.
The court found that Rahman had “very ridiculously abused” the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and was silent on the charges of racial discrimination and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have “declared during the election campaign that it is a religious duty to loyal Muslims”.
As many as 300 ballots are in doubt, and voters may have voted against others.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of electoral fraud across the country.
He particularly warned of election fraud by the mail, and senior members of the Muslim community are said to be putting pressure on voters to cast ballots for their designated candidates.
Sir Eric (in the photo) has given a number of suggestions for the clean-up of the voting mechanism, including bringing a good identity document to confirm his identity.
“Evidence shows that senior members, particularly in Pakistan and Bangladeshi communities, are putting pressure on vulnerable groups in minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote as they please,” he said in the report.
“Because of their over-sensitivity to ethnic divisions and religious ‘political correctness,’ they fear that State institutions will turn a blind eye to such behaviour.”
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the electoral mechanism, including a ban on political activists handling mail-in voting documents to stop the “voting harvest”.
The report also requires strict checks on registration information to prevent voter rolls from being used for immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa May is also considering the report.
The recommendations include requiring voters to show their identity documents before voting.
After the vote, the voter's finger can not be wiped with ink to prevent someone from voting for a second time.
Systematically verify the ethnic affiliation of voters to ensure eligibility to vote.
The validity of the automatic mail-in ballot request is set at three years.
Political activists and activists are prohibited from handling completed mail-in ballot and mail-in voting envelopes.
The police are authorized to set up cordon around polling stations.
The changes to the provisions of the law make it easier to charge relevant persons with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
It is illegal to take pictures at a polling station.
Only English is allowed at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff strictly implement the “voters go to the polling room alone” requirement.
Sir Eric decried the Metropolitan Police for saying it was "surprising" that they had not brought any criminal charges following the Tower Hamlets incident.
“Rahman and his election officers had a lot of corruption and violations and were therefore disqualified by the electoral court,” he said.
By the standards of criminal proof, he is unquestionably guilty in many ways.
He also criticized the "check box check" of the city hall election registration department.
Sir Eric said: “Last year the court sounded the alarm about Tower Hamlets.”
Our country has a glorious tradition of “the mother of parliament”, but the private and covert electoral fraud of some institutions and the subsequent denials are really worrying and threaten this good reputation.
Cyclists who look like Princess Kate at the Rio Olympics and other celebrities are sought after.
This week, Pauline Ferrand Prevot, a French cyclist who resembles Princess Kate at the 2016 Rio Olympics, was highly sought after by the audience.
But the 24-year-old Olympian isn’t the only gold medal contender for a celebrity at the Summer Olympics, at least not on social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the celebrity faces that appeared on the screen at the time, FEMAIL put together a list of Olympians who hit the face of Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolves: American Archer Brady Ellison (left) is likened to Leonardo DiCaprio from a young age
In addition to the rider on the bike track hit Kate, many netizens quickly found that a certain archer was Leonardo DiCaprio's twin brother.
Since his photo of the starred Wolf of Wall Street came to light on Twitter, American archer Brady Ellison has caused a huge stir on social media.
In fact, the archer noticed the social media hype and admitted that when he was young, some people said he looked like a little plum.
“I don’t think I look alike other than beard,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome playboy, so I think that's a compliment to me."
One of the most popular contrasts at the 2012 London Olympics will undoubtedly find more similarities this year: British long jumper Greg Rutherford looks like famous actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with big, talking eyes, is said to look like the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
For years, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Change: The user believes that Nathan Adrian is the "sports version" of the "Inception" actor
Another pair of old ones compared to tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, whose brows and lips look alike.
The silver-picked Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova and actress Annalynne McCord had the same bronze skin and blonde hair, while the American team’s Ni Jiajun was likened by fans to a “sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.”
Women's Men: Football star Hope Solo (left) and "Dexter" actor Jennifer Carpenter (right) with similar faces and eyes
Not the only one: one Twitter user was happy to find that others saw the similarities, too.
Communication theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for this pair of looks.
One Twitter user recently happily declared online that “other netizens also think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look alike.”
Indeed, the American football star and the bloodthirsty forensics star have extremely similar faces and eyes.
Other popular contrasts include Kerri Walsh Jennings, whose smile is almost identical to actress Laura Linney’s, and the gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose beautiful and brilliant smile is similar to that of the “Bring It On Star” star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologises for comments made by Chinese swimmers 'as slow as pigs'
On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald irritated the audience watching the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Olympic live broadcast of the comments on the 14-year-old Ai Yan's fourth-place finish in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
A CBC communicator said the 14-year-old Chinese swimming boy "swim faster than the odor" in the game, and finally "slowed like a pig", and CBC was forced to apologize.
Narrator Byron McDonald made some of his own comments at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final, thinking his microphone had been switched off.
The audience heard Byron, a CBC narrator on the team of "colored glasses" commenter, said: "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
Too excited, I started to swim faster than the stinking, but later as slow as a pig.
It was a great loss to her.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanyou was the second best, taking 1:57.79 — 1.61 seconds behind Canada’s Taylor Ruck, which then narrowed the gap with China.
The entire Canadian audience was shocked by the communicator’s tone and wording, and they quickly reacted online.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “The CBC narrator says China’s 14-year-old swimmer ‘slow as a pig’???”
The idiot didn’t realize it was on the radio.
Ai Yan, a Chinese junior who participated in the final of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay, was described as: "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter quickly hit the web, and many people asked him to withdraw from the explanation.
When Twitter users heard that Byron MacDonald was slow to respond, they did not stop.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wow #Byron MacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and your words and actions make us all sound like a bunch of racists. # It's disgusting.
Shortly after, CBC radio host Scott Russel apologized for Byron's comments, saying, "We apologize for our comments on the live swimmer's performance."
“We are sorry for the inappropriate wording.”
CBC Apologizes More Than 90 Times to Twitter Users Who Respond to the Comments
Another commentator, Scott Russel, also apologized on behalf of Byron.
CBC later copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users protesting Byron’s interpretation.
The channel also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We are very sorry to say this and broadcast it live.
Last night, we moved quickly to apologize to the audience who watched our live broadcast and to those who followed us on social media.
It should be noted that Byron's commentary is aimed at the performance of the swimmer, but not personally.
That is to say, the wording is indeed inappropriate, and Byron is deeply sorry for that.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized on the live broadcast, saying that his words did not mean half a personal attack and tried to justify his remarks.
“I want to take a moment to apologise for what I said last night after the women’s relay,” he said at the CBC Olympics broadcast.
"I'm just commenting on the performance of the swimmers, not on their individual."
"Of course, I don't mean disrespect, I'm sorry."
Primark customers angry at a woman who brazenly tried on panties in the middle of the store
A woman undresses on the spot in the middle of a Primark store, and the customers in the store do not know where to look.
Worse, she also looked at how she looked after she put it on, then took off her underwear and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves and eventually tried four pairs of underwear in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The woman kept trying on panties in the Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone and then put it back on the shelves.
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two, who was also in the store at the time, said that after trying on underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed again and then walked out of the store and bought nothing."
She said, "Everyone can't believe what they're seeing."
She stood in the middle of the shop, took a pair of panties from the shelf, took off her leggings and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a hidden place to try it on - she just stood there, it was impudence."
“When she took her panties off again, everyone was stunned. Obviously, she was still not satisfied because she put them back on the shelf.”
After that, she tried three times like this, and finally found that it was not her favorite, and then dressed again and went out of the store.
“She didn’t seem to care if someone was looking at her—or she didn’t think anyone would end up buying the underwear she tried to wear.”
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent town, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone will buy underwear that someone else has worn and hasn’t cleaned.”
This happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she leaves, it is clear that the clerk will have to take off the underwear, but fortunately.”
"I hate to buy a new pair of underwear and find another woman trying to pass through and not being cleaned."
A spokesperson for Primark said: “Primark has known what happened at our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9th.”
All the products in question have been removed.
How to Protect Yourself with Maga in a Gun Attack
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com may give you a little sense of security.
We asked Rhon Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, to learn how to deal up close with the gunman.
Whether he is near you from the front or behind you, the video will teach you how to turn to victory.
Mizrachi said that if the gunman approaches you from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and “clear the line of fire.”
Then, clamp the gun with your forearm and shoulder, and then hit the attacker in the face with your elbow.
Next, with his knee in his groin, when the attacker bent down due to pain, turned the gun in his hand, hit him in the face with a barrel and a back-up gun group, keeping the weapon at him all the time.
If the gunman is approaching from the front, use a similar technique - keep your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and turn the muzzle so that the gunman can't fire.
At the same time, the weight was pressed on the gun and struck the attacker's chest, and the muzzle was reversed from his clenched hand, which was then pointed at him.
Sounds complicated?
Check out the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
But keep in mind that if you’re not a master of maquila, the safest way to get rid of the robbery is to hand over cash.
A rogue family destroys a low-rent rental house in Saltash, Cornwall, before being evicted.
A rogue family who was evicted for terrorizing neighbours damaged their low-cost rental housing before leaving, causing £50,000 in damage.
After a long list of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, were evicted from a low-rent apartment in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being forcibly removed from the residence, Housing Institute officials were surprised to find that the area had been severely damaged.
There were holes everywhere in the walls, the floor was torn, the rubbish was littered, and the walls were painted in the mess.
The family has been moving after being evicted and is said to be living in a private home.
Donna McEvoy, a home manager at the Cornish Housing Association, said she was concerned the house could not be saved.
She said, "It's a nightmare for the people who live here, and I don't think people can live that way."
There are a lot of things to weigh in now, as this house is likely to be a not-so-good element for Cornwall.
The family is infamous, and their names are equally infamous.
The couple, who have three sons, live here from time to time. Police say the family's terror acts include using baseball bats to fight in the streets, terrorize nearby residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, yelling, quarrels and swearing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant, named Skeldon, received an anti-social action resolution.
In this house, which may have been demolished, many rooms are long-term garbage.
In this once-traffic drug-dealing room, the floor was lifted.
Neighbors said they often saw them fighting in the streets and often called the police.
After giving an 11-week extension to allow them to voluntarily move out, the Cornish Housing Association forcibly evicted her and her husband from the residence this week.
The neighbors, who were finally relieved, cheered, saying that their previous life was a hell on earth.
One of the neighbors said, "They don't care about anybody."
We’ve lived next door to them for 20 years and it’s been so bad.
We have seen the police many times.
"We can't sleep this morning."
We got up early because it was so quiet – we weren’t used to it!
It was great that they finally left.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Community Executive Manager, Cornwall Housing Association, said the family had not been able to work well with the local government.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years and is often visited by police.
Garbage and old toys are tossed on the weed side of the cheap rental
He added: “Regrettably, the tenant did not bear any responsibility for her actions with her family and that eviction was a last-ditch approach considered by the Cornish Housing Association.”
This is a very difficult case, because their behavior is very extreme, and what they are doing must also make their neighbors feel very afraid.
I thank my team for their work, as well as Devon and Cornwall Police and the community members who have bravely informed us.
I hope that this move will bring some comfort to our neighbors and send a message that we will not tolerate anti-social behavior.
Mr Fitzpatrick said their three sons had lived in the house at various times, but also said they were both in their 20s.
After they were evicted, a dirty mattress was also thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms.
Housing Association workers will soon clean up piles of rubbish around the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as balances, drug paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of Class B drugs and for his intent.
She claims the money was used to buy a tombstone for her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, Tanya and her husband now live in a private home in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house are full of graffiti.
Police said they would evict tenants who defy tenant rules.
Devon and Cornwall Police’s Angela Crow said the eviction issued a clear warning to other tenants who continue to defy tenant rules.
“This warning is aimed at those who believe that their actions will not be blamed, and those who are ravaged by such behavior,” she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police will not tolerate crime and anti-social behaviour, and they will continue to work together to protect our communities.
Reid: Hillary Clinton will nominate Garland to Supreme Court if elected president
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he was confident that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was elected president, she would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked the confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated Garland in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would choose to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call on Thursday that he predicted Clinton would choose Garland with “some credibility.”
A spokeswoman for Reid later said that Reid did not speak directly to Clinton about whether he would nominate Garland, and said he was only speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team did not want to "disturb" the new candidate.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said the Republicans who blocked Garland’s nomination were “favorites” and “achivetakers” of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit to be president.
"Treats": Nude Calendar "Loved by Men and Women"
Treats magazine will team up with photographer David Bellemere on a set of 2017 calendars inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
This time, they plan to find a new generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar, rather than the famous naked people.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, said earlier this year that their magazine, which is dominated by nudity, is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because it is “proselytical for men.”
We are targeting women.
Obviously, he thinks this group of calendars is the same.
“We need to show the timeless and classic nudity that makes both women and men feel at ease, and that’s what’s inspired this time,” Shaw said at a calendar launch.
Women will be happy to participate in this film because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or go to open recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.
Video Report Shows Small Head Sleeping Sharks Are Longest-Lived Vertebrates

French court rejects petition to demolish shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a petition by the Calais government to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the “Jungle” refugee camp, where thousands of refugees are currently living.
At the court's hearing this week, the Calais government argued that the French government should have the right to demolish a total of 72 makeshift shops in the camp. People sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, provide haircuts, and sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) in makeshift restaurants or basic meals for a few euros.
The office of the governor of Calais believes that these places should be demolished because they are parallel economies that are not taxed, and there are still fire and health hazards.
Humanitarian groups have told the courts that these shops and restaurants are extremely important because free food provided by state-backed associations and other groups simply does not meet the needs of the growing refugees in the camp.
They say these makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the operators of the 72 temporary shops, but said the governor’s concerns were “completely understandable”.
Judge Jean François Molla said the shops, cafes and restaurants were doing much more than simply providing food to refugees who “live in extremely dangerous conditions”.
He said the places were a calming meeting point between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by demolition is the camp’s Jungle Book Kids cafe, which offers 200 daily food, English and French lessons and asylum advice for hundreds of unaccompanied and vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the cafe.
A letter to the Guardian wrote that closing the cafe “would be a disaster for these children, many of whom are only eight years old”.
The two charities Help Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants, on Friday forecast that the number of refugees in bush camps had topped 9,000, the highest level since the surge in summer refugees.
"This 5,000 yuan grant has solved my urgent need."
Zhou Fen, a poor girl in Miqiu Village, Changle Township, Huayuan County, received an acceptance letter from South China University.
Just when she was worried about the cost of admission, on August 9, the county party committee promptly implemented 5,000 yuan in support to her.
In the past few days, the relevant departments of the county have also implemented 2.838 million yuan of education subsidies for more than 690 poor college students.
At the same time, the family's economic situation is particularly difficult, and it also helps them to complete their studies by organizing social donations and other forms of academic support.
This year, the flower has integrated more than 18.5 million yuan in student aid funds, and the financial self-funded more than 2.5 million yuan has been put into the real-name bank card of poor students according to the prescribed time limit.
She said gratefully, "I thought my father had died, my brother and I couldn't go to college, and I didn't expect the county to solve the difficulties for us in time."
As of August 8, Huayuan has implemented more than 21 million yuan of various rescue funds for 13,140 poor students in the first half of this year.
All poor students in the county have achieved that they should help, and the supplement should be supplemented.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the New South Wales government announced on the 11th that it will spend 200 million Australian dollars (about $154 million) to repair the famous Sydney Opera House.
The New South Wales government said the repairs would not change the shell-shaped shape of the opera house.
The Sydney Opera House is one of Sydney’s landmarks, designed by Danish architect Jon Utsson and built in 1973, which welcomes around 8 million visitors a year.
Rory Jeffs, managing director of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes that the Sydney Opera House will use this transformation to make a "turnaround" and become "one of the best acoustic concert halls in the world".
Non-Beijing citizens who have lived in Beijing for more than 6 months and who meet one of the conditions for legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence and continuous study in Beijing may apply for a residence permit.
Recently, the implementation rules of the Provisional Regulations on Residence Certificates in Beijing were introduced, which means that the "temporary residence permit" will be upgraded to a "residential permit".
The head of the relevant departments said that the change from "temporary residence permit" to "residential permit" means that Beijing will change from "management" to multi-faceted services for the non-Beijing resident population.
The reporter learned from the State Administration of Taxation today that as of the end of June this year, tax authorities at all levels have announced 2,470 cases of tax illegal "blacklist".
It is understood that in July 2014, the State Administration of Taxation took a step forward in the functional departments of the central government and jointly issued the Measures for the Publication of Information on Major Tax Illegal Cases with the Measures for the Administration of Tax Credit.
However, the illegal facts, legal basis and punishment of these cases will be published, and the basic information of the parties to the violation and the responsible persons of relevant intermediaries will also be included in the "black list".
The government departments such as quality inspection, finance and customs have also taken relevant disciplinary measures against the "blacklist" parties.
"The credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and even the construction of the whole social credit system, which marks that the construction of China's social credit system is constantly developing and improving and becoming more and more mature."
"Environmental problems are manifested in air, water and soil pollution, but the roots are still in production and lifestyle."
For example, in 2015, the land development degree of Jiangsu Province was as high as 21%, ranking the highest in the country's provinces and autonomous regions.
Therefore, the problems of high pollution, large energy and multi-occupation have not yet been fundamentally responded to from the transformation of production and lifestyle.
On the one hand, from the perspective of the results of various types of ecological environment creation at all levels in Jiangsu Province, it ranks first in the country with absolute advantages; on the other hand, the resource environment carries a lot of pressure.
To solidly promote the protection and governance of the ecological environment, it is necessary to fundamentally promote the transformation of production and lifestyle, and promote the transformation of people's livelihood with the construction of ecological civilization.

Qingdao is the 12th national and the first pilot city in Shandong Province for the paid use and trading of sewage rights.
On the 11th, a number of enterprises came to the Qingdao Municipal Sequence Rights Trading Center to submit the requisition of sewage rights, and will pay a paid user fee after the requisition is accepted.
The upcoming transaction first order also indicates that the pilot work of Qingdao sewage rights trading officially kicked off, which will also be the first single of the province's sewage rights trading and the first single of the national urban-level sewage rights trading.
On the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Fine Chemical (Group) Co., Ltd., came to Qingdao sewage rights trading center to submit the sewage rights requisition.
The company is located in the factory area of Qingdao's old city at the end of last year, completely shut down, and environmental protection relocated to the new factory in Pingdu.
After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form and the environmental impact report of the construction project, the Qingdao Municipal sewage rights reserve and trading service center began to conduct a preliminary examination of the application materials.
According to the collection standards determined by Qingdao price, finance and other departments, the current estimated initial sewage rights use fee is about 641,200 yuan, and the staff will complete the approval within 7 working days.
The first order of the upcoming transaction also indicates that the pilot work of Qingdao sewage rights trading officially kicked off, and will also be the first single of the province's sewage rights trading and the first single of the national urban-level sewage rights trading.
Zhao Xiuping said that at present, the environmental protection of enterprises has invested 400 million yuan, on the surface of the huge amount, but the management concept of the enterprise, social benefits have a great impact, the enterprise innovation management has also opened up space.
On the same day, Qingdao Sifang New Cheng Zhizhuo Bus Parts Co., Ltd. also came to purchase sewage rights for the annual output of 4,200 high-speed rail and EMU interior accessories.
The project belongs to the machining enterprises, the initial sewage rights applied for is 0.514 tons of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 0.052 tons/year of ammonia nitrogen (NOX).
The paid use and trading of air pollutants for the city's power and heat production supply is a key industrial enterprise.
Existing sewage units that have obtained environmental assessment before January 1, 2016 will not levy paid royalties.
“Reimbursement for the right to discharge pollution does not mean that you have the right to discharge illegal sewage, and you cannot discharge pollutants at will.”
Han Hongyan, deputy director of Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau, introduced that if illegal sewage discharge and excessive sewage discharge still have to be punished in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises to avoid punishment by purchasing sewage rights.
In other words, through legal means to crack down on environmental violations, severely punish enterprises for excessive pollution discharge, so as to protect the environment and protect public health.
Now, for its own interests, enterprises have improved their enthusiasm for pollution control, cherished limited sewage rights, and reduced pollutant emissions.
Driven by economic benefits, reducing pollutant emissions has changed from the government's coercive behavior to the conscious market behavior of enterprises, so as to truly achieve the purpose of protecting the environment, protecting nature and protecting public health.
The right to discharge pollution, also known as the "right to discharge", is the right to discharge pollutants, which refers to the right of the emitter to discharge pollutants to the environment in accordance with the law within the amount allocated by the government.
This right is essentially the right of the polluter to possess, use and gain resources for the environmental capacity.
In the next step, under the premise that the total amount of pollutant emissions does not exceed the allowable emissions, the internal pollution sources will adjust the amount of pollution to each other through currency exchange.
Since 1968, when the American economist Dales proposed it, the United States began to apply it to the management of air and river pollution sources in the 1970s.
China began to carry out pilot projects in 2007, and 14 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) such as Zhejiang and Jiangsu have been fully implemented.
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, in order to assist the six strategic bombers to carry out air strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria, a number of Russian warplanes have been lifted off from the Hmeimim air base in Syria.
On February 22 this year, the United States and Russia reached an agreement on a ceasefire between the parties to the Syrian conflict, and the ceasefire agreement began to be implemented on the 27th of the same month.
According to the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes against terrorist organizations identified by the United Nations Security Council, such as the Islamic State Support Front.
Russia will continue to build relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of Russian soldiers will be guaranteed accordingly.
He also said that if the extremist forces are not attacked, these forces will expand to Russia.
Although Russia and the West have not reached an agreement on jointly combating extremist forces in Syria, Russia will strengthen cooperation with Syria, Iran and Iraq in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia began a military strike against extremist forces in Syria at the invitation of the Syrian government.
On March 15 this year, the main Russian military forces in Syria began to withdraw, but the Russian side promised to continue to maintain the Khmeimim air base and the Tartus naval base.
In the case of the new birth of the old house and the successful countryside, He Pei has made a good demonstration: inheriting a century-old house, and also telling the story of the inheritance of a piece of land.
Today, an average of 100,000 people gather in Bamboo Hill every year, either to bring a variety of ideas or to seek inner peace.
In fact, the relationship between the countryside and the city should be accompanied by each other, just like mothers and children, there is no strength and weakness, there is no need who to rule who to rule, should be very warm.
There is no fixed model for rural development, but it is difficult to rely on spontaneous changes in the countryside, and the most important point should be to let the right people go to the countryside.
The Shanghai Songjiang District Traffic Management Department recently used electronic police to remediate drivers to drive and play with mobile phones, and more than 30 cases were seized in a week.
With the popularity of smart phones, mobile phones are becoming more and more fun, brushing WeChat, micro-blog and even playing games, shopping Taobao have become the norm, many people seem to be inseparable from mobile phones, even when driving can not stop.
The Road Traffic Safety Act explicitly prohibits driving and defines it as “obstructing safe driving behavior.”
Unfortunately, due to the difficulties of offenders and the difficulty of obtaining evidence, this phenomenon has not been duly punished, and the law has almost become a decoration.
If the traffic control department can make up its mind to "declarate war" on the act of driving and playing mobile phones, and normalize this measure, this illegal act will certainly be curbed.
It is necessary to strictly manage the household registration file, and establish electronic and paper files one by one for the registration materials of no household registration personnel to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the archives.

The village of 150 acres of orchards, more than 10 tree species, only need 12 workers plus 1 technical engineer.
Last year, 50,000 yuan total, like my age, if you work in the factory will certainly not get this money.
Last year, the village income of Donglin Village reached 22 million yuan, of which total agricultural income accounted for nearly half.
Village Secretary Su Qifang: Per capita land planting area is increasing every year, starting at the beginning of 50 acres, and now more than 100 acres; the average efficiency of mu is increasing every year, and the income of professional farmers is also increasing every year.
The biggest highlight of the collective economic reform of rural areas in Southern China is to clarify the property rights of rural collective operating assets and explore political and economic separation.
In July 2015, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations in Anzhen Street, Xishan District, Wuxi City, "divided account management" with the village committee, and the village committee performed the management of rural public affairs, and the cooperative organization was mainly engaged in business.
The two institutions have two accounts, which do not "break the boundary" with each other to prevent the corruption of village cadres from participating in collective asset management.
Zhu Baoping, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Committee, said that Jiangsu will continue to promote the reform of the community joint-stock cooperation system in the next step, encourage the joint development of farmers, and establish a mechanism for the operation of democratic power at the village level.
Zhu Baoping: Further promote the reform, engage in community-share cooperation, quantify assets to members, fix farmers, and form a clear property rights.
Through the Internet +, the implementation of his right to know, the right to participate in decision-making and the supervision of democratic management, the three rights are implemented to farmers, and it really makes it a standardized mechanism for the operation of joint-stock cooperation.
At present, the new collective economy of rural areas in Southern China has mainly formed four development models: asset leasing, enterprise share-based, agricultural development-oriented and joint development-oriented.
It is understood that overseas exhibitions have become an important platform to promote the construction of the "Belt and Road" in Zhejiang Province.
The successful holding of these overseas exhibitions has accumulated valuable experience and good foundation for continuing to explore emerging markets along the “Belt and Road” and building a comprehensive platform for overseas exhibitions.
Pick will always be guided by improving consumer sports demand, build a sports industry ecosystem, and accelerate the strategic upgrade from a single sporting goods manufacturing enterprise to a professional sports service enterprise.
Hamill added that 34 other people were taken to hospital, including three firefighters who suffered minor injuries and had been discharged from the hospital.
As some residents remain unaccounted for, he also called on the residents of the fire-hit apartment to contact the authorities.
Mariana Turay, who has lived in the apartment for 30 years, said: "It looks like a bomb has fallen."
It was reported that the local fire brigade took 1 hour and 45 minutes to extinguish the fire, and residents of nearby buildings were allowed to return to their homes after a few hours.
American Red Cross personnel estimate that about 100 people are homeless, of whom 60 to 70 are temporarily staying in shelters in nearby neighborhood centers, most of whom are Hispanic residents.
On August 11, the first Jinzhou Wetland Tourism and Culture Festival opened on the shore of "Hequan Lake" in Jinzhou Oriental Huadi City.
Since 2014, the tourism industry has generated revenue, accounting for 10% of Jinzhou's GDP; in 2015, it reached 11.3%.

Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: "Hands-in-hand beautiful" began shooting career several "reversal"
Zhang Donghong of Dongyuan Village, Xiamen Xiang'an District, just changed the 29-inch old TV in his home to a 65-inch TV.
The daughter of the ordinary farmer is Zhang Binbin, who won the silver medal in the women's 50-meter rifle three-position final for China at the Rio Olympics on the evening of the 11th.
On the night of the 11th, just in front of this new TV, Zhang Donghong and dozens of relatives and friends witnessed the magical process of their daughter rising up and chasing all the way, from almost the preliminaries to be eliminated to almost reverse.
In the day's game, Zhang Binbin once ranked in the middle and lower reaches, it seems that it is very far from the final.
But parents and friends did not give up, constantly brushing the text live, see as other players finished the game, Zhang Binbin all the way up, and finally locked the final seat, his home suddenly burst from a cheer.
In the final, Zhang Binbin was once ranked lower, and the last few shots were more and more stable, only to win the silver medal with the 0.2 ring result of the backward champion.
Zhang Binbin, who is 27 years old this year, has almost passed this hard-won silver medal several times in his 16-year shooting career.
His mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told reporters that just when they hesitated, Zhang Binbin found several "novel guests" in the same village.
These "novel" are the same village children who were recommended to participate in the training at the same time, including Zhang Binbin's cousin.
Shortly after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once took the initiative to return to Xiang'an's school for reasons such as family difficulties.
But after his enlightenment coach Zhang Yajie repeatedly did his work, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once because he was late in entering the national team, and once returned home again because he could not see hope.
This time, not only coach Zhang Yajie, the leaders and coaches of Xiamen Shooting Archery Sports Center and Fujian Provincial Team came home, and finally persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team.
Just like yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl insisted on achieving a reversal on the road of shooting.
"Each coach chooses the team in a different way, when I saw that Binbin's hand was beautiful, and I fell in love with each other."
Zhang Donghong also recalled that in the training test, although the daughter's performance is not the best, the number of rings played is very stable, which is also an important reason for Zhang Binbin to attract the coach.
In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie was most impressed by the input of the farm girl.
He recalled that more than a year after Zhang Binbin entered the Xiamen shooting team, the team conducted a long-term gun training for direct shooting, requiring the team members to not move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well-behaved child, and has loved to draw and homemade handmade toys since childhood.
"It turns out that I will make clothes and sew at home, and Binbin will pick up some scraps and make dolls."
She said that her daughter often sewed her own handmade toys, plus she is good at painting, from the doll's five senses to clothing, can always be lifelike.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and his family gathered less and more, only holidays can go home, usually rely on the phone to contact.
Parents said that whether it is to meet or call, Zhang Binbin rarely said his hard work, more is to talk to his parents about happy things.
Usually can not see the daughter, parents at home the daughter's childhood paintings and years of honor are carefully stored.
Zhang Xiaolong showed his daughter's anime paintings to reporters, "If she hadn't been a shooting athlete, she should have continued to paint."
In the second floor of Zhang Binbin's living room, there is a cabinet full of medals, medals and certificates she has received.
Zhang Donghong put the medals and medals neatly, and the certificate was uniformly placed in the folder to save, "These are the honors of Binbin's efforts for more than ten years, and we all cherish it."
Recently, the Hebei Province Cixiao Fund sent 16,000 yuan of condolences to six families of lost relatives in the villages of Xiaozhu, Taitou and Guiquan in Jingxian County.
This is another condolence and care action after the fund sent a message to the society to find "lost children and lonely elderly in the 7.19 flood".
7.19 Heavy rainfall caused many disasters in Hebei Province, causing floods and deaths and disappearances in some parts of the province.
The "old iron" of the good people was unfortunately sacrificed to help the community to drain the unfortunate sacrifice, leaving a 2-year-old child and a wife with Malacca, and the touching deeds of the good man's "old iron" touched the entire province.
On August 4, the staff of the Cixiao Fund in Hebei Province and the volunteers of the Hebei Brand Association came to the home of the good people's "old iron" and handed over the 3,200 yuan of love money to the family of the "old iron".
When Ye Li, vice president of the brand association, learned the status quo of the "old iron" family, it was immediately decided to carry out the "love charity sale" activity in the corporate members of the brand association to help the "old iron" family to overcome the difficulties.
Hebei Cixiao Fund, known as Hebei Volunteer Service Foundation · Cixiao Fund, was initiated by the Hebei Brand Association Preparatory Committee and established in August 2015.
According to Hong Kong's "Oriental Daily" reported on August 12, the current mainland diamond sales are accused of three major problems, including virtual diamond clarity to push up the price, virtual diamond weight, after-sales insecurity and so on.
Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers, the local artisans of diamond cutting technology is famous all over the world, the diamonds sold by the strict identification, by the mainland ladies welcome.
"A small bag, held in the hand, a small handful of light, worth nearly one million yuan," a young aunt surnamed Liu, who participated in the purchase of diamonds, described her experience in Antwerp in June this year to the mainland media.
She pointed out that she hid the diamond in her underwear, went to the toilet and took a bath for several days, and was very nervous to walk and sleep.
She claimed that the diamond she bought in Antwerp was valued at about $55,000 per carat, and the retail price of the same quality diamonds in Xiamen was about 111,000 yuan.
She recently sold all the diamonds she bought, earning more than 200,000 yuan at a time.
According to the provisions of the mainland customs, diamonds are not the supplies or necessities of passengers in the itinerary, so they belong to the category of goods, and they need to be declared when entering or leaving the country, otherwise they are listed for smuggling, and the situation can be seriously sentenced to imprisonment.
According to foreign media reports, on the 10th local time, the British Prime Minister's Office Downing Street announced that British Prime Minister Theresa May will go to Switzerland for a summer vacation, but did not disclose the specific place of the holiday.
Some media said that after the British referendum to leave the EU, the new British Prime Minister chose to go to the "neutral country" on the European continent for a holiday, with a certain policy symbolism.
The British "Guardian" commented that the symbolism of Switzerland, the neutral country, played a role in the choice of the British Prime Minister's first holiday destination.
The British "Daily Telegraph" commented that Theresa May chose to go to Switzerland for a holiday, which is the first time since Margaret Thatcher has taken a British Prime Minister's holiday in Switzerland.
The choice of two female prime ministers contrasts between the likes of Blair and Cameron, the two male prime ministers, who prefer to go on vacation to hotter places.
Britain’s new prime minister, Theresa May, will return to London on August 24, after which she is waiting for a series of important work and activities.
The British Parliament will resume on September 5, and the debate will include the online demand for a second Brexit referendum.
On June 23, the UK voted to leave the European Union, but the new British prime minister is reluctant to start the 50th paragraph of the Lisbon Treaty on the Brexit of the member states before the end of the year.
There are 1,325 intangible cultural heritage projects in Huangshan City, ranking first in the province in terms of types and numbers.
Because the non-genetic inheritance of the emblem culture mainly depends on oral and face-to-face teaching, many non-heritage is on the verge of being lost, and it is imperative to use digital technology to save and protect it.
According to the main work arrangements of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress this year, the Standing Committee plans to listen to the special work report for consideration, and carry out special inquiries on the implementation of the Banking Supervision and Management Law and the service of local economic development.
In mid-August, the Standing Committee will organize two research groups to conduct research in some cities to prepare for special inquiries.
Hua Jianhui pointed out that the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress listened to and reviewed the special work report of the vertical management department and carried out special inquiries, which is the first time in our province, and it is an active exploration to strengthen and expand the supervision of the National People's Congress.
In the exercise director's department in Kashgar, Xinjiang, with the order of the general director, the armed police forces in Kashgar, Hotan and Aksu quickly carried out mobile assembly in accordance with the guidance instructions and went to the exercise combat site.
China's Mars program is here.
China's Mars exploration mission to achieve orbit, landing, patrol, this form has never been abroad.
China's Mars exploration and launch target is to want to surround, land and patrol in one step, which is quite difficult.
Because it will take 26 months for Mars exploration to encounter a time window, experts are closely developing an engineering plan to launch China's first Mars probe in this window in 2020.
According to Xu Dazhe, although China's aircraft have entered deep space, it is still indispensable to complete the Mars exploration mission, and Mars exploration means that China has entered the era of deep space exploration in a real sense.
“Every two or three years, there is only one chance that Mars is closest to Earth, and launching a Mars rover at this point in time is the most energy-efficient for the launch vehicle.”
“In view of the quality of the Mars probe, the launch mission will be completed by our Long March 5 launch vehicle.”
China's Mars exploration mission to achieve orbit, landing, patrol, this form has never been in foreign countries, foreign has been to achieve a round-robin and landing, but the landing failed.
Mars exploration involves a lot of technical fields, especially in that although the rover is a space probe, it has distinct characteristics compared with ordinary space probes.
In other words, the Mars probe must have the ability to determine the driving route and find the danger of obstacles.
Pang Zhihao, a researcher at the Fifth Academy of China Aerospace Science and Technology Group, said that the reason why humans are so favored for Mars exploration is that it has important scientific and technical significance, and even relates to the future of mankind.
At present, Mars has become the most studied planet outside of Earth, and the history of human use of space probes for Mars exploration has lasted almost throughout the entire history of human spaceflight.
Therefore, humans hope to one day establish a habitation base on Mars and eventually migrate to Mars, turning it into a second home for humans.
There are also a large number of signs that Mars was likely to have been the same as the current Earth, and it was only after billions of years of evolution that it became thin, low temperature, and water depletion.
Therefore, the exploration or manned landing on Mars can be carried out to prevent the earth from becoming a second Mars that is difficult for humans to survive.
As of June 2016, there have been 114 lunar explorations and 43 Mars explorations.
Since the 1990s, humans have made 18 Mars explorations, while only 14 lunar ones have been explored.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rovers working, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are working.
The world's space powers have developed a Mars system-targeted exploration plan, which shows that today's Mars exploration is hotter than lunar exploration.
On November 5, 2013, India launched its first Mars probe, Mangarian, becoming the first country in Asia to successfully explore Mars.
Mangarian is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars to see if there are signs of methane and life on Mars.
The most difficult part of this mission is that the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration after the probe enters the Martian atmosphere have only one chance.
According to Sun Zezhou, chief designer of the Mars probe in the general department of the Fifth Academy of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, Mars exploration missions face many technical challenges.
The atmospheric pressure of Mars is very low, only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on the Earth's surface, which has a high degree of uncertainty.
Scientists have no thorough understanding of factors such as its changes and the characteristics of storms.
Mars often forms dust storms similar to Earth's dusty weather in the summer, which will cause the rover to receive a sharp drop in the sun's energy, and it must be designed for the rover to "sleep" mode, so that it can patiently wait for the dust storm to pass.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reduced effect on the sun's light, which brings problems to the energy supply of Mars exploration.
This requires that the probe's solar wing area is larger and needs to be constantly adjusted and strive to be aligned in the direction of the sun.
Also, Mars has only 38 percent gravity on Earth, but it’s more than the gravity on the surface of the moon, so the rover needs more power.
“The most central and difficult part of this Mars exploration mission is the pneumatic shape and parachute deceleration process after the probe enters the Martian atmosphere, and there is only one chance to ensure success.”
Sun Zezhou said that because of the distance between the Earth and Mars, the whole process cannot be controlled by the ground in real time, so it must rely on the probe to complete it autonomously.
Because there is not so much propellant to offset that high speed, when landing on Mars, the deceleration depends on the role of the Martian atmosphere, but the Martian atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground.
Pang said that in general, the way to explore Mars is similar to the way of exploring the moon, and it is also "circling, landing, patrolling, and returning", and finally achieving the goal of manned landing on Mars.
Because Mars is far farther from Earth than the Moon, exploring Mars requires overcoming a series of more complex technical difficulties.
According to Taiwanese media reports, Taiwan's "executive director" Lin Quan announced yesterday morning that the "Regulations on the improper acquisition of property by political parties and their affiliated organizations" will take effect from today.
Zhan Qixian, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, said, "A more than 100-year-old Kuomintang has social commitments and responsibilities, and will not fail in this way."
Lin Quan stressed that if political parties, affiliated organizations or trustees violate the prohibitions stipulated in the regulations, the committee will investigate and punish "according to law" according to their authority.
Lin Quan also announced that he was not the deputy chairman of the party's production committee, and Hong Bacon, the deputy director of the Taiwan "ICAC", would serve.
He said that Gu Lixiong is the main committee of the improper party production committee, and borrowing Hong Bacon's experience in investigating relevant major cases in the past will serve as the basis for the committee to investigate the relevant improper party property cases.
Zhan Qixian believes that as long as there is still party property today, no one will give you social donations, if the party's property system is confiscated, the Kuomintang can just request social support and sponsorship, "today really there is no opportunity to go."
Zhan Qixian also stressed that even after the improper party property regulations are on the road, the Kuomintang party property has not been completely confiscated and confiscated, and the rest will still be donated according to the promise, so that the party's property will be zero, and the party wants everything from scratch.
Original title: "The Corridor Doctor" Lan Yuefeng v. CCTV host Wang Zhi'an's reputation infringement lost the first instance
Legal Evening News News that because CCTV host Wang Zhian posted remarks on Sina Weibo about the "column doctor" incident, Lan Yuefeng sued Wang Zhian and Beijing Micro Dream Technology Network Technology Co., Ltd. to the court.
Yesterday afternoon, the Haidian court sentenced the case, the judgment found that Wang Zhian and Weimen did not constitute infringement, and rejected all the claims of Lan Yuefeng.
At the beginning of 2014, CCTV reporter Wang Zhian found that although Lan Yuefeng, who had sat in the hospital corridor for more than 600 days, was portrayed by the media as a tragic hero by the system, there was a lot of false information in these reports.
On March 29, 2014, the "Madrid Doctor" program produced by CCTV News Investigation was broadcast.
There is no evidence for the various so-called over-medical information reported by Lan Yuefeng to the media.
Wang Zhian also described in the real-name authentication microblog, "the reason why Lan Yuefeng came to this step is the character, it has obvious paranoid personality and so on."
Lan Yuefeng asked Wang Zhi'an to delete Weibo, apologize to him and compensate him for 100,000 yuan in moral damage.
At the trial at that time, the two sides debated whether Wang Zhian violated Lan Yuefeng's reputation rights.
12 to see: Athletics start the Chinese team is very busy women's football team rushed to four bicycles hope for a breakthrough
The bicycle is expected to achieve the Olympic gold medal "zero breakthrough", and the women's football girl will challenge the two-time world champion Germany, looking forward to the cold into the top four.
Wang Zhen's state in the past two seasons is outstanding, last year's Beijing Athletics World Championships won the silver medal, in May this year, the team race to walk in the world championships and upgrade the individual project champion.
According to foreign media reports, 27-year-old South Korean archery player Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in the women's archery individual competition, and won the Olympic gold medal after the team competition, becoming a double champion.
Zhang Huizhen is considered to be a latecomer, she regretted not getting the ticket to the last London Olympics, but now proudly stand on the highest podium of the Rio Olympic Games.
Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in the final of the women's archery individual competition at the women's archery at the Samba Avenue Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a total score of 6-2.
She scored her first archery in the fourth grade of primary school until the age of 27, who won her first individual gold medal at the World Cup in 2014.
Zhang Huizhen recalled, "Before going to middle school, there was no level, so that I could not participate in the national competition.
Zhang Huizhen won only the fourth place in the London Olympic Games four years ago, regretting that the Olympic ticket, can only sit by and watch colleague and friend Qi Fu double to win two gold medals.
Zhang Huizhen said after the award ceremony of the women's archery individual competition, "until the end is as far as possible shot, may bring good results, satisfied."
28-year-old South Korean archery "a sister", the London Olympic Archery individual gold medal winner Qi Fudu won the bronze medal.
Chifup won the semi-final defeat to Zhang Huizhen and competed for the bronze medal with Mexico's Alejandra Valencia.
Chifup doubled in tears after ensuring the bronze medal, during which the burden of gold can be imagined.
The first is that the coaching staff has accumulated rich experience in continuous research, and the second is the scientific training method, which needs to be accumulated for a long time.
Archery teams use military training, night through the cemetery and other methods to help the team focus and maintain normality.
Although it has not yet been confirmed, many sources have said that Apple's fall 2016 conference will be held in September, and the iPhone 7 is really coming.
Although Apple did not respond, but the new iPhone features, configuration has been released, and even the Internet even iPhone 7 "real model" pictures.
The new generation of iPhone can be described as "catching up", hot, tight, rich and ungoods... If you want to buy authentic products in the first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suning.
This adds to the frustration of the new phone, "It's lengthened, but it can't project a holographic image at all!
The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, was born with countless secrets.
In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will cancel the 3.5mm headphone jack and use the Bluetooth connection and charging interface, which will provide Apple with space to add a second speaker.
Another evidence to support this news is that as early as 2014, Apple allowed headset manufacturers to produce headphones connected through the charging interface.
Whether these messages are true or false, the answer will not be revealed until Apple's fall 2016 conference.
But that doesn’t stop industry insiders from being bullish on the iPhone 7’s prospects — which many believe will likely be Apple’s last major upgrade to the iPhone series.
Although from the recent market research firm IDC released data, iPhone market share has declined.
Goldman Sachs maintained a “buy” rating on Apple’s stock, while BMO analysts said the iPhone 7 would reap a historic sell.
At the same time, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple's future revenue growth will likely exceed 20%, which is entirely due to the launch of the iPhone 7.
Seven percent of respondents said they plan to buy an iPhone 7, up from just 4 percent two years ago.
It is understood that 20% of the current iPhone 6 or 6Plus user group plans to buy the iPhone 7, which is a fairly high proportion.
Secondly, some experts have analyzed that most fruit powder likes to replace their iPhones from generation to generation.
According to statistics, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for two years, that is, almost 120 million iPhone users have used it for two years.
Some media said that during the production of the iPhone 7, Taiwan suffered several earthquakes, "the degree of damage to TSMC production facilities is beyond imagination, and may have an impact on the initial iPhone 7 supply."
The contradiction between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time to start the original iPhone7 at a low price.
According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning senior management and Apple frequently met, the purpose is to prepare sufficient supply.
The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and it is foreseeable that with the in-depth cooperation between the two sides, it will inevitably bring lower prices and more intimate services to users.
“The lowest price, consumers may be able to buy an iPhone 7 for just $7 a day.”
Adequate supply and a variety of concessions, so that the purchase of iPhone 7 is no longer "pressure mountain", and Suning's logistics, will turn this beauty into a more intuitive experience.
Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Suning Tesco, your iPhone 7 is here."
Through the exhibition of cultural relics, the organizers hope that the local people can learn more about the long-established Chinese culture, so as to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
Barcelona’s “Ming Dynasty Heritage Exhibition” is part of a European tour that will run until early October.
Huaxia Bank and Pudong Development Bank released their 2016 semi-annual report yesterday, and China Securities Bank once again increased their shares in the second quarter.
Among them, China Securities increased its holdings of Huaxia Bank by 29.29331 million shares, and by the end of June, the number of shares held by China Securities Bank of China increased to 387 million shares, accounting for its share ratio from 3.35% to 3.62%.
According to China Merchants Securities estimates, after deducting the increase, China Securities also increased its holdings of 38 million shares in the second quarter of the Pudong Development Bank, and the number of shares held increased to nearly 600 million shares, accounting for 2.77% of the shares of Pudong Development Bank.
Recently, the Hebo Garden of Lions in Zhengfu Village, Tongxiang City, Zhejiang Province, was officially opened to villagers and tourists.
The park consists of more than 100 small circular ponds, planting about 300 varieties of ornamental lotus, water lilies and so on.
The rural lotus industry has both ornamental, leisure and economic benefits, which has become the highlight of the new local rural development.
According to foreign media reports, due to the water of the diving pool from blue to green, the Rio Olympic "green pool" incident has attracted much attention recently.
However, on the morning of the 10th, the water in the water ball game pool adjacent to the diving pool also turned green.
The Australian water polo player said after the game that his eyes were tingling and wanted to shed tears.
Earlier, the official personnel of the Rio Olympic Games confirmed the greening of the pool water, and said that the discoloration of the pool water is due to the weakening of the alkaline and will not affect the health of the athletes.
But the Australian athlete said his eyes were tingling after a win over the water polo pool with the Japanese team.
As early as after the water in the diving pool turned green, the organizers of the competition worked overtime to deal with the problem of the diving pool on the evening of the 9th, but on the morning of the 10th, it was found that the color of the pool also changed rapidly.
During the Australian team's match with Japan, the environmental conditions of the water polo pool gradually deteriorated, but officials stressed that they would restore the water quality of the two pools to their original color on the 11th.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Games, said: “Yesterday afternoon, the water in the diving pool became less alkaline first.”
“We understand a range of causes that may trigger the discoloration of the pool water and the alkalinity of the water quality.”
The water quality is tested by the Aquatics Center for a series of tests, and hundreds of divers and swimmers use the swimming pool to determine that the water quality conditions meet the standards.”
“We’ve been following the normal routine these days, but we may have overlooked the more athletes the more likely it has to have an impact on water quality.”
“But a change in the color of the water certainly has no effect on good health, especially for athletes.”
“This independent team confirmed our assessment and the steps we took to return the pool to its normal colour and normal chemistry.”
“We had hoped that the pool would return to its normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by the rain.”
According to Taiwan's "Central News Agency" reported that an explosion occurred in a prison in the suburbs of Metro Manila last night, resulting in the injury of the warden and the death of 10 prisoners, reportedly including two Chinese.
ABS-CBN reported that the incident occurred at around 9 p.m. at Paranaque prison, but police made a preliminary claim until 2 a.m. to this day.
Police said the 10 prisoners asked the warden to complain about the transfer, but the two sides did not speculate, and some prisoners threw grenades and caused the explosion.
The prison authorities have not released the names of the dead prisoners, but GMA television reported that they included two Chinese nationals.
As of 8 a.m., the prison authorities had not provided detailed explanations, including how the prisoners had obtained the grenade.
Yesterday, the police in the central Philippines entered the regional prison in Leyte Province and killed a person who was "attempted to attack the police".
Urumqi regulates the order of tourism market operators travel agencies must sign contracts with tourists
At present, Xinjiang has entered the tourist season, in order to standardize the order of the tourism market, the Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment and the Municipal Transport Administration Law Enforcement Detachment yesterday did not regulate the existence of tourist vehicles in the loose market, and the low signing rate of travel agencies and tourists were investigated and dealt with.
At eight o'clock yesterday morning, about 10 buses full of tourists were parked around the Kempinski Hotel, most of which were scattered groups to Tianchi for a day trip.
“Hello, I’m from the Urumqi City Tourism Bureau, have you signed a contract with this travel agency?”
Yu Bin, a staff member of the law enforcement detachment of the Urumqi Municipal Transportation Administration, said: "The off-site tourist car and the train line car operate the tourist passenger transport project in the Urumqi market, and there is no qualification for the industry."
"Exceeding the scope of business for this penalty of three to 100,000 fine, the driver did not have a qualification certificate is a fine of 2000 yuan."
It is understood that the Urumqi tourism law enforcement department has inspected the places where tourists are concentrated in West Park and Hongshan.
Comprehensive two inspections, Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment deputy leader Ma Qi said: "The first is safety, the second is the norm, the tourist vehicles are no small matter, once the problem is the group of casualties."
“We and the transport management jointly continuously check the market and regulate the use of vehicles by travel agencies to ensure the safety of tourists.”
On the morning of August 12, the Information Office of the State Council held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016.
Sheng Laiyun, spokesman of the National Bureau of Statistics and director of the Comprehensive Statistics Department of the National Economy, said that in July, the growth rate of some indicators of the national economy slowed down, but it still operated within a reasonable range.
According to the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, the growth rate of fixed asset investment and total imports fell in July.
Sheng Lai said that with regard to the operation of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow a sentence that the Prime Minister once said, "The shape is fluctuating, the situation is still good", which can better summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July.
He explained that "shape fluctuation" means that the growth rate of some economic indicators in July is indeed a decline.
Because the domestic and foreign economies are still in the midst of deep adjustment in July, the international situation is complex and changeable, and the recovery of the world economy is less than expected, so the export pressure is still relatively large.
From the domestic situation, the entire economy is still in the critical stage of adjustment, the pain of adjustment is released, and the economy is facing no small downward pressure, so some indicators are fluctuating.
Sheng Laiyun pointed out that there is another special situation in July, floods and floods are more serious, and the high temperature and hot weather have brought some effects on the production and operation of some areas.
According to the recent situation released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people have been affected by the country, and the direct economic loss has exceeded 200 billion yuan.
From the perspective of industrial, investment and transportation-related indicators, these areas are affected to varying degrees.
The growth rate of weekly freight transit in July fell by 3.6 percentage points compared with the previous month, and floods have a certain impact on traffic in these areas.
From these factors, it is also normal for some indicators to fluctuate in July, and it is also expected.
He said that "the trend is still good" means that although the economic growth rate has declined, the overall economic operation is stable, and the general trend of steady progress and steady improvement has not changed.
In July, the CPI rose by 1.8%, up 0.2% month-on-month; the CPI rose by 2.1% in January-July, so the price situation was generally stable.
According to the statistics of the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau portal on the high temperature weather of each district and county, in addition to Yuyang, all other parts of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance.
At present, at least 28 provinces in the country have clarified the subsidy payment standards, but the standards issued by provinces and cities are not the same, while Chongqing receives high-temperature allowance in the form of high-temperature working day allowance.
If it is below 37 °C above 35 °C, it shall be issued according to the standard of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; above 37 °C shall be issued according to the standard of not less than 15 yuan per person per day.
High-temperature workers above 40 °C can receive a maximum allowance of 20 yuan / day per month (except for workers who have already enjoyed high temperature job allowance according to law).
According to this standard, last month's high temperature weather days in the state can receive 330 yuan, the fewest days of the city is 80 yuan, and the highest temperature in Yuyang because it does not meet the high temperature standard, so there is no high temperature allowance.
In the past, many units would offset the high temperature allowance with refreshing drinks, and the Municipal Security Supervision Bureau said that this behavior was not in line with the current method.
If the work is stopped and the working hours are shortened due to high temperature weather, the employer shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the workers.
The Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau said that if employees encounter high temperature operations but do not receive high temperature allowances, they can fight for their legitimate rights and interests through the labor dispute mediation agency where the enterprise is located, or call 12333 to complain.
Where a useful person refuses to pay a high-temperature allowance, the worker may complain to the competent department of human resources and social security at or above the county level where the employing person is located.
At the same time, because the high temperature allowance is part of the salary, not a benefit, it should be included in the total salary and deducted from the tax.
Therefore, the high temperature allowance is not within the scope of the minimum wage and must be paid in cash and cannot be replaced by drinks and other materials.
The newly built Urumqi station is located in the high-speed rail area of Urumqi City, with an entire construction area of about 100,000 square meters.
The ground floor is the inbound, waiting hall and office and commercial, and the ground floor is the outbound floor.
At present, Urumqi Station is the largest integrated transportation hub in Xinjiang, integrating high-speed rail, rail transit, public transportation, and rental, so as to achieve seamless docking of various transfer methods.
There are three ticket halls on the north and south sides of the platform floor and the north side of the exit layer, equipped with 39 individual ticket windows and 34 vending ticket machines.
In terms of ticketing, there are 30 channels on the east and west sides of the waiting hall, and passengers can quickly check and wait according to the ticket number of the ticket.
If you need help, you can select the 41 call buttons set in the nearby station to get timely service.
Since July 1, the old passenger station, the passenger train of Urumqi South Station, has been running to Urumqi Station in a step-by-step manner.
In other words, all trains and 30 pairs of trains can stop at Urumqi Station.
Now both stations can buy tickets, the train between them travel time is about 10 minutes, passengers need to pay attention to the specific name of the station of the ticket and the terminal.
The official operation of the new passenger station in Urumqi will become an important platform for Xinjiang to build a national comprehensive transportation city and promote the construction of the "Silk Road Economic Belt" and new areas.
Gracia is a budding female toucan, radiating the breath of tropical rainforest.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story are already well known.
At a press conference on August 10, Grecia, who recovered after surgery, finally appeared to show people its brand-new 3D printed plastic beak.
The toucan, which had been broken a beak and dying a year and a half ago, has finally been reborn.
This day not only announced that it has 100% health, but also that it has moved into a luxury aviary and met with human friends who care about it.
Grecia, who was new to his new home, was a little shy, but not often became lively, rolling in the basin and eating grapes with a new beak.
To remind people of the harm it has suffered, the technician did not color its new beak, but retained the original white of the 3D printed material.
Outside the beak is a thin keratinized sheath, hollow inside, only some fine bone support rods intersected.
Although this internal reinforcement component is available, the toucan's beak is still fragile and broken when it is damaged.
Animal rescue centers, ornithologists, and an American 3D printing company have teamed up to create several “experimental beaks” for Gracia, and finally the “perfect beak” that works best for it.
Now Gracia is skilled at using new beeps to drink water, eat, and even peck small grains.
“The final product took about two months to design and took only four or five hours to print.”
"3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has actually entered your life," Thomas Lange, chairman of SG3D Printing in the United States, said in an interview with Xinhua International.
In January 2015, a blood-soaked toucan, Gracia, was discovered on a farm in Gracia, in the central province of Alajuela in central Costa Rica.
At that time, its upper beak was cruelly broken by a group of young people, and it was completely unable to eat, and its life was in danger.
After the tragedy of Grecia was reported in the media, it caused a wave of anti-animal abuse in and outside Costa Rica.
There are calls for stricter animal protection laws and increased penalties for abusers.
People came spontaneously and did their best to help Gracia recover as much as possible from his previous injuries.
Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of Gracia’s beak.
“The situation in Gracia is very special, with less than one centimetre remaining on its upper beak, which makes it difficult to install the new beak.”
“We first scan Gracia, then design and make an extension prosthesis that is slightly longer than the rest of its beak, fixed to its beak with viscose.”
“This could reduce further intrusive harm to Gracia,” Lange told Xinhua International.
Before installing the prosthesis, staff had to clean up the beak for Gracia every day to prevent infection.
Thousands of miles away, the story of the Toucan Gracia touched the famous documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and Discovery News Channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded a bit during Gracia’s installation of the new beak, recording a documentary, The Country of Toucans, which was broadcast on Animal Planet this month.
The documentary "The Country of the Toucan" shows how a small tocodise bird can change a country and how its citizens are involved in the fight against animal cruelty.
Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of small independent refineries in China known as “teapots.”
Reference News Network reported on August 12 that Japanese media said that Japan's largest oil company JX Energy believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the downturn."
Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of small independent refineries in China, known as “teapots.”
The quality of China's petroleum products is gradually approaching that of Japanese oil products as the Chinese government strengthens environmental regulations.
Before obtaining the crude oil import license, the "teapot refinery" generally imports heavy oil with high sulfur content from Russia and other places for refining.
The sulphur content of petroleum products produced is high, and the oil is not good, which has become one of the reasons for environmental pollution.
After obtaining the crude oil import license, the "teapot refinery" was able to import Oman-made crude oil with low sulfur content and Russian crude oil, and the quality of its petroleum products also improved.
Dongfeng General Oil Company said, "With the continuous improvement of China's domestic oil product quality standards, the ability of refining equipment has also improved.
As a result, the quality of China’s oil products exported abroad has gradually reached the same level as Japan (the world’s highest quality).
JX Energy said that “after the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia” to compete with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Although "Japanese high-quality oil" is facing a crisis, the response strategy adopted by Japanese oil companies is only to "take exports to profitable regions while paying attention to market conditions."
Due to the huge impact of China's oil products on the Asian market, the attention to teapot refineries is also increasing.
In 2016, the Yangzi Evening News Sunshine Student Aid Action was launched on May 26, and after two months of registration, the total number of poor students applying for grants reached more than 800.
In the process of teaching aid, more than 1.2 million yuan has been received in social donations (has been publicized in five batches), which can help at least 240 students.
At present, the donation continues, and the newspaper calls on the community to continue to lend a helping hand so that more children with difficult families can receive financial support and social care.
In order to ensure that the student action is fair, open and transparent, this newspaper will publish the basic information of students in batches from today, and today will be publicized 1,100th and will be supervised by readers.
Liqun Sunshine student aid action is a well-known Chinese charity brand, Yangzi Evening Liquor Sunshine Aid Action has been carried out in Jiangsu since 2003, funding more than 4,000 poor students.
The scope of funding for the event is the admission of undergraduate students, excluding tuition-free majors; excellent quality, family poverty.
New Zealand’s population growth was previously only more than 2 per cent at the peak of the “baby boom” population in 1974 and the early 1950s and early 1960s, the Bureau of Statistics said.
As of June this year, New Zealand's net migration in the 12 months was 69,100, making it the main driver of population growth in recent years.
In addition, the natural population of New Zealand grew by 28,220,000 people during the same time period.
According to the data, in the past 10 years, the average annual net inflow of immigrants in New Zealand has reached 218,800, and the average annual population has increased by 32,300.
From the perspective of population structure, the influx of immigrants means that the proportion of the “working-age population” between the ages of 15 and 39 is gradually expanding.
In the 12 months to June 2016, New Zealand’s working-age population grew by 3.6 per cent to 1.58 million.
At the same time, the number of elderly people over the age of 65 also increased by 3.6%, reaching 700,000.
At about 10 a.m. yesterday, the X9003 international freight train left Xi'an Xinzhuang Station and went to Almaty, Kazakhstan.
The opening of the train marks that the number of trains running has exceeded 10,000 since the opening of the Central Asian International Freight Train by the Xi'an Railway Bureau in 2013.
It is understood that the freight train transport categories covering industrial raw materials, machinery and equipment, industrial spare parts, building materials, food, light industrial products six categories, a total of 206 varieties.
As of August 11 this year, the new station opened a total of 221 trains and 1009 cars in Central Asia, with a total of 338,000 tons of export goods, of which 84 were opened in 2016, an increase of 47%.
It is understood that the goods carried by the first Central Asian train are "made in Shaanxi", and now, it has attracted a large number of foreign sources.
As of the end of July, the volume of Central Asian train containers exceeded 64,000 TEU, an increase of 8% over the same period in 2015.
With the opening of the encryption of the Central Asian train, the freight volume of the new station of the Xi'an Railway Bureau has increased year by year.
In 2015, the annual freight throughput of the new station was 2.477 million tons, and as of August 10, 2016, the freight delivery volume had reached 1.531 million tons, an increase of 6.7% over the same period last year.
In order to meet the needs of future development, the Xi'an Railway Bureau has been launched to build a new railway integrated logistics center centered on the new construction station, and has made every effort to build a modern new railway integrated logistics park.
An Indian uncle just last week at Dubai International Airport, where he won a $1 million prize at the same airport.
Mohammed Bashir Abdul Hedal, an Indian who has lived in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, has a habit of buying lottery tickets every time he returns home.
His 21-year-old son was paralyzed by an accidental fall 13 days after he worked hard to repay his son’s medical loans.
“To escape from an air crash is God gave me a second life and the money that gave me money to do good,” Hedar said.
Although it is now autumn, the power of the "autumn tiger" seems to be no worse than summer.
Ultraviolet light not only makes the skin of the students dark, but also burns the skin, how to make the skin can go through military training smoothly and not get sunburned?
Sunscreen packaging is generally marked with SPF and PA, SPF refers to the sunscreen index, is aimed at UVB ultraviolet light, our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50 and so on.
Products labeled PA are aimed at UVA, so that sunscreen will play a more effective role, under normal circumstances, the strength of PA is expressed as +, and more than one + indicates the extension of effective protection time.
Oily skin should choose water-based sunscreen with strong permeability, sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
Dry skin should choose frosty sunscreen products; neutral skin is generally not strictly regulated, sensitive skin rubbing any care products is a burden, it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products.
Remember to apply sunscreen half an hour in advance, as sunscreen products take time to completely seep into the skin.
Military training sun time is longer, sunscreen every two hours to wipe once to have a lasting effect, do not lazy.
Because the skin has just been stimulated by the sun, military training should not be immediately whitening products.
After military training, if you have the conditions, you can use a towel to wrap the ice cubes to freeze the burned skin to slow down the localized heat.
Farmers who buy agricultural machinery during the exhibition continue to implement the cumulative subsidy policy, and farmers can receive up to 40% of the subsidy for purchasing agricultural machinery.
This exhibition is aimed at global investment promotion, especially increasing the invitation to countries and target market countries along the "Belt and Road".
The exhibition strives to complete 60 investment signing projects, introduce funds of 22 billion yuan, sign more than 160 trade contracts, and contract amount of 3.2 billion yuan.
It is reported that the reason why the "Xiangbo Expo" has settled in Loudi for seven consecutive years is due to the strong manufacturing industry base and the industrial development history of Loudi City, Hunan Province.
As the host of the "Xiangbo Expo", Loudi has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
"Xiangbo Expo" has become an important platform for cultivating the development of characteristic industries and promoting the development of characteristic industries to go abroad.
On some nights, the ionosphere is filled with free electrons, which means that the radio signal can go even further.
According to the US "Popular Science" monthly website reported on August 11, the US Air Force is interested in replicating this effect.
While a stable ionosphere of a large number of free electrons can help people listen to the radio station on the edge of a university radio station, this may not be of interest to the U.S. Air Force.
The electron-filled ionosphere means that the radio used by the military has a larger range of broadcasts, and it may provide some protection for Global Positioning System (GPS) signals from solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of CubeSats, depending on demand, that can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first, these teams that have contracts with the Air Force must prove that the science works.
Industry data show that the total scale of coal production capacity in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons, and the national coal production capacity was overstated by 1.8 billion tons.
In the past ten years, the State Council has issued five notices of eliminating excess and backward production capacity.
Although the first four times were not targeted at the coal industry, the target industry directly related to the coal industry.
From November last year to January this year, the price of Qinhuangdao's 5,500 kcal thermal coal has long been hovering at a low level of 370 yuan / ton, and 90% of coal companies are in a loss.
Since February, coal prices have gradually rebounded, and recently the price of Qinhuangdao thermal coal has risen for four consecutive weeks, rising to a high of 16 months, once climbing to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan from the beginning of the year.
With the price rebounded, everyone worried that it would happen: will a number of small coal mines resume production?
In this regard, the Economic Institute of the China (Hainan) Reform and Development Research Institute conducted analysis and interpretation.
Qian Xianming: to the production capacity has aroused the high concern of all parties, and the report card of the coal industry to the production capacity announced today does make everyone feel more worried.
These three surface factors still reflect the reason why our growth patterns have lagged in the past, which is that the government-led growth mode has not yet undergone a fundamental shift.
Second, this is also directly related to the promotion of local governments, in the process of production capacity, funds and corresponding supporting measures must be in place, from this point of view, the difference between different regions is indeed relatively large.
Third, if some provinces with slow progress are to catch up in the second half of the year, they may face greater risks.
In this case, relying on the central award funds to promote the process of de-capacity may have a negative impact.
First of all, to production capacity is not simply to control the total amount.
Our goal is to eliminate backward production capacity, promote the optimization of the structure, and reconstruct the new format of the entire coal industry.
In the process of deploying production capacity, local governments must combine the transformation and upgrading of production capacity and coal industry to vigorously develop related service industries.
Second, in order to complete this year's production capacity task this year, we still need to give full play to the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision.
Finally, we must strengthen the role of social security.
Because the market is directly related to employment, we need to strengthen the employment skills training of employees and employees.
“The decline in the ranking is due to the deterioration of foreign investment expectations for Brazil’s GDP development in the medium term.”
In 2015, Brazil’s participation in global direct investment was 3.7%, down from 5.7% in 2014.
Credit Suisse’s International Investment Attraction Index includes four sub-indices: infrastructure, economic outlook, business environment and direct investment.
In 2015, Brazil’s international direct investment was $64.6 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year, “greenfield investment” (investment model for factories abroad) in Brazil was $17.9 billion, down 2.1 percent year-on-year.
“There are 288 ‘greenfield investment’ projects in Brazil, compared to an average of 314 per year from 2003 to 2014.”
However, in the first half of 2016, international direct investment in Brazil reached $33.8 billion, an increase of almost 10% compared to the same period last year.
Canadian police kill IS supporters: homemade bomb attack downtown preparations near the end
The taxi company said the taxi was dispatched to Drafer's home before police arrived.
Canadian police said at a news conference Wednesday that the information they received was a "marriage video" provided by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation about the young man about the attack.
According to Deutsche Welle, a man wearing a black al-balakalafa hat is reading the Koran, mentioning crimes against Muslims and vowing that an attack will soon be carried out on a Canadian city.
He said in the video that the attack will take place within 72 hours, and it will be at peak hours.
The incident was the first time since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came to power last year that police killed a terror suspect before the incident.
After the upgrade and renovation of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal branch channel Lao Wanfu River, the Northern Grand Slipway will be charged tolls from September 1.
These two tributary waterways adopt social financing methods for renovation and construction, and the fees have been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.
The old Wanfu River channel flows through Jinxiang and fishtai, and enters the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal through Nanyang Lake, with a total length of 32.5 kilometers.
According to the navigation needs, the old Wanfu River channel adopts the maintenance and transformation method, and the local water depth is deep, and the local sharp bends are bent straight, etc., and the navigation conditions can be improved.
The channel flows through Jinxiang County and Rencheng District, and enters the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal through Nanyang Lake, with a total length of 19 kilometers.
The renovation of the two waterways started construction in February 2011, and the acceptance was completed in January 2015, and the main body of investment construction and operation is the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center in Jining City.
In accordance with the principle of "loan construction, charging and repayment of loans", Jining Anping Canal Logistics Service Center collects channel tolls according to the charging standards approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau.
Among them, the basic toll is charged by 1.75 yuan / dwt, and the mileage toll is charged according to 0.05 yuan / km dwt.
The toll collection period runs from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019.
The reporter learned from the Jining Port and Navigation Bureau that there are currently four toll waterways in Jining, namely, the Sushui River channel, the Baima River channel, the Northern Grand Slipway, and the Lao Wanfu River channel.
The four shipping lanes are tributary channels of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, all of which are upgraded and transformed by means of social financing.
The Upgrading and Upgrading Project of the Sushui River is the first to adopt the "government + market" model for the construction of the inland river port and sea in Shandong Province, the government accounts for the main investment, and the social funds supplement the funding gap.
The Baima River, the Lao Wanfu River, the Northern Grand Slide River and other regional channels adopt a purely market-oriented operation.
The funds allocated by the state government cannot meet the needs of the construction of the project and restrict the progress of the upgrading of the waterway.
The use of social funds for the construction of public infrastructure meets the requirements of national policies and has also become a way to crack the bottleneck of funds.
Ning Zetao's performance in the 100-meter freestyle semi-finals has left many Chinese spectators speechless.
But in the 50-meter freestyle preliminaries, Ning Zetao once again refreshed the "bottom line" of people.
In fact, the 50-meter freestyle is not the main item of Ning Zetao, his performance and best results in the Kazan World Championships, but also decided that he is unlikely to make a breakthrough in this project.
Sure enough, Hong Kong's authoritative media "Grand Gazette" revealed that the biggest reason for Ning Zetao's loss is that he has lost his interest in swimming.
Many factors off the field may have had a big impact on his ideas for the future, and he is now likely to be more interested in moving into the entertainment world.
After the Kazan World Championships, Ning Zetao, with his ultra-high face value and good results, instantly became a net red.
Therefore, the titles of "national husband", "small fresh meat", "beautiful man" have also continuously become his label.
All kinds of business activities come to the door, a beautiful money road, become a golden light shining road.
In this case, even if Ning Zetao chooses to retire at this time to join the entertainment industry, it is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly feasible path.
After all, he is only 23 years old, after a certain amount of study, can be used to star in one or two TV series with his popularity.
But Ning Zetao needs to see if he has enough qualifications compared with these predecessors?
At the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, Liu Xuan, who is already 21 years old, has reached the end of his career as an athlete.
Liu Xuan's beautiful appearance made her quickly remembered by people, and also laid the foundation for her to enter the entertainment industry in the future.
After retiring, Liu Xuan starred in a number of TV series and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang participated in the single-double 10 meters competition of the two Olympic Games and won 2 gold and 2 silver.
However, after losing to teammate Hu Jia in the single 10 meters at the 2004 Olympic Games, Tian Liang's competitive status declined and was expelled by the diving team.
And he and his daughter participated in the "Dad where to go" and other variety shows, but also let him make enough attention.
Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing, the former golden generation of gymnastics, all participated in various variety shows in high profile.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei Li Xiaopeng led China to win the 2008 Olympic men's team championship, and Yang Wei won the individual all-around gold medal twice, known as the all-around king.
Chen Yibing, while leading China to the 2012 Olympic team championship, also became the king of the hanging ring.
After suffering from a miscarriage of gold medals at the London Olympic Games, Chen Yibing's generous move also made him circle countless powders.
But the main energy of these athletes is still in the field, and for the variety show is just like a dragonfly - touch it and go.
However, whether it is retired or active athletes, they need to be able to get the favor of the entertainment industry.
After all, athletes step into a new field, whether it is ability or networking, is a blank state.
Even if Tian Liang and Liu Xuan have been mixed with the entertainment industry for many years, the ordinary audience mentioned them, and they still think of their performance in the Olympic Games.
And Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and other newcomers, in the variety show appearance of the introduction, without exception are "Olympic champions."
Compared with the above few people, Ning Zetao's name of a swimming world championship is still slightly thin.
What's more, compared to the achievements and retreats of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan, Yang Wei and others, Ning Zetao's rapid retreat if he encounters a setback in his 23-year-old sports career, and the negative impact on his image is probably immeasurable.
After all, when it comes to athletes, people's requirements are "not to win a hundred battles, but not to be afraid of difficulties", Ning Zetao is still a lot behind this point.
Ten thousand steps back, Ning Zetao is handsome, can rely on the value of the face to get the support of thousands of brain powder.
No amount of power, just by appearance, want to mix well in the entertainment industry, this difficulty is no better than good training to get back the state it deserves.
The choice of life is all based on personal will, but how to choose, Ning Zetao should be numbered.
On the surface, online social platforms expand their social circle and reduce people’s loneliness.
The scope of influence of online social networking is becoming more and more extensive, not only gradually replacing traditional telephone contact, but even infiltrating the real life circle offline, quietly changing the social life of the current people.
The benefits of online socialization are obvious, such as convenience and speed, so it is particularly vulnerable to young people.
According to a survey of college students' social habits, 57% of college students use mobile phones for more than 5 hours a day, and their daily life is basically "unleaving".
“Social networks have the characteristics of low cost, fast transmission speed, and simultaneous communication between multiple people, which meets the needs of contemporary university students.”
Expanding interpersonal relationships, more equal dialogue, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love online chat more and more.
Newcomers who have just entered the company love to communicate with colleagues online, "because they are not familiar with the unit, and through the likes and comments on the social platform, the relationship is much closer than before."
Love friends also often use online communication, "before with friends because of some misunderstanding for a period of time did not contact, and then in a large group of first dialogue a few words before the network."
IT engineer Wu Yan is a deep network social enthusiast, most of his social life takes place online, network contacts are several times more than the number of offline circle of friends.
Wu himself admitted that he was more “fished in water” on the Internet.
“You can reply to a friend when you are comfortable with yourself, because there is a lot of time to consider the words, and the expression can be clearer.”
"Hidden under the ID, you have avoided face-to-face interpersonal collisions, not only have room for manoeuvre, but even give each other more time and space to think about words and deeds."
“People of different identities have the same right and efficiency to speak, and social concerns in real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace.”
However, Wu's friend Xiao Peng felt that Wu Yan in his life was a "quite boring house man."
Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a large group, because both of them were active speakers and soon became acquainted.
Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan and the network judged two people, the language is boring, do not take the initiative to express their opinions, turning over and over is a few words "huh, okay, is it", or "this I want to check the Internet."
Lingshui police have now intervened in the investigation, and the Lingshui traffic department will also strengthen efforts to rectify illegal operating vehicles.
“The police investigation into the clashes on 4 August has not yet been launched, and at about 0:00 on 11 August, two other drivers’ taxis were smashed in their accommodation.”
“Now most of the tricycles operate illegally at night, and it is hoped that the competent authorities will also strengthen their efforts to rectify them.”
The reporter of the South China Sea Network learned from the Public Security Bureau of Lingshui Li Autonomous County that the police have now accepted the report of the two cases, and the cause of the two cases, who committed it, and whether they are related are in further investigation.
Wang Wenyi, director of the traffic management station of the Lingshui Transportation Bureau, said that the Lingshui Transportation Department began to rectify the illegal operation of passenger tricycles at the beginning of this year, and banned a total of 613 illegal operation of passenger tricycles.
In the next step, the transportation department will apply to the county government to strengthen the rectification of illegal operating vehicles such as tricycles, motorcycles and black cars in the county.
At 8 a.m. on August 11, the reporter of Qilu Evening News followed the "Healthy China Walk" clinic service team to Hegou Village, West Lake Town, Donggang District.
The village is located in a remote area, about 24 kilometers from the city, and more than 200 households in the village have caused inconvenience to many middle-aged and elderly patients to go out to see a doctor due to economic, transportation and physical limitations.
The project of this clinic is more comprehensive, internal medicine, surgery, respiratory, psychiatry, dermatology, pediatrics.
Many villagers heard that the experts of the clinic were coming, and they had already waited in the small square in the village early.
Mrs. Xue, 67, suffers from congenital scoliosis, and in recent years, she has been so plagued by “asthma” that she will be breathless and breathless even walking on the upper slope.
The doctor told Aunt Xue that it is unlikely that chronic bronchitis wants a fundamental cure, and that it can be alleviated by insisting on medication.
At the dermatologist's office, an elderly man in his 60s came to consult with her grandson.
The old man's grandson is 11 years old, and since the child's 3 years old, his left foot has been plagued by "foot gas".
After the doctor checked, he told the elderly that this is not a "foot" but a seasonal eczema, and do not delay treatment with drugs at will.
"In this village, we provide medical treatment and B-ul-chao services, while the other team also provides free medical examination services in Qiujiadian Village, Wulian County.
The clinic is only one part of the "Healthy China Tour", and in the coming days, other activities will be carried out one after another."
51Talk is considered to be a milestone in building an online education industry ecosystem.
CEO Huang Jiajia said that bringing the world's best learning resources to the children in China is their strategy for the next five years.
It is understood that "51Talk's biggest advantage is to be able to meet the needs of users of different ages."
Zhang Liming, chief operating officer, said that the global high-quality foreign teacher funding and services are connected to the student end, and parents no longer need to travel to work hard, and they spend their precious time on transporting their children.
The central bank renewed the payment business license of 27 non-bank institutions such as Alipay for 5 years

On August 11, when the reporter telephoned Huang Yilin, who had returned to his home in Mianyang, Sichuan, she said: "At that time, the situation was too urgent, and I only had one thought in my heart that was to save people!"
Huang Yilin is a 2015 class student at the Central South Linke University School of Landscape Architecture.
Huang Yilin, who studied urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Sichuan Jingzhong to study local architectural design, so the family went to travel.
At about 10 a.m. on August 8, Huang Yilin's father rested in the hotel, and the mother and daughter came out to visit the ancient city of Zhenzhong.
Not far away, I suddenly saw a group of people shouting, out of curiosity and went forward.
Seeing that "the little boy has disappeared, the little girl is desperately pounced in the water, only her little head is exposed on the river, and it sinks down from time to time", Huang Yilin, who learned to swim when she was a child, jumped down to save people.
After the water, Huang Yilin, who was 165 centimeters tall, found that he could not step on the end!
Before it looked calm water, but under it was a torrent!
But she was still desperate to swim to the little girl.
Huang Yilin said that the river is turbid and rushy, less than 5 meters away, almost all her strength.
She tried her best to push the little girl to the edge of the river, "the slope is particularly slippery, I am afraid that I have no strength to sink."
So, Huang Yilin asked her mother for help, heard her daughter's call for help, Ms. Yin, who was not well-hydrated, was ready to go into the water rescue, and was stopped by the tourists next to her.
On August 10, after Huang Yilin jumped from the river to save people, Ms. Yin received many relatives and friends condolences and praise at the same time, but also many relatives and friends "accountability".
To tell the truth, when the child can't hold on to the river embankment and ask for help, my heart is almost broken."
Ms. Yin said with a heart, although it is very dangerous, but if she is in such a scene again, she will still support her daughter's choice, she is proud of her daughter!
Because he was forced, Huang Yilin rarely took the initiative to go into the water after learning to swim, "I did not expect this skill to really come in handy."
According to Chen Yixi, the class leader in Huang Yilin's class, Huang Yilin is recognized as a "student leader" in the class, and he is helpful.

The Northeastern Tiger is currently listed as an endangered (EN) species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, in 1998, the data of the joint monitoring of China, the United States and Russia and other countries showed that there were only 4 to 6 wild Northeast tigers and 3 to 5 northeast leopards in Jilin Province.
According to Changchun, director of the protection department of the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, in recent years, Jilin Province has continuously increased the protection of wild animals, and the population of Northeast tigers and northeast leopards in China is growing significantly, and the distribution area is constantly expanding.
The latest monitoring data in 2015 showed that only 27 wild northeast tigers and 42 northeast leopards were monitored in Jilin Province.
As the world's flagship species for wildlife protection in the border area between China and Russia, the cooperation between China and Russia is of great significance for the recovery and reproduction of wild northeastern tigers and leopards.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, Jilin Province has established a long-term and stable cooperation and exchange mechanism with Russia.
At the 2016 China Haochun Tiger and Leopard Protection International Forum, which ended on the 11th, the forestry departments and animal protection organizations of China and Russia once again reached a number of consensus.

Sun Fujian, as a leading cadre of party members, lost his ideals and beliefs, seriously violated the discipline of the party, and still did not converge after the 18th National Congress of the Party, did not stop, and broke the wind and discipline, which was of a bad nature and a serious situation.
After the case occurred, after a number of media reports, it became the focus of the case, and the social impact was extremely bad.
After the case, the leadership of the criminal police detachment of Haikou Public Security Bureau attached great importance to it and immediately organized a large team of elite police forces to launch an investigation.
The police immediately carried out the suspect to escape online, took a variety of measures to control, and contacted the foreign police to investigate the whereabouts of Wang's country.
Because the suspect is a frequent offender for theft, has been repeatedly cracked down by the public security organs, has a strong anti-reconnaissance ability, coupled with his long-term drug use, interrogation poisoning addiction often occurs, interrogation work is very difficult.
The Greenland shark, also known as the small head sleeper, is widely distributed in the North Atlantic Ocean around Greenland and Iceland, and its height in adulthood is 4 to 5 meters.
But they grow extremely slowly, sometimes only about a centimeter a year, suggesting that Greenland sharks may have the life of their foreign minister.
Traditional dating methods typically use animal calcified tissue, and some sharks can use fin ridges, but this calcified tissue is rare in Greenland sharks.
The new study, led by Julius Nelson of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, turns to radiocarbon dating using the eye lens of a Greenland shark.
This method has previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it is the first time it has been used to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis showed that the largest shark had an estimated lifespan of 392 years, with an error of 120 years.
That is to say, the shark is at least 272 years old and can reach a maximum of 512 years.
In addition, the female Greenland shark is said to be mature at about 4 meters, which translates to an age of at least 156 years old.
The researchers thus wrote in the paper that the Greenland shark is the oldest known vertebrate on Earth, surpassing the previous longevity champion circuit whale (211 years old).
Over the past year, the exchange rate has achieved remarkable results, and the RMB exchange rate has remained basically stable, and it has also laid the foundation for promoting the internationalization of the RMB.
From the perspective of market performance, in the past year, the two-way fluctuation of the RMB exchange rate has become obvious, the exchange rate flexibility has increased, and the exchange rate is expected to be generally stable.
Since the exchange rate reform, the upward and upward fluctuations of the RMB against the middle price of the US dollar have repeatedly appeared, but the process has alternated.
The last exchange reform measure before the August 11 exchange reform last year was implemented in 2005, and the RMB appreciated significantly against the US dollar in a decade.
Since the implementation of the new exchange rate reform, the RMB has changed its previous appreciation state, and the middle price of the RMB exchange rate has depreciated by about 8% in one year.
On October 1 this year, the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the RMB and become the weighted currency of the SDR (Special Drawing Rights).
This week, statistics released by the General Administration of Customs of China show that in the first seven months of this year, the total value of China's imports and exports was 13.21 trillion yuan, down 3% from the same period last year.
In July, the total value of China's imports and exports fell by only 0.9% year-on-year, especially exports increased by 2.9% year-on-year.
Relevant experts believe that although there are signs of stabilization of imports and exports in July, there should be no high expectations.
In July, the total value of China's imports and exports was 2.09 trillion yuan, down 0.9% year-on-year.
Among them, exports 1.22 trillion yuan, an increase of 2.9%; imports of 873 billion yuan, down 5.7%; trade surplus of 342.8 billion yuan, an increase of 34%.
Although the total value of imports and exports still fell year-on-year, there was an increase in export data, which is the fifth consecutive month of growth since March this year.
Shanghai police arrested more than 3,400 thieves in four months to crack down on 157 "stealing and cheating" gangs
At the same time as the case was solved, the police also recovered a total of more than 33 million yuan for stolen goods.
According to the confession of the members of the theft gang, they entered Shanghai from the field by bag by black car, then got off the car separately, and then closed the car several hours later, and then left Shanghai together.
In the course of the crime, the suspect often uses a building as a unit, using the external wall to climb, and breaking the anti-theft window fence from top to bottom.
Recently, the suspect involved in the case has been transferred by the Xuhui Public Security Bureau to the Xuhui District Procuratorate for review and prosecution.
The police remind the general public that when going out, they must lock the doors and windows in their homes, and for the choice of anti-theft windows, it is recommended that the public should choose steel with harder materials.
According to the Voice of China's "News Evening Summit" reported that in late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will go to Kenya to attend the sixth African Development Conference.
The Africa Development Conference is led by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, so the meeting will also be the first time to move to Africa.
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said that local meetings in Africa would help draw the attention of African and European countries to Japan.
In order to cooperate with Abe's visit, according to Kyodo News, the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan will send a parliamentary group to relevant countries.
It is no coincidence that Japan’s “normal” path began in the early 1990s, and the African Development Conference initiated by Japan also began in 1993!
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations, is an important ticket warehouse of the United Nations, Japan wants to "normal", how can Japan abandon Africa?
It will also exchange views with relevant people from various countries on the extremist organization "Islamic State" and countermeasures for terrorist activities.
The Western Group will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida recently explained his intentions at the UN Security Council on the Africa Development Conference.
Abe has announced here that for the stability of sub-Saharan African countries, he will provide 100 billion yen (about 6.1 billion yuan) of aid within five years.
Observers generally believe that Japan's generosity to Africa has always had two main purposes: one is to increase Japan's presence in Africa; the other is to win the support of African countries on the issue of entry.
Yang Bojiang, an expert on Japan, said, “From a political point of view, although Africa is lagging behind in relative development, the number of countries is relatively large, so Japan has always regarded it as the so-called ‘big ticket field’.”
In the future, Japan will not give up, and the work for Africa will not be terminated, and it will continue to strengthen.
In terms of economy, because Japan's production capacity is relatively strong, but the domestic market is relatively limited, especially in the context of the aging of the minority children, domestic demand is relatively sluggish.
However, from Junichiro Koizumi 10 years ago to Abe 10 years later, during which Japan has repeatedly launched a "sprint", but all returned.
Yang Bojiang, an expert on Japan, believes that Japan's usual intention is clear at a glance, but the road to normalcy is bound to be difficult.
To achieve its goals, Japan must first do a good job with its neighbors, among which Japan needs to have a correct attitude on issues of geopolitical competition and national disputes and historical understanding.

Traditional customs introduce new highlights of the opening of the "2016 Bolan Culture Festival" Hong Kong Victoria Park
The music of drumming, traditional snacks, fancy decorations, and crowded places.
The "2016 oyland culture festival" organized by the Hong Kong Tide Association was held in Victoria Park from 12 to 14th, which is the largest event in Hong Kong.
In addition to continuing the existing "squatting competition", it also adds the "parent-child basin for the base game" that the whole family can participate in.
Not only in the form of cartoons to introduce the cultural history of oylan, but also the oylan-themed 3D selfie area, traditional food area and traditional craft mobile classroom, etc., to attract many children and overseas people to experience the visit.
A couple from France stayed at the event for nearly three hours and experienced it in a mini-series mobile classroom.
"I found this special festival online, so I decided to come and see it, it felt very fresh."
They said that although France also has similar festivals to commemorate the ancestors, the atmosphere is very heavy, unlike here, there is music, food can also learn traditional craftsmanship.
“In such a busy financial metropolis as Hong Kong, we can also see such a large-scale and organized ceremony of worshipping ancestors.”
“This not only reflects the diversity of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to understand these traditional craftsmanship and pass on them.”
The President of the event, Hu Yansong, said, “We do not want to make the festival of the ylang culture so terrible that it is not easy to approach, especially children.”
"We hope that through the activities and layout of the young people on the site, we can let young people know that behind the ylang culture is filial piety and gratitude."
He also said that a total of 24 teams participated in the "squat-orphan competition", which not only had community organizations, but also cooperated with some schools to allow students to participate.

The enthusiasm of the Mexican audience impressed the white lady's play and the young actor.

Liu Yigui went to Sanya to investigate "double repair, two cities" to improve the level of urban construction management
On the morning of the 12th, Liu Yigui presided over a symposium and listened to the report on the promotion of the pilot work of "double repair" and "twin cities" in Sanya City and the opinions and suggestions of relevant departments.
Liu Yigui fully affirmed the phased results achieved in the pilot work and the good experiences and good practices created.
Liu Yigui stressed that Sanya should seize the opportunity of historical development, take the pilot work of "double repair" and "twin cities" as an important starting point, and give full play to the leading role of demonstration in the province's economic and social development.
It is necessary to play a leading role in improving the internationalization of international tourism islands, starting from the details, enriching international elements and creating international boutiques.
It is necessary to play a leading role in urban and rural integration and global tourism, accelerate the construction of characteristic towns, integrate tourism elements into each project, and build every village and town in Sanya into a tourist attraction.
It is necessary to play a leading role in the "100-day action on serving social investment", promote the construction of a number of major projects and parks, ensure the landing of high-quality projects, and implement the requirements of major actions.
Zhang Qi, Secretary of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Sanya Municipal Party Committee, Wang Lu, Vice Governor, and Lu Zhiyuan, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, participated in the research discussion.
In his 14-year career, Deng Yaping won 18 world championships, becoming the first person in the history of China to win four Olympic gold medals.
She has remained world No. 1 in table tennis for eight consecutive years and is the longest female athlete in the history of table tennis.
On September 26, 2010, he was Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Daily and General Manager of the People's Search Network Joint Stock Company, and a cadre at the head office level.
Recently, she and Yu Minhong will join hands to build the first domestic sports industry innovation and entrepreneurship platform.
There is also such a group of star coaches in the Chinese sports arena: they have unlimited scenery in the era of athletes and won countless glory for the country; after retirement, they will teach later generations and cultivate the winners.
As the first world champion of Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yubin chose to pick up the teaching whip after retiring.
From the women's team coach to the men's team coach to the head coach, Huang Yubin created a "Olympic gold team", and led the team in the Beijing Olympic Games to achieve 9 gold, 1 silver and 4 copper mythical record.
Since then, Tian Liang has been advertising endorsements, but in recent years played an important role in "cow", "Lei Feng" and so on.
A lot of NBA players have proven their strength. But if someone progresses, someone declines.
Whether it is due to age or limited playing time, there are some players who will regress every season.
Of course, some "regressions" may just be a shrinking of data, and the strength of these players may not be declining.
Even if Wade is still one of the best shooting guards in the league, his performance in the Bulls should not be as good as the Heat.
He and Ronda formed a limited range of backcourts, and when home star Butler's three-point shooting rate was only 32.8%, which would make their attack next season crowded.
Arriving in Wind City, the Flash is bound to give more of the ball to Butler and Ronda, and he is likely to choose health play in the regular season.
Okafor’s situation was more awkward, as the first choice for the 76ers last season, he had to compete with Simmons and Embiid for the new season and the ball.
This competition may not come soon, Simmons also need to adapt to the NBA arena, and Embid needs to fully recover from the injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafor can be in the 76-man long-term position is still a problem.
Last season, Okafor scored 32 percent from the lows, higher than Cousins, Vucevic and Brook Lopez, and his use rate is also high in the league's top 40.
With Simmons already showing excellent possession forward potential, Embiid also has a more suitable body for NBA games, Okafor's position is unlikely to be so stable.
Thompson’s usage has been steady in the top 20 of the league over the past two seasons, two of his best.
The problem is that with Durant’s arrival, Thompson’s usage is bound to decline, which is bound to affect his play.
This impact will not only be the impact of the number of shots, Tang God's ball attack will certainly be greatly reduced next season, which in some ways will also reduce the opponent's defensive difficulty.
Durant's arrival will certainly make the Warriors players data shrink, but the biggest of these is probably Thompson.
But that doesn’t mean Tang’s level of regress, which is more like he made sacrifices for the team as a whole.
Parker performed better than the numbers last season, not only because his basket efficiency came to the highest level of his career, but also because of his chemistry with Aldridge.
Duncan retired, Ginobili announced another year of fighting, the combination of GDP eventually came to an end, as the youngest of the three, the French sports car tank does not have much oil.
After securing a third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular-season MVPs than James, and Jordan was the only one with more FMVPs than James.
Well, James just brought Cleveland the first professional sports championship trophy in the last 52 years.
Coming to the 14th season of his career, James needed better assurance of physical strength to prepare for the playoffs.
Therefore, in the regular season, James's numbers are likely to decline further, and he will give more of the burden to Irving, but he will still easily become a top three player in the league.
“We must develop the talents we have learned from the country in Russia.”
On the 12th local time, Huang Jing, chairman of the Federation of Overseas Chinese in Moscow, said excitedly when he saw the reporter of China New Network.
Not long ago, she participated in the "Chinese Talent (Calligraphy, Painting) Training Course for Overseas Chinese Cultural Associations" sponsored by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council of China and hosted by Jinan University.
When I just participated in the training course, I did not know where to start with the calligraphy and painting, and the result was that after the training course, I was able to draw and write my own works.
After returning to Moscow, we must use the knowledge and skills we have learned to make our own contribution to the spread and promotion of Chinese culture.
At the same time, the Secretary-General of the Russian Chinese Cultural Association, Nayana Wei, who participated in this training course, felt the same way.
She said that she made great progress with the help of the teacher in the training course, and also felt the heavy responsibility of being an overseas communicator of Chinese culture.

Britain won silver in seven-a-ers-ball rugby and Fiji won gold.
In Thursday night's seven-a-side rugby final, the British team failed to extend their previous stellar performance in front of Fiji, which was beaten 43-7 by Fiji at Rio's Theodoro Stadium.
Fiji won the gold medal with an impeccable performance in possession, steal, avoidance, cooperation, running and strength, which is the country's first-ever Olympic medal.
The silver medal was also a no small consolation for the defeated British team, the third silver medal won by the British delegation on the same day. This result was enough to make the English rugby team proud: they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa all the way to the sevens rugby tournament for their first time at the Olympic Games.
Earlier in the day, Britain narrowly defeated South Africa 7-5, which may have affected their form in the final.
But in any case, the current Fiji team is enough to beat a full-fledged 15-man team.
Tomorrow, at least one Briton will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort to the British team, but it may not be. This Englishman is Fiji head coach Ben Ryan from Wimbledon, who has served as head coach of the British team.
It is not easy for the British team to achieve today's results.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's management, they did not win the Adélide international sevens rugby.
Now they are one step away from the championship.
Although they have been hit hard, they have also made amazing progress.
Fiji's opening had an advantage, leaving the British team without strength.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like hitting a series of moving buses. By the time Ossie Colliniso stormed into the corner flag, the World Series championship team was already well ahead by 5-0.
Just four minutes into the game, Jerry Tuhuai scored again on the right-wing touchdown.
At 22-0, the British team barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's strong interception left Giant's-sized Lyonnakalava without a third score, but it only slowed Fiji's score.
At seven minutes, Yasa Weilemaru was in the right corner. At 17-0, the British team made it worse.
Nakalawa scored another point, and the game... had one minute left in the first half.
Then, Watmo Lawowo broke through the British defense and went straight to the scoring line.
At half-time, the score was 29-0.
It’s as if the Fijians were born to play seven-a-side rugby, and the British team is still in the making.
That is the case.
The British made a huge change in the second half and punched the Fijians' defence for the full four minutes, a performance that was good in the first half. But then Fiji played a brilliant match, with Joshua Tuesova scoring again.
Dan Norton, who created the scoring opportunity for the British team, was in the left corner, changing the score to 36-7, but the game was already under the control of the South Sea Island, and their fans were singing, waving flags and singing and dancing on the platform.
The Fijian team's wonderful performance made people have to clap their hands.
Matta Willem stopped a no-show attack from Fiji at the last minute.
The final whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged together, and the defeated British team could only regret leaving.
Earlier in the day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, while Britain narrowly defeated South Africa in a bitter semi-final matchup.
Kyle Brown helped South Africa take the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with a brilliant footwork.
After that, Marcus Watson, the brother of England's Anthony, secured the team's victory with a brilliant interception, and eventually England won the silver medal.
Helen Graff and Heather Steinen, inspired by cancer-damaged coaches, win rowing gold medal
It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most exciting gold medal.
From the first paddle to now, Helen Graff and Heather Steining have received 220 punitive pull trainings, and the gold medal they won at Estacio da Lagoa has even more extraordinary significance.
Although only the two of them were paddled, there was another person on board – coach Robin Williams – whose voice had been accompanied by their impact on the second consecutive women’s double paddle Olympic gold medal, the first British rowing women’s team to reach that height.
They have a 39-match record and an absolute advantage.
What we see is these two talented athletes moving gracefully on the water, but that’s not all there is to this victory.
Behind every rowing gold medal there are many people who volunteer to help, and it is their constant dedication that creates a difference, and the biggest help is a coach who learned that he has cancer 30 months ago and does not know whether he can live to see this day.
As he said, death can come at any time.
I had bladder cancer and they had surgery for me.
Without surgery, the cancer cells spread throughout the body.
In this way, the situation will be much worse.
This will change your opinion a little.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he started treatment in early 2014 to minimize the impact, although it may not be appropriate to say so in this case.
I need to get paid, so I need to get better.
This is an incentive for me.
I was in the hospital, and although they said a few steps would be enough, I walked around the ward every time I walked 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet.
This is the starting point of everything.
Rowing is a journey in itself, and that makes it a little longer.
At the moment of winning the gold, they first thought of Williams. This morning's Williams was slightly chatter than usual, in order to overcome his anxiety.
Stein, who was the head of the Royal Artillery team, will travel to Afghanistan after that, she said: "I am in a bad mood this week, it may be a little extreme, but this gold medal is really meaningful."
It repeatedly tells me how important it is to me and how hard I, Helen and Robin have put in.
It was a three-year reward for Helen, Robin and me.
Without Robin, we would be no-little, thank you very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I can’t possibly find a better trainer and coach than him.
Helen Graff and Heather Steinen have not lost in five years.
The punishment set by the combination is unmatched by their opponents.
Even in the last 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Steining and Graff still had a lot of physical reserves.
It was a thrilling time.
Helen said, “Keep the pace, keep the pace.”
Not being influenced by an opponent is very important.
We had a good start, and we weren’t expecting anything to do.
We didn’t think about the glory today, we just wanted to peg every paddle and win this game, and we did.
It took the group a year to decide their future.
Graff will marry TV explorer Steve Bakshar next month.
But now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don’t want to say this is my last game.
This will put too much pressure on me.
It took me about six months in London to realize I was an Olympic champion.
It was a whole new experience and I was very nervous.
It has now been about 4 minutes.
She said, "I feel better."

Bulgaria sees first inflation in eight months
National statistics show that the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest inflation rate in several years (since June 2012). After October last year (inflation rate of 0.2%), inflation exceeded zero for the first time.
The average annual inflation rate (as measured by the Consumer Price Index) for the previous 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) was -0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016).
Compared with June 2016, the consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0%, which is the monthly inflation rate of 1.0%.
The inflation rate so far this year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) is -0.2%. Compared to July 2015, the annual inflation rate in July 2016 is -0.2%.
Compared with the previous month, the prices of the following categories of consumer goods increased in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), and other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, home appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%), medical (0.1%).
The same as last month’s prices were alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, natural gas and other fuels, communications, education.
Snapchat's 'anime' effect is accused of satirizing Asians
Snapchat says the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers believe it is racially colored.
Snapchat’s 150 million everyday users can change reality and make people funny through its filtering tools.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
These lenses have the effect of passivation and bending characteristics, producing more than 30 million modified selfies every day.
Any mistake will immediately be noticed by the public.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized for being agitated for black people or for being beautiful with white skin.
So when the app this week provided some users with a filter that could create the effects of slanted eyes, teeth and pink faces, some critics called it a racial satire on the “yellow race” of Asians.
They even think that these recurring problems mean that the company has big problems with diversity.
After Snapchat said it had removed the feature, reports from The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday sparked outrage.
The company’s explanation: The filter is a tribute to anime characters, not a satire of Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the hurtful stereotypes of reality.
Others are also strongly opposed to these images.
A Korean-American art student who tweeted about the photos and was widely shared said in an email that the filters were “at least uncomfortable and uncomfortable.”
She added: “It is difficult to distinguish between the extremely disgusting image of Asian satire and the effect of the filter.”
Although the filter is not only yellow people, the yellow species are extremely devalued.
Snapchat isn’t the only company that has touched the bottom line of these cultures.
From the corporate board to Hollywood and the devices we carry, American culture seems to have always advocated diversity and inclusion.
Snapchat’s large young population may be sensitive because it is more racially diverse than the older generation.
When one of Snapchat’s filters captured the image of insulting users, 25-year-old Zhu Katie said in an interview on Thursday: “It’s harder to get out of sight than it used to be.”
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes the racial controversy reflects Snapchat’s lack of racial diversity in the hiring process.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company’s employees for being mostly white, with leadership all male and putting a hashtag at the end of the article: #DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese-American, Ms. Zhu said, “Either they don’t have a variety of people in their workforce, so they can make that decision, or they have some people of color in their workforce, but their positions don’t make them speak freely.”
Other observers shared complaints that she had not been responded to by Snapchat.
The company does not release data on employee diversity and says it is a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the ethnic background of its employees, but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on the lower proportion of people inside and promote internal inclusion.
Ms. Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account: "I wonder if they need more users like us who oppose this."
Congressional panel says military officials have distorted ISIS intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel said officials at U.S. Central Command had changed the intelligence report to describe the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than it actually was.
The midterm report comes from a special task force formed by the Republican chair of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the House Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee. The report said there was "widespread dissatisfaction" among the intelligence analysts at Central Command who said their superiors were tampering with their assessment of the U.S. war with the Islamic State.
The Central Command (Centcom) in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news report on the report, “intelligence vetted by the senior leadership of Central Command is more optimistic about the description of U.S. counterterrorism operations than it is, and has always been more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies.”
A Republican representative for California said, “Central Command’s behavior is unacceptable. On one side, our fighters are suffering from war, and on the other, top policymakers are getting the wrong analysis.”
The issue of leadership at Central Command has been extended to the highest levels of the agency.
The report details Central Command’s long-standing problems in describing and analyzing U.S. training of Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered changes to the reports, according to the report’s description, the analysts felt pressured from CENTCOM leaders to give a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
“In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimony were far more optimistic than they actually were,” the report said.
For example, a Central Command official has publicly said it could take a major military operation to retake Mosul as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, is still under Islamic State control.
Mike Pompeo, the Republican representative for Kansas, said in a statement: “After months of investigation, this result is clear.”
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most of the top intelligence officers at U.S. Central Command controlled the command’s intelligence products and concealed the threat from the Islamic State in Iraq.
After the Republican Party learned from analysts that intelligence about the Islamic State had been manipulated, it set up a task force.
As the investigation continues, more will be found following the report released on Thursday.
The Attorney General of the Ministry of Defence has also conducted a lengthy investigation into Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their findings on Thursday, in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
Sheanda, the committee’s Democratic leader, said in a statement that Central Command’s intelligence assessment of Islamic State and Iraqi peacekeeping forces developed an overly narrow process between 2014 and 2015.
Mr. Sheanda said the process “fails the release of intelligence,” degrades the analyst’s morale and “cannot accept different opinions.”
But Mr. Xie and Democrats also said they found no evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on Central Command analysts, and that their conclusions were in line with “presets or political narratives.”
The Daily Beast reported the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon’s attorney general began an investigation after receiving a complaint from a Central Command analyst.
Pentagon spokesman Navy Maj. Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report until the attorney general's investigation was completed.
But he said: “Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security topics.”
The impact of the investigation has outweighed the success of the U.S.-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria, which is claimed by a growing number of Defense Department officials.
But last year, those claims raised questions about the extent to which President Barack Obama could trust Central Command’s assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of a controversy more than a decade ago, when Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Hook wrote a research paper in which George W. Bush’s administration insisted on sending small troops to Iraq despite the opposition of numerous analysts and making little consideration of what happened after the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooke played a key role in this campaign against intelligence about the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said Mr. Hook’s team had concluded that airstrikes targeting Islamic State refineries did not significantly reduce the economic revenue of the terror group, which built temporary refineries to continue selling oil on the black market, in stark contrast to the announcement.
According to a September report in Time, Central Command did not disclose the findings.
Central Command Commander Lloyd Austin III was criticized last year after multiple lawyers reviewed Senate testimony about an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and is currently replaced by Joseph Waterl from his position at Central Command.
The U.S. won four straight games in women's hockey and will win a tie-de-break with Britain.
Katie Bam, who won the 6-1 victory over Japan, took the lead twice for the U.S. women's hockey team on Thursday, helping the U.S. team beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games was a thrilling four, but the 27-year-old Bam said she didn’t know she had done so well.
She said, "I don't know anything about it."
I’m not the kind of person who remembers to have scored a few goals.
What she knows is that the U.S. has won four in a row at the Olympics and will be in the group with the British team, which won a 2-0 win over Japan on Thursday, to the top of the group.
The United Kingdom and the United States met narrowly in the final match of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams advance to the quarter-finals, which will decide who will appear as group first.
The team that finished first in the group would avoid a strong Dutch team, which would be able to go further. The Dutch team qualified as the first in another group.
In Saturday's game, the U.S. team performed a miracle with a stunning performance. Know that at the London Olympics four years ago, the U.S. team was at the bottom of 12 teams.
Bam was also in that team at the time.
Bam grew up in Brubel, Pennsylvania, first picked up a hockey stick at the age of 3 (her twin sister worked in the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team to date.
Failing to make the final list, she missed the 2008 Olympics.
In 2012, she and her teammates were not well-received.
The following year, Briton Craig Panham was head coach and everything started to change.
“This is a cultural, mindset and substantive change,” Bam said.
We were not at our current level in London.
We came here with a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam took the lead in the first half with a close-range backhand shot.
India has not yet tasted the result in this tournament, but the team has shown amazing tenacity and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam broke out.
She took the ball to the left side of the court and then cut it into the middle and pumped into the net, with the U.S. leading 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Bridges scored a goal for the first time in the tournament, scoring one goal each in the first three victories.
This time she played very often.
Bam as well.
Panam said: "We are in good shape now" but exactly how good it will be depends on the result of Saturday's game.
Chilled food during the Great Depression.
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had just been elected president, sat in the president's office for lunch.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt loved Fifth Avenue delicacies such as foie gras and Maryland stewed waterfish.
On that day, his menu was very simple: ketchup devil eggs, mashed potatoes and pudding as a snack.
Jane Zigman said, “This is to share the pain with the people who are suffering in food.”
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It also reflects the way Americans eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Mr. Coe’s last book, “Frying Chop,” was about Chinese food in the United States, and Ms. Zigman told the lives of slum tenants through food in her book 97 Orchards.
Their new book, The Great Meal, will be published Tuesday by Harper, about the history of food in the United States during the Great Depression.
After showing some common insights on food, they met a reporter at the sandwich shop in Eisenberg. The simple lunch counter in the iron district has been open since 1929 when the economy collapsed.
Ms. Ziegman, 54, ordered a cream cheese with a crushed olive sandwich, while Mr. Ko, 57, ordered a platter of turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The reporter ordered a baking roll, and the couple thought the dishes were appropriate to discuss the Depression-era diet.
Ms. Zigman said, “Bread was very popular at the time.”
At that time, there was peanut bread, liver bread, and soybean bread.
They are all made with a raw material and a cheap topping that can be poured on the raw material.
Imagine that your dinner is all peanuts.
Mr. Co. has been a strange.
He said, "They must be like lead in your stomach."
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, Americans were buffets, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cooks for the men’s farm workers, and breakfast, lunch and dinner are just out of the pie.
During World War I, it was the Americans who gave food to hungry Europeans. The Massade records how the country suddenly ceased to be a rich place.
Mr. Coe explained why he and his wife were writing the book: “At the time, food had become a major topic of displeasure for Americans.”
Another unpleasant topic is shabby new foods: “fascination foods” such as bread and steweds are the main course, and stew is “the best way to cook leftovers,” says Ms. Zigman, because chefs can use the cream in the sauce to cover up the indefatigable ingredients.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat that has been the protagonist on the American table for years has become a rare luxury.
The strange hodgepodge only considers calories, and the first thing people think about is nutrition than taste or even basic cooking knowledge.
In the course of her research into the book, including various recipes, Ms. Zigman produced a baked onion stuffed with peanut oil.
Mr. Ko said, "This is not common at dinner tables."
Ms. Zigman said: “It’s too strange.”
Peanut oil and roasted onions simply cannot be matched.
This is a characteristic of many family meals.
Family economists influenced the country’s eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as head chefs at the Federal Office for the Family Economics from 1923 to 1943, a historically unique experience.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to “finish” and have the courage to turn bad foods like creamy pasta into gourmet foods.
The Great Dinner is a “historical taste.”
Of particular interest is the government’s response to the hungry, such as the president’s citizen Herbert Hoover’s “I can’t handle other people’s affairs.”
Although he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse as a child, his diet was as delicate as a millionaire.
Mr. Ke said: "He likes to eat European Western food, such as fish with cucumber sauce."
He wore an evening dress and ate in a gilded restaurant.
He was clearly out of the people.
If his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example in his diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As the book puts it, Ms. Roosevelt hired housekeepers have no interest in taste, so the White House “food is not only the hardest food in Washington, but the worst food to cook.”
As soon as the United States returned to normal, many of the cooking methods of the Great Depression were abandoned.
What is left, Ms. Zigman said, is our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they learned more about Ms. Zigman’s mother’s eating habits, such as how she doesn’t throw away food.
Mr. Coe said, "She was very afraid of wasting food."
Ms. Zigman recalled, “She actually made many people sick.”
For example, there was a "cream puff" incident.
After removing the plate, she and Mr. Coe brought out a dessert they had prepared at home: the fruit-potendic pudding that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
Ms. Zigman said: "This is called creamy fruit, and added that the name of a new trend for an ordinary dish is a "customary trick".
There is no cream in this dessert, only fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone is trying to get into the sticky brown paste.
Surprisingly, the dessert tastes good.
Mr. Ke ate the second and third spoons.
He felt that it was an acceptable and affordable dessert, and told his wife, "It would be better to add a broken walnut."
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, and Saudi Arabia's production reached a new high.
The report does not prohibit the market from doubting the credibility of OPEC, and the road to oil price recovery is likely to remain full of thorns.
On Monday, OPEC’s rotating chairman and Qatari energy minister, Saada, said the organization would hold an informal meeting on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
OPEC's monthly report on Wednesday showed that the entire OPEC organization, including Gabon, rose 46,000 barrels per day in July to 33.11 million barrels per day.
OPEC also said in its monthly report that low crude prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil, increasing the extent of the market's oversupply.
Affected by this news, coupled with the increase in crude oil production expectations and the unexpected increase in crude oil inventories in the United States, international oil prices have fallen for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday’s close, light crude oil futures for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2.48 percent, while London Brent crude futures for October delivery fell 2.07 percent.
Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of oil-producing countries is unlikely to significantly tighten supply, and the data released by the US Energy Information Agency also weighs on market sentiment.
Iran's official news agency, Fars, quoted Iran's oil minister as saying on Wednesday that Iran's daily crude oil production was as high as 3.85 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
As soon as the news of the meeting was held, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said that there is no need for a new round of freeze negotiations under oil prices.
The last meeting of producers was in April, and OPEC members failed to reach an agreement on any measures.
Emma Richards, oil and gas analyst at BMI Research, said markets and the media could overreact to the OPEC meeting.
Helima Croft, head of commodities strategy at the Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC had changed the mood by sending a signal that they would broker a deal.
This method is like a smoke and mirror that leads to people's eyes (deliberately giving the wrong impression).
Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank, said the likelihood of OPEC trying to stabilize the market through the September meeting was low.
This is likely to further undermine the market confidence in OPEC, after all, the organization staged a "wolf."
All localities should focus on medical institutions that have posted medical advertisements, complaints and reports in violation of the law, and have been punished many times in the past.
The National Health and Family Planning Commission and the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine will organize the supervision of the special supervision and inspection work in some provinces in a timely manner.
According to media disclosure, due to the large-scale influx of capital into Internet medicine, the current problem of product homogenization is serious, the investment boom is gradually receding, and capital has entered a wait-and-see period.
According to the Hong Kong Alipi Hospital Management Research Center, a large number of Internet medical companies have died within a year of business, and about 20% of the start-up Internet medical companies have ceased to exist.
However, as most Internet medical companies struggle with the financing of round A or B, there are several leading companies in the subdivision field that can still get capital.
It seems that Internet medical entrepreneurship can not be "a swarm", but to see the market demand, sink the heart to do special, do deep.
Yue Yue invested 1200.00 million yuan, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, and Kyushu Tong Equipment Company invested 1800.00 million yuan, accounting for 60% of the registered capital.
In recent years, with the country's policy support in medical information, electronic and integrated supply chain management systems have gradually entered hospitals at all levels.
The cooperation between Yue Yue and Kyushu Tong is aimed at the needs of the market, helping hospitals to build advanced supply chain management systems, and taking this opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet medical companies, iBaby has been focusing on the Internet obstetric vertical from the beginning, cultivating the two ends of the pregnant mother and the doctor.
Pregnant mothers can not only free 24-hour and one-on-one doctor consultation, but also pay for targeted medical consultations.
On the doctor's side, iBaby breaks the geographical restrictions by organizing experts to conduct online lectures, peer exchanges, case discussions and other micro-lectures for grass-roots doctors.
At present, doctors have opened three sections, namely, doctor continuing education, doctor socialization and doctor seeking help.
Provide services including online learning, case discussion, academic exchanges; social platforms between doctors in the same hospital and departments; legal aid and entrepreneurial support required for doctor-patient relationships or personal life.
According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently said that Ali Health is "willing to sink down" to take the big data of health.
Internet companies and data companies lack professionalism, and the writing methods on the same terms cannot be unified.
Ali's current layout in the field of medical and health is divided into three parts, namely Ali Health, Tmall Medical Museum and Alipay Future Hospital.
Wang Lei admitted that medical health entrepreneurship will be more difficult than other industries, "this is not only how much money, but also to sink down, to endure loneliness slowly to do."
Staying up late to watch Olympic events is easy to damage the heart
The Brazilian Olympic Games are in full swing, and even if the event is broadcast in the middle of the night in China, many citizens will stay up late to watch.
In this regard, the doctor specially reminded that there are health risks in staying up late to watch the event, which may cause cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up late for a long time, the hormone will still be a lot of secretion, the human body will continue to be in a state of tension and excitement, can not get a normal recovery, easy to cause blood vessel contraction, blood pressure rise, resulting in cardiovascular disease.
Han Zhiyuan especially reminded that groups with cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipids, smoking habits, and family history will be more likely to cause cardiovascular disease if they stay up late.
If you stay up late for a long time, not only the cardiovascular function is affected, but also the gastrointestinal function, the immune system, and the neuroendocrine system will be affected, and even the risk of tumors will increase.
For elderly friends, Han Zhiyuan suggested that try not to stay up late in order to watch the Olympic Games, especially for groups with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last "World Cup" football tournament, Han Zhiyuan had received a patient in his 60s, whose myocardial infarction was triggered or related to staying up late to watch the game.
Han Zhiyuan introduced that since this year, its department has treated some patients with myocardial infarction or stroke around the age of 25, which is largely caused by the patient's long-term lifestyle.
Do not stay up late every day, occasionally stay up late to watch favorite sports, other projects may wish to wait for the next day to watch the replay of the event.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union brought missiles into Cuba, which almost led to nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.
The incident is seen as the culmination of the Cold War, known as the Cuban Missile Crisis.
What is less well known, however, was that a strong solar storm, also during the Cold War, led to a nuclear war by the United States against the Soviet Union, an event that was not first announced by researchers until August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused intense interference with U.S. military radar and radio communications in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the U.S. ballistic missile early warning system for monitoring Soviet missiles.
The paper, completed by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed U.S. military personnel involved in forecasting and analyzing solar activity at the time, and consulted the unclassified literature.
In the 1960s, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly launching a nuclear war, the US Air Force always had a part of a fighter with a nuclear warhead flying in the sky.
The U.S. military commander did not know that the cause of the disturbance was the solar storm, not the Soviet Union, and ordered the aircraft to be put into combat readiness.
Fortunately, the U.S. military’s study of solar activity and its electromagnetic interference with Earth, which began in the late 1950s, ultimately prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he aggregated the information provided by the Air Weather Service of the United States Air Force and submitted a detailed report.
As a direct result of the solar storm, the U.S. military has since made space weather a combat concern and has built a more robust space weather forecasting system.
In the daily travel, the public found that the car was hindered by strange vehicles, in the case of contact with the driver of unfamiliar vehicles, you can use the "WeChat mobile car" function to solve this problem.

On the other hand, for owners who refuse to move cars, park illegally or obstruct traffic, Xi'an Traffic Management Department said that the traffic police will take different disposal measures according to the actual situation and deal with them according to the situation.

On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly released a new version of the "Meanseo and Japanese Defense Cooperation Guidelines" in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role in the world.
This is the day of U.S. Secretary of Defense Carter, U.S. Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and Japanese Defense Minister Nakagawa attended a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth time that a Chinese private think tank has published a Japanese military assessment report, and it is also the fourth time that the English version has been launched.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including overall policy adjustment, military strength, defense budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, institutional reform, military training exercises, foreign military security cooperation, and military security relations with China.
The report said that 2015 is the end of the year when the Abe government has promoted major policy adjustments in the security field for several consecutive years.
Since then, Japan's measures in the field of security will mainly be in the operational level of the rule of law, strategic implementation and policy implementation, rather than the substantial adjustment and changes of frameworks, mechanisms and policies.
The report emphasizes that the Abe cabinet has tried to achieve multiple purposes through the above three breakthroughs to promote Japan's "normal nationalization", the Self-Defense Forces to go out and intervene in international security affairs, strengthen the Japan-US alliance, and prevent China and China.
Previously, the China Strategic Culture Promotion Association released the Japanese military assessment report on June 5, 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014, and June 30, 2015.

Complementing the shortcomings of public sports facilities
The black coal farm warehouse has become a "green grass" football field; the red brick spire factory has become a modern sports hall.
On the National Fitness Day, the Nan Lok Ma camp sports and cultural park outside the Wangjiangmen Gate in Hangzhou unveiled the mysterious veil.
Once a coal farm, it has been idle since it was closed more than a decade ago, leaving behind a large number of illegal buildings and domestic waste.
After the rectification, it has become a sports and cultural park, and will be officially opened to the public in November, providing free sports venues to the public, and undoubtedly opening up a new fertile ground for national sports.
This is reminiscent of Hangzhou Chen Jinglong Sports School, the Chinese swimming world "Wangpu Military Academy" swam out of many world champions.
The name of the swimming world will continue to emerge, vividly interpreting the relationship between competitive sports and national sports - a rich mass base provides good conditions for the selection of professional players.
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of national sports, which depends on the national sports in a certain sense, and the national sports depends on the conditions of the venue.
According to reports, as of 2015, China's per capita stadium area, although it is 150 times that of the founding of New China, is still far behind the sports power.
In June this year, the State Council issued the National Fitness Plan (2016-2020), which will focus on the development of mass sports.
In order to make up for this short board, on the one hand, the relevant departments should fully consider the layout of the sports venues when carrying out urban planning.
On the other hand, the public sports venues that have been built, including sports venues in schools and other units, should be opened as much as possible and the use efficiency should be as much as possible.
At present, the Rio Olympic Games are in full swing, which has stimulated people's enthusiasm for sports and also awakened everyone's awareness of participation.
Gilead Gets Lawyer's Fee in Fight Against Merck's Hepatitis C Patents
According to the U.S. District Judge’s decision, Gillesight is entitled to attorneys’ fees incurred in a hepatitis C patent lawsuit with the U.S. company Merck Group.
In June, after a U.S. judge found Merck guilty of wrongdoing, including perjury and other unethical conduct, Gilles is exempt from paying $200 million in damages for Gilead’s best-selling drugs, Sofosbuvir and Havoni, in violation of two of Merck’s patents.
In Thursday’s lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Beth Lambosohn Freeman said Gilead did not have to bear the costs incurred in the defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gillard, which dominates the new generation of hepatitis C drug markets. Gilled's drug can cure more than 90 percent of hepatitis patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, both claiming to be the active ingredient in Gilead’s drug, the lab work owner of Sofibbwe.
U.S.-backed forces announce they have recaptured Manbij from Islamic State
A force spokesman said on Friday that all remaining Islamic State soldiers in the city had left and that U.S.-backed forces had taken full control of the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border.
After the militants who were hiding in the city left, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping the city.
Sharan Darwish of the Syrian Democratic Forces military council in Manbij told Reuters they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians abducted by militants.
He told Reuters: "Manbij is now under our control, but we are still carrying out the sweep."
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a 34.2 percent federal tax.
Hillary Clinton released her 2105-year-old tax returns on Friday showing the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a 34.2 percent federal tax.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable donations, most of which went to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton’s speech fee reached nearly $5.3 million, while the former secretary of state earned $3 million from publishers Simon & Schuster with a book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton’s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holden, have released a 10-year tax return.
The couple paid a 20.3 percent federal tax in 2015.
Clinton's campaign aide, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement: "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine will continue to be benchmarks for financial transparency."
In stark contrast, Donald Trump has covered up and retracted his previous promise to release his tax returns on false grounds.
Although the law does not require it, by convention, U.S. presidential candidates should disclose their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyers used the IRS audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams tweeted that you were in charge and attached a link to the Democratic candidate’s tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump’s special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release his tax returns until the audit was complete.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said Trump’s refusal to release tax returns raised questions about his net worth, charitable donations, business deals and various other relationships, including with Russia.
Clinton seized the issue to lash out, posting an online video on Friday that highlighted high-profile Democrats urging Trump to release his tax payments.
She raised the issue Thursday in a speech on economic policy in Michigan.
She told the crowd, “For decades, he refused to publish his tax returns, like other presidential candidates.”
Trump paid virtually no taxes in the 1990s for two years, according to Politico, a business columnist for The New York Times, citing a number of tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, all of whom said the situation may still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a major problem in the presidential race.
Clinton named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who gave the honor of Warren Buffett, a pledge to pay at least 30 percent tax on people earning more than $1 million a year.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire Hathaway is based, at which Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also being audited by the IRS and that Trump was “scared” not by the tax authorities but by voters.
The earliest tax returns published by the Clinton campaign were in 2007.
The Clintons, who are currently living in Chabaak, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and a combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, they earn as little as $100.
Their main investment is a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons have a dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli phone code at 'required' Arab customer - Reuters News
A French filmmaker with Jewish blood told the media that the Kempinski Hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli phone code, and the hotel staff said that this was in accordance with the "requirement" of Arab customers, which caused an uproar.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, expressed his disappointment at the Kempinski Hotel and published an open letter in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
During your recent stay, Longzman wanted to find Israel on the hotel's list of phone codes.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can talk directly from the room.
Did Israel disappear in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany?
Rhonemann wrote.
Instead, guests can call Israel through the Kempinski Hotel’s call center.
In an attempt to find an explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel’s front desk.
In the letter, Mr. Langzman said he received the answer at the front desk “shocked him.”
Hotel staff said it was “a deliberate decision made by the management of Kempinski Hotels.”
The reason for this made the filmmaker even more angry.
Mr. Lanzmann quoted the employee as saying: Most of our guests were Arabs who demanded the removal of the Israeli code.”
According to the Sødden newspaper, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas Handelsmann, called the incident a “shame.”
We were surprised to learn of this incident.
That in itself is a great shame.
And it is even more embarrassing to happen in Germany and the hotel chain.
There is no need for any explanation.
“We hope that the hotel will come to the right conclusion,” the official said.
The incident sparked a heated debate online, which everyone thought was a scandal.
Some people think that the Kempinski Hotel is simply "chelling" to meet the demands of Arab customers.
Another post pointed directly to the hotel as “unscredible” and noted that the street on the famous Kudamm Street was near a synagogue.
According to Der Spiegel, the hotel quickly clarified all the allegations, claiming that everything was “negligent” and “apologizing” to Longzeman.
The Sød daily quoted Kempinski as saying: “There has never been a direct order to remove Israel from the speed dialing list.”
The newspaper also said the Israeli code had been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with police as they protested against the reform of the government’s public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to deport protesters.
The incident was caused by law enforcement officials trying to disperse the students, so the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the march to express their displeasure with the programs.
To save money, St. Paul’s state governor, Orkmin, plans to close 100 public schools and transfer 300,000 students.
Some of the students who took part in the protest expressed their displeasure with interim President Michel Temer through graffiti on the wall.
Just days before the most recent protest, protesters took to the streets in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the nation’s Senate.
Scottish cyclist Carle Skinner returned after winning the gold medal in cycling.
Scottish cyclist Carle Skinner helped the British trio successfully defend their Olympic gold medals after the 2012 London Olympics at the Rio men's team race last night.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist has replaced his fellow Scotch, Sir Chris Hoy, as the centre of the team. Even the legendary cyclist was proud when the young Skinner beat the favourite New Zealand and returned with a reputation.
Four years ago, the British team made a splash, and Hoy won the fifth of six individual Olympic gold medals.
The British team was only sixth at the World Cycling Field Championships in London in March, and Hoy has since retired. The British team then made another brilliant run.
During the Beijing Olympics to the London Games, the problem for the British team was to replace the "first lap expert" Jamie Stav.
The team did just that when Sinders showed up.
Hoy’s retirement also leaves a void, and both Chien Imadi and Matt Crampton want to fill that gap.
After seeing the potential of Skinner, the British men's coaching staff insisted that he be selected for the national team, and Skinner eventually lived up to expectations.
Skinner was paired by Sics and Kenny, who won the gold medal with Hoy four years ago. The trio set an Olympic record in the qualifying round, but was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
The three British cycling races eventually defeated their opponents and won the gold medal.
Although Sics was slightly behind, Kenny took the lead for the team, and Skinner kept that lead to the end.
The change in strategy was key to this reversal, with Sindez opting for the larger flywheel, which was slower, and that allowed Kenny, and Scanner in particular, to maintain the speed.
Hoy watched the match as a BBC commentator. Skinner, Kenny and Sindes saw him on the podium.
Glasgow cyclist Skinner, 23, said: "It flatters me."
I just did my best to make myself famous.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It's unbelievable.
There is nothing better than this victory.
After winning gold with Kenny and Hoy at the 2012 London Olympics, Sinders admitted to deliberately falling on the track under poor start.
He later retracted the comments, and the opponents of the British team could not appeal.
This victory has no such problems.
"It's like London, the British flag on the platform," Sindez said.
We were just in the team three months ago.
We’ve lost a lot of world champions, so it’s amazing to be able to defend the Olympic champion.
This is only a competition and a gold medal for the British team that won seven of the 10 venue cycling gold medals at the Beijing Olympic Games and the London Olympic Games.
If this is a sign of the progress we have made over the past five months, we will continue to be successful in the bike gallery over the next five days.
Based on Kenny's performance, it is not impossible for him to reproduce Hoy's feat of winning three gold medals at an Olympic Games.
If that’s the case, he’s 12 years younger than Hoy and also on March 23 (a day that seems to be a sacred day for British sport, where Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) Kenneth, who was born, will have six gold and one silver medal.
This achievement is the same as that of Hoy.
Kenny will play in the three-day race that begins today.
The 28-year-old Bolton said: “I will be focusing on this game for the time being.
The team is always the best.
You can win games with your teammates.
Frankly, a person wins a little lonely.
Hinds said: "If he can win the other two gold medals, then he should be awarded the title of the Jazz."
It was the only game of the day to produce a medal, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Douer advanced to the four-man four-kilometre team pursuit with the fastest result.
The score was 351.943.
The world record for the 2012 London Olympics gold medalist is 351.659.
The first and final (10:42 p.m.) will be held today at the second tournament, and Wiggins will undoubtedly be the focus of attention.
Yesterday he had a dispute with the tournament official before the qualifying round, when the race officer asked him to measure his height.
In the women’s group competition, which will end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rossel Chand, Eleanor Barker and Kate Archibald from Mirguet qualified with a new world record of 413.260.
The British team relied on the powerful cycling team of its venues to take the initiative in the middle of the Olympic Games and won many medals.
After showing its absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British Cycling team was a little disappointed when it went to Rio.
There have been many twists and turns, including April’s resignation of technical director Sean Sutton over sexist and bullying allegations and the retirement of legends such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first race night in the bike hall is enough to prove that the British team will once again stage the legend of the peak of the key moment.
After the little life comes into this world, parents are responsible for this life, which is not only responsible for the health of the child, but also in the development of the spirit, that is, education.
If the child's education fails, then even if the career is successful, it will not make up for the shortcomings of life and the failure of the family.
When a new life comes, new parents spend time and effort to care for and educate their children.
And responsible, in addition to the body's care, let them be healthy, but also in the spiritual education, that is, let the children learn how to be human, how to adults, how to succeed.

Parents' words and deeds will affect the child's growth, they will imitate their parents, that is, people often say that dragons and dragons, phoenixes, mice's sons will play holes, and what kind of children parents are like.
Therefore, parents need to be a good example in front of their children, standardize their words and deeds, and cultivate their own excellent character, which can indirectly help the child to shape a good temperament and make him better.
Amy is a smart and pretty girl.
She is extra-troverted and lively, can get along well with her friends, and has good adaptability to the environment.
But Amy has a little secret in her heart: she can’t focus on the learning and work tasks she’s going to do for a long time.
This secret has been with Amy for a long time. The problem is not serious.
Even through decentralized, modular time to learn and work, she can basically complete tasks and achieve good results.
But when the task was heavy and time was tight, Amy felt very pain and tormented.
The individual’s resistance to self-exposure and his emotional experience is designed not to put the individual’s self-knowledge and self-esteem at risk.
There are also some behaviorist psychologists who understand impedance as the disobedience of individuals to correct their behavior.
I tried to get Amy to do an exercise to calm herself down by breathing and relax, to feel the orgy.
Once out of that trapped situation, she felt herself relaxed and regained her freedom.
Han, a 63-year-old wanderer, had an argument with another homeless man Xiao after drinking and killed him with a knife.
Han said that before the crime, he and the homeless Xiao lived on the ground in a hutong in the Dongcheng District, and the two were more than 20 meters apart.

Original title: 2000 chickens from a farm in Jiangsu were sentenced to prison by the court for unauthorised sale by the owner of the yard
After the judgment came into effect, because Li did not automatically fulfill the obligations determined by the judgment, Wang applied to the Shuyang court for enforcement.
On October 16, 2014, the Shuyang court issued a civil ruling, ruling that 2,000 laying hens on all farms of Li should be detained and could not be transferred or sold without permission.
After receiving the seizure ruling, Li sold some of the laid chickens seized in the farm without the permission of the Shuyang court.

The head of the Industrial Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out here today that steel overcapacity is a global problem.
In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate has been higher than the global average, and it is also higher than that of countries and regions such as the United States and Europe
China has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess capacity, and the results are gradually emerging.
The person in charge pointed out that the global problem of steel overcapacity is highly valued by the Party Central Committee and the State Council.
All departments and regions actively implement the deployment of the State Council and work seriously, and this year, it is necessary to reduce the crude steel production capacity by about 45 million tons.
From the perspective of China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports, on the contrary, it also takes a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The person in charge stressed that the international trade of steel products is essentially a market behavior, which is an independent choice after considering factors such as the demand of the importing country and consumers considering the cost performance of the product.
The implementation of trade protection measures will not help fundamentally solve the development of the global steel industry, on the contrary, it will only have a further impact on the international trade order.
When it comes to debt, the person in charge stressed that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly handled in the process of resolving excess capacity.
Due to the large scale of steel enterprises and the wide scope of the assets involved, the debt relationship of some enterprises is complex, and if it is improperly disposed of, it may cause regional risks.
According to the person in charge, in recent years, with the increase of downward pressure on the economy, the total social demand has gradually weakened, the capacity utilization rate of some industries has declined, and the production and operation difficulties of enterprises have increased.
Some enterprises do not adapt to changes in the market environment, production and operation are unsustainable or even on the verge of closure, but by some institutional and institutional factors, there are more obstacles to exit in the market-oriented way, becoming "zombie enterprises".
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of factor resource utilization, increases social management costs, and hinders the establishment of a fair competition market environment.
The main reason for the loss is the same as the global steel industry is facing the same - weak market demand and low capacity utilization.
China mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic means and rule of law methods, and the government mainly does a good job in the bottom of workers and social stability to ensure a fair and just market order.
The person in charge stressed that in the next step, we must unswervingly continue to do a good job in production capacity to ensure the completion of the goal of resolving crude steel production capacity of 100 million to 150 million tons in five years.
On the afternoon of the 10th, as soon as the Chinese tourist police appeared in Red Square in Moscow, it immediately attracted people's attention, and Chinese tourists waved with surprise, and locals and foreign tourists could not help but stop and look back.
On the same day, members of China's first professional tourism police team, the tourist police detachment of Sanya Public Security Bureau of Hainan Province, came to Moscow's Red Square to exchange and learn from the local tourism police.
Moscow tourism police in Red Square, Nikolsky pedestrian street, Gum department store and other places into three groups on duty patrol, the Chinese tourism police together with the post to learn, the whole process lasted more than an hour.
Liusine, a female police officer in her 20s and fluent in English and Spanish, joined the tourist police force last year.
Along the way, he carefully observed the words and deeds of his Russian counterparts and communicated with her from time to time.
When Spanish tourists came to consult, the Moscow tourist police gave each other a patient explanation in fluent Spanish, which impressed Wang Bing.
“Everyone in the Moscow tourist police has a foreign language, and some more than two, which is very touching to us.”
“Hainan, as an international tourism island, is gradually attaching importance to attracting international tourists, and we hope to improve our ability to match the status of international tourism islands.”
On the same day, before studying with the post, the Chinese tourism police also went to the Moscow City Tourism Police Brigade to communicate with their Russian counterparts.
“I often deal with Chinese tourists and am very happy to see them coming to Russia.”
“The question they usually turn to is: how to go, where is a monument, how to rent, how to get back to the hotel.”
Resakov, head of the Moscow City Tourism Police Brigade, said that in recent years, Moscow's urban environment and tourism atmosphere have become more and more favorable and attractive to foreign tourists.
In order to meet the needs of tourism development, a tourism police team was established in July 2014, which is responsible for patrolling and guarding major attractions to help and guide tourists.
At present, all Moscow tourist police are proficient in English, and some also speak Spanish and German.
The police brigade divided them into nine groups based on their foreign language proficiency, taking two lessons a week to learn self-defence, laws and regulations and foreign languages.
“At present, two tourist police officers have started to learn Chinese, and they have spoken well, and we will continue to improve their Chinese language,” Resakov said.
Resakov told reporters that the Moscow tourism police have accumulated some experience since its formation, hoping to inspire their counterparts in Sanya.
He believes that the cooperation between the police departments of Russia and China will enhance the sense of security of their citizens to travel to each other's countries.
“The recruitment of Moscow tourist police personnel, police mode, equipment, and good interaction with tourists have given us a lot of inspiration,” Chen said.
At present, at least nine provinces and cities such as Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian and Beijing have issued residence permit implementation rules.
For the conditions for applying for a residence permit, it is generally proposed that the above-mentioned areas need to live for more than half a year, which meets one of the conditions for legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence, and continuous study.
The reporter noted that in terms of the treatment provided by the residence permit, the "gold content" of various places is different, and the scope of public services and convenience provided in some regions has been expanded compared with the provisions of the national version.
These areas have increased the convenience of children to participate in the secondary and secondary college entrance examination in the local area under the relevant conditions.
In addition, Beijing and other places have also explicitly requested that the scope of public services and convenience be gradually expanded and announced to the public on a regular basis.
For example, Fujian proposes to publish to the public at least once every three years the scope of public services and conveniences enjoyed by the holder of the residence permit.
The Provisional Regulations on Residence Permits stipulate that if they meet the conditions for the handling of the residence permit, the public security organ shall, within 15 days from the date of acceptance, make and issue the residence permit.
For the time limit for the issuance of certificates, most of the regions are in line with the national version, that is, within 15 days.
Hebei clearly, in line with the application conditions, the full material, the residence of the public security police station should be issued within 3 working days from the date of acceptance.
Jiangxi stipulates that if the conditions for the application of the residence permit are met and the certification materials are complete, the public security organ shall make and issue the residence permit within 5 working days from the date of acceptance.
In accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on Residence Cards, the above-mentioned areas are clear that for the first time to apply for a residence permit, the cost of the document is exempted.
For example, Sichuan requires that public security police stations or entrusted community service institutions should strictly implement the approved charging items and charging standards, and resolutely prohibit excessive, excessive fees or ride fees.
After investigation, on July 27, 2016, Chen Yangxia, secretary of the Dingnan County Party Committee of Ganzhou City, reported to the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission and served as the director of the Party Wind and Political Style Supervision Office (deputy director level, trial period of one year).
The red wine that was consumed that night was provided by Li Youcai personally, and the other expenses were borne by Liu.
The Jiangxi Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection reported that Chen Yangxia, Cheng Ziliang and others organized and accepted food requests in private clubs, violating the spirit of the eight provisions of the Central Committee and violating the discipline of the party.
Pogba, who received two yellow cards in the Italian Cup last season, will be automatically banned for one match according to the rules.
Although he has moved back to the Premier League, the FA still extended its cumulative suspension to the Premier League.
As a result, in the away game against Bournemouth on August 14, Pogba will be on the wall, and his return to Manchester United's debut will be postponed to the 20th home game with Southampton.
As the first round of the 12th rookie in 2014, Saric will officially land in the NBA next season and join the Philadelphia 76ers.
As a young European player, many fans do not know him very well, but through this Olympic Games, I believe that Saariq's performance has left a deep impression.
The last time Croatia narrowed to win over Spain, Salic managed to seal off Paul Gasol in the final minute trying to drag the game into the plus-time basket.
Recently, 76ers coach Brett Brown gave Salic a high rating, the Spurs coach believes that he saw the young Manu Ginobili's shadow in Sarics.
It’s clear that Sarich has shown his talent and has the 76ers looking forward to him.
In the first two games of the Olympics, Sarici scored 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Saric showed his ability to open space on the court, and after blocking with his teammates, he was able to shoot outside the three-point line.
Although the 76ers have hoarded a number of talented young players in the inside, they do not have the outside ability of Saari.
From the cap to the launch of a long pass fast attack and complete the assist, there are only a handful of inner players in the NBA arena today.
Since the start of the Olympic Games, Saric has averaged 13 points, eight rebounds and five assists in three games.
Since deciding to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014, James has signed two consecutive 1+1 contracts.
As the NBA’s final year of the collective bargaining agreement, James, as vice president of the NBA Players Union, will be at the forefront of the labor agreement negotiations.
Given the league’s significant increase in revenue, thanks to a new television deal and a battle between owners and players over how to handle the money, the NBA is headed for a shutdown next summer.
But for James, he doesn’t have to worry about becoming a free agent next summer, as he has already extended a three-year contract with the Cavaliers.
No matter when the 2017-18 season officially starts, James is under contract.
Since the stunning appearance of the iPhone SE, the mobile phone market has also ushered in a boom in small screen machines.
Not long ago, Nubia also launched the first work of its Z11 series: nubiaZ11mini.
The nubiaZ11mini continues its excellent photogenic genes and is equipped with a 5.0-inch screen with a single hand, easy to use, and easy to use, which has achieved its outstanding experience.
Nubia's small screen camera phone Z11mini has been reduced by 200 yuan, that is, from the original 1499 yuan to 1299 yuan.
In terms of appearance, the nubiaZ11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen, and the front is still the classic "little red circle" design.
The middle frame is made of metal, and the bottom is symmetrical and configured with a Type-C data interface.
The future of the Portland smelter is uncertain due to the cancellation of the power contract.
As the power company that powers the plant has revealed that a factory owner will terminate a supply contract that invalidates all supply contracts, the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria and hundreds of workers at the plant are currently facing an uncertain future.
The move comes after the Victorian government decided not to continue issuing subsidies to guarantee plant operations.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will end in November.
2,000 workers at Alcoa’s Portland plant could face job losses.
Once the plant closes, as many as 2,000 people may lose their jobs directly or indirectly.
And because the plant accounts for about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity output, it may also have a chain reaction.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Hanerrey Cape smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesey Island power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is currently losing money and is at risk of closure.
The move comes after forecasts for the plant for years to come, initially due to the strength of the Australian dollar and more recently because of the price of the factory’s products.
AGL supplies electricity to the large aluminum smelter through the Latrobo Valley Old Eyang Power Plant. The company predicts that three other plant owners will also terminate its agreement.
The largest shareholder of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, while China CITIC Group and Japan's Marubeni Co. also hold a small stake.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand,” the joint venture said.
AGL said the contracts were “hedging contracts” that should have been in effect since November 2016.
The contracts are terminated for a period of 12 months, so they will be terminated in 2017.
“As a result, AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in fiscal year 2017.”
Any revenue impact on AGL from fiscal 2018 is currently subject to an optimistic outlook for wholesale electricity prices in the futures market.
AGL said it had written down $187 million in its “expectation of termination activity” in its contract value.
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts “will not affect Alcoa’s ability to operate the smelter or guarantee the smelter’s power supply.”
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with El Young in 2010 that was due to take effect in November, but it did not explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are wary of whether the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle will be closed because of the industry’s poor economic situation.
In response to the analyst comments earlier this week, AGL’s head of operations, Steven Mickelson, said Portland’s annual electricity consumption reaches about 600 megawatts and the Tomargo plant reaches about 900 megawatts.
If two plants are closed, the demand for the electricity market will be greatly reduced.
“As a power company, this is not good news for us.”
Community law centre shuts 160,000 people out every year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are shut out of community law centers each year. Funding for the service is already stretched, and it is now facing further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of every five people are denied access to free legal advice and representation, most of them elderly, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the resources to fight unjust evictions.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limit and now faces further funding cuts.
From June next year, federal funding for these legal centers will be reduced by another 30 percent.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Centre, said thousands of people were turned away every year, according to the latest National Community Association Law Centre survey.
Mr Farrell said the situation would only get worse if the federal government doesn’t change its existing decisions.
“Queensland’s community law centres have long been underfunded, meaning thousands of people will not have access to the vital services they need,” he said.
People who need to stay away from violence, people with huge debts that cannot be repaid, families facing disintegrated families, and crushed workers all face legal problems, and the report shows that they do not get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by another 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable people in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland MP George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when faced with legal issues.
Last year, the state government pledged to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
The time has come to pay attention to community law centers and their needs in response to the needs of the community, and the government must also be engaged in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign indicted for staff pulling guns
NEW YORK (AP) — Trump’s campaign has been indicted for his inaction by the North California chief in February after pulling a gun at a staff member while driving a jeep.
Vincent Bodini, a former software trainer for the state campaign, described the incident in a Charlotte-based state court on Wednesday.
Bodini said he had hoped the matter would be resolved internally, but after waiting for months, he realized "it couldn't happen."
According to Bodini, the head, Earl Philip, “pulled out a pistol, placed his right index finger on the board, and pointed the muzzle at Vincent’s kneecap.”
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bodini learned from the dossier that at least four others had experienced the same thing.
In his complaint, Bodini stated: “The absence of a shot does not mean that no harm will be inflicted.”
The case came just two days after the Republican presidential candidate told the crowd in North Carolina that if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and picked the judge she loved, the “pro-provost” of gun owners and gun enthusiasts might take action, a speech that sparked outrage.
Trump’s campaign said the media took his words out of context and that he did not advocate violence.
In his complaint, Bodini demanded that the campaign team compensate for his neglect of supervision, as well as Philip for his assault, assault and mental injury.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the news.
I couldn't get to Phillip.
According to a local news agency in Charlotte, Philip recently left the campaign.
His consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, did not respond immediately to the call.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign has been controversial.
In this case, the two sides are Bodini and President Trump campaigning for the company, 16-CS-14300, the General Division of the High Court of Mecklenburg County (Charlotte).
Britain must deliver Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our communities, London and the country as a whole.
For me, this is the charm of Heathrow, just as at the 2012 London Olympics, we did everything we could to ensure that our countries and regions could benefit from these events.
The Olympics have benefited Stratford and the East End.
And we will once again benefit the region by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
In our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and lift the youth around the airport out of unemployment.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, some people thought the Heathrow expansion was too large.
I was told that Britain would not be able to prepare for the Olympics and that we would be disgraced in front of the world.
Skeptics are wrong about the 2012 Olympics, and their suspicions about the Heathrow project will also be proven wrong.
While there will always be obstacles to overcome, Heathrow is addressing every problem it faces.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not the few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs, bring £211 billion in economic growth, leaving a wealth of technology and jobs around the airport and across the UK.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team. The team has completed £11 billion of infrastructure investment projects on time and within budget, including T5, which has been named the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years and the T2 terminal between the world's two busiest runways.
Now they are ready to build a third runway with a private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The UK successfully hosted the London 2012 Olympic Games, and I am confident that the Heathrow Airport expansion project will also be a great success.
Now is a good time to deliver the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport so that we can secure our future and create a wealth of technology and jobs that make the UK proud.
Lord Paul Dayton is Chairman of the Board of Directors of Heathrow Airport and former Commercial Counsellor at the UK Treasury
A woman committed suicide on a Swiss highway and was killed.
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
The woman who attempted suicide was overtaken by multiple cars on the highway early Thursday morning. Police are currently searching for witnesses.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges, Wa, early Thursday morning.
Vaud state police said a woman was lying "desperately" on a road late at night and was being squashed by multiple vehicles.
The victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, was apparently suicidal. She was hit by several vehicles, including a van.
The woman died instantly.
Police said several of the drivers involved had been investigated, but some of them remained unconfirmed. Police are appealing to them and witnesses to the accident to come to the investigation.
Mr. Gilles Hofstadter told the Geneva Tribune that a criminal investigation had been initiated, which is a routine process for such incidents.
It is not yet known whether the pilot will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
Hofstadter said: "This will be determined by the prosecutor."
Based on the outcome of two other similar cases over the past five years, the driver will not be liable.
According to the newspaper, both cases were caused by someone walking down the highway late at night. The final verdict was that the driver could not have expected a pedestrian to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with negligent death after she struck a man on the A1 motorway near Payne in August 2014 and killed him.
The court learned that the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking alcohol.
After the investigation, the judge said the police officer was driving completely legal, and the man who appeared on the road was "completely unexpected and unpredictable" and that the police officer later called emergency services.
Anyone who can provide information about the accident near Moorges on Thursday should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 6444 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Space Institute have developed a model that can explore the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms that are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, which is hot on the surface, is not hot, and whose atmosphere is filled with carbon dioxide, once had an Earth-like environment.
Previously, scientists thought that Venus was slower to move because of its thicker atmosphere.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and at a slower rotation rate at the time.
The model also shows the early topography of Venus.
Venus may have more dry areas than Earth, but there used to be enough water and geographic changes to nurture life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the sunlight shining on Venus was 30% brighter than Earth’s.
Anthony Del Geno, a scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Research, explained at a press conference that “in the model simulations of the Goddard Space Research Institute, Venus’s slow rotation makes its side of the day nearly two months long.”
This warms the surface and produces rainwater capable of forming thick clouds, which, like an umbrella, block most of the sun’s heat from the ground.
The result of the simulation was that the average climate temperature of Venus was actually a few degrees lower than that of Earth today.
The evolution of Venus, as simulated by this model, is similar to that previously speculated by planetary scientists.
Although life may once exist on Venus, over the course of billions of years, Venus has been exposed to excessive temperatures and ultraviolet rays.
The ocean on the planet evaporates, and water vapor is burned out by ultraviolet light.
With the escape of hydrogen, only a thicker atmosphere of carbon dioxide and a deadly greenhouse gas effect have left, forming Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published simulations of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Communications.
Patrick Roy resigns as avalanche coach
Patrick Roy, who resigned as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche ice hockey team on Thursday, said he had no say at the team’s decision-making level.
Colorado executive vice president Joe Sarchis confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new head coach.
Roy, 50, said in a statement: “Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche team with every energy, passion and determination.”
I thought hard about how to improve this team throughout the summer and get it to the next level.
To this end, the goals of the head coach and vice president must be in line with the goals of the club.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
However, these conditions have not yet been met.
Saatchis hired Roy on May 23, 2013, and he thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sarchis said, "Patrick told me his decision today."
We are grateful for his contribution to the club and hope that he will be successful in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach of the Year in the 2013-14 season.
He helped the club score 112 points, ranking first in the Central Division. But Colorado was eliminated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, and missed out on the playoffs in the last two years.
In the 2015-16 season, the avalanche team's score was 39 wins, 39 draws and 4 losses, and finally lost the second wild card qualification in the Western Grand League region by 5 points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy has won four Stanley Cups, two each in the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil industry workers stop strike, continue talks
The chief negotiator said workers in the North Sea oil fields had halted a pay strike and the parties to the dispute began a new round of talks.
There have been several strikes against oil-field service company Wood Group on the North Sea oil platform operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement, “Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to reopen the settlement process of the current dispute.”
We will be having multiple full-day meetings in the coming weeks, starting early next week, to revisit these issues.
The union said its recent action was to protest a pay cut of up to 30 percent, the first time in 25 years.
Wood Group has cut the compensation of North Sea contractors by about 9 percent this year due to market pressures.
The pay cut comes after the company cut compensation for offshore contractors by 10 percent in 2014.
The company said that another pay cut will help the company through the market downturn.
Shell has cut thousands of staff and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries as it needs to streamline its operations following a merger with British energy company British Gas.
Energy companies are under pressure from falling crude prices and Britain’s June Brexit decision.
Dave Anderson, a member of the Scottish Parliament, met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute in a generation in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea is crucial for the regional economy.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that serves the majority, not the few.”
Spending on new projects in the North Sea is not expected to exceed $1.4 billion in 2016, compared with an average of about $7 billion spent on projects over the past five years.
Kepler measured the rotation velocity of the star of the Angsu cluster
The Kepler space telescope’s latest mission has helped astronomers capture the most complete stellar rotation velocities.
The new data are helping astronomers understand why the cluster's stars have different rotation velocities and the association of their rotation period with the planet's composition.
Lusa Rebble, a research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing Analysis at Caltech Pasadena, said: "We hope to further understand the relationship between star mass, age, and even the history of its solar system by comparing our results with other clusters."
The cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and have just reached adulthood.
They reach the highest rotation speed in their lifetime.
At the highest rotational velocity, these mature stars emit a large number of stellar winds.
When these stellar winds pass through the star's magnetic field, they brake on the star.
As the star ages, its rotation begins to slow.
Kepler measured the rotation velocity of each star by tracking the time of the appearance of the identified star sunspot (like the sunspot).
The latest velocity data set shows that more massive stars rotate slower than smaller stars.
Rable compared the star to the dancer, and the larger dancers rotated more slowly than the smaller dancers.
“In the ballet performance of the Angsu cluster, we found that stars with slower rotations tend to be more massive, while the fastest stars tend to be the lightest stars,” said Rable.
Because the cluster is so close, it can be used as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing stellar mass to rotational velocities.
“Angu clusters laid the foundation for a theoretical model of bidirectional rotation of young and aged stars.”
We still have a lot to know about how, when and why stars slow their rotation and “put away their dancing shoes.”
In three new papers, Rebble and her colleagues elaborated on their latest analysis of the rotation rate of the cluster. The three papers will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Zheng Jianjun, head of the Water Management Section of Nanhu Park, said that the deepest depth of the South Lake is more than 10 meters, and those who do not understand the water situation are likely to be dangerous.
"Although the South Lake rescue team is very professional, but still hope that the majority of rowing tourists can wear life jackets, do not do illegal actions on the lake, safe to play," Zheng Jianjun said.
The village has a unique marine environment and is home to two major leisure tourism resources: natural ecology and human ecology.
“But the individual owners who bought the parking spaces in the community are afraid that this will affect the rental price of their parking spaces, and they suspect that others have selfishness, so they have been destroying behind them, resulting in the renovation of parking spaces being put on hold.”
The question of when and by whom to introduce sweet potatoes is still varied.
In the current mainstream view, there are three main lines for the introduction of sweet potatoes.
Among the three lines introduced by sweet potatoes, the most influential and widely spread is that Chen Zhenlong was introduced to Fuzhou by the Philippines.
From now on, the Beijing Municipal Office of Social Group Management will carry out special inspections on the use of unified receipts for social groups.
The inspection is divided into two types of unit self-examination and key spot checks.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Municipal Association Office, the scope of this inspection includes social groups that charge the unified receipt of social group dues in the municipal association from 2013 to 2015.
In its 2012 Olympic communications strategy, the Rio Organizing Committee said: “The success of the Olympic Games is defined by those who share stories on social media.”
Judging from the reports of this Olympic Games, the media have made great changes in the way of communication, product form, language style, news perspective and many other aspects.
The IOC and media practitioners around the world seem to have met this round of challenges.
On August 11, the public offering of Everbright Securities' H shares entered its final day. It was reported that the market reaction in the two days before the prospectus was uneven. According to the plan, it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18.
A domestic brokerage analyst said that the foundation of Oriental Securities in Hong Kong is not good, and its asset management business is the director of East Securities. Compared with Bank of China International, CITIC Securities and other banking securities companies, it is not congenital.
Experts pointed out that since this year, with the return of the securities market to the flat, many brokerage performance has declined, but the situation after the company's listing to see more about the development of the company's own business, can not be generalized.
After the introduction of this new regulation and control, Suzhou will become the first second-tier city in the country to restart the purchase restriction.
The second-tier cities that have introduced or are about to introduce property market regulation and control policies are not only Suzhou, but also include cities such as Hefei and Nanjing.
Previously, Hefei has taken the lead in issuing a loan restriction policy, and the bank will refuse to provide mortgage services for buyers who have two suites in the name of Hefei and have an outstanding home loan.
