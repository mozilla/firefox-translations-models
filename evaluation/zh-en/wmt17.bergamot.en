28-year-old chef found dead in a San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell at a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to harm him, and said, "Everything is finally getting better."
The San Francisco coroner's office said the body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old San Francisco resident.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death case was found to have been killed for him and is investigating.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's San Francisco-based radio station, KGO, that Frank, who previously worked as an assembly line chef in Boston, found an ideal job for an assembly line chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were "very shocked" by Frank's death.
The spokesman said, "We are a small team like a close family, and we will miss him deeply."
In this sad time, we express our deep sympathies and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia says Frank lives in a guest house at first, but recently "everything is finally getting better."
Louis Galicia told KGO: "Frank found an apartment and was in a relationship with a girl at the same time."
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to harm his brother.
Frank has a good heart and broad heart.
Louis Galicia said, "Frank often cooks dinners for his family."
He never wanted to argue with his family.
He is a person who follows everyone's opinion.
Louis Galicia said, "Everything in the world can be wrong, but Frank can be called a man who shines every day."
There are leads, please call the San Francisco Police Department to report the 115-575-4444.
Beginners strike: Call for new labor action
Representatives of junior doctors called on the coalition to approve new labor actions in response to the new contract dispute.
The British Medical Association junior doctors' committee will be asking all of its members to support more labour action from the beginning of September.
The Junior Doctors' Board said ministers had not addressed concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to boycott the contract deal with the British Medical Association.
Of the members who participated in the vote, 58 percent opposed the contract deal.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Doctors Committee, said in a letter to members on Twitter late Thursday that the government had "constantly remained silent on issues that led to the boycott of the contract."
She said: "In view of this, the Executive Committee of the Junior Doctors Committee has voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and called for formal consultations to be reopened on all concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the Junior Doctors Committee's Executive Committee formally requested today a special meeting of the British Medical Association Council to approve a long-term plan to upgrade labour action from early September.
The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out strike in the history of the NHS England.
Dr. Johann Malawana, a leader of the British Medical Association's junior doctor, resigned after the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the British Medical Association were boycotted.
At a meeting before the 54,000 junior doctors and medical students voted, he had told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should therefore be accepted.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed among England paramedics.
Russia and Turkey: "Unbecome in the League"?
A gesture to end a crisis.
Russia and Turkey's leaders met on Tuesday, with the two sides shaking hands and announcing a formal end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish president in the golden hall of a St. Petersburg Palace, I had a strong feeling: this reconciliation is what Ankara most wants to see.
Yes, the two sides did shake hands.
However, even according to the standards of Mr. Putin's constant introverted, Putin is only a shallow smile, barely showing enthusiasm.
Rejep Tayyip Erdogan reportedly referred to "good friend" Putin five times.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to pre-crisis levels, even to higher levels.
The next day, a newspaper wrote that Mr. Erdogan did as if nothing had happened.
But, I think his enthusiasm hints at something the opposite.
However, Mr. Putin's continued lukewarm attitude shows that he has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening post was the reason for the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was fierce at the time.
Mr Putin lashed out at the incident, accusing Ankara of undersecreting on Moscow.
Attacks from so-called friends are even more difficult to accept.
It's hard for both sides to re-establish true trust, or even possible.
Since the beginning of November, Russian public opinion has also been reversed.
For months, the media controlled by the government have carried out a shocking all-out offensive against Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
Among them, the most serious of these accusations came from senior officials: Mr. Erdogan's family profited from the illegal oil trade in the so-called Islamic State-controlled area of Syria.
He has categorically denied that statement.
However, the news coming from St. Petersburg showed that it was time to look forward.
After all, the meeting is premised on Putin receiving an apology from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are palpable.
First, Erdogan was ousted after last month's failed coup, so he needed the support of all his friends.
The constant terrorist attacks have clearly hit him hard.
There is also economic motivation.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially banning charter services that transport millions of Russian tourists a year to the Turkish coast.
That figure has fallen by nearly 90 percent.
As the flight resumes, Russia's travel agency and charter companies will be relieved.
They will usher in a mid-season Mediterranean tourism boom.
State television even predicted this week that the price of fruits and vegetables would fall once Turkish agricultural imports were reopened.
A report by a Moscow newspaper Vedemosti said: "The tourists went, the tomatoes were back."
For Moscow, the visit also has added political value.
Ankara is angry at the Western world's weak reaction to the intention to take over.
In addition, Ankara has long been unhappy with the slow progress of the EU accession negotiations and Putin's meddling, and Putin is keen to use the political chill and weaken Turkey's relations with the Western world.
As a result of espousing the elected authorities after the failed coup, the Russian leader is bound to get an extra point from Ankara.
Note that this is a gift for Moscow, which has always been deeply veneated in the regime's changing arms.
So the meeting held at this brilliant seaside palace led Russia and Turkey to form allies of two countries that the Western world had refused to be abused, an analyst described as "attributing to the alliance rath
However, despite the open rapprochement, there are still major differences between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors. Moscow has played a peace role in Syria in recent days, while Russia and Turkey have supported the opposite faction.
It is foreseeable that after nearly three hours of initial conversation, the two presidents said at the launch that the topic had not been discussed.
The Turkish president has deliberately sidestepped the issue of differences between the two sides, while Putin stressed it.
The two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to seek common ground on the Syrian issue.
With months of open hostility and the possibility of a major disaster caused by the shooting down of the Russian warplanes by Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the leaders of the two countries will surely be a good thing to restart dialogue again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland
According to the chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank will be reduced to a logistics unit.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland division that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand was once committed to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago on the verge of collapse, had to be bailed out since then began to give up that pursuit.
During that time, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
The Group has spent millions of pounds sponsoring international sporting events in favour of sponsoring international sporting events, including the rugby six and the Win-Bulton Tennis Championships champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right thing to do is to get more national brands to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish clients, but will not respond as it is.
In England and Wales, all the reference in the headquarters and outside the stock exchange will be changed to the National Westminster Bank.
The Ulster Bank brand has been used for clients of the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Autonomous Region.
There are other, more prominent, smaller private banking brands, such as Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of Invernessshire clients and staff.
He told the BBC Scotland that “the Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually be our investor brand and one of the employee-employed brands, because at a larger sense, we have become a bank with many brands. ”
Since the bank itself became an international brand, RBS has also become a global brand.
At the moment, I'm going to say that we're no longer focused on the globe, we've turned our sights to homeland.
Each brand represents the difference in their respective industries, and our employees serve their customers through different brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland has shown that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championships; at the same time, efforts have been made to elevate the image of different brands in sporting events sponsorship.
The CEO said: "It's time to be a multi-brand bank, because we've been privately looking for how to be a better bank to serve our customers."
If we aspired to be a big bank with a lot of brands three years ago, it would be taunted.
We are currently focusing on customer needs and I'm sure you've noticed these changes.
I think we can restart those brands, and now the time is right.
Daitury with Predilection's success in Newmaket, 3,000 wins
Newmakett's two wins helped Dai Tulli take a career 3,000 win after he sprayed champagne to celebrate
On Friday, professional racehorse jockeys Frankie Dettori scored his 3,000th victory in Newmarket.
He was advised by Predilection, a coachman at the hands of John Gosden, in a rush on the horse's road, and won two wins that night, which also achieved a professional 3,000 victory.
The 45-year-old is the sixth professional horse racing jockey to achieve this milestone in the field of the flat race.
The top five are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Dai Tullie, a three-time champion jockey who won earlier in Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
I was so excited because my family was on the scene.
I'm happy with what I've achieved in Newmaket, because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a massive raceball club, nor the Royal Ascot, it's just an ordinary Friday night with a 20,000 spectators.
I'm very relieved and humble.
Daitury brought Predilection after winning, causing cheers across the field
In the hurdles field, two jockeys have achieved that, with them champion jockey Richard Johnson and now-retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, in which Sir McCoy has scored more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Boge is a nine-time German contest winner who has scored a total of 4,493 wins in his career
Daituri is one of the best jockeys of our time, so it's no surprise that he has achieved this milestone, and there are not many people who have achieved it before him.
He was stylish and robust, but what really made him stand out in the weighing room was his tactical rationality.
He's an amazing equestrian ambassador and over the years his passion and charisma has attracted a large number of fans for the sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Dai Turing in Epsom that if he wasn't just a weekend with a contest jockey, he should have been able to win a 6,000 victory!
Seriously, it's so important that Daitury is the best equestrian winner in three decades in the UK.
He was lively, which was good for British horse racing, but otherwise he was still an incredible jockey.
Daitury celebrates the milestone with its iconic jump-down horse action
From the jump-trillion line to the jump-down horse, for two decades, Daituri has been a typical representative of the English field of the flat race.
His career is like a rollercoaster.
He won a number of competitions, including the famous "seven-game winning streak" at the Royal Aisko in 1996, but he also suffered a crash and was banned for taking a banned drug.
Three years ago, when he returned to the game after the six-month ban, he was once struggling. But he showed an amazing personality advantage and finally returned to the top, to be the first for those who were skeptics.
He probably couldn't do too long, as he said before he said he hoped to be at least until he was 50.
Russian President Vladimir Putin removes Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly removed Sergei Ivanov's chief of staff.
For years, Mr. Ivanov has been a member of the core group that Mr. Putin has trusted.
Ivanov, who is now 63 years old, has now been appointed as a special representative for environment and transport.
A Kremlin statement said Mr Putin had "declared the removal of Ivanov's post of chief of staff of the Russian President, ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★
Anton Vaino, who began his post in 2012 as a deputy of Mr. Ivanov, has been appointed to take over.
Mr Vaino is now 44 years old and is a former diplomat.
Born in Talin, the capital of Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he managed the presidential draft and government employees, the Kremlin website (in Russian).
After his appointment, he said to Mr. Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of this Government is to support the Head of State in drafting laws and control directives.
Mr Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr Ivanov himself had asked to resign and recommended Mr Vaino to take over himself.
Is that kind of smile convincing?
Moscow is puzzled by the move.
Sergey Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest aides and, like Putin, has worked at the Soviet Security Service (KGB).
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin aired on state television, both said the chief of staff had called for his resignation.
Despite the smiles in front of the camera, almost no one was convinced that the April would be particularly at this time before the parliamentary elections.
So, is that caused by the fall in some kind of power grab?
It is not known.
But the official saying that a candidate once seen as a presidential candidate suddenly chose to take the lead in Russia's environmental policy has attracted a lot of doubts.
The Kremlin website quoted a conversation between Mr. Ivanov and Mr. Putin, saying: "Yes, in early 2012, I asked you in a conversation to give me this difficult post, even a troubled post, for a four-year term."
"As a result, I have been the chief of office of the president for four years and eight months."
Mr. Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
Before that, he served as deputy prime minister and defense minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, a former member of the National Security Agency.
In the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin became director of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly known as the National Security Agency), Mr. Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
After Mr. Putin came to power, he appointed Mr. Ivanov one of the five most trusted people he trusted.
At one point, it was thought that Mr. Ivanov might become the president of Russia after Mr. Putin's second term, because the three-election is unconstitutional.
But the position eventually belonged to Dmitry Medvedev, another close aide to Putin.
Before re-entering the presidency after three and a half years, Mr. Putin took the post of Russian prime minister.
Mysterious Fish Amazing Banff a Garden
One of the residents of Banff found the fish in their garden and then sent out for help.
Kevin Bain thought the 75-sand fish could be a sand eel blown by a sea tornado.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a video of the strange scene on Periscope, hoping someone could explain to him why these two-inch-long fish appeared.
The Kunsfery Bridge is now available to Fife
The £13.5bn project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017
Engineers have connected the North and viaducts of the Queensferry Crossing, which means that the bridge is now through Fife.
The four "Bridge surface fan" near the three bridgeheads of each bridge is now nearing completion, and the project is the first bridge of Helong.
The bridge, which began in Faff, is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 metric tons.
It uses 2,000 metric tonnes of steel, 20,000 tonne concrete and 46 cable lupess.
The £13.5bn project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today to become one of the first to board the bridge.
"This is a historic moment in the construction of the Kuns Ferry Bridge," he said.
We've all been witnessing engineering work on such a grand project, using more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel in the construction of the bridge alone.
Although the size and weight of the bridge are huge, the completion of the bridge between the viaduct and the bridge surface requires fine work and requires very precise assembly.
In general, nearly 79% of the total bridge surface has been completed, and the last section of the bridge concrete bridge surface is poured in Rosyth today, which means that all the bridge surfaces are ready in place.
Michael Martin, Project Director of the Kuns Ferry Bridge Construction Company, said: "No matter which bridge project, the first Helong is a major milestone."
In terms of this remarkable project, this time Helong demonstrates cutting-edge civil engineering technology.
After installing the last section of the road panel and connecting it to the Expanded North Bridge Bridge Road panel, the remaining gap on the north side or near the land side needs to be completed next.
Completing the operation requires the transfer of the northern viaduct to the south of the 700mm.
It's a huge operation of scale, and it's a very sophisticated job.
It is said to be huge because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighing about 6,000 metric tons, and needs to pull out a slope of about 3 percent.
It's sophisticated because the engineering team needs to make sure the deviation is very small, only a few millimeters per side.
It's gratifying that everything is going well.
Simon Byers picks up women's gymnastics all-around title
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the hype.
Simone Biles is not affected by it all.
Vibrant when you jump.
Balance the wood upstream blades.
Free gymnastics is amazing.
Overall performance is great.
Now, it's finally the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast picked up the all-around title on Thursday, fully demonstrating her talent for leading the world in gymnastics at the Olympic field.
She topped the silver medalist with a total score of 62.198, "The Ultimate Five Group of Four: Lily Raisman and the bronze medalist Russian player Aliya Mustafina.
Simon Byers from the United States performed a balanced wooden performance on Thursday at the Artistic Gymnastics Women's Individual All-around final of the 2016 Summer Olympics, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Byers helped the U.S. team achieve a four-game winning title at the women's gymnastics individual at the Olympics, and she won five medals at the Olympics, further confirming that she was a generation and possibly the finest gymnast ever.
When the moment she saw her total score, Byers couldn't help but shed tears. She finally ended the long journey.
Biles thus ranks among "once-in-a-row athletes" like Michael Phelps, who take their sports in their fields to new heights:
Byers has been dominating the field for the last three years, winning 15 World Championship medals, including ten gold medals. Her determined-minded trainage every day to achieve greater precision. "Byers is the best gymnast I've ever met."
There's also the last game in Brazil, but the game is not so much about Beiers's rivalry with other gymnastics as a contest between herself and the pressure of great expectations.
If Byers hadn't been full of gold medals back to her home in Spring, Texas, everyone would have been very disappointed.
Simon Byers (left) and Leseman from the United States hugged each other, and they won gold and silver at the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, August.
Byths won the first gold medal on Tuesday, giving the retiring national team coach Martha Karolyi a generous gift in a surprise salute.
Although Byers insists he has no plans for the future in the process of occupying the title for a long time, the fact is not exactly that.
A section of the Biles Free Gymnastics, which includes her signature rotary strung, is accompanied by Latin music, which she often hears from the residence where there is only one street away from the Rio Olympic Games.
It's no coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents during infancy, was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother on a gymnasium field trip and has now grown to become a backbone.
Byers hasn't lost in the all-around since the summer of 2013, and as long as she wants to win, she'll definitely win.
The slight lead after Mustafina spun twice was just an illusion.
The reigning world champion, Balancewood and Free Gymnastics, is ambush.
She scored 15.433 in Balanced Wood, Free Gymnastics scored 15.933.
While waiting for the final score to come out, Lesman gently hugs Byers. When Byers learned of his dream, he left a tearful.
Lesman's performance was a bit like a revenge on four years ago when she tied for third but lost to Mustafina in the tiebreaker.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, who was nicknamed "Grandma" by Americans, is far ahead.
She flew a kiss to the crowd after the end of free gymnastics and announced her return, but it sometimes seemed doubtful before such a return.
Byers is only 19 years old. Since earlier this week, its news spread virally on Twitter. As far as Beiles is concerned, his life has been given a whole new meaning.
'Smigling' 6-year-old Mahaj Brown is spared in Philadelphia shooting
A six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old child in the city this week, police said.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child who was shot was Mahaj Brown.
They said Brown's groin, legs, arms and abdomen were involved in multiple gunshot wounds, but the child was awake on the way to the hospital.
"He's been guilty of a lot of sin, and the little body has been shot and broken by the rammed as a member of his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the TV station.
I can't believe it.
The boy was in critical condition at the hospital and had undergone multiple surgeries.
His family told the television station that the child was expected to recover.
He was due to start attending first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown is one of four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Of the other three who were shot, two were 29 years old and one 32 years old.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims was in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition.
The TV station said the child was found in the front seat of the car with the 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether there were the gunmen among the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like multiple gunmen exchanged fire.
A number of offensive weapons were found shells at the scene, which can be inferred from the fact that they were using different assault weapons.
Judging from this, this is undoubtedly a continuous war.
There are shell casings on the pavement on both sides of the street.
"So, it can be seen that at that time, there were a number of armed men at the scene in a state of intense battle, and Anthony Ginaldi, the Philadelphia Police Chief of Police, told the TV station.
There are many houses and vehicles damaged in the area.
Arrests have not yet been carried out, and it is said that police are looking at surveillance footage.
On Tuesday, there was also a six-year-old child (girl) who was ejected on the arm while playing on the doorstep of the West Oak Lane community.
She is currently recovering and police are still hunting for the suspect.
Why We Need Simon, Gabrielle, and Laurie
That's how I'm evaluating this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First, from 1984 onwards, I went to every Summer Olympics, but the United States has never been to dominate as much as it.
Second, the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabrielle Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have been inspiring many girls of color.
The composition of this team is proud of all, because it contains the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kochian.
This team finally looks like the American team.
It also cemented the pinnacle of black and Latino women in the sport.
For the past four years, the premier female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabrielle were numbered and second.
It's so powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabriele Douglas "surprisingly" became the Olympic champion, which cheered the United States.
Today, the world can witness the three-time world champions Simon Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez. They have deduced the conventional gymnastics skills.
On Thursday, Simon helped the U.S. team achieve a four-peat on the women's individual all-around program.
Her team-mate Ali Lesman won the silver medal.
We've reached the pinnacle of the sport, but that's not the case in gymnastics classes across the United States.
Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie entered the Olympic team as well as Ali and Madison.
They are the "ultimate five-person group of" Final Fives, because the next Olympic gymnastics team will consist of four gymnasts, which is Marta Karolyi's last year of coaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly sport, and gymnasts are mainly trained in private gymnastics clubs, and their parents need to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotel costs (including the fees associated with coaches and gymnasts and family-related expenses), and the list of fees is still increasing.
Most gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can support the industry.
All the training of gymnasts is done in these clubs and is a long-term expensive expense for the families of gymnasts.
Byers's coach, Aimee Boorman, and Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have coached them since the two gymnasts began practicing gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to countless young girls influenced by Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie.
Twenty years ago, I set up my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we offer free, cheap gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youths in black residential areas, mainly black and Hispanic, and to produce national and even world champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home country) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who are worth getting this learning opportunity and will benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnastics helps to develop physical strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as hard-working, self-discipline and determination.
These can bring lifelong benefits to a person ’ s health, academic and work success.
Encouraged by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sport is significant, especially for girls.
It was an exciting time.
Thank you to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for their wonderful “girls ’ power in winning the Olympic team gold medal ”, and for inspiring young girls with so many backgrounds to embark on the path to health, strength and success.
Junior doctor plans to launch further strike after dismissing Jeremy Hunt's offer
Ministers at first wanted to end the dispute, which was triggered by the change by accepting a revised contract by a British Medical Association (BMA) official, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who participated in the vote opposed the contract.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose contracts, saying the NHS is currently in a "vacuum" and that a slight delay would harm the interests of staff and patients.
The new contract first mentions changes to junior doctors' all-night and weekend work practices to improve care during non-normal working hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Junior Doctors Committee, said in a statement: "Prim doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially for its concern that it will exacerbate the current labor force crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
It's just eight weeks before the first doctors sign the new contract, and we need to make progress and there's not much time.
The BMA strives to resolve disputes through negotiations, but everyone is reluctant to participate, and sometimes the government is responding with silence.
Still, just last month we got Jeremy Hunt's promise, and he said his door was always open.
"Jeremy Hunt now needs to act to remove enforcement and address the concerns of junior doctors."
If he doesn't, the junior doctor makes it clear that they're ready for further labor action.
The last strike occurred at the end of April, leading to the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and condiment doctors took cover for doctors on the picket line.
The ministers at first hoped to end the change-induced dispute by accepting the BMA's revised contract.
The BMA wants to fight for better weekend salaries for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract.
NHS Employers chief executive Daniel Mortimer has called on junior doctors to stop staging any more strikes.
Mr. Mortimer said: "Labor action has had little success, but on the contrary, it will put pressure on the already exhausted teams and services, leading to the worry, worry, and confusion of patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have been in constant negotiations with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other departments, have responded positively to their concerns about guardianship roles and whistleblowing.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics such as deployment, flexibility in training, other training for those who are re-inducted after a career break, the cost of training, a common understanding of course skewers, the gender pay gap in the areas of postage and gender pay, which illustrate the importance that employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health have attached importance to the agreements reached with the CMA in November, February and May.
Drug 2 per day can reduce heart attack threat
Officials have suggested that a drug per day of 2 pounds per day should be rolled out to more patients and that the medication time is extended, after which thousands of heart patients will benefit from the drug.
Anticoagulate can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease.
The drug, which lasts for 12 months after a heart attack, can reduce the risk of stroke or re-emission of heart disease.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE), a supervisory arm of the NHS, recommends that patients continue to take their medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now, NHS watchdog NICE has recommended giving patients a sustained four years of medication in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people develop heart disease every year, and a quarter of them will continue to experience a recurrence of heart disease or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the formation of plaques by the deposition of fatty substances in the walls of artery walls.
If the plaque is disconnected, it can cause blood clots, which in turn can hinder the flow of blood into the heart, leading to a heart attack.
If the blood clot moves, it enters the bloodstream, hindering the flow of blood into the brain, causing a stroke.
In patients who have already experienced a heart attack, the risk of heart attack is higher.
Ticagre is made by British company AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, which can reduce the risk of morbidity by reducing the formation of blood clots.
The NICE guidance, released today, recommends that patients take 90 mg of tygrare for 12 months for 12 months, and take 60mgt to Carreg and twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: "Despite effective secondary prevention treatments, up to a quarter of patients with a history of heart attacks can develop or stroke again, often with serious consequences."
The fear of recurrence can have a great negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence suggests that taking it with aspirin in ticagreine can effectively reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence and stroke in patients who have experienced a heart attack.
We are gratified that the temporary recommendation for ticagray will provide more treatment options for thousands of people who have benefited.
Due to limited information on the efficacy and safety of ticagray after three years, in particular the risk of bleeding, the draft guidance does not recommend that it continue to be treated after this period.
Computer culture makes ‘ election fraud ’ popular Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was vetted from office last year over corruption, prompting the publication of a government report.
The culture of “political correctness ” has turned a blind eye to election fraud widespread in Muslim communities, a deadly government report that reveals today.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former cabinet minister, accused the police, election watchdog and town hall of turning a blind eye to evidence of abuse of the election because of "excessive sensitivity to racial division and religious issues."
The former Secretary of State for Community Affairs and the current anti-corruption chief said that the practice of intimidating religious positions of voters is bad, and the police should be allowed to set up a cordon outside polling stations to protect the frightened voters.
He advised voters to carry ID documents when they vote to confirm their identity.
At the moment, voters only need to report their names and addresses.
The report even recommends wiping ink on voters' fingers to prevent someone from voting twice.
Sir Eric said the protection of whistleblowers should be increased.
He called for greater media access to parliamentary documentation and the way in which non-official committees or working groups were made.
“It ’ s not just about guarding election fraud, it ’ s about protecting local governments from widespread culture of corruption and the poison of financial fraud closely linked to it, ” he said.
The report was made after the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London, when Downing Street demanded.
Last year, a special election court ruled that there was a cascade of corruption and violations in Rahman, the incumbent mayor, and that there should be a vindication of corruption and delegations.
The court found that Rahman had "very ludicrously abused" the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and kept a word of mouth about the accusations that the sword referred to him as racial discrimination and Islamophobbe.
It is said that Rahman "declares in the election campaign to vote for him as a religious duty of loyal Muslims."
As many as 300 ballots are suspicious, and it may be that voters impersonate others to vote.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of election fraud across the country.
He specifically warned of election fraud by mail, and it is said that senior members of the Muslim community are said to have put pressure on voters to press for their designated candidates to vote.
Sir Eric (in the photo) gave a number of recommendations to clean up the voting mechanism, including bringing a good ID to confirm his identity.
“In the report, he said: “The evidence shows that senior members, particularly in the context of Pakistan and Bangladesh, have put pressure on vulnerable groups in some minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote as they wish. ”
"Because of the oversensitivity to racial division and religious 'political correctness', they fear that state institutions will turn a blind eye to such behaviour."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the electoral mechanism, including a ban on political activists dealing with mail-in voting documents to stop "voting gains rattles ethers
The report also calls for a rigorous investigation of registration information to prevent voter rolls from being used for immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa May is also considering the report.
The recommendations include requiring voters to show ID documents before voting.
After the vote, it is unwiped with ink on the voter's finger to prevent someone from voting twice.
Systematic verification of the ethnic affiliation of voters to ensure voting eligibility.
The period of validity of the automatic mail-in voting request is set for three years.
Political activists and activists are prohibited from handling completed mail-in voting and mail-in voting envelopes.
Police were authorized to set up a cordon around polling stations.
The amendment of the provisions of the law has made it easier to charge the perpetrators of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983.
It is illegal to take photos at polling stations.
Provision is made for English only at polling stations (except for the Welsh region).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff strictly enforces the "publders go to the polling room alone" provisions.
Sir Eric lambasted the Metropolitan Police, saying they had not made any criminal charges after the Tower Hamlets incident, which was truly "surprised rattle ratisty
“Rahman and his electoral officers have a number of corruption and violations, and as a result, they have been requalified by the Electoral Tribunal, ’ LM ’ s said.
By standard of criminal proof, he is in doubt in many ways unquestionably guilty.
He also criticized the town hall's election registration department for the "ticking box inspection" in the form of a false "ticking box check".
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court's verdict against Tower Hamlets sounded the alarm for everyone."
Our country has a glorious tradition of “mother of parliaments ”, but it is a matter of concern and a strong reputation for some institutions that are secretly involved in electoral fraud and post facto claims.

On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald's comment on 14-year-old junior Ei to get the fourth place in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay race stirred over a viewing audience live by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Olympic live broadcast
A narrator at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation CBC said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimming junior would "swim faster in the race when it set off than the stench, and finally" but it was slow like a pig, "after the CBC was forced to apologize for it."
Commentator Byron Macdonald, who made some of his own opinion at the end of the Women's 4x200m Freestyle Rearsion final, was when he thought his microphone had turned off.
Audiences heard the CBC narrator team, the Byron, who wore a "colored glasses" critic, saying: "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
Because it was so agitated, it began to swim faster than the stench, but then it was as slow as a head pig.
It's a lot of money for her.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yi is the second stick, and the time of the 1 minute 57 seconds 79th of the time, Taylor Ruck, who lags behind Canada for 1.61 seconds, has then caused the Canadian team to narrow the gap with China.
The entire audience in Canada was stunned by the narrator's tone and wording, and they quickly reacted on the web.
Emmett Macfarlane pushed: "The CBC narrator says that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'slowly like a pig'??? .
This idiot didn't realize it was on the live broadcast.
Chinese junior Chinese junior who participated in the final of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay was described as described as "the 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
The criticism of Bylan Macdonald on Twitter quickly surfaced on Twitter, and many asked it to withdraw from the comment.
When Twitter users heard that Bylan Macdonald had a sluggish reaction to this, they didn't stop.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wow # Bylan Macdonald.
What you represent is CBC and Canada, and your words and actions make it all sound like a bunch of racists. #

We are so sorry to say that and live it out.
Last night, we moved quickly to apologize to viewers watching our livestreams and to the audience who followed us on social media.

Primark customer expresses anger at a woman brazenly trying on underpants in the store
A woman undressed on-site in the middle of a Primark store on the spot, and the insider's customers did not know where to look.
To make matters worse, she also looked how she looked after putting it on herself, and then took the underwear off and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves and eventually tried on four panties in the store in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The woman kept trying on underwear in this Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone and then back on the shelves
Jenny Davidson, who was also in the store, said that after trying on underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed up again, and then went out of the store and bought nothing."
She said, "Everyone can't believe what they saw."
She stood in the middle of the store, removed a pair of underwear from the shelf, took off her leggings and underwear, and put it on.
"She didn't try to find a hidden place to try it on the tethers, she just stood there, it's outrageous."
"When she took the underwear off again, everyone was stunned. Obviously, she was still not satisfied because she put the underwear back on the shelf."
After that, she tried three like this, and finally found that it was not her favorite, and then got dressed again and went out of the store.
“She doesn ’ t seem to care if anyone is watching her in her, or doesn ’ t even think about who ’ s going to end up buying the underwear she ’ s trying through. ”
Ms. Davidson, who lives in Kent town (33 years old), said: "It's sick to think that someone would buy the underpants that other people had worn and had not been cleaned."
It happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "After she left, the clerk obviously had to do the off-the-shelf handling of these underwear, but so good."
"I hate to buy a new trouser home, but I've found another woman trying through and hasn't been cleaned."
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark already knew what happened on Tuesday, August 9th, in our Folkestone store."
All problematic goods have been removed.
How to use magmatical in a gun attack to protect yourself
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com may give you a little security.
We asked Rhon Mizrachi, a master of the Krava Federation in New York, to learn how to deal with gunmen up close.
Whether he's from the front or behind you, the video will teach you how to turn to victory.
Mizrachi said that if the gunman approached you from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and "clear the fire line loomed 燨
Then, hold a gun with your forearm and shoulders, and then hit the attacker in your elbow in your face.
Next, with the knee to its groin, when the attacker bent down because of pain, reversed the gun in his hand, punched him in the face with a barrel and a backup gun, keeping the weapon right behind him.
If the gunman is close from the front, it also uses similar tricks to get your body out of the line of fire, seize the gun and turn the gun at the muzzle so that the gunman can't fire.
Meanwhile, the weight was pressed on the gun and hit the attacker's chest, and the muzzle from his clasped hand to reverse the muzzle, then pointed the muzzle at him.
Does it sound complicated?
Check out the video to see how Mizrachi did it.
But remember, if you're not a master of Maga, the safest way to get rid of robbery is to hand over cash.
A rogue family destroyed a low-cost rental in Soltash, Cornwall, before being evicted
A rogue family, who had been evicted by terrorizing a neighbour, had bashed the low-rent housing it had before he left, causing a £50,000 loss.
After being met with a long list of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were driven out of a low-cost rental in Soltash, Cornwall.
After being forcibly removed from the residence, housing association officials were surprised to find that the site was severely damaged.
There were holes everywhere on the walls, the floors were ripped, the garbage was littered with all, and the crass of the painted walls were.
The family has been moving since being evicted and is said to be currently living in a private home
Donna McEvoy, a housing manager at the Cornwall Housing Association, said she was concerned the house could no longer be saved.
"For the people who live here, this is a nightmare, I don't think people can live like this."
There are a lot of things to weigh now, because this house is likely to be a not-so-element of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and their names are equally notorious.
The couple had three sons who would live here from time to time. Police said the family's terrorist acts included the use of baseball bats to fight in the streets, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug trafficking, shouting, quarreling and swearing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant, named Skeldon, received an anti-social behavior resolution.
In this house that could be demolished, many rooms are filled with trash for a long time
In this room that had ever traded drugs, the floor was set off.
Neighbours said they often saw them fighting on the streets and also often called the police as a result
After giving 11 weeks of extension to them to move voluntarily out, the Cornwall Houses Association forcibly removed her from the residence with her husband this week.
At last the relieved neighbors cheered, and they said that life before is simply hell on earth.
A neighbor said, "They don't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and have been so bad.
We ’ ve seen the police go to the door countless times.
"We can't sleep this morning."
We got up early because it was so quiet here, as it's so quiet, we're not used to it!
They're finally gone, it's great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive manager of the Cornwall Housing Association, said the family had not been able to cooperate with the local government.
The family lived in the house for 20 years and the police often visited
Garbage and old toys are thrown on the side of the low-rental rent.
He added: "Regrettably, the tenant was not held responsible for her actions with her family and that eviction was the last practice of the Cornwall Housing Association."
It's a very difficult case to deal with because their behaviour is very extreme, and what they do must make the neighbors feel all the fear.
I thank the team for the work I did and to the Devonshire Police and the community members who bravely provided us with information.
I hope that this move will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that we will not tolerate anti-social behaviour.
Mr Fitzpatrick said his three sons had lived in the house at various times, but also said they were only in their 20s.
After they were driven away, a dirty mattress was also thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms.
Housing Association workers will soon clean up piles of rubbish around the house
In 2014, police searched the house, found more than 70 grams of marijuana, and found the balance, the drug paraphernalia and the £1,700 in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of Class B drugs and drug trafficking.
She claims the money was used to buy a gravestone for the son Lee Skeldon who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is understood that after the homelessness, Thanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of the rooms are painted with graffiti.
Police said they would evict tenants who defy tenants against tenants' rules.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the evictions issued a clear warning to other tenants who continue to defy tenants' rules.
"This warning is aimed at those who believe their actions will not be blamed, and those devastated by this behavior, ” she said.
Devonshire and Cornwall Police will no longer be tolerant of crime and anti-social behaviour, and they will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Reid: Hillary Clinton will nominate Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he was certain that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was elected president, she would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated Garland in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would choose the man to succeed the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a conference call Thursday that he predicted Hillary would choose "some credibility" for Gallant.
A spokeswoman for Reed then said that Mr. Reid had not nominated Garland to speak directly with Hillary, saying he was just speculating.
He praised Garland's exodus and said Hillary's team didn't want the new picks to "roast ."
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid says Republicans who block Garland's nomination are the "favorites" of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and "achiere of achievement engraved ," Reid said.
He said Trump is not fit to be president.
Treats: The nudity calendar "both men and women love"
Treats will work with photographer David Bellemere to take a set of 2017 calendars inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
This time, they plan to find a new generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar, rather than the famous nude man.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, said earlier this year that their nudity-based magazine was different from the old-school Playboy because "the latter is aimed at men."
And we are for women.
Obviously, he thinks the same is true of this set of calendars.
“We need to show the timeless and classic nudity that women and men feel at ease, and this time, ” said Alad Shaw at a calendar presentation.
Women will be happy to participate in this film because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photo requests online or to publicly recruit in person in Los Angeles and New York.

French court rejects petition to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a petition by the Calais government to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the "jungle" refugee camp, which currently houses thousands of refugees.
At the court's hearing this week, the Calais government argued that the French government should have the power to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops in the camp. People sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, provide haircuts in these shops in the camps, and sell basic meals at 50 cents (40p) prices in temporary restaurants or at a price of a few euros.
The Governor's Office of Calais believes that these places should be dismantled because they are a parallel economy that is not taxed, and there are also fire and health hazards.
Humanitarian groups, on the other hand, have said to the courts that these shops and restaurants are extremely important because the free food provided by state-backed associations and other groups simply cannot meet the needs of the growing refugees in the camp.
They say the makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
A Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the operators of the 72 temporary shops, but said the concerns of the Governor Calais were "entirely understandable to the rave"
Judge Jean ·François Molla said the role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants goes far beyond simply providing food to refugees who "live in extremely dangerous conditions."
He said the places were a calm confluence between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places where the demolition was threatened was the "Jungle Book Kids" cafe in the refugee camp, which offers 200 food, English and French lessons per day, and provides shelter advice to hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the cafe.
A letter to The Guardian's Guardian, wrote that closing the cafe "would be a catacly mark for these children (a lot of children are just eight years old)."
The two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, projected Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle camps had broken through 9000, the highest level since the number of refugees surged in the summer.
"This five thousand yuan of funding, to solve my urgent need."

“The environmental problems are manifested in atmospheric, water, soil pollution, but the root is still in the production lifestyle.
For example, in 2015, Jiangsu Province's land development was as high as 21%, ranking as the highest in the country's provinces and autonomous regions.
Therefore, the problem of high pollution, large energy and occupation of land has not been fundamentally dealt with from the transformation of production and lifestyle.
On the one hand, from the perspective of the effectiveness of the creation of various ecological environment at all levels in Jiangsu Province, it ranks first in the country with absolute advantages; on the other hand, the resource environment carries great pressure.
To solidly promote the protection and governance of the ecological environment, we need to fundamentally promote the transformation of production and lifestyle, and promote the transformation and benefit people's livelihood with the construction of ecological civilization.

Qingdao is the 12th largest pilot city in the country and the first pilot city in Shandong Province for the paid use and trading of sewage rights.
On the 11th, a number of enterprises came to Qingdao Municipal Soil Pollution Trading Center to submit the sewage right to purchase, and the requisition will pay the paid use fee after the application is accepted.
The upcoming completion of the first order also indicates that the pilot work of the Qingdao sewage rights trading has officially kicked off, which will also be the first order of the province's sewage rights trading and the first order of the national urban sewage rights trading.
On the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuang Tao Fine Chemical (Group) Co., Ltd., came to Qingdao Municipal Soil Pollution Trading Center to submit the sewage right to purchase.
The company's factory in Qingdao's old town was completely discontinued at the end of last year, and the environmental protection was relocated to the new plant of Pingdu.
After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form and the environmental impact report of the construction project, Qingdao Municipal Emissions Reserve and Trading Service Center began to conduct a preliminary examination of the application materials.
According to the collection standards determined by the price, finance and other departments in Qingdao City, the current estimated initial sewage rights use fee is about 64.12 million yuan, and the staff will complete the approval within seven working days.
The upcoming completion of the first trading order also indicates the official opening of the Qingdao sewage rights trading pilot work, will also be the province's first sewage rights trading and the first order of the national city-level sewage rights trading.
Zhao Xiuping said that at present, the environmental protection of enterprises has invested in 4 billion, the amount is huge on the surface, but the business management philosophy and social benefits have a great impact on the business management concept and social benefits, and has also opened up space for enterprise innovation management.
On the same day, Qingdao Quanxiang Zhizhuo Bus Parts Co., Ltd. also purchased the right of sewage for the annual production of 4200 high-speed rail and EMU interior accessories project.
The project belongs to the machining enterprise, the application of the initial sewage removal rights for chemical oxygen demand (COD)0.514 tons / year, ammonia nitrogen (NOX) 0.052 tons / year.
The right of air pollutants to be used and traded for the city's power and heat production supply key industrial enterprises.
Before January 1, 2016, the existing sewage units that have obtained the environmental assessment have not levy paid royalties.
"Reserving the right to discharge sewage does not mean the right to obtain the right to illegally discharge sewage, and can not discharge pollutants at will."
Han Hongyan, deputy director of the Qingdao Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, said that if illegal sewage discharge and excessive sewage discharges are still punishable in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises to circumvent the punishment by purchasing the right of sewage.
That is to say, through legal means to crack down on environmental violations, severely punish enterprises' excessive sewage behavior, so as to protect the environment and protect public health.
Now enterprises for their own interests, improve the enthusiasm for pollution control, cherish the limited right of sewage, reduce pollutant emissions.
Driven by economic interests, reducing pollutant emissions has changed from the government's coercive behavior to the self-conscious market behavior of enterprises, so as to truly achieve the purpose of protecting the environment, protecting nature and protecting public health.
The right to discharge sewage, also known as the "emission right", is the right to emit pollutants, which means that the emission of the emitter has the right to discharge pollutants to the environment within the quota allocated by the government.
This right is essentially the right of the sewer to the possession, use and benefit of the environmental capacity resources.
In the next step, under the premise that the total amount of pollutant emissions does not exceed the allowed emissions, the internal pollution sources are transferred to each other through currency exchange.
Since the introduction of the U.S. economist Dales in 1968, the United States has applied it to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources in the 1970s.
China has been piloting since 2007, and there are currently 14 provinces (autonomous regions and cities) such as Zhejiang and Jiangsu.
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, in order to assist the six strategic bombers in carrying out air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria, multiple Russian warplanes have been promoted from the Hememym Air Base in Syria to provide support.
On February 22 this year, the United States and Russia reached an agreement on a ceasefire between the parties to the conflict in Syria, which began to be implemented since the 27th of that month.
Under the deal, the cease-fire does not include military strikes against terrorist groups designated by the U.N. Security Council, such as the Islamic State "Support Front."
Russia will continue to build relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of Russian soldiers will be guaranteed accordingly.
He also said that if extremist forces are not to be targeted, these forces will extend to Russia.
Although Russia and the West have not reached an agreement on jointly fighting extremist forces in Syria, Russia will strengthen cooperation with Syria, Iran, Iraq and other aspects in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia began a military strike against extremist forces in Syria at the invitation of the Syrian government.

Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: "handsy" began shooting the road career several times after "reversal"
Zhang Donghong, who is in Xiamen Xiang'an District, had just replaced the old TV of his home for a 65-inch large TV a few days ago.
The average farmer's daughter is Zhang Binbin, who won the silver medal in the silver medal of the women's 50m rifle final for China at the Rio Olympics on the evening of the 11th.
On the night of the 11th, just in front of this new TV, Zhang Donghong and his wife and dozens of relatives and friends witnessed the amazing process of her daughter all the way up, from almost preliminating to the magical process of almost reversing.
In the day's competition, Zhang Binbin once ranked in the middle and lower reaches, and it seems that he was far away from the final.
But the parents and friends did not give up, kept brushing the text live, saw that as the other players finished, Zhang Binbin's famous leveled all the way up, and finally locked the final seat, and his home suddenly broke out from a burst of cheers.
In the final, Zhang Binbin was in the case of the ranking at a time, and the last few shots became more and more stable, and only won the silver medal with the trailing champion 0.2 ring.
Zhang Binbin, who is already 27 years old this year, has almost rubbed himself with this hard-won silver medal in 16 years of shooting career, in fact, a few times.
His mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told reporters that just when they hesitated, Zhang Binbin came to the same village for several "fiction dragons."
These "votes" are the same village children who were recommended for training at the same time, including Zhang Binbin's cousin.
Shortly after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once took the initiative to return to Xiang'an's school for reasons such as family difficulties.
But after his enlightenment coach Zhang Yajie repeatedly did the work, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang Binbin had returned home again because he had been unable to enter the national team because he could not see hope.
This time, not only coach Zhang Yajie, Xiamen shooting archery sports center and Fujian provincial team leaders and coaches have come to the home, and finally persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team.
Just like yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl's use of persistence to achieve a reversal on the road of shooting.
"Each coach to pick players in a different way, when I saw that the good hand is very beautiful, it suddenly came together."
Zhang Donghong also recalled that in the training test, although the daughter's results were not the best, the number of hits was very stable, which is also an important reason for Zhang Binbin's attraction to the coach.
In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie was most impressed by the investment of the farm girl.
He recalled that Zhang Binbin entered the Xiamen shooting team for more than a year, and the team carried out a long-term gun training, asking the team members to move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well-behaved child, and since childhood, he has loved to draw and make homemade handmade toys.
"It turns out that I will make clothes at home, stitches to make up, and I'll pick up some corners and dolls."
She said that her daughter would often sewed manual toys herself, plus she was good at drawing, from the five senses of the doll to the dress, always do it vividly.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and his family gathered more, only the holidays can go home, usually by telephone contact.
Parents said that whether they met or called, Zhang Binbin rarely said that he had worked hard, and it was more about talking about something happy with his parents.
Usually do not see the daughter, the parents at home the daughter's childhood paintings and the honors of the past years are carefully stored.
Zhang Xiaolong showed her daughter's moving cartoons to reporters, "If she hadn't been a shooting athlete, she should continue to paint dras up."
In the second-floor living room of Zhang Binbin's house, there is a cabinet full of medals, medals and certificates she has received.
Zhang Donghong will be neatly placed medals and medals, the certificate is uniformly put into the folder to save, "these are polite for more than ten years of heartache in exchange for the honor, we cherish."

According to Hong Kong's "Oriental Daily" reported on August 12th, there are currently three major problems in mainland diamond sales, including the netness of false diamonds pushing up the price, the weight of the fake diamond, and the lack of after-sales protection.
Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers, where the diamond cutting technology of local artisans is well known, and the diamonds sold are closely identified and popular with the mainland ladies.
"A small cloth bag, held in hand, a small group of light, worth nearly a million yuan", a young mother who participated in the purchase of diamonds, to describe her experience in Antwerp in June this year to the mainland media.
She said that she hid her diamonds in her underwear, went to the toilet for a few days, took the bath, and was very nervous to walk to sleep.
She claims that the diamonds bought in Antwerp are at a price of about fifty-five thousand yuan per car, and the same quality diamond has a retail price of about eleven thousand yuan in Xiamen.
She recently added two percent of the purchase price, all the diamonds she bought were sold, and made two hundred thousand yuan a lot at a time.
According to the regulations of the Mainland Customs, diamonds are not passengers in the travel supplies or necessities, so they belong to the category of goods, and they need to be declared when they are in the country, otherwise they may be listed for smuggling, and the situation can be seriously sentenced to imprisonment.
According to foreign media reports, on the 10th local time, the British Prime Minister's Office Downing Street announced that British Prime Minister Theresa May will spend the summer vacation in Switzerland, but did not disclose the specific vacation location.
Some media said that after the Brexit vote, the new British prime minister chose to go to the "neutral country" on the European continent for a holiday in Switzerland, with some kind of policy symbolism.
Britain's Guardian newspaper commented that the symbolism represented by the neutral country in Switzerland played a role in the choice of the British prime minister's first holiday destination.
The British "Daily Telegraph" commented that Theresa May chose to go on holiday to Switzerland, which is the first time since Margaret Thatcher that the British Prime Minister has gone on holiday to Switzerland.
The choice of two female prime ministers and the two male prime ministers, Blair and Cameron, liked to go to a hotter holiday to a more hotter place.
It is reported that Britain's new prime minister, Theresa May, will return to London on August 24th, after which she is waiting for her is a series of important jobs and activities.
The British Parliament will resume meeting on September 5th, and the topics debated include the online request for a second Brexit referendum.

China's Mars program is coming
China's Mars exploration mission should be a one-time orbit, landing, and inspection, which has never been seen in a foreign country.
The goal of China's Mars exploration launch is to want to be a step around, landing, and patrolling, and this mission is quite difficult.
Because it takes 26 months to encounter a window of time for Mars exploration, experts are closely developing engineering plans to try to launch China's first Mars probe at this window in 2020.
According to Xu Dazhe, although China's aircraft has entered deep space, the completion of the Mars exploration mission is still indispensable, and the exploration of Mars means that China has entered the era of deep space exploration in a true sense.
"Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth, and launching a Mars rover at this point in time is the most energy-efficient for the launch vehicle."
"Considering the quality of the Mars rover, it will be completed by China's Long March V carrier rocket."
China's Mars exploration mission to achieve a circumnavigation, landing, patrol, this form from abroad from there is no time, once proposed to achieve the orbit and landing, but the landing failed.
Mars exploration involves a lot of technical fields, and the special point is that although the rover is a space probe, it has a distinct feature compared with the general space probe.
That is to say, the Mars rover must have the ability to determine the driving route and find the danger of obstacles.
Pang Zhihao, a researcher at the Fifth Academy of China Aerospace Science and Technology Group, said that the reason why mankind is so favored by Mars exploration is because it has important scientific and technological significance and many other aspects of the exploration of Mars, and even related to the future of mankind.
At present, Mars has become the most studied planet other than the earth, and the history of human exploration using space probes for Mars exploration has been running through almost all of human space history.
As a result, humanity hopes to one day establish a residential base on Mars and eventually migrate to Mars, turning it into a second home for humanity.
A large number of indications also suggest that Mars, as it used to be the case with the present Earth, has only evolved over billions of years to become a thin atmosphere, lower temperatures, and depletion of water sources.
Therefore, the exploration or manned landing on Mars for research can be proposed for a second Mars to prevent the earth from becoming a difficult human to survive.
As of June 2016, a total of 114 lunar explorations and 43 Mars explorations were conducted worldwide.
However, since the 1990s, humans have carried out a total of 18 Mars explorations, and lunar explorations have been carried out only 14 times.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two rovers working, but only one Lunar Orbiter and one lunar lander are working.
The world's space powers have developed a Mars system-targeted exploration program, which can be seen that today's Mars exploration is hotter than lunar exploration.
On November 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars rover "Mangalian", which became the first country in Asia to successfully explore Mars.
Mankaryian is used to study the surface, atmospheric and mineral characteristics of Mars to find out whether there are methane and signs of life on Mars.
The most difficult part of this mission is that the pneumatic shape and parachute slowed down after the probe enters the Martian atmosphere.
According to Sun Zezhou, the chief designer of the Mars rover in the overall department of the five-courts of China Aerospace Science and Technology Group, the Mars exploration mission faces many technical challenges.
Mars' atmospheric pressure is very low, only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on the Earth's surface, and there is a high degree of uncertainty.
Scientists have not yet had a thorough understanding of factors such as its changes and the characteristics of the storm.
Mars often forms dust storms similar to Earth's dusty weather in the summer, which will cause the rover to receive a sharp drop in the solar energy, and must design a "dormant" mode for the rover to wait patiently for the dust storm to pass.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a role in reducing the light of the sun, which poses a difficult problem for the energy supply of Mars exploration.
This requires that the probe's solar wing area is larger, and it is necessary to constantly adjust and strive to be in the direction of the sun.
Also, the gravity of the Martian surface is only 38% of Earth, but the gravity is mostly above the lunar surface, so the probe needs more power.
"The most central and most difficult place for this Mars exploration mission is that the pneumatic shape and parachute deceleration process after the probe enters the Martian atmosphere, and there is only one chance to ensure success."
Sun Zezhou said that because the distance between Earth and Mars, the whole process cannot be controlled in real time by the ground, so it must be completed independently by the probe.
Since there are not so many propellants to offset such a high speed, when landing on Mars, it depends on the role of the Martian atmosphere, but it is difficult for the Martian atmosphere to simulate on the ground.
Pang Zhishao said that in general, the way to explore Mars is similar to the way it is to explore the moon, and it is also "rounding, falling, patrolling, and returning", and ultimately achieving the goal of manned landing on Mars.
Because Mars is much further a lot farther from Earth than the moon, it is difficult to detect Mars to conquer a range of more complex technologies.
According to Taiwanese media reports, the "Executive Director" of Taiwan's "Executive Director" Lin Quan announced yesterday morning that "the regulations on improper acquisition of property by political parties and their affiliated organizations" have come into force since today.
Zhan Qixian, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, said, "A more than one hundred years of history, the commitment and responsibility of society, will not collapse in the loom
Lin Quan stressed that if political parties, accompanying organizations or trustees violate the provisions of the regulations prohibiting punishment, the commission will investigate ex officio and punish them "in accordance with the law".
Lin also announced that the deputy chairman of the party production committee will be appointed by the deputy director of the "CNICAC" Hong Bacon.
He said that Gu Lixiong's role as the main committee of improper party property committees is the only candidate, and using Hong Bacon's experience in examining related major cases in the past will serve as the basis for the committee to inventory relevant improper party property cases.
Zhan Qixian believes that as long as there is still party property today, no one will give you donations to the society, if the party is confiscated, the Kuomintang can just ask for social support and sponsorship, "today there is really no opportunity to go to commere."
Zhan Qixian also stressed that even after the improper party property regulations came to the road, the Kuomintang Party's property was not fully confiscated and confiscated, and the rest would still be donated according to the promise, so that the party's production should be zeroed out, and the party would have to start from scratch.
Original title: "Room Doctor" Lan Yuefeng against CCTV host Wang Zhi'an reputation infringement lost in the first instance
Legal Evening News According to CCTV Host Wang Zhi'an's speech on the "corridor doctor" incident on Sina Weibo, Lan Yuefeng v. Wang Zhian and Beijing Micron Innovation Network Technology Co., Ltd. sued the court.
Yesterday afternoon, the Haidian court handed down the sentence in the case, and the judgment found that Wang Zhi'an and Wei Meng Company did not constitute infringement, and dismissed all of Lan Yuefeng's claims.
At the beginning of 2014, CCTV reporter Wang Zhi'an investigation found that although the Lan Yuefeng, who had sat in the hospital corridor for more than 600 days, was shaped by the media as a sad hero suppressed by the system, there was a lot of false information in these reports.
On March 29, 2014, the "Room Doctor" program produced by CCTV News Survey was broadcast.
There is no evidence to support the various so-called excessive medical information reported by Lan Yuefeng to the media.
Wang Zhi'an also described in the micro-blog of real-name authentication, describing "the reason why Lan Yuefeng has reached this point is the character, which has obvious paranoia and so on."
Lan Yuefeng asked Wang Zhi'an to delete the microblog, apologize to him and compensate him for the compensation of moral damage of one hundred thousand yuan.
During the trial at that time, the two sides debated whether Wang Zhi'an violated the right of reputation of Lan Yuefeng.
12th look at point: track and field Chinese team is very busy women's football four bicycles look forward to break through
The bicycle is expected to achieve the Olympic gold medal "zero breakthrough", and the women's football girl will challenge the two world champion Germany team, looking forward to the cold rush into the top four.
Wang Zhen's status has been outstanding for nearly two seasons, and last year's Beijing Athletics World Championships won the silver medal, and the group competition in the world championships in May this year was upgraded to the individual project championship.
According to foreign media reports, 27-year-old South Korean archery player Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in the women's archery individual competition, and won the Olympic gold medal after the team competition to become the double crown.
Zhang Huizhen is considered to be a big latecomer, she once regretted not receiving tickets for the last London Olympics, but now proudly standing on the top podium of the Rio Olympics.
Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in the women's archery individual final at the women's archery individual final at the gymnasium of Rio Samba Avenue in Brazil by a total score of 6-2 to defeat Germany's basra.
She was only the first to shoot in the fourth grade of elementary school, and until the age of 27 won the individual gold medal for the first time at the World Cup in 2014, and was a late-ranked player.
Zhang Huizhen recalled, "There was no level before secondary school, so that it was impossible to participate in the national competition."
Zhang Huizhen won only fourth place in the London Olympic runners selection four years ago, regretting losing Olympic tickets, and can only sit by ascuff colleagues and friends Qi Fub to win two gold medals.
Zhang Huizhen talked about his golden speech after the women's archery individual competition award ceremony, "Until the end is as soon as possible to shoot arrows, which may have brought good results and satisfaction."
Twenty-eight-year-old South Korean archery "one sister", London Olympic archery individual gold medal winner Chi Fube won the bronze medal.
Chivbe lost to Zhang in the semifinals, competing for bronze with Mexican player Alicandra Valencia.
Chivbe after ensuring the bronze medal tearful tears on the field, during which the silent burden of gold can be imagined.
The first is that the coaching team has accumulated a wealth of experience in continuous research, followed by scientific training methods, which all require long-term accumulation.
The archery team helps the team to concentrate and keep a normal mind by means of military training and crossing the cemetery at night.
Although it has not been confirmed, many sources have said that Apple's autumn 2016 conference will be held in September, and the iPhone7 is really coming.
Although Apple did not respond, the features and configuration of the new iPhone have been released, and even the iPhone7 "true machine model" pictures have been released on the Internet.
The new generation of iPhone can be described as "all-disible", hot, tight, rich and no goods... If you want to buy authentic products for the first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suning.
This has exacerbated people's disappointment with the new phone, "It's lengthened, but it can't project holographic images at all! This generation of iPhone sucks."
The iPhone7, like other iPhones, was accompanied by countless secrets before birth.
In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new iPhone will cancel the 3.5mm headset interface and switch to Bluetooth connection and charging interface, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker.
Another piece of evidence that can support this news is that as early as 2014, Apple allowed headphones manufacturers to produce headset products connected through charging interfaces.
These messages, either true or false, the answer won't be revealed until Apple's 2016 Fall Press Conference.
But that doesn ’ t stop the industry from bullish on the iPhone7 prospect, many believe that the iPhone7 will likely become Apple ’ s last major upgrade to the iPhone series.
Although the data released by the market research institute IDC recently, the iPhone's market share has declined.
Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained Apple's stock "buy" rating, while analysts at the BMO believe the iPhone7 will reap a historic sales score.
At the same time, Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom, also said that Apple's future revenue increase is likely to exceed 20%, which is completely due to the launch of the iPhone7.
Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to buy an iPhone7, compared with just 4 percent of the people planning to buy iPhone6 two years ago.
It is understood that there are 20% of the current user base holding the iPhone6 or 6Plus plan to buy iPhone7, which is a fairly high proportion.
Secondly, there are expert analysis, most of the fruit powder like to replace their own iPhone.
According to statistics, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for two years, that is, almost 1.2 billion users of iPhones have been in use for two years.
Some media said that during the production of iPhone7, Taiwan suffered several earthquakes, "the extent of the damage to TSMC's production facilities is beyond imagination, and it may have an impact on the initial iPhone7 supply."
Supply and demand contradictions will affect the average user, it is time to choose a good channel, the first low price to start the original iPhone7.
According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning executives and Apple met frequently, in order to prepare sufficient supplies.
Operators have negotiated with Suning, and it is foreseeable that with the in-depth cooperation between the two sides, it will inevitably bring lower prices and more intimate services to users.
“At the lowest price, consumers may ‘ buy iPhone7 in just seven dollars a day. ’ ”
There are plenty of supplies and a variety of offers, so that the purchase of iPhone7 is no longer "pressure mountain", and Suning's logistics, but also will turn this beauty into a more intuitive sense of experience.
Maybe, you'll get a call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Suning E-commerce, your iPhone7 is here."
Through the cultural relics exhibition, the organizers hope to let the local people learn more about the long-established Chinese culture, thus enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.

According to foreign media reports, due to the diving pool water from blue to green, the Rio Olympic "green pool" incident has attracted much attention in recent days.
However, on the morning of the 10th, the water of the pool of water ball games adjacent to the diving pool also turned green.
The Australian water polo player said after the game that his eyes felt tingling and wanted to shed tears.
Previously, Rio's official personnel confirmed the situation of the water turning green of the pool, saying that the color of the pool water is due to the weak alkaline nature and does not affect the health of the athletes.
But Australian athletes said after winning a match with the Japanese team at the pool of water polos, the eyes felt tingling.
At the earliest after the diving pool water turned green, the competition organizers worked overtime to deal with the diving pool problem on the 9th night, but found that the color of the polo pool also changed rapidly on the morning of the 10th.
During the match between Australia and the Japanese team, the environmental conditions of the water polo pool gradually deteriorated, but the official stressed that they would return the water quality of the two pools to their original color on the 11th.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Olympics, said: "Yesterday afternoon, the alkaline degree in the diving pool weakened first."
“We ’ ve learned a range of reasons that may cause the discoloration of pool water and the alkalinity of water quality. ”
The water sports center has carried out a series of tests on water quality, and hundreds of divers and swimmers have used the pool to determine the water quality conditions to meet the standards. ”
"We've been going through the normal procedures these days, but we may have overlooked the impact more athletes could have on water quality."
"But the change in water color must definitely have no impact on health, especially for athletes."
"This independent team confirmed our assessment and confirmed the measures we have taken to restore the pool to normal color and normal chemistry."
“We had hoped that the pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected due to the rain. ”

On the morning of August 12th, the Information Office of the State Council held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016.
Spokesperson of the National Bureau of Statistics and director of the National Economic Comprehensive Statistics Department said that in July, the growth rate of some indicators of the national economy slowed down, but still running within a reasonable range.
The data released by the National Bureau of Statistics shows that the growth rate of fixed asset investment and the total import volume fell back in July.
Sheng said that on the operation of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow the words the Prime Minister once said, "There are fluctuations, the situation is still good, which can better summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July."
He explained that "shape fluctuation" refers to the growth rate of some economic indicators in July.
Because the economy at home and abroad is still in a deep adjustment in July, the international situation is complex and volatile, and the recovery of the world economy is not as expected, so the export pressure is still relatively large.
From the domestic situation, the entire economy is still in the critical stage of adjustment, the pain of adjustment is being released, and the economy is facing no small downward pressure, so some indicators have fluctuated.
Shenglai pointed out that there is a special situation in July, the flood disaster is more serious, and the hot and hot weather has brought some impact on the production and operation of some areas.
According to the recent release of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people in the country were affected, and the direct economic losses exceeded 200 billion yuan.
From the perspective of industrial, investment, transportation-related indicators, these areas are affected to varying degrees.
The weekly freight transfer growth rate in July fell by 3.6 percentage points compared with the previous month, and the flood disaster has a certain impact on traffic in these areas.
From these factors, it is normal for some indicators to fluctuate in July, and it is also expected.
He said that "the trend is still good" refers to although the economic growth rate has declined, but the overall economic operation is stable, and the general trend of steady progress and steady to good has not changed.
CPI rose 1.8% in July, up 0.2% year-on-year; in July, the CPI rose by 2.1%, so the price situation was generally stable.
According to the statistics of the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau portal for high-temperature weather in various districts and counties, in addition to Toyoyang, the rest of our city can receive high temperature allowances to varying degrees.
At present, at least 28 provinces in the country have clarified the subsidy payment criteria, but the standards issued by provinces and cities are not the same, while Chongqing is receiving high temperature allowance according to the high temperature work day allowance.
3  CPC below 37 ° C, according to the standard of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; above 37 ° C, according to the standard of not less than 15 yuan per person per day.
4 "Rather of the C high-temperature staff can receive a maximum of 20 yuan / day per month (except for the worker has been entitled to the high-temperature post allowance in accordance with the law.
According to this standard, the last month's high temperature weather days the most can receive 330 yuan, the few days of the city mouth is 80 yuan, and the highest temperature of Toyoyang because it does not reach the high temperature standard outside the high temperature standard, so there is no high temperature allowance.
In the past, many units will offset the high temperature allowance with cool drinks, and the Municipal Safety Supervision Bureau said that this behavior is not in line with the current measures.
If the working is stopped due to the high temperature weather and shorten the working hours, the employer shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the worker.
The Municipal People's Social Bureau said that if employees encounter high-temperature operations under high temperature but have not been confiscated, they can fight for legitimate rights and interests through the labor dispute mediation institution where the enterprise is located, or call 12333 to complain.
Where a useful person does not refuse to issue a high temperature allowance, the worker may complain to the competent department of human resources and social security at or above the county level where the employed person is employed.
At the same time, since the high temperature allowance is part of the salary, it is not a benefit, it is necessary to include the total salary and the deduction of taxes.
Therefore, the high temperature allowance is not within the scope of the minimum wage, and must be issued in the form of cash, and cannot be replaced by physical objects such as beverages.

Grecia is a budding female giant toucan, radiating the whiff of the rainforest.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the fartheuctous of the farthe-guchi and its story have long been household names.
At a press conference on August 10th, the post-operative rehabilitation of Grecia finally unveiled to show people its brand-new 3D printed plastic bird beak.
The giant touted the beak and dying canuted by a year and a half ago is now finally reborn.
This day not only announces that it has been 100% healthy, but it moves into the luxury bird house and meets with the human friends who care about it.
Gradia, who first-in-a-home, is slightly coy, but when not a few times it becomes lively, rolling in the basin and eating grapes with a new beak.
In order to remind people that it had suffered injuries, the technicians did not color its new beak, but retained the original white material of the 3D printing material.
Outside the bird's beak is a thin layer of a thin-foliuting squid, inside hollow, with only some fine bone support rod staggered arrangement.
Although there is this internal reinforcement, the beak of the fare is fragile and is broken when it is hurt.
Animal rescue centers, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company worked together to create several "experimental beaks" for Grecia, "finally creating the" perfect beak draulate the "perfect beak drax for it."
Grecia is now proficient in using the new beak to drink water, eat, and even pecked small grains of grain.
"The final design took about two months to print out in just four or five hours."
"3D printing is not the future technology, it has really entered your life," Thomas Lange, chairman of SG3D Printing Company in the United States, said in an interview with Xinhua International.
In January 2015, on a farm in Grecia, the province of Lahouela in central Costa Rica, the giant toutophal Grecia, covered with blood, was discovered.
At that time its upper beak was cruelly broken by a group of young people, it was completely unable to eat, life is in danger.
After the tragic media reports of Grecia, there has been a trendy anti-animal abuse in Costa Rica and beyond.
Stricter animal protection laws are being called for more severe animal protection laws and increased penalties for abusers.
People come spontaneously and do their best to help Grecia try to restore as much as possible to their previously injured life.
Even the inventor of 3D printing technology, Chuck Her, was involved in the design of the beak on Gracia.
"The situation in Grecia is very special, and the rest of its upper beak is less than one centimeter, so it brings many difficulties to installing the new beak."
"We first scan Gracia, and then design and make an extended prosthesis that is slightly longer than the rest of its beak, fixed to its upper beak with a viscose."
"This can reduce further intrusive harm to Grecia," Lange told Xinhua International.
Before installing the prosthesis, the staff had to clean up the beak-breaks for Grecia every day to prevent infection.
A thousand miles away, the story of the Toucanian Grecia has touched the famous documentary filmmaker Paula Eredia and Discovery News Channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded a dot in the process of the installation of the new beak in Grecia, and recorded a documentary, "The Country of the Toucan", which was broadcast on Animal Planet Channel this month.
The documentary "The Country of the Toucan" shows how a tiny toucan can make a country change and how to get the nation involved in the fight against animal cruelty.
Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of China's small independent refinery, known as "teapot."
According to Japanese media reports on August 12th, JX Energy, Japan's largest oil company, believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the downturn."
Japanese oil companies have in particular expressed alarm at the rise of China ’ s small independent refinery, known as a “teapot ”.
The quality of China's petroleum products is gradually approaching Japanese oil products due to the Chinese government's enhanced environmental regulations.
Before obtaining the import license for crude oil, the "teapot refinery" generally imports heavy oil with high sulfur content from Russia and other places for refining it.
The sulfur content of petroleum products produced is high, and the oil is poor, which has become one of the reasons for environmental pollution.
After obtaining the import license for crude oil, the "teapot refinery" was able to import Omani crude oil with a lower sulfur content and Russian crude oil, and the quality of its petroleum products also improved.
Dongming General Petroleum said, "With the continuous improvement of China's domestic petroleum product quality standards, the capacity of refining equipment has also improved."
As a result, the quality of China's foreign exports of petroleum products has gradually reached the same level as Japan (the world's highest quality)
JX Energy said that "after the end of 2015, China began to export high-quality light oil to Australia, which competed against Japanese products in the Asian market."
Although "Japanese high-grade oil" is facing a crisis, the response strategy adopted by Japanese oil companies is only "to export to profitable regions with market attention while focusing on market conditions."
Due to the huge impact of China's exported petroleum products on the Asian market, the attention to the teapot refinery is also increasing.

Ultraviolet rays not only make the skin of the students dark, but also sunburn the skin, how to make the skin smoothly through the military training, not sunburn?
Sunscreen packaging is generally marked with SPF and PA, SPF refers to the sun protection index, for UVB ultraviolet, our common SPF index has 15, 30, 50 and so on.
Products marked with PA are UVA, so that sunscreen will play a more effective role, usually, PA strength + to indicate, one more + indicates effective protection time extension.
Oily skin should choose water-based sun protection products with strong permeability, and sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
Dry skin should choose cream-like sun protection products; neutral skin is generally not strictly regulated, sensitive skin to wipe any maintenance is a burden, it is recommended to choose pure physical sun protection products.
Remember to apply sunscreen half an hour in advance, as sunscreen products take time to fully seep into the skin.
Military training day sun for a long time, sunscreen every two hours to rub every two hours to have a lasting effect, do not be lazy.
Because the skin has just been stimulated by sun, military training does not return immediately with whitening products.
After the military training, if there is a condition, you can use towels wrapped in ice cubes to burn the skin in the ice town to slow the local heat.

"Xiang Expo" has become an important platform for local cultivation of characteristic industries and promoting the development of characteristic industries out of the country.
On some nights, the ionosphere is full of free electrons, which means that radio signals can go further.
According to the U.S. newspaper's Volkswagen Science website August 11th, the U.S. Air Force is interested in replicating this effect.
While a steady large number of free-electrons can help people listen to the station on the edge of a university radio station, this may not be the interest of the U.S. Air Force.
The electronic ionosphere means that the radio used by the military has a greater range of broadcasts, and it may provide some protection for GPS signals to protect them from solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to create a range of cubes based on demand, which can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first, these teams that contract with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles will work.
Industry data shows that the total scale of coal production capacity in 2015 was close to 60 billion tons, and the national coal capacity exceeded by 18 billion tons.
In the past ten years, the State Council has issued five notices of elimination of excess and backward production capacity.
Although the first four times did not target the coal industry, the target industry had a direct relationship with the coal industry.
From November last year to January this year, the price of Qinhuangdao 5500 large truck power coal hovered at the low level of 370 yuan / ton for a long time, and 90% of coal companies fell into losses.
Since February, coal prices have gradually recovered, and the price of Qinhuangdao has risen for four consecutive weeks, rising to a high point for 16 months, once climbing to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan from the beginning of the year.
As the price rebounds, all walks of life are worried about it: will a number of small coal mines resume production?
In this regard, Kuang Xianming, director of the Economic Research Institute of China (Hainan) Reform and Development Research Institute, conducted an analysis and interpretation.
Kuang Xianming: To the production capacity has attracted a lot of attention from all parties, the report card of the coal industry's de-capacity released today has indeed made everyone feel more worried about.
The three surface factors still reflect the relative lag in the transition of our growth patterns in the past, and that the government-led growth mode has not yet undergone a fundamental shift.
Second, it is also directly related to the promotion of local governments, in the process of going to production capacity, funds and corresponding supporting measures should be in place, from this aspect, the difference between different regions is indeed relatively large.
Third, if some provinces that are currently slow to catch up with progress in the second half of the year, they may face greater risks.
In this case, relying on the central award and supplement funds to promote the process of decapacity may have a certain negative impact.
First of all, de-capacity is not simply a total amount of control.
Our goal is to promote the optimization of the structure and reconstruct the new format of the entire coal industry by eliminating backward production capacity.
In the process of deploying to capacity, local governments must combine the transformation and upgrading of the decapacity and the coal industry to vigorously develop related services.
Second, in order to complete this year's capacity task this year, we still need to give full play to the strength of administrative supervision and administrative supervision.
Finally, we want to strengthen the role of social security.
Because the market directly concerns employment, we need to strengthen the employment skills training of employees and employees.
“The reason for the decline in the ranking is the deterioration of foreign capital ’ s expectations for Brazil ’ s GDP development in the medium term. ”
In 2015, Brazil ’ s participation in global direct investment was 3.7 percent, down from 5.7 percent in 2014.

Canadian police kill IS supporters: Homemade bomb attack city preparations near the end
The taxi company said the taxi was dispatched to Drif's home before police arrived.
Canadian police said at a news conference on Wednesday that the information received by police included "martyrs" provided by the FBI about the youth being attacked.
According to Deutsche Welle, on the screen, a man wearing a black Balakla hood is reading the Quran, mentioning crimes against Muslims and vowing that an attack on a city in Canada will soon be launched.
He said in the video that the attack would take place within 72 hours and that it was at peak times.
The incident comes after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came to power for the first time after the incident that police killed a terror suspect before the incident.
The upgraded Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal branch channel old Wanfu River and the North Great Sling Passage have been charged tolls from September 1st.
These two tributaries have been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government for renovation and construction by social financing.
The old Wanfu River channel flows through Jinxiang and Fish Tai, and enters the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal through Nanyang Lake, which is full length of 32.5 kilometers.
According to the needs of navigation, the Lao Wanfu River channel adopts the method of maintenance and transformation, and the local depth of water is dredged deep, and the local sharp bends are cut for cutting, etc., and the navigation conditions have been improved.
The channel flows through Jinxiang County and Rencheng District, and enters the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal through Nanyang Lake, which is 19km long.
The renovation of the two waterways began construction in February 2011, and the completion of the acceptance of the trade in January 2015, and the main body of investment construction and operation is Jining Anping Canal Logistics Service Center.
In accordance with the principle of "loan construction, fee repayment", Jining Anping Canal Logistics Service Center is levied according to the charging standards approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau.
Among them, the basic toll is charged according to 1.75 yuan / load tonne, and the mileage toll is collected according to 0.05 yuan / km load ton.
The toll levy from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019.
The reporter learned from the Jining Port Aviation Bureau that there are currently four toll lanes in Jining, namely the Sushui River channel, the White Horse River channel, the North Great Slide Passage, and the Lao Wanfu River channel.
The four shipping lanes for the tributary channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal have been upgraded and transformed by social financing.
The upgrading project of the Sushui River channel is the first to adopt the "government + market" model, which is used for the project of the construction of the Inner River Port Aviation in Shandong Province, and the government accounts for the main investment and the gap of supplementary funds for social funds.
The branches of the Baima River, the Lao Wanfu River, and the North Great Slipper River adopt the method of pure market operation.
The funds allocated by the state's financial resources cannot meet the needs of the construction of the project and restrict the progress of the upgrading of the waterway.
The construction of social funds for public infrastructure meets the requirements of national policies and has also become a way to crack the bottleneck of funds.
Ning Zetao's performance in the 100m freestyle semi-final has left a lot of Chinese viewers speechless.
But in the 50m freestyle preliminaries, Ning Zetao once again refreshed people's "bottom line ."
In fact, the 50m freestyle is not the main item of Ning Zetao, and his performance and best results at the Kazan World Championships also determine that he has made a breakthrough in this project.
Sure enough, Hong Kong's authoritative media outlet Grand Gazette revealed that the biggest reason for Ning Zetao's defeat was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many factors off the field may have had a big impact on his future idea, and he may now be more interested in foray into showbiz.
After the Kazan World Championships, Ning Zetao became an influencer in an instant with its high value and good results.
As a result, the "national husband's small fresh meat is a beautiful man" and other names have also become the label on him.
Various commercial activities came to the door, the good money, became a golden road.
In this case, Ning Zetao, even if he chose to retire at this time to join the entertainment industry, not only his freedom, but also a seemingly feasible path.
After all, he was only 23 years old, after a certain study, can play in a TV series with his popularity.
But Ning Zetao needs to see if he has enough qualifications compared to these predecessors?
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, 21-year-old Liu Xuan has reached the end of his career as an athlete.
Liu Xuan's beautiful appearance made her quickly remembered, and also laid the foundation for her future into the entertainment industry.
After retiring, Liu Xuan starred in a number of TV series and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang participated in the single-double ten-meter stage competition of the two Olympic Games and won the gold and 2 silver.
But after losing to team-mate Hu Jia in a single-mete-made 10m race at the 2004 Olympics, Tian Liang's competitive status declined and was fired from the diving team.
And he and his daughter to participate in "Daddy to go" and other variety shows, but also let him earn enough eyeballs.
The former gymnastics golden generation Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing all participated in various variety shows.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei Li Xiaopeng led China to win the 2008 Olympic Games men's team championship at that time, and Yang Wei won the individual all-around gold medal twice, known as the all-around king.
While leading China to the 2012 Olympic team title, Chen Yibing also became the king of the Rings while leading China to win the 2012 Olympic team.
After the loss of gold medals at the London Olympics, Chen Yibing's big move also made him circled countless times.
But the main energy of these athletes is still in the arena, and for variety shows it is just like a dragonfly?
But whether it is retired or active athletes, can be able to get the favor of the entertainment industry need to have the results to be guaranteed.
After all, athletes step into a new field, whether it is ability or contacts, is a blank state.
Even Tian Liang and Liu Xuan have been mixed with entertainment circles for many years, and the general audience mentioned them, and more of them were still thinking about their performance at the Olympic Games.
And Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and other newcomers, in the variety show appearance of the introduction, all without exception are "Olympic champion  multiplied"
Compared to the above, the name of a swimming world championship champion in Ning Zetao is still slightly thin.
What's more, compared to the successful retreat of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan, Yang Wei and others, Ning Zetao has a quick retreat in the 23 years and a slight setback in his sports career, and the negative impact on its image is probably also immeasurable.
After all, when it comes to athletes, people's demands are "not to win a hundred battles, but not afraid of danger", Ning Zetao is still far from this point.
Ten thousand steps back, Ning Zetao is handsome, can rely on the value of the waist to get the support of thousands of brain powder.
No bit of strength, only on the appearance, want to mix well in the entertainment circle, this difficulty is not more difficult than good training to find the state of the state.
The choice of the road to life is based on personal will, but in the end how to choose, Ning Zetao should have a number in mind.
On the surface, online social platforms have expanded their communicative circle and reduced people's loneliness.
The sphere of influence of online social networking has become more and more extensive, not only gradually replacing traditional telephone contact, but even infiltrating into the real life circle of the line, quietly changing the social life of the current people.
The benefits of online socialization are obvious, such as convenience and speed, so they are particularly vulnerable to young people.
A survey of college students' social habits shows that 57% of college students use their mobile phones for more than five hours a day, and daily life is basically "avoiding hands."
"Social networks have the characteristics of low cost, fast transmission speed, and multi-person communication at the same time, which is in line with the needs of contemporary college students."
Expanding relationships, interacting more equally, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we are becoming more and more deeply interested in online chat.
Newcomers who have just entered the company love to communicate with colleagues online, "because it is not very familiar with the unit, and the relationship is closer than before."
Love friends are also commonly used online communication, "before with friends because some misunderstandings have not been in contact for a period of time, and later in a large group of dialogue a few words before the hot contact."
IT engineer Wu Yan is a deep online social enthusiast, and most of his social life occurs online, and the network contact is several times the number of offline friends.
Wu Yan himself also admitted that he was more "like a fish to get water on the Internet."
"You can reply to friends when you are convenient and willing, because there are many times to consider the words, the expression can be more clear."
"Hidden under the ID you come to me to avoid face-to-face interpersonal collisions, not only with room for manoeuvre, but even give each other more time and space to think about words and deeds."
“People with different identities have the same right and efficiency to speak, and all kinds of social concerns in real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace. ”
However, Wu Yan's friend Xiaopeng believes that Wu Yan in life is a "blessed house man draulately"

Greenland sharks, also known as small-headed sleeping sharks, are widely distributed in the North Atlantic Seas around Greenland and Iceland, and its presence in adulthood is 4 to 5 meters long.
But they grow extremely slowly, sometimes only about 1 centimetre long for one year, suggesting that Greenland sharks may have an exceptionally long life span.
Traditional dating methods typically use calcified tissue in animals, and fins can be used in some sharks, but this calcified tissue is scarce in Greenland sharks.
The new study, led by Julius Nelson, of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, turned to a radiocarbon dating using the eye lens of the Greenland shark.
This method was previously used to determine the age of a whale, but it was used to determine the age of fish such as sharks for the first time.
Their analysis revealed that the largest shark life in the head is estimated to be 392 years old and an error of 120 years.
That said, the shark is at least 272 years old and is likely to reach the maximum of 512.
In addition, the female Greenland shark is said to have until about 4 meters long to mature, and it is estimated to be age to reach an adult at least until the age of 156.
The researchers therefore wrote in the paper that Greenland sharks are the longest-living vertebrates known on Earth, surpassing the previous long-lived champion right whale (211 years old).

According to the Voice of China "News Evenpeak Summit", in late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will travel to Kenya to attend the 6th Africa Development Conference.
The African Development Conference was led by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan. Therefore, this meeting will also be the first time that this conference will be Africa.
In this regard, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said that the local meeting in Africa has helped to attract the attention of African and European countries to Japan.
In order to cooperate with Abe's visit, according to Kyodo News Agency, the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party will send a delegation of parliamentarians to relevant countries.
It is no coincidence that Japan's "normal" road began in the early 1990s, and the Africa Development Conference, launched by Japan, also began in 1993.
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations, and is an important ticket for the United Nations. How can Japan abandon Africa if it wants to "get into the ordinary"?
An exchange of views will also be exchanged with relevant people from other countries on the extremist group Islamic State and terrorist activities.
The Western Group will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida also recently explained the intention at the UN Security Council on the African Development Conference.
Abe had announced here that for the stability of sub-Saharan African countries, it would provide 100 billion yen (about RMB61 billion) in five years.
Observers generally believe that Japan's generosity to Africa has always been for two main purposes: one is to increase Japan's presence in Africa; the other is to win the support of African countries on the issue of entry.
Yang Bojiang, a Japanese expert, said: "From the political point of view, although Africa is relatively lagging behind, the number of countries is relatively large, so Japan has always regarded it as the so-called 'big ticket field'."
Japan will not give up in the future, and the work on Africa will not be terminated and will continue to strengthen.
Economically, because Japan's production capacity is relatively strong, but the domestic market is relatively limited, especially in the context of the aging of children, domestic demand is relatively low.
However, from the 10-year ago, Junichiro Koizumi, to Abe ten years later, during which Japan had repeatedly launched the usual "sprint", but all failed.
Yang Bojiang, an expert on Japan, believes that Japan's usual intention is obvious at a glance, but the path to the common situation is bound to be difficult.
To achieve its goals, Japan must first have to do a good job of doing relations with its neighboring countries, and Japan needs to have a correct attitude, both in geopolitical disputes and historical understanding.

Whether it's because of age or the time limit, there are some players who play each season when they play a step backwards.
Of course, some "regression" may simply shrink the data, and the strength of these players may not decline.
Even if Wade is still one of the best scoring guards in the league, he should not be as good as the Heat in the Bulls.
He and Lungdo have a limited range of backcourts, and the three-point hit rate of Peter Butler is only 32.8%, which makes their offensives crowded next season.
Coming to Windy City, the Flash is bound to give more to Butler and Rondo, and he is likely to choose a health game in the regular season.
Okaford's situation is more awkward, and as the first choice for last season 76ers, he has to compete with Simmons as well as Enbid on the game for the new season and the ball.
This competition may not come soon, Simmons also needs to adapt to the NBA arena, and Enbid will fully recover from the injury as soon as possible, but Okafu can have a position in the 76ers.
Last season, Okafu's 32% score came from a low offense, a higher percentage than Cousins, Vucevic and Brook Lopes, while his usage rate also topped the league's top 40.
As Simmons has shown excellent possession of the ball-handling forward potential, Enbide also has a more fit for NBA games, and Okaford's status is difficult to be so solid.
Thompson's usage has been steady in the league's top 20 for the last two seasons, and it's the two best seasons of his career.
The problem, though, with Durant's arrival, Thompson's use will necessarily decline, which will inevitably affect his play.
This effect will not only affect the number of shots, but also the impact of the ball attack of Tang God in the next season will certainly greatly reduce the difficulty of the opponent's defense against him in some ways.
Durant's arrival will certainly shrink the Warriors' players' data, but the worst of it is Thompson.
But that doesn't mean the level of Tot-God regress, it's more like he's made a sacrifice for the team as a whole.
Parker was better than the data last season, not only because his basket efficiency came to the highest career, but his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs.
Duncan retired, Ginobili announced another year of fighting, and the combination of GDP eventually came to an end, as the youngest of the three, the French sports car tank also had little oil.
After getting a third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell James won more regular-season MVPs, and Jordan was the only one with the only FMVP to more than James.
Oh right, James just brought Cleveland the first professional sports trophy of the last 52 years.
James, who came to the 14th season of his career, needed to be better assured of physical strength and ready for the playoffs.
So in the regular season, James's data is likely to slide further, and he'll split more of the burden on Irving to bear, though he'll still easily be the league's top three players.
“We must carry forward the talent learned from the country in Russia.
On the 12th local time, Huang Jing, president of the Overseas Chinese Federation of Moscow, said excitedly when he saw the reporter of China New Network.
Not long ago, she participated in the "Overseas Chinese Cultural Society Chinese Talents (Stolica, Calligraphy, Painting) Training Course organized by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council and hosted by Jinan University in China."
When I first attended the training course, I had no idea where to start the book, and the results were able to draw and write his own work after the end of the training course.
When you return to Moscow, you must use the knowledge and skills you have learned to make your own contribution to the spread and promotion of Chinese culture.
At the same time, the Secretary-General of the Russian Chinese Cultural Promotion Association, who participated in this training course, Na Yanwei, had the same feeling.
She said that she has made great progress with the help of the teacher in the training course, and at the same time feel the heavy responsibility as a "foreign communicator of Chinese culture".
Na Yanwei said that after returning to Russia, he decided to spread and promote Chinese traditional culture among Chinese people and Russians who love Chinese culture.

UK wins silver in seven-man rugby, Fiji wins gold
In the seven-man rugby final on Thursday night, the British team failed to continue the stellar performance in front of Fiji, beaten by Fiji at the Rio Tioduro Stadium by a 43-7th.
The Fiji team won the gold medal with an unassailable performance in terms of possession, snapping, shunting, rescircling, co-operation, running and strength, which is also the country's first ever Olympic medal.
The silver medal was also a big comfort for the defeated British team, which was the third silver medal won by the British delegation on the day. The result was enough to make the English rugby team proud: they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa all the way to the seven-man rugby game for the first time at the Games.
Earlier in the day, the British team narrowly over the South African team by 7 to 5, which could have affected their status in the final.
But anyway, the Fiji team now is enough to beat a full-spirited 15-man team.
Tomorrow, at least one Briton will wear a gold medal, which could be a comfort for the British team, but it may not be. This Brit is Fijian coach Ben Ryan from Wimblelton, who has served as the head coach of the British team.
It is not easy for the British team to achieve today's results.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's coaching, they had not won a win at the Adelaide International Seven-Fu Rugby.
And now they're just one step away from the championship.
Although they have been hit hard, they have also made very amazing progress.
Fiji's opening took advantage, leaving the British team without a splash.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it's like hitting a cascade of buses that are on. When Osci. Corinistas rushed into the flag-ring area, this world-series championship team was already ahead with a score of five to 0.
Just four minutes after the match, Jerry Tue Wyeth scored again on the right.
At 12- to-ten, the British team barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's strong interdiction left the giant-like Lyon Nakalawa without scoring a third time, but it was only delaying the speed of Fiji's score.
In seven minutes, Yassa Weilemaru tentacled in the right corner. From 17 to 0, the British team was worse.
Nakkalawa got one more point, and the game... was still one minute left in the first half.
Then, Vatmo Lavovo broke through the British team's defense, straight to the scoring line.
By the time of the middle break, the score was already 29 to 0.
It's as if Fijians were born to play 7-man rugby, and the British team is still fledgling.
That's how the situation is.
The British team made a huge difference in the second half and hit the Fijian line in a full four minutes, and the performance was already good in the first half. But then Fiji played a wonderful fit, scoring again by Joshua Tuesova.
Dan Norton created a chance for the British team to score, and he touched in the left corner, changing the score to a 360- to7, but the game has long been in the control of the South China Sea Island nation, where their fans sing loudly, waving flags, and singing and dancing on the platform.
The Fiji team ’ s wonderful performance has to be clapped.
Mata William stopped the Fiji team from an uncharted attack at the last minute.
The final whistle rang out, the Fijians hugged together, and the defeated British team could only regret quitting.
Earlier in the day, Fiji beat Japan in the semifinals by 20 to 5, while the UK narrowly won South Africa in a bitter semi-final matchup.
Kyle Brown helped South Africa take the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with an excellent footstyle.
After that, England's brother Marcus Watson secured the team's win with a fantastic interception, and eventually the British team won the silver medal.
Helen Graff and Heather Stanin, inspired by coach who has cancer, won the rowing gold medal
It's no exaggeration to say that this is the most moving piece of gold.
From the start of the first paddling to the present, Helen Graff and Heather Stanning have received the 220 punitive pucing training sessions, and the gold medal they won at Estacio da Lagoa has a more extraordinary significance.
Although the paddles were only two of them, there was also a man on board the sound of the men's coach Robin Williams who had been accompanied by their impact on the second consecutive women's double-plear Olympic gold medal, the first British women's portfolio to reach this height.
They have maintained a 39 unbeaten record and have an absolute advantage.
What we're seeing is that these two talented athletes are gracefully moving forward on the water, but it's not the whole of that victory.
Behind every rowing gold medal is a lot of people who volunteer help, and it is their constant dedication that makes a difference, and the biggest thing is to help a coach 30 months ago who learned that he had cancer and did not know whether he could live to see the day.
As he said, death could come at any moment.
I've got bladder cancer and they've had surgery for me.
If you do not have surgery, the cancer cells will spread throughout the body.
That way, things will be much worse.
It will slightly change your view.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he started treatment at the beginning of 2014, minimizing the impact, though it may not be appropriate to say so in this case.
I need to get my salary, so I have to get better.
It's an incentive for me.
I was in the hospital, and although they said a few steps would be enough, I was still walking around the ward 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet every time I walked around the ward.
That's the starting point of everything.
Rowing itself is a journey, which makes the journey a little longer.
At the moment they won gold, the first thing they thought about was Williams. This morning's Williams was slightly more talkative than usual, which was to overcome his anxiety.
Stanken, who was the head of the Royal Artillery team, will travel to Afghanistan, saying: "My mood this week is very bad, it may be a little extreme, but this gold medal does matter."
It repeatedly told me how much it was for me, how much effort I, Helen and Robin put in.
It was Helen, Robin and I struggled for three years in return.
If not Robin, we'd just be a nobody, thank you very much, and he's the best coach in the world.
I can't find a better trainer and coach than him.
Helen Graff and Heather Stanning failed in five years.
The penalties set by the pair are incomparable to their opponents.
Even at the end of the 500m, when the New Zealand and Denmark began to approximate, Stanen and Graf still had a lot of physical reserves.
It was so thrilling then.
Helen called it: Keep the pace, keep the rhythm ’ s troe.
Not being affected by opponents is very important.
We had a good start, and at the same time we weren't looking forward to what kind of earth-shattering big things were.
We didn't think about the glory of today, we just thought about rowing every paddle and winning this game, and we did.
It took a year for the pair to decide for their future.
Graf will be married to TV explorer Steve Bhakshar next month.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say it was my last game.
It puts too much pressure on me.
It took me about six months in London to realize I was an Olympic champion.
It was a whole new experience, and I felt very nervous.
It has now been around four minutes.
She said, "I feel better."

Snapchat's "anime" effect is accused of satirizing Asians
Snapchat says the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers believe it is racially coloured.
Snapchat ’ s $150 million everyday users can change reality with its filter tool and make portraits comical.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a role in a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
These lenses have the effect of passivation, bending features, resulting in more than 30 million modified selfies every day.
Any mistake is immediately noticed by the public.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized for agitating for playing black people or white skins.
So when the app this week offered some users a filter that could create oblique eye, strange teeth and powdered effects, some critics called it a racial satire on the Asian "yellow people."
They even think that these recurring questions mean that the company has a bigger problem in diversity.
Reports from The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday sparked outrage after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company's explanation: The filter is a tribute to the anime character, not a satirical for the Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of harmful stereotypes in reality.
Others are also adamantly opposed to these anime images.
A Korean-American artian who posted a tweet and was widely shared on the photos said in an email that the filters were "at least distressing and unwell drames."
She also said: "It's hard to distinguish between the effects of the extremely disgusting Asian satire and the filter."
Although the filter is not only yellow people, the yellow people are extremely devalued.
Snapchat isn ’ t the only company that touches the bottom line of these cultures.
From corporate boards to Hollywood and the devices we carry, American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusion.
Snapchat's large young group can be sensitive because it is more racially diverse than the older generation.
When one of Snapchat's filters produced an insulting image of users, 25-year-old Zhu Katie said in an interview on Thursday: "It's harder to escape people's eyes than before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, who is a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article written for Medium and a phone interview, she said she thought the racial overt controversy reflected Snapchat's lack of racial diversity in the hiring process.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's employees as white, the leadership for all men and added a hashtag to the end of the article: #ReteSnapchat.
As a Chinese-American, Ms. Zhu said, "Either their employees don't have a variety of races, so they can make such a decision, or they have some people of color in their employees, but their positions can't make them speak freely."
Other observers have shared complaints that she has not been responded to by Snapchat.
The company did not release data on employee diversity and said it was a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the ethnic background of its employees on Thursday, but a spokesman said the company had recently hired a recruiter to focus on a lower proportion of people inside and work to promote internal inclusion.
Ms. Zhu said she would shut down her Snapchat account, "I wonder if they need more users like us to oppose this behavior."
Congressional panel says military officials have distorted ISIS intelligence
A congressional panel noted in a report released Thursday that officials at U.S. Central Command have changed their intelligence reports to describe the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as more optimistic than it actually is.
The interim report comes from a dedicated task force formed by the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the House Appropriations Committee. The report said there was "widespread displeasure" by Central Command intelligence analysts who said their superiors were tampering with their assessment of the U.S. war with the Islamic State.
Central Command (Centcom), based in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news report on the report, “intelligence, reviewed by senior leaders at Central Command, describes the U.S. counterterrorism operations more optimistic than it really is, and is always more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies. ”
A Republican representative in California said: "Central Command's actions are hard to accept. On one side, our fighters are suffering from war, and on the other hand, high-level policymakers have received the wrong analysis."
The leadership issue of Central Command has extended to the highest levels of the agency.
The report details the long-standing problems of Central Command in describing and analyzing U.S. training of Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no definitive evidence that top Obama administration officials ordered changes to these reports, according to the report's description, the analysts felt themselves under pressure from leaders in Central Command to force them to make a more optimistic opinion about the threat of the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
“In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements, and congressional testimony were much more optimistic than they were on the ground, ” the report said.
For example, an official at Central Command has publicly stated that a major military operation could be taken as early as April or May to retake Mosul.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Mike Pompeo, a Republican representative for the Kansas state, said in a statement: “After months of investigation, this result is already evident. ”
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most of the top intelligence officials at U.S. Central Command have manipulated the command's intelligence products to conceal the threat of the Islamic State in Iraq.
The Republican Party set up a special task force after learning from analysts that intelligence about the Islamic State was being rigged.
As the investigation continues, there will be more to be found after the report, released on Thursday.
The Attorney General of the Ministry of Defence has also carried out a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their findings on Thursday, consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican-specific task force.
In a statement, the leader of the Committee's Democratic Party, Sheanda, said in a statement that between 2014 and 2015, the Central Command's intelligence assessment of the Islamic State and the Iraqi peacekeeping force had developed an overly narrow process.
Mr. Sheanda said the process "obstructs the release of intelligence", reduces the morale of analysts and "cannot accept different opinions."
But Mr. Sheanda and Democrats also said they found no evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on Central Command's analysts, so that their conclusions were in line with "prestigal or political narratives."
The Daily Beast reported on the preliminary results of a congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that after receiving a complaint from a Central Command analyst, the Pentagon's attorney general began an investigation.
Pentagon spokesman Navy Major Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Defense Department did not comment on the congressional report until the end of the attorney general's investigation.
But he said: "Experts sometimes diverge of the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense encourage a healthy dialogue on these important national security topics."
The impact of the investigation has outpaced the success of the U.S.-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria, which has been claimed by a growing number of Defense Department officials.
But last year, those claims led the public to question the extent to which President Obama could trust the military action assessments released by Central Command in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of a dispute over a decade ago, when Gregory Hook, an intelligence analyst at Central Command, wrote a research article in which the George Bush administration insisted on sending small troops to Iraq despite the opposition of numerous analysts and barely considering what was going on after the invasion in 2003.
Mr Hooke played a key role in this campaign against Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr Hook's team had concluded that the airstrikes against the Islamic State refinery did not significantly reduce the terror group's economic revenues, as the terror group built a makeshift refinery to continue selling oil on the black market, which is very different from the announcement.
According to a report by TIeks in September, the Central Command did not release the discovery.
After multiple lawyers reviewed Senate testimony about an overly optimistic assessment of the war, Middle Command commander Lloyd Austin III was criticized last year.
Gen. Austin retired in April and is currently succeeding him in the position of Central Command by Joseph Waterll.
US to score four in four-game winning streak in women's hockey game, will lose with Britain
Katie Bam, who won the single-to-class in the 6-1 victory over Japan, took the second time the U.S. women's hockey team on Thursday, helping the U.S. team win a 3-0 win over India.
Five goals in two games were stunning, but the 27-year-old Bam said she didn't know she had such a great performance.
She said, "I don't know anything about it."
I'm not the kind of person who will remember myself getting into a few balls.
What she knows is that the U.S. team has had four straight wins at the Olympics and will compete with the UK team in the group on Thursday after a 20-to-beating victory over Japan in the group.
Britain and the United States met narrowly in the final match of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams are advancing to the quarter-finals, and the game will determine who appears as the first in the group.
The team that wins the first place in the group will avoid encountering a strong Dutch team, which will be able to go further. The Netherlands is out as the first in another group.
In Saturday's game, the U.S. team worked wonders with an astonishing performance. To know that at the London Olympics four years ago, the U.S. team was at the bottom of the 12 teams.
Barm was also in that team at the time.
Bam grew up in Brubel, Pennsylvania, and first picked up hockey sticks (her twin sister worked in the sport in Drexel) at the age of 13 and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest national team member to date.
She missed the 2008 Olympics due to the failure to be included in the final list.
In 2012, neither she and her teammates were bullish.
The next year, the Briton Craig Panam was the head coach, and everything started to change.
“This is a cultural, mindset and substantive change, ” Bam said.
We were not at the current level in London.
We came a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam pulled the lead in the first half with a close backhand shot.
India has not yet had a win in this tournament, but the team has shown amazing tenacity and kept the 1-0 score to the end of the third quarter, when Bam broke out.
She streaked up the ball along the left side of the court, then cut to the middle, radiated into the net, and the U.S. team took a 20-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez shot the last goal in mid-fourth quarter.
U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Brigis over the match for the first time in the tournament, in the first three wins, each scored a goal.
This time she was playing extraordinaryly.
Bam too.
Panham said: "We are in good shape now, but exactly how good it is depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
The sour foods during the Great Depression in The Great Food
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had just been elected president, sat in the president's office for lunch.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt loved Fifth Avenue's gourmet food, like foie gras and Maryland stew fish.
On that day, his menu was very simple: ketchup devil eggs, mashed potatoes and dried pudding as a dot-to-picture.
Jen Ziegman said, "It's to be food-to-neumber with people who are suffering."
Her husband, Andrew Co., added, "It also reflects the way Americans eat."
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Mr. Co's last book, "Crysper Gadge", is about Chinese food in America, and Ms. Ziegman tells the story of the life of the ghumite through food in her 97 orchards.
Their co-production of the new book, The Humious Meal, will be published by Harper's Press on Tuesday, which introduces the history of food in the United States during the Great Depression.
After showing some of the food-related insights, they met a reporter at Eisenberg's sandwich shop. This simple lunch counter in the ironed area has been open since the time of the economic collapse in 1929.
The 54-year-old Ms. Ziegman points out a cream cheese with a broken olive sandwich, while 57-year-old Mr. Co., who is 57 years old, picoats, platters for turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
Reporters ordered a baked roll, which the couple thought were suitable for discussing the Great Depression-era diet.
Ms. Ziegman said, "Bread was very popular at the time."
At that time, there were peanut bread, liver bread, soy bread.
They are all made with a raw material and a cheap topping on the raw material.
Imagine that your dinner is peanuts.
Mr. Ko was dressed up as a strange thing.
He said, "They're definitely like lead in your stomach."
In the years before the Great Depression, Americans had all buffets, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cooked for male farm workers, and had fresh-depthing pies for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
In World War I, it was the Americans who gave food to the hungry Europeans. The Great Meal Documented how the country suddenly ceased to be a land of abundance.
Mr. Ko explained why he and his wife were writing the book: “At that time, food had become a major topic of displeasure to Americans. ”
Another unpleasant topic is the chiming new food: "fans" such as bread and stews become the main course, and stew is "the best way to cook leftovers," said Ms. Ziegman, because chefs can use the cream in the sauce to cover up the unscrupid ingredients.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat that has been a protagonist at the American table for years has become a rare luxury.
The strange hodgepodge only considers calories, and the first thing people think about nutrition than taste, even basic cooking common sense.
In the course of researching the book, including various recipes, Ms. Ziegman made a roasted onion filled with peanut oil.
Mr. Ko said, "It's not common at the dinner table."
Ms Ziegman said: "It's also so weird.
The peanut oil and the roasted onion cannot be matched at all.
This is characteristic of many family economic meals.
Family economists influence the country's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as a chef of the Federal Household Economic Bureau from 1923 to 1943, and others, which are unique in history.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to "fine hard" and have the courage to turn bad foods such as creamy pasta with carrots into gourmet food.
The hearty meal is a hearty "historic cede looms"
It is especially worth playing with the government's response to the hungry people, such as the attitude of the president's citizen Herbert Hoover, "I can't control other people's affairs."
Although he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouses in childhood, his diet was as refined as a millionaire.
Mr. Ko said: "He likes to eat European-style Western food, such as fish with cucumber sauce
He wore an evening dress and dined in a gilded restaurant.
He was clearly out of the people.
Had it not been for his wife Eleanor to encourage him to set an example on his diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As the book says, the butlers hired by Ms. Roosevelt had no interest in the taste, so the White House "food was not only the hardest food to Washington, but also the worst food to cook."
When the United States returned to its regularity, many of the Great Depression-era cooking methods were abandoned.
Ms Ziegman said what was left behind was our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they learned more about Ms. Ziegman's mother's eating habits, such as how she didn't throw food away.
Mr. Ko said, "She's very afraid of wasting food."
Ms. Ziegman recalled: "She actually got a lot of sick people."
For example, there has been a "cream puff" incident.
After removing the plate, she and Mr. Coe took out a dessert they had prepared at home: this is the dried pudding that President Roosevelt ate in his lunch.
Ms Ziegman said: "This is called creamy dried," and added a new trend of name for a normal dish is "the usual trick.
There is no raw cream in this dessert, only dried fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone is reluctant to get a lot deeper into the sticky brown paste.
Unexpectedly, the dessert tasted well.
Mr. Coe ate the second and third spoon.
He felt that it was an acceptable and affordable dessert, so he told his wife: "It would be better to add walnuts."
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, and Saudi production hit a new high.
The report does not ban the market in doubt about OPEC's credibility, and the road to a recovery in oil prices is likely to remain full of thorns.
On Monday, OPEC's rotating chair and Qatari Energy Minister Sada said OPEC would hold an informal meeting on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
OPEC's monthly report on Wednesday showed that the entire OPEC group, including Gabon, rose 4.6 million barrels / day in July, to 3311 million barrels / day.
OPEC also said in its monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil products, which has increased the market's oversupply.
Affected by this news, coupled with the United States' upward crude oil production expectations and the unexpected increase in crude oil inventories, international oil prices have closed lower for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday's close, light crude futures for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2.48 percent and London Brent crude futures for October delivery fell 2.07 percent.
Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of oil-producing countries is unlikely to tighten supply significantly, and the data released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration has also weighed on market sentiment.
Iran's official news agency Fars on Wednesday quoted a statement from Iran's oil minister, Zangane, as saying that Iran's daily crude oil production was up to 385 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
As soon as the news came out, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said that there is no need for a new round of frozen production negotiations under oil prices.
The last time a meeting of oil-producing countries was already a matter of April, and OPEC members were unable to reach agreement on any measures.
Emma Richards, an analyst at BMI Research oil and gas, said markets and media could overreact to the meeting that OPEC will meet.
Helima Croft, head of commodities strategy at the Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC had changed market sentiment by releasing signals that they would facilitate the agreement.
This method is like a smoke and mirror that leads to a person's sight (deliberately giving the wrong impression).
Eugene Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank, said the chances of people thought OPEC would try to stabilize the market through a September meeting were low.
This is likely to further undermine market confidence in OPEC, after all, this organization staged a "Wolf came to ..."
All localities should make medical institutions that publish medical advertisements in violation of the law, the concentration of complaints and reports, and the previous punishment has been repeatedly punished as the focus of spot checks.

According to the media, due to the large-scale influx of capital into Internet medicine, the current problem of homogenization of products is serious, the investment boom has gradually receded, and capital has entered a wait-and-see period.
According to the data of the Management Research Center of the Alipe Hospital in Hong Kong, the Internet medical companies have died in large numbers of years, and about 20% of the start-up Internet medical enterprises have ceased to exist.
However, just when most Internet medical companies are struggling on the road to the A-round or Series B financing, there are several leading companies in the subdivisions who can still get capital enthusiasm.
It seems that the Internet medical entrepreneurship can not be "a swarm", but to see the market demand, sink the heart to do it, do deep.
Fish Yue invested 1.20.00 million yuan, accounting for 40% of registered capital, and Kyushu Tong Instrument Co., Ltd. invested 1.80.00 million yuan, accounting for 60% of registered capital.
In recent years, with the national policy support in medical information, electronic and integrated supply chain management systems have gradually entered hospitals at all levels.
The cooperation between fish and Kyushu is aimed at the needs of the market, helping hospitals to build advanced supply chain management systems, and using this as an opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet medical companies, iBaby has focused on the Internet obstetric vertical since it was the first to cultivate both ends of the mother and doctors.
Pregnant mothers can not only provide free 24 hours and one-on-one doctor's consultation, but also pay for targeted medical consultation.
On the doctor's side, iBaby breaks the geographical restrictions by organizing experts to carry out online lectures, peer exchanges, case discussions and other micro-done lectures for grassroots doctors.
At present, there are three sections on the doctor's side, namely the doctor's continuing education, the doctor's socialization and the doctor's help.
Provision of online learning, case discussion, academic exchanges; social platforms with hospitals, and doctors in the same department; legal aid and entrepreneurship support required by doctor-patient relationships or personal life.
According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently said that Ali Health is "willing to sink" to win the health big data.
Internet companies and data companies lack professionalism, and the writing methods on the same terms are not uniform.
Ali's current layout in the field of medical and health is divided into three pieces, namely Ali Health, Tmall Medical Museum and Alipay Future Hospital.
Wang Lei admitted that medical health entrepreneurship will be harder than other industries, "this is not only a lot of money, but also sinking, can withstand loneliness and slowly do it."

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union brought missiles into Cuba, which almost led to a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.
The event was seen as the culmination of the Cold War, the history of which it said: "Cuban Missile Crisis ..."
But what is less known is that during the Cold War, a strong solar storm that nearly led to a nuclear war by the United States against the Soviet Union, this event was not first announced by researchers until August 9th.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused a strong interference with the U.S. military's radar and radio communications in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the U.S. ballistic missile early warning system for monitoring Soviet missiles.
The paper, completed by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed U.S. military personnel who were involved in forecasting and analyzing solar activities at the time, and reviewed non-confidential literature.
In the 1960s, in order to prevent a sudden nuclear war in the Soviet Union from waging a nuclear war, the US Air Force always had a portion of the warplanes carrying nuclear warheads flying in the sky.
U.S. military commanders did not know that the main culprit of the disturbance was the storm of the sun, not the Soviet Union, and ordered the warplanes to be prepared for combat.
Fortunately, the U.S. military's research into solar activity and its electromagnetic interference on Earth, which began in the late 1950s, eventually prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he aggregates the information provided by the U.S. Air Force Aerometeorological Service and submits a detailed report.
A direct result of this solar storm was that the U.S. military has since considered space weather as a combat concern and built a more robust space weather forecasting system.

On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly published a new version of the U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation Guide in New York, allowing Japan's armed forces to play a more offensive role in the world.
That was the same day that U.S. Defense Secretary Carter, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and Japanese Defense Minister Nakaoshi Nakag Yue Yue attended a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth time a Chinese civil think tank has published a Japanese military assessment report, and the fourth time it has launched an English version.
The report consists of nine chapters, including general policy adjustments, military strength, defense budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, institutional reform, military training exercises, foreign military security cooperation, and military security relations with China.
The 2015 year is the year of the Abe government's phased closing year to push forward major policy adjustments in the security field for several consecutive years, the report said.
Since then, Japan's initiatives in the field of security will be mainly at the operational level of legal application, strategic implementation, and policy implementation, rather than the mechanism, and the drastic adjustment and change of frameworks, mechanisms and policies.
The report emphasizes that Abe's cabinet tries to achieve the multiple purposes of promoting Japan's "normalization of state", the self-defense forces going out to intervene in international security affairs, strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance, and prevent China from China through the above three-point breakthrough.

Completing the short board of public sports facilities
The black coal field warehouse, into the "green grass" football stadium; the red brick-topped factory, into a modern sports hall.
On National Fitness Day, the South Falling Horse Camp Sports Culture Park outside the Wangjiang Gate in Hangzhou lifted the veil of mystery.
It used to be a coal farm and was idled more than a decade ago, leaving behind a lot of illegal construction and household waste.
After the remediation, it has become a sports and cultural park, and will be officially opened to the public in November, providing free sports venues to the public, which has undoubtedly opened up a new fertile ground for national sports.
This can't help but remind people that Hangzhou Chen Jinglian Sports School, the "Wangpu Military School" in Chinese swimming arenas has swake a number of world champions.
The famous swimming world will continue to produce a steady stream, vividly interpreting the relationship between competitive sports and national sports, the rich mass base provides a good condition for the selection of professional players.
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the basis of national sports, competitive sports in a certain sense depends on national sports, and national sports depends on the conditions of the venue.
According to reports, as of 2015, China's per capita stadium area, although it was 150 times that of the founding of New China, still lags far behind the sports powerhouse.
In June this year, the State Council issued the "National Fitness Plan (2016-2020)", which will focus on the development of mass sports.
In order to fill this short board, on the one hand, the relevant departments should take full account of the layout of the stadium when carrying out urban planning.
On the other hand, the public sports stadiums that have been built, including the stadiums in the school and other units, should maximize the scope of opening up and improve the efficiency of use as much as possible.
At present, the Rio Olympics, which are in full swing, stimulate people's enthusiasm for sports, and also awaken everyone's awareness of participation.
Gilead gets attorney's fee in the battle over hepatitis C patent with Merck
According to a U.S. District Judge's decision, Gilled Scientific is entitled to a lawyer's fee generated in a patent lawsuit for hepatitis C with the pharmaceutical company Merck Group in the United States.
In June, after a U.S. judge found that Merck had committed violations, including perjury and other unethical practices, Gilled was exempt from paying $200 million in damages for two patents from Gilead's best-selling drugs, Sobwe and Havoni, in violation of Merck.
In Thursday's lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Bes Lamborgsun Freeman said Gilead was not at the expense of the costs incurred as a result of his defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilled, who dominates the new generation of hepatitis C drug market. Gilled's drugs can cure more than 90 percent of hepatitis patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, both of whom claimed to be the owner of the lab working on the effective component of the Gilead drug ® ’ s rifubwe.
U.S.-backed forces announce they have retake Manbij from Islamic State
A force spokesman said on Friday that the remnants of Islamic State soldiers in the city had all left and that U.S.-backed forces had taken full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now sweeping the entire city after the militants who have ducked inside the city.
Shalan Dalvish of the armed forces of the Union of Syrian Arab Forces, Manbidi Military Council, told Reuters they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians who had been hijacked by militants.
He told Reuters: "Manbij is now all under our control, but we are still sweeping."
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2% federal tax
Hillary Clinton on Friday released his tax returns for the year 2010, which showed the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband's income in 2015 at $1.75 million and paid 34.2 percent of federal taxes.
In 2015, the Clintons' charitable contributions amounted to $1 million, and most of the donations were given to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton's speech cost nearly $5.3 million, and the former secretary of state earned $3 million from the publisher Simon and Schuster for a book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and his wife, Anne Holden, released their 10-year tax returns.
The two paid 20.3% federal taxes in 2015.
In a statement, Clinton's campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said: "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine will continue to be a benchmark for financial transparency."
In stark contrast, Donald Trump covered up on false grounds and retracted his previous promises to publish tax returns.
Although the law does not require it, as is customary, U.S. presidential candidates should disclose their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyers cited the IRS audit as a reason for refusing to release their tax returns.
Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter that you were in charge and attached to the Democratic candidates' tax returns link.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release his tax returns until the audit is complete.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said Trump's refusal to release his tax returns would raise questions about his net worth of capital, philanthropic contributions, business dealings and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton seized on the issue and lashed out, posting a web video on Friday highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Trump to release his tax payments.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in her economic policy speech in Michigan.
She told the crowd: "For decades, he refused to publish his own tax returns like other presidential candidates."
According to the Politicians News Network, Trump paid little to no penny in taxes in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants, all of which they said that the current situation may still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a big issue in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named a provision after a liability for hundreds of millions of investors, Warren Buffett, guaranteed that people with annual incomes of more than $1 million would pay at least 30 percent of their taxes.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire Hathaway's company is located, where Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he is also under the audit of the IRS, and that Trump's "fear of" not the tax authorities, but voters.
The earliest tax returns released by the Clinton campaign group were in 2007.
The Clintons currently living in Chabak, New York, paid an average federal tax rate between 2007 and 2014 reached about 32 percent, and the combined tax rate was about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, their wages earned just $100.
Their main investment was low-cost index mutual funds, and the Clintons' dividend and interest income was $109,000.

Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for deleting Israeli phone code as Arab customer "requests"
A French filmmaker with Jewish ancestry revealed to the media that the Kempinski hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli telephone code, and that the hotel staff said it was "required by Arab customers", which caused an uproar in public opinion.
Claude Lonzman, author of the Holocaust documentary The havoc, expressed his disappointment at the Kempinski Hotel and published an open letter in Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
During his recent stay, Lantsman wanted to find Israel on the list of phone codes at the hotel.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can talk directly from the room.
Israel disappeared in the capital of Germany in 2016, Berlin.
Lunzman wrote.
Instead, guests can make calls to Israel via the Kempinski hotel's call centre.
To seek an explanation, the filmmaker asked about the hotel's front desk.
In the letter, Lonzman said the answer he got at the front desk "shocked him to the loomed housantly
Hotel staff said it was "a deliberate decision made by Kempinski's management
The reason for this is to make the filmmaker feel angry.
Lantsman quoted the employee's original words: Most of our guests were Arabs, and they asked for the Israeli code to be deleted. ”
According to the South German Daily, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadass Handelman, called the affair "the great shame of humiliation ."
We were taken aback by learning about the incident.
This in itself is a huge shame.
What happened in Germany and that hotel chain is even more embarrassing.
This does not require any explanation.
“We hope that the hotel will come to the right conclusion that the official was said.
The incident sparked a heated debate online, and everyone thought it was a scandal.
Some people think that the Kempinski Hotel is simply "grovel to meet the requirements of Arab customers"
Another post directly refers to the hotel ’ s “No Face, ” and points out that this famous street on Kudam Avenue is near a synagogue.
According to Der Spiegel, the hotel was quick to clarify all allegations, claiming that everything was "negline" and to make it an "appointy" to Lunzman.
The South German daily newspaper quoted Kempinski as saying: "No direct order was ever made to remove Israel from the Quick Dialing list.
The newspaper also said that the Israeli code had been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to expel Brazilian student in protest
On Thursday, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with police in protest against the government's reform of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to deport protesters.
The incident was caused by an attempt by law enforcement officials to disperse the students, so police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the march, expressing their displeasure with the programs.
To save money, Sao Paulo state Gov. O Kemin plans to close 100 public schools, with 30 million students going to switch to school.
Some of the students who took part in the protest expressed their displeasure with interim President Michel Temer through the graffiti on the wall.
Just days before the most recent protest, protesters took to the streets en masse in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the national Senate.
Scottish cyclist Carm Skinner takes title after taking the bike gold medal
Scottish cyclist Carm Skinner last night at the men's team race at the Rio cycling arena helped the British trio successfully defend the title Olympic gold medal after the 2012 London Olympics.
The 23-year-old Glasgow biker replaced his fellow Scotsman, Sir Chris Hoy, and became the backbone of the ranks. When the young Skingner beat the favourite New Zealand team and brought its name, even the legendary cyclist was proud of him.
Four years ago, the British team was amazing, and Hoe won the fifth of the individual six Olympic gold medals.
The British team finished only sixth at the World Cycling Venue Championship in London in March, and Hoi has since retired. Then, the British team has been brilliant again.
During the Beijing Olympics to the London Olympics, the problem with the British team was to change the "first-lap expert" Jamie Stuff.
The team did exactly that when it appeared in Hindes.
Hoy's retirement also leaves a blank, and Chin Imady and Matt Christon want to fill that gap.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's coaching staff insisted that he was selected for the national team, and Skinner ultimately did not meet expectations.
Skinner's partner was Hinders and Kenny, who won the gold medal with Hoy four years ago. The trio set a new Olympic record in the qualifiers, but that result was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
And these three British cycling races eventually beat their opponents to win the gold medal.
While Hinders were slightly behind, Kenny took the lead for the team, and Sginner kept that lead to the end.
The strategic change was key to this reversal, and Hinders chose the larger flywheel, so it was slower, which allowed Kenny, and in particular Skinner, to keep pace.
Hoy watched the match as a BBC commentator. Skinner, Kenny and Hinders saw him on the podium.
The 23-year-old Glasgow biker Skinner said: "It flatters me to this."
I just tried my best to raise myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world championship.
It's so unbelievable.
Nothing is better than this win.
After winning the gold medal with Kenny and Hoe at the 2012 London Olympics, Hinders admitted to deliberately falling on the track without starting the ground.
Later, he retracted the comment, and the British team's opponents could not appeal.
This victory has no such issue.
"It's like in London, the British flag on the platform."
We were just in the team three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world titles, so it's too surprising to be able to defend the Olympic champion.
For the British team, which won the seven gold medals in the 10-place cycling competition at the Beijing Olympics and the London Olympics, is only a game and a gold medal.
If that symbolizes the progress we've made over the last five months, then we'll continue to succeed in the bike hall for the next five days.
According to the state of Kenny, it is not impossible for him to reproduce Hoi's feat of winning three gold medals at an Olympic Games.
If that's the case, Bie Hoe is 12 years younger and is also on March 23rd (a day that appears to be the sacred day of British sports, Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannest are also born on this day) Kenny will have six gold medals and a silver medal.
That achievement was on par with Hoe.
Kenny will next play in a three-day race that begins today.
The 28-year-old Bolton said: "I'm going to focus on the game for the time being.
Team racing is always the best.
You can win games with your teammates.
Frankly, a person winning is a little lonely.
Hinders said: "If he can win two other gold medals, then he should be awarded the Jazz."
It was the only tournament that produced a medal that day, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Durr advanced to the four-man four-kilometer group chase as soon as they could.
Their results were 351.943.
And the 2012 London Olympics gold medalist's world record is 351.659.
The first round and final (10: 42pm) take place on the second match day of today, and Wiggs will undoubtedly be the focus of attention.
He had an argument with the match officials yesterday before qualifying, when the match officials let him measure his height.
In the women's group competition, which will be over tomorrow, Laura Trolt, Joanna Rothers Chand, Eleanor Barker and Kate Archibald from Milge advanced with a new world record of 413.260.
The British team relied on a strong venue cycling team to take the initiative in the middle of the Olympic Games and won multiple medals.
After showing its absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British cycling team let everyone feel slightly disappointed in their journey to Rio.
There were many folds during the period, including the resignation of April technical director Sean Sutton on allegations of sexism and bullying and the retirement of legendary legends such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the bike hall ’ s first race night is enough to prove that the British team will once again stage the saga of the peak at a critical moment.
After the small life came into this world, the parents and parents are responsible for this life, and this responsibility lies not only in the health of the child, but also in the development of the spirit, that is, education.
If the child fails in the education of the child, then even if the career is successful, it will not be able to make up for the shortcomings of life and the failure of the family.
When a new life comes, new parents need to spend time caring for and educating their children.
And responsible, in addition to the care of the body, let them be healthy, but also in the spiritual education, that is, let the children learn how to be human, how to be adults, how to succeed.
Good family education means that parents need to accompany their children regularly, give their children care, and take care of their children with patience, and also need to teach their children to develop civilized words and deeds, so that children can better learn knowledge and improve their intelligence.
Parents' words and deeds will affect the growth of children, they will imitate their parents, that is, people often say that dragons, Fengsheng, rat sons will punch holes, parents like children what kind of children.
Therefore, parents need to be a good example in front of their children, standardize their words and deeds, and cultivate their own excellent character, which can indirectly help the child to shape a good heart and make him more excellent.
Amy is a smart and beautiful girl.
She is exuberant and lively, can get along well with her friends, and adapt well to the environment.
But Amy has a little secret in her heart: she can't focus on her long-term study and work tasks.
This secret has been with Amy for a long time.
Even with decentralized, modular time to study and work, she can basically get things done and get good results.
But when the task is heavy and the time is tight, Amy feels very bitter and tortured.
Individual resistance to self-exaling and its emotional experience is designed not to put an individual's self-knowledge and self-esteem at risk.
There are also behavioral psychologists who understand impedance as an individual's disobedience to the correction of their behavior.
I tried to get Amy to do an exercise to calm herself down by breathing and to feel that for that ordeal.
And once she left the trapped situation, she felt herself relaxed and regained her freedom.
Han, a 63-year-old wanderer, had an argument with another vagabond Xiao Mou after drinking wine, so he took a knife to death.
Han said that before the case, he and the vagabond Xiao were living on the ground in a hutong in the Dongcheng District, and the two were more than 20 meters apart.
Han said that on the day of the crime, they were called by friends to drink together, and the two had two disputes at dinner and after dinner.
Han said that if he was afraid that Xiao would hit him, he picked up a fruit knife from the garbage pile and strangling him to death.
In the court, the victim's family asked Han for compensation for funeral expenses and death compensation, etc., which totaled more than 53 million yuan.
Uber's entry into the Taiwan market for four years has had a big impact on the local traditional taxi industry.
Taiwan's "United News" said on August 12th that more than a hundred taxis around Taiwan's "administrative court" on the morning of the 12th to protest, resulting in serious traffic paralysis in the surrounding area.
Zheng Lijia, director of the Taipei City Drivers' Union, said that in the next four years, the Taiwan authorities only held a meeting at the end of this month, and the drivers can no longer wait.
Yet the government is untrustworthy and drags on.
Law-abiding taxi drivers belonging to the bottom of the labor force, but they want to compete with Uber, who are illegal but not restricted, and feel cheated by the authorities.
Original title: Jiangsu a farm 2000 chicken was seized by the court's owner and sold for punishment without authorization
After the judgment came into effect, because Li did not automatically fulfill his obligations under the judgment, Wang applied to the Shuyang court for enforcement.
On October 16, 2014, the Shuyang court made a civil ruling that the egg and chickens in the farm were seized only in 2000, and could not be transferred or sold without permission.
After receiving the detention ruling, Li sold some of the eggs and chickens in the farm privately without permission from the Shuyang court.
Until March 8, 2015, when the Shuyang County Public Security Bureau was surveyed, there were only 142 eggs in the farm.
Reporters learned on August 12 that the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympic Games Organizing Committee issued a notice that the Beijing Winter Olympic Organizing Committee inherited intellectual property rights such as the emblem and logo of the Beijing Winter Olympic Committee.
No one may use the emblem and logo of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games for commercial purposes without the permission of the Beijing Winter Olympic Organizing Committee.
The head of the Industrial Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out here today that steel overcapacity is a global problem.
In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate is higher than the global average, and it is also higher than in the United States and Europe and other countries and regions.
China has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess capacity, and the results are gradually showing.
The person in charge pointed out that the Party Central Committee attaches great importance to the global problem of steel overcapacity.
All departments and regions actively implement the deployment of the State Council and work seriously, and reduce the production capacity of crude steel by about 45 million tons this year.
Starting from China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports, on the contrary, it also takes a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The person in charge stressed that the international trade of steel products is essentially a market behavior, which is an independent choice after factors such as the demand of the importing country and the comprehensive consideration of the product cost performance.
The implementation of trade protection measures will not help to fundamentally solve the development of the global steel industry, on the contrary, it will only cause further impact on the international trade order.
When talking about debt, the person in charge stressed that the issue of resolving debt is an important issue that needs to be properly handled in the process of resolving excess capacity.
Due to the large size of steel enterprises' assets and wide scope, the debt relationship of some enterprises is complex, and if the disposal is improper, it may lead to regional risks.
According to the person in charge, in recent years, with the increasing downward pressure on the economy, the overall social demand has gradually weakened, the capacity utilization rate of some industries has declined, and the production and operation difficulties of enterprises have increased.
Some enterprises do not adapt to the changes in the market environment, production and operation is difficult to sustain or even close to the closure, but due to some institutional constraints, the obstacles to exit in a market-oriented way, become "zombie enterprises raq."
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of factor resources, increases social management costs, and hinders the establishment of a fair competition market environment.
The main reason for the loss is that the world steel industry is facing the same difficulties as the global steel industry demand is weak, the capacity utilization rate is low.
China mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic instruments and rule of law methods, and the government mainly does a good job in the work of workers and social stability to ensure a fair and just market order.
The person in charge stressed that in the next step, we must unswervingly continue to do a good job in capacity production and ensure the completion of the goal of resolving the production capacity of 1 billion ~1.5 million tons in the past five years.
On the afternoon of the 10th, as soon as the Chinese tourist police appeared in Moscow's Red Square, it immediately attracted people's attention, and Chinese tourists waved with surprises, and local and foreign tourists could not help but stop to look back.
On the same day, members of the tourism police detachment of the first professional tourism police team of the Sanya Public Security Bureau of Hainan Province came to Red Square in Moscow to exchange and learn from the local tourist police on duty.
The Moscow Tourist Police was patrolled in three teams in Red Square, Nikolysky Walking Street, and the Gum department store. The Chinese tourist police studied with the post, and the whole process lasted for more than an hour.
Female Sergeant Liu Xione, who is in her 20s, fluent in English and Spanish, has just joined the tourist police force last year.
He took a closer look at the words and deeds of his Russian counterpart along the way, and from time to time he communicated with her.
When I met Spanish tourists, the Moscow Tourist Police gave a patient explanation to each other in fluent Spanish, which impressed Wang Bing.
"Moscow tourist police everyone has a foreign language, and some will have more than two doors, which has a very big touch for us."
"Hainan, as an international tourist island, is gradually paying attention to attracting international tourists, and we hope to improve our ability to match the status of the international tourist island."
On the same day, before the study, the Chinese tourist police also went to the Moscow City Tourism Police Brigade station to communicate with their Russian counterparts.
"I often deal with Chinese tourists, and I'm very happy to see them coming to Russia."
"The questions they usually ask for help are: how the road is going, where a monument is, how to rent, how to go back to the hotel."
Ressakov, captain of the Moscow City Tourism Police Brigade, said that in recent years, Moscow's urban environment and tourism atmosphere have become better and more attractive to foreign tourists.
In order to meet the needs of tourism development, a tourism police team was set up in July 2014 to patrol and defend, help and guide tourists at major attractions.
Currently, all Moscow tourist police are proficient in English, and some also master Spanish and German.
Police brigades divide them into nine groups according to their level of foreign language, taking 2 lessons a week to learn self-defense, laws and regulations, and foreign languages.
"At present, two tourist police officers have started learning Chinese, which is already good, and we will continue to improve their Chinese level, said:
Ressakov told reporters that the Moscow Tourism Police has accumulated a certain amount of experience since its formation, hoping to inspire Sanya's peers.
He believes that the cooperation between the police departments of Russia and China will enhance the security of their citizens to travel to each other's countries.
"The recruitment of personnel recruitment, police mode, equipment, and good interaction with tourists in Moscow have taught us a lot of inspiration to RALAmate Chen Xiaokun.
China New Network reporter combing found that at least nine provinces and cities such as Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian, Beijing have issued residential permit implementation rules.
For the conditions for applying for a residence permit, the above-mentioned areas generally propose that it is necessary to live for more than half a year, and it meets one of the conditions for legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence, and continuous study.
China New Network reporter noted that in terms of the treatment provided by the residence permit, the "gold content" varies from place to place, and the scope of public services and conveniences provided by some regions has expanded compared with the provisions of the national version.
These areas have increased the ease of children being able to take local gaokao under the relevant conditions.
In addition, Beijing and other places have made clear requirements for the gradual expansion of the scope of the provision of public services and facilities, and regular publicization to the public.
For example, Fujian proposed that the scope of public services and convenience enjoyed by the holder of the residence permit be announced to the public at least once every three years.
The Interim Regulations on Residence permits stipulate that if the conditions for the processing of residence permits are met, the public security organ shall, within 15 days from the date of acceptance, make a residence permit.
For the time limit for the issuance of certificates, most of the regions are in line with the views of the national version, which is issued within 15 days.
Hebei clearly, if it meets the conditions for application and complete the materials, the residential public security police station shall issue a residence permit within three working days from the date of acceptance.
Jiangxi stipulates that if the conditions for applying for residence permit are met and the supporting materials are complete, the public security organ shall make a residence permit within five working days from the date of acceptance.
According to the provisions of the Interim Regulations on Residence Permits, the above-mentioned areas are clear and apply for a residence permit for the first time and waive the cost of the document.
For example, Sichuan requirements, local public security police stations or entrusted community service agencies should strictly implement the approved charging items and charging standards, and resolutely prohibit the scope, over-standard charges or ride-hailing charges.
After investigation, on July 27, 2016, Chen Yangxia, secretary of the former Ganzhou Dingnan County Party Committee, reported to the provincial disciplinary committee to work, serving as the director of the Party Wind and Economic Supervision Office (Deputy Director, probation period for one year).
The red wine that was drunk that night was provided by Li Youcai personally, and other expenses were borne by one person Liu.
The Jiangxi Provincial Discipline Commission informed that Chen Yangxia, Chen Ziliang and others organized and accepted eating and accepting food invitations in private clubs, violating the spirit of the eight provisions of the Central Committee and violating the party's discipline.
Pogba ate two yellow cards in the Italian Cup last season and will automatically ban one under the rules.
Although he has moved back to the Premier League, the FA has extended its cumulative suspension to the Premier League.
As a result, Pogba will look to the wall in the run-up to Bournemouth on the 14th of August, and his return to Manchester United's debut will be extended to the 20th to the 20th and Southampton's home game.
As the first-round 12th rookie of 2014, Sarwich will officially make the NBA next season and join the Philadelphia 76ers.
As a young European player, many fans don't know him well, but through the Olympics, I believe that Saric's performance has impressed people.
In the last match of Croatia's victory over Spain, Saric succeeded in sealing off Paul Gasol in the final minute trying to drag the game into the extra-time basket.
Recently, the 76ers manager Brett Brown gave Saric high ratings, and the Spurs manager thought he saw the shadow of Manu-Ginobili in his youth in Saric.
It was clear that Saric had shown his talent and kept the 76ers expecting him.
Croatia's first two games at the Olympics, Sarí got a total of 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Saric showed his ability to pull out space on the field, and after being pulled through the team-mates, he could hit the shots outside the three-point line.
Although the inside of this 76er currently hoards a lot of talented young players, they do not have the ability of Saric's outliers.
From the cap to the long-spreading and the completion of the assist, there are only a handful of inside players on the NBA field to do this today.
Since the start of the Games, Saric has received 13 points, eight rebounds and five assists in the three games, and the performance is comprehensive.
Since deciding to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014, James has signed two 1+1 contracts in a row.
As the NBA's labor agreement enters its final year, as vice president of the NBA's players union, James will be at the forefront of the negotiations on the collective agreement.
Given the big uplift in league revenue, thanks to the new televised protocols and the feud between bosses and players about how to handle the money, there are fears the NBA will be in a shutdown next summer.
But for James, he won't have to worry about becoming a free agent next summer because he's already a 3-year contract with the Cavaliers.
No matter when the 2017-18 season officially started, James was within the contract.
Since the stunning appearance of the iPhoneSE, the mobile phone market has also ushered in a boom in small screeners.
Not long ago, Nubia also launched its first work in the Z11 series: the nulliaZ11mini.
The nubiaZ11mini continues its consistently superior photogenic gene, equipped with a 5-0-inch screen with a one-handedly more secure, easy-to-use rear fingerprint recognition, for its outstanding experience.
Nubia's just-listed small-screen photo mobile phone Z11mini reduced the price of 200 yuan, that is, from the original 1499 yuan to 1299 yuan.
In terms of appearance, the nubiaZ11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen, which is still the classic "Little Red Circle" design below the front.
The middle box is metallic, with a symmetrical design at the bottom and configuration of the Type-C data interface.
Portland smelter's future is fraught with uncertainty over cancellation of power supply contract
As the power company that powers the plant revealed that a factory owner would terminate a supply contract, all supply contracts lapsed, the Portland aluminum smelting plant in Victoria and hundreds of plant workers are currently facing an uncertain future.
The move comes after the Victorian government decided not to continue to issue subsidies guaranteeing plant operations.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will be terminated in November.
The 2000 workers at the Alcoa-U.S. plant in Portland could face job losses.
Once the factory is closed, there may be as many as 2000 people who are directly or indirectly unemployed.
And because the plant's electricity consumption accounts for about 10% of Victoria's entire power output, it may also have a ripple effect.
In 2014, the company closed the Hanrui Corner smelting plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesey Island power plant last year.
Alcoa Portland smelters are currently losing money and are at risk of closure.
The move comes after a forecast of the plant for the next few years, initially due to a strengthening of the Australian dollar and, more recently, because of the price of the plant's products.
AGL supplies electricity to the large aluminum smelter through the Latrob Valley Old Eyang power plant. The company predicts that three other plant owners will also terminate their agreement.
The plant's largest shareholder is a joint venture between Aluminum and Alumina, while China's CITIC Group and Japan's Marubeni Co., Ltd. also hold a small stake.
The joint venture said: "AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, which means that the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand."
AGL said the contracts were "hedging contracts that should have come into force" since November 2016.
The termination of the contract is 12 months, so they will be terminated in 2017.
The power company said: "Therefore, AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in the 2017 fiscal year."
Any possible revenue impact on AGL since fiscal year 2018 is currently being followed by an optimistic outlook for wholesale electricity prices in the futures market.
AGL said the company had tilified the value of $187 million in the "terminated event expectation."
Alcoal said its decision to terminate the contracts "will not affect the ability of Alcoa to operate the smelter or guarantee the smelter's power supply to the smelter."
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Lao Eyang in 2010, which would have been in effect in November, but the company did not explain why it was withdrawing from the contract.
Analysts are wary of whether the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle will be shut down because of the industry's dire economic situation.
In response to comments made by analysts earlier this week, AGL operations chief Stephen Mickelson said Portland's electricity consumption is up to about 600 megawatts per year and the Tomago plant reaches about 900 megawatts.
If the two factories close, the demand for the electricity market will be greatly reduced.
“As an power company, this is not a good news for us.
Community Law Centre Shuts Out of the Nation Every Year
More than a million of the most vulnerable groups are turned away each year by community legal centres. Funding for the service is already stretched, and now it's going to face further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of every five people are denied when seeking free legal advice and agency services, most of them elderly, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without the resources to fight unjust evictions.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limit, and it is now facing further funding cuts.
Since next June, the federal government's funding for these legal centers will be reduced by another 30%.
Queensland Community Law Centre head James Farrell said thousands of people were turned off each year, according to the latest National Community Association Legal Centre investigation report.
Mr Farrell said the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change the existing decision.
“Queensland ’ s community law centre has been underfunded for a long time, which means that thousands of people will not be able to access the vital services they need, ” he said.
People who need to stay away from violence, people with huge debts that can't be repaid, families facing falling apart, workers who are squeezed, are all facing legal problems, and the report shows that they can't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut back a further 30 per cent funding from June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable people in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland MP George Brandis to immediately undo these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when they face legal issues.
Last year, the state government promised to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
Attention must now be paid to community-based legal centres and their need to respond to communities, and the White Leqi government must also be put into this important work.
Donald Trump campaign team indicted for pulling gun for staff
NEW YORK: Trump's campaign team has been indicted for inaction after his North California head pulled a gun to a staff member while driving a Jeep in February.
Vincent Bodini, a former software trainer for the state's campaign team, described the incident Wednesday in a state court in Charlotte.
Bodini said he had hoped the matter could be resolved internally, but waited months after he realized "it's impossible to happen 燨
According to Bodini's description, the person in charge, Earl Philip, "duprooted a handgun, placed his right index finger on the plate, and pointed the muzzle at Vincent's knee bones."
After filing a complaint with the leadership of the local and regional campaign teams, Bodini learned from the dossier that at least four others had gone through the same thing.
In his complaint, Bodini said in the complaint: "The absence of a shot does not mean that there will be no harm."
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential candidate told the masses in North Carolina that if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and she liked the judge, then "the person who supports the Second Amendment, which is the possibility of action by gunholders and gun enthusiasts, has sparked outrage."
Trump's campaign said the media took his words out of context and he did not advocate violence.
In his complaint, Bodini asked the campaign to compensate for his own unsupervised supervision, and also asked Philippe for compensation for his assault, beating and mental injury.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the news.
I can't get to Philip.
According to a local news agency in Charlotte, Philippe recently left the campaign.
His consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, did not immediately respond to the call.
The campaign team for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been controversial.
The two parties in this case are Bodini and President Trump campaign for the company, 16-CS-14300, Mecklenburg County (Charlotte) Superior Court General Court.
Britain must pass on the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport
Heathrow will also bring energy and prosperity to our communities, London and the country as a whole.
For me, this is the charm of Heathrow, as at the 2012 London Olympics, we did everything in our power to ensure that our country and region could benefit from these events.
The Olympics have benefited Stratford and the Eastern District.
And we will once again benefit the region by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
In terms of our local community alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and get the young people around the airport out of unemployment.
As ahead of the 2012 London Olympics, some people thought Heathrow's expansion was too large.
I'm told the UK won't be ready for the Olympics and we're going to be humiliating in front of the world.
The doubters about the 2012 Olympics are wrong, and their suspicions about the Heathrow program will also be turned out to be wrong.
While obstacles that need to be overcome will always arise, Heathrow is addressing every problem that faces.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority and not the few.
The expansion will create up to 18 million new jobs, bring in £21.1bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of technology and jobs around the airport and across the UK.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team. The team has completed a £110bn infrastructure investment project on time and within budget, including the T5 terminal for five consecutive years to be elected to the world's best airport terminal and the T2 terminal between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they are ready to build a third runway with a £16bn private investment.
The UK has successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics, and I am confident that the Heathrow Airport expansion project will be a huge success.
Now is the right time for us to pass on the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow so that we can protect our future and create a wealth of technology and jobs that makes the whole of the UK proud.
Lord Paul Dayton is chairman of the board of directors of Heathrow Airport and former UK Treasury business counsellor
A woman commits suicide on a Swiss highway and is tossed and killed.
The victim lay on the highway at midnight.
The woman, who attempted suicide, was run by multiple vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning. Police are currently searching for witnesses.
The accident happened on the A1 motorway near Mohrj, Vosaw early hours of the early hours of Thursday.
Vozhou police said a woman was "descendantly" lying on the road late at night and being run by multiple vehicles.
The victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, had a clear act with suicidal intentions. She was run-run by multiple vehicles, including a van.
The woman died on the spot.
Police revealed that multiple of the drivers involved have been investigated, but some drivers have not confirmed it. At present, police are calling on them and witnesses to come to investigate.
Lawyer Gillesofstadter told the Geneva Tribune that a criminal investigation has now begun, which is a routine process for such incidents.
It is not yet known whether the driver will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
Hofschittel said: "This will be determined by prosecutors."
Based on the results of two similar cases in the past five years, the driver will not be liable.
According to the newspaper, both cases were caused by someone taking the highway late at night. The final verdict was that it was impossible for the driver to expect pedestrians to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, an officer was charged with negligent death, with the alleged content of August 2014, when she hit a man on the A1 highway near Payene and killed him.
The court learned that the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking.
The judge said after the investigation that the policewoman's driving behaviour at the time was completely legal, and that the man appeared on the road "completely unexpected and unforeseen circumstances" and that the policewoman made a first aid call afterwards.
Anyone who can provide information about the accident near Bolges on Thursday should contact police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once suitable for human habitation
According to the predictions of NASA's new climate model, Venus was once suitable for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Research have developed a model that can explore the past of Venus, a model that uses tools and algorithms that are similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, whose surface is hot, waterless and filled with carbon dioxide, has ever had an environment similar to Earth.
Previously, scientists thought that Venus' rotation was slower because its atmosphere was thicker.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus may have had a thinner, Earth-like atmosphere and a slower rotation at the time.
The model also shows the early terrain of Venus.
There could be more dry regions than Earth, but there were once enough water and geographic changes to cede life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the sun shining on Venus was 30 percent darker than Earth.
Anthony Del Genio, a scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Research, explained at a press conference: "In the model simulation of the Goddard Institute, Venus' slow rotation makes the daytime on one side of nearly two months for nearly two months."
This warms the surface and produces rain that can form thick clouds, which block most of the sun's heat for the ground like an umbrella.
The result of the simulation is that the average climate temperature of Venus is actually a few degrees lower than that of Earth today.
The model's simulated evolution of Venus is similar to that previously speculated by planetary scientists.
Although life may have existed on Venus, over billions of years, Venus was exposed to high temperatures and ultraviolet light.
The planet's oceans evaporate and water vapor is burned with ultraviolet rays.
With the escape of hydrogen, only the thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and the deadly greenhouse gas effect, thus forming what we know today to Venus.
The researchers published simulations of a new model of the Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Newsletter.
Patrick Roy resigns as avalanche manager
Patrick Roy, who stepped down as head coach and vice president of the Colorado avalanche ice hockey team on Thursday, said he has no say at the team's decision-making level.
Colorado executive executive general manager Joe Sages confirmed the news and said the club will start looking for a new head coach immediately.
Roy, who is fifty-year-old, said in a statement: "Over the past three years, I have been alive, passionate and determined to carry out the duties of the head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche team."
I've thought hard all summer about how to improve this team to get to the next level.
To this end, the manager and vice president's goals must be aligned with the club's goals.
He also needs to have a voice in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
At present, these conditions are not met.
Saschis hired Roy on May 23, 2013, and he thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick told me his decision today. ”
We are grateful for what he has made to the club and hope that he will be smooth in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award League's best coach in the first season of 2013-14 coaching the avalanche.
He helped the club score 112 points, ranking first in the Central Division. But the Colorado team was eliminated by the Minnesota team in the first round of the playoff, all of which have been lost in the last two years.
In the 2015-16 season, the avalanche team finished 39 win 39 flat and 4, and eventually lost the second wild card qualification for the Western Major League Division by a margin of five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy has won four Stanley Cups, each of which won two of them when he played for the Montreal Canadiens and avalanche.
North Sea oil field workers stop strike, continue talks
The chief negotiator said workers in the North Sea oil field had stopped a strike on pay, and the parties to the dispute began a new round of negotiations.
A number of strikes against the oil service company Wood Group have been on a North Sea oil platform operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement, “Wood Group and Unite and RMT Unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the current dispute resolution process. ”
We will start early next week and hold multiple full-day meetings in the coming weeks to revisit these issues.
The union said its recent actions were taken to protest a pay cut that could reach a maximum of 30 percent, which was the first time the union has taken it in 25 years.
The Wood Group has reduced North Sea contractors ’ compensation by about 9 percent this year due to market pressure.
Before this pay cut, the company reduced its compensation for offshore contractors by 10 percent in 2014.
The company said that another pay cut will help the company through the market bust.
Shell has laid off thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries, as the company needs to streamline its business after the company's merger with British energy company UK Gas Group.
Energy companies are facing pressure from falling crude oil prices and the UK's decision to leave the EU in June.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labor dispute of this generation in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea is vital for the regional economy.
“In the North Sea and the nation, we need an economy that serves the majority, not the minority, ” Dave said in a statement.
Spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to be no more than $14 billion in 2016, while the average project spending over the past five years has reached about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of the stars of the Ancho cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers capture the most complete star rotation speed.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the star in the cluster has a different rotational velocity and the association of rotation cycles with the planet.
Lussa Reebble, a research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology at Pasadena, said in a press release: “We hope to further understand the relationship between star mass, age, and even the history of its solar system by comparing our results with other clusters. ”
The Aung Cebu is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 1.25 billion years ago and are still in adulthood.
They reach the highest rotation speed in their lifetime.
When reaching the highest rotation velocity, these mature stars eject a large number of stellar winds.
When these stellar winds pass through the star's magnetic field, they exert a brake effect on the star.
As the star gets older, its rotational speed begins to slow.
Kepler measured the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time of the visible star black, like the sunspot.
The latest rotational velocity dataset shows that the larger-mass star's rotation rate is slower than the star with less mass.
Rebler compares the star to a dancer, where larger dancers rotate slower than the smaller dancers of the body.
"In the 'ballerinal performance' of the Aung Cebu cluster, we found that slower-rope-turned stars tend to be larger in mass, and the fastest-rotating stars tend to be the lightest.
