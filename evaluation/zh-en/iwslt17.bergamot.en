Well, I'm going to tell a story about how we know what we know.
This story is about the woman, Natalia Liczynski.
She is a paleontologist, and her specialty is to dig up ancient things everywhere.
Natalia Liczynski: "Yes, some people call me Dr. Dead."
I find it particularly interesting because the places where she digs things are in the Arctic Circle at high latitudes, in the far Canadian permafrost.
One day in the summer of 2006, she was at an archaeological excavation site called the Fars leaf bed, which was less than 10 degrees from the magnetic north pole.
NR: "Really, that doesn't sound like much." "You've been carrying a bag all day, with a GPS navigator and a notebook," "and you've been traveling long distances, picking up what might be fossils."
But at some point, she noticed something.
“A little rusty thing, ‘probably as big as my palm.”
"He's lying on the ground."
Her first reaction was that it was just a piece of wood, because it was something that had been found in the Fars leaf bed—prehistoric plants.
That night, we went back to camp...
NR: “...I took out my hand-held microscope,” and I looked more closely, and suddenly I found, ““This thing doesn’t look like an annual ring.”
“It’s because of the problem of preservation,” “but it really looks like...”
"The Bones."
So over the next four years, she went back to that location, and finally collected 30 pieces of debris, all from the same bone, many of which were very small.
"It's not a lot. A small zipper bag fits."
Then she tried to put the pieces together like a puzzle.
But this is very challenging.
"It's broken into a lot of tiny pieces," "We tried to recover with sand and oily ash, but it looked bad."
"In the end, we used a three-dimensional surface scanner."
Oh, and "That's cute, isn't it?"
In the end, it was found that it was much easier to recover in a virtual way.
"When they're all put together, it feels really amazing."
How sure are you to put it right, to put it in the same way?
Is it possible that you spelled it in the other way and finally spelled out... a little parrot or something?
"No, no. We're going to fight right."
She found that she had a tibia, that is, a calf bone, and that the tibia came from a mammal that was ungulate, such as cattle and sheep.
But it can’t be a cow or a sheep.
It's too big.
"It's really that big. It's a huge animal."
So what animal will it be?
Now she had a bottleneck, so she showed a piece of that piece of it to some of her colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea.
“We used the small saw, and then scraped a little bit of the corner of the debris,” and then some very magical smells came out from there.”
It smells like burnt skin.
It was a smell that Natalia knew, and she smelled it when she cut her skull in a general anatomy lab, and that was collagen.
Collagen makes our bones hard.
Generally speaking, after so many years, it will naturally break down.
In this case, however, the Arctic is like a natural freezer.
A year or two later, Natalia went to a convention in Bristol, where she saw one of her colleagues, Mike Buckley, in demonstrating a new technique he called “collypfingerprinting.”
In fact, collagen in different species has a slightly different structure, so if you have collagen information for an unknown bone, you can compare it with collagen information of a known species, so who knows, maybe you've found matching information.
So she sent Mike a piece of debris, with FedEx.
"Of course, you have to keep an eye on the delivery schedule. It's important."
He then processed the sample, comparing it to 37 known mammal species of modern age.
I found a pair!
The final conclusion is that the 3.5-million-year-old bone found in the high latitudes of the Arctic Circle is derived from...
of a camel.
I was just thinking, "What's the joke?" "If we're not right, it's amazing."
So they tested a whole bunch of pieces, and got the same results for each.
However, judging by the size of the bone they found, this means that the camel is 30% larger than the modern camel.
Then the camel is about 2.7 meters tall and weighs a ton.
(Shocked) Yes.
Natalia discovers an Arctic camel.
Now that you hear the word “camel,” you have the picture in your mind: the twin camels of East and Central Asia.
But it's more likely that the image in your head is more like this: a single-peak camel, a typical desert animal, often in the hot desert, for example, the Middle East or the Sahara, with an oversized hump on its back, allowing it to store water for long treks in the desert, and wide soles to help them step over the sand dunes.
So how did these guys get to the high-latitude Arctic Circle?
In fact, scientists have long known that before Natalia's discovery, camels originated in the Americas.
(Music: American National Anthem "Song of the Stars and Stars and Stars)" they originated here.
In the 45 million years that camels have lived, 40 million years, you can only find them in North America, and there are 20 different species in all, maybe more.
“If we put them in a row, would they look different?”
"Yes, their bodies vary greatly."
There are some necks that are particularly long, "so they function very much like a giraffe."
Some have long noses, like crocodiles.
“They’re particularly primitive, and some of the earliest ones may be very small,” “Almost like a little rabbit.”
What, a rabbit-sized camel?
“The first ones are yes.”
“You may not recognize them.”
Oh my god, I want a rabbit camel to be a pet!
“I know, it’s going to be great, right?”
Then about 3 million to 7 million years ago, one branch of the camel migrated south to South America, where they evolved into llamas or alpacas, and another branch crossed the Bering Land Bridge to Asia and Africa.
Around the end of the last glacier, the camels of North America went extinct.
So scientists already know this, but that doesn’t fully explain how Natalia found camels in the north.
Here, from a temperature point of view, it is the opposite of the Sahara.
To be honest, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius higher than it is today.
So it's a northern forest, a bit like the Yukon River basin or Siberia today.
However, they are still six months long in the winter, and all the ponds will be frozen.
You will have a snowstorm.
You will meet for 24 hours of the night.
In the end... what happened?
How can these Sahara Desert superstars survive in this cold condition?
Natalia and her colleagues felt they had found the answer.
And the answer is pretty clever.
What if these properties of camels evolved in order to adapt to the Sahara environment, as we think?
What if those broad feet were not to walk over the sand dunes, but to walk over the snowfield like snow boots?
If those humps are stuffed, it's not water, but fat, which is actually meant to keep camels through the six-month-long cold winter of food.
If we say that far after that, after they crossed the land bridge, they transformed these winter characteristics to adapt to the hot desert environment.
For example, those humps may be good for camels in the hot zone, because when your fat accumulates in the same place, you know, like a "fat backpack," it means that your body's insulation doesn't have to cover the whole body.
This makes heat dissipation easier.
It was this crazy idea that makes the camels appear to be typical desert properties, and suddenly become evidence that they originated in the high latitudes of the Arctic.
I’m not the first to tell this story.
Others have already spoken to admire the wonders of biological evolution, or to glimpse the future climate change.
But I love this story for a different reason.
To me, it’s a story about us, about how we know the world, about how that perception has changed.
My profession is a historian.
I think a lot of scientists are historians.
They understand the past.
They tell the history of the universe, the earth and the creatures of the earth.
As a historian, you need to have an idea in your mind about how this story goes.
“We make up stories, and then we go along the lines of thought, ‘It’s like a camel in the desert, right?’”
"It's a great story! The camel is perfect for the desert."
“Obviously, the camel has been living there.”
But at any time, you may find small clues.
You may find something small that forces you to reinvent everything you think you know.
Like this example, this scientist found this fragment, and she thought it was wood, and because of this discovery, the scientific community gave birth to a new, counter-intuitive theory, explaining why this strange, hairy creature grew into what it is today.
For me, it completely overturned my view of the camel.
It went from being a creature that exists only for this particular environment to a round-the-world traveler, just happens to be in the Sahara, and it can happen anywhere at any time.
This is Azuri.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I brought you some food.
Azuli has just finished her special performance, coming from Radio City Music Hall in New York.
This is not a joke.
Seriously, Azul is here as a living example that the story of the world is changing rapidly.
We need to be proactive, to boldly make changes and re-imagin.
Azul, are you right?
True, there is only a broken bone in our new perspective on the world.
Thank you guys.
Today’s computers are so amazing that we even ignore how bad they actually are.
Today I'm going to talk to you about this and how we can solve it with neuroscience.
First of all, I’m going to take you back to a cold night in Harlem in 2011, which had profound implications for me.
I was sitting in a bar next to Columbia University, where I majored in computers and neuroscience, and I was having an interesting conversation with a classmate about the power of holography that would one day replace computers.
Just as our conversation was going to be great, unsurprisingly, his phone rang.
He picked up his phone and started typing.
Then he looked up at me from time to time and said, "Go on, I'll listen."
But it was clear that his eyes were not focused, and a wonderful moment was so fleeting.
Also, across the bar, I noticed another student holding his phone, this time around a crowd.
He was looking at the photos on Instagram, and the kids were laughing.
They were so happy with the same technology, and I was so frustrated that this contrast immediately caught my mind.
As I thought more deeply, I realized more and more that it was clear that the problem here was not electronic information, but simply that the location of the information separated me from my friends and brought these children together.
It's clear that they're being connected to something, like our ancestors evolved their social cognition, like telling stories around bonfires.
I think that’s exactly what the tools should do.
They should extend our physical function.
I think today, computers are doing the exact opposite.
Whether you’re sending an email to your wife, or giving a symphony score, or just comforting a friend, you’re almost always doing it the same way.
You bend over to these squares, play with buttons and menus, and more squares appear.
I think it’s the wrong way, and I think we can start using a more natural machine.
The machines we use should be able to bring our work back to real life.
We should use machines that can use neuroscience principles to extend our senses, not limit them.
I have a machine like that now.
It’s called Meta 2.
Let's try.
Now I can see the audience, and I can see my hands.
In counting to 3, 2, 1, we're going to see an image of a holographic photograph, a very real holographic photograph in front of me, in front of the glasses I'm wearing now.
Of course, this can be anything we're going to buy, or learn, and I can easily control its movement with my hands.
And I think Iron Man would be proud.
We will be back later.
If you're like me, you should be thinking about what you can do with this technology, let's look at some examples.
My mother was an architect, so it's natural that the first thing I could imagine was to draw a three-dimensional building, rather than using these flat floor drawings.
In fact, she is now touching the design and wanting to choose an interior decoration.
All of this was shot by GoPro in my glasses.
The next use case is very personal for me, Professor Adam Gozerley’s Glass Brain Project, thanks here for the authorization of UCSF.
As a neuroscience student, I'm always amazed at the ability to learn and remember these complex brain structures with a real machine so I can touch and fiddle with different brain structures.
Now what you're seeing is called augmented reality, but to me, it's just part of a more important story -- a story about how we started using digital devices to extend our bodies, not to limit our physical function.
Then -
In the next few years, humanity will undergo a transformation, I think.
We're going to start covering an entire digital information layer in the real world.
Take a moment to imagine what this means for the storyteller, for the painter, for the brain surgeon, for the interior decorator, and perhaps for all of us here today.
And I think what we're going to do as a group is really trying and trying to imagine how we can create this new reality, in a way that extends the human experience, rather than gamifying our reality, or mixing reality with digital information.
That’s what I’m very interested in doing.
Now I want to tell you a little secret.
In about five years — not the smallest device — in about five years, these will look like striped glasses placed in front of you, capable of projecting holograms.
Just like we don't care much about the hardware parameters of different phones -- which phone we buy is the operating system -- as a neuroscientist, I always want to build a brain-based iOS, if I can.
It's very, very important to make sure it works, because these things will not be less time than we've been exposed to the Windows image user interface.
I don't know what you think, but living in Windows makes me feel a little scary.
To isolate the single most intuitive contact interface to an infinite distance, we use neuroscience to guide our designs, rather than having a bunch of designers argue in the design room.
The principle of our evolution is called the least resistance nerve pipe.
At each moment of change, we connect the iOS system of the brain to our brain, and the first time, with our brain language.
In other words, we’re trying to create a computer with a zero learning curve.
We’re building a system that you always knew how to use.
These are the first three design guidelines we use in this new form of user experience.
First, you are an operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract, and they make your brain have to go around a few more corners to decode them.
We are taking the opposite route to the “minimum resistance nerve pipeline.”
At the same time, in augmented reality, you can certainly put your holographic TED display here and put your holographic mail on the other side of the table, and your spatial memory has evolved to extract this information exactly.
You can put Tesla’s holographic photography in the online shopping here — or any pattern my legitimate team told me before taking the stage.
Well, your brains really know how to get back to reality.
The second interface guide is what we call “touch and visual.”
What do babies do when they see something they are interested in?
They will try to reach out and grab it.
Natural machines work like that.
In fact, the visual system gets a very basic push, and we can call it ontological sensation -- that's a sense that parts of our body are in space.
By directly engaging with our working people, we not only control it better, but we also understand it more deeply.
This is “contact visibility.”
But it is not enough to experience things ourselves.
We are social primates.
This reminds me of our third guide, “The bonfire of holography” from our first story:
Our mirrors, the neural system, show that we can better relate to everyone and our work, if we can see the three-dimensional image of each person's face and hands.
So, if you look at the video behind me, you can see two Meta users operating the same holographic image, building eye contact, focusing on this thing, rather than being distracted by external devices.
Let’s try again with the concept of neuroscience.
Again, our favorite interface, the brain of the iOS system.
Now I'm going to take a step forward and grab the pair of glasses, and put it on the table.
I am in a moment with you, and we are connected.
My spatial memory is working, and I can go over grab it and bring it back here, reminding myself that I’m an operating system.
Now that my body feels like it's working, I can go and make these glasses burst into thousands of pieces, and then touch the sensor that's scanning my hand right now.
But it’s not enough to just see that, so soon, Ryan, my co-founder, will call me in a 3D.
Hi Ryan, how are you?
Ladies, I can see this man in front of me in the form of a three-dimensional projection.
And his image is very real.
(Applause ) Thank you.
My mirror-nerf system shows that this will be an alternative to telephone in the near future.
Ryan, how are you?
Ryan: I'm fine. We've finally been able to demonstrate it live.
Ryan, give you a small gift from the holographic photography we saw in the short film.
This will not only change the way we make phone calls, but it will also change the way we work together.
Thank you very much.
thanks Ryan.
Ryan: You are welcome.
Meron Gribez: So, here's what I found in that bar in 2011: The future of computers is not locked inside these screens.
It is here, in our bodies.
So if I can leave you with an idea today, it's that the natural machine doesn't exist only in the future imagination, it's here, it's in 2016.
That's why hundreds of employees at Meta, including executives, executives, designers, engineers -- before TED2017, we're going to throw away our external display devices and replace it with a really, more natural machine.
Thank you very much.
(Applause ) Thank you.
Thank you all.
Chris Anderson: I have a problem, and there have been a lot of holography presentations last year.
Sometimes there's a debate in tech about whether we're really seeing real things on the screen.
It's a problem in this space, and in a way, technology is showing a broader perspective than you actually see with glasses.
Did we just see the real effect?
Meron Gribez: Absolutely real effect.
Not only that, we also used additional measurement technology, using GoPro to shoot through real lenses, and we got all the different short films you see here.
We want to try to realize the experience of the world through what we see through our glasses, not just the locality.
CA: Thank you very much for the presentation.
MG: Thank you very much.
I am one of the most liberal, tolerant and promising cities in the United States, Seattle, Washington.
I grew up with a wonderful Seattle family.
My mother was an artist, and my father was a university professor, and I was grateful for their upbringing, because I could plan my life the way I felt right.
In fact, my choice is not the same as what my parents think.
When I was 19, I dropped out of college — dropped out of school, or more accurately, was fired.
I set out on a path to becoming a professional French trumpeter, which was my lifelong dream.
I've played chamber music in the United States and Europe, and I've toured for a few years, with the great jazz guitarist Charlie Bird.
When I was in my twenties, I was excited to join the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a beautiful life!
My parents never complained,
They supported me from the beginning,
Even if that wasn’t their dream.
They used to tell neighbors and friends, "Our son wants to 'rest' for ten years."
And there was an awkward conversation about my life that I wanted to share with you.
I was 27 years old, and I came home from Barcelona, it was Christmas, and I went home to see my parents, and I was doing dinner for my mother, and it was just the two of us in the kitchen.
She was silent, without saying a word.
I think something is wrong.
I asked my mother, “Mom, what are you thinking?”
She said, "Your father and I'm really worried about you."
I was surprised: “What are you worried about now?”
She replied, “I want you to answer my question honestly: Did you vote Republican?”
The truth is, I’m not interested in politics, I’m just a French trumpet player.
But I kind of understood that they were aware of something, so some confusion.
At that time, I became a fanatical pursuer of capitalism, let me tell you why.
Believe it or not, it is rooted in my research on poverty.
When I was a kid in Seattle, I remember it was the first time I was exposed to real poverty.
My family belongs to the lower middle class, but that’s certainly not really poor.
Not at all.
The first time I saw the truth about poverty was in the early 1970s, when I was only six or seven years old.
Like many of us, this example is ordinary.
It was a picture in National Geographic, a picture of a country in East Africa that was about the same age as me, with flies flying on his face and his stomach swelling.
I know he can't stand it, I know, and I can't do anything.
Some of you may remember a painting like that, not necessarily exactly the same, but a very similar painting.
It shows the world the unbearable poverty of the rest of the world.
That picture lingered in my mind, growing up, going to school, going out of school, starting to form my own family.
I wonder, what happened to that kid?
Or what about people like him in the rest of the world?
I started to look at this question, and even though I was no longer in college, I was still looking for answers: What happened to the poorest people in the world?
Is it getting worse or is it getting better?
I finally found the answer and changed my life. I want to share it with you.
In fact, most Americans think that from childhood, from the time they saw it to the present day,
If you ask Americans, “Is the world’s poverty problem worse or better?” 70% of people say that hunger has been worse since the early 1970s.
However, this is the case.
This is a moment that makes me change my mind and make me realize.
Since 1970, the percentage of people living on less than $1 a day has fallen by 80% after inflation correction.
Since I was a child, the percentage of the world's poorest has decreased by 80%.
I am not aware of this fact.
My friends, this is a miracle!
This is something worth celebrating.
This is the greatest achievement in human history against poverty, and it has happened in our lifetime.
When I know this, I think, what makes it possible to get rid of poverty?
Because if you don’t know the reason, it’s just a flash.
We want to replicate success, to rid the 200 million people who are still struggling with poverty, because that's what we've been talking about: from the time I was a kid, two billion of the poorest people, our brothers and sisters, out of poverty.
I want to save the remaining two billion people, so I have to know why.
I'm looking for answers,
It’s not a political answer, because I don’t care about the political answer.
Now, I still don't care.
I want the best answer from mainstream economists, from left, right, and centrist economists.
Below
I began to talk about specific reasons.
From childhood to now, 2 billion people have been lifted out of poverty.
There are five reasons. First: globalization
Second: Free trade
Third: Property rights
Fourth: The rule of law
Fifth: Entrepreneurship
These are the free-market economic systems that swept the world after 1970.
I am not childish.
I know that a free-market economy is not perfect, and I know that a free-market economy does not meet all of our needs to build a better world.
But it is great.
It goes beyond politics.
This is what I learned and realized.
Capitalism is not just the accumulation of capital.
What's great about it is that it's about ambition, as many people on this stage have said, the ambition that was born of dreams, and it's rooted in the free market system.
We need to make more people understand this.
Now, I want to talk about my second epiphany, which is related to the first one, which I believe will not only promote the development of the world, but also the development of our country.
To sum up the old view that lifts people out of poverty is: “The free market created the greatest wealth in history.
And hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty.”
Whose word?
Like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
Wrong!
It's President Obama!
Why do I remember deeply?
Because he told me.
I can't believe it.
I said, “Hallelujah!”
Not only that, I said, "What a great opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, we did an event at Georgetown University on the subject we were doing.
And that's when I came up with a solution to the biggest problem facing America today. What is it?
It’s whether liberals or conservatives come together to discuss these ideas to help those who need our help the most.
Needless to say, everyone present knows that we are in crisis, in the United States and in other countries around the world that are politically divided.
This issue is imminent.
This is not to worry.
Last year, an article was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, one of the most influential and cutting-edge scientific journals in the West.
That was a 2014 article on political asymmetry.
Psychologists describe this phenomenon as assuming that your ideas are based on love and the other person's ideas are based on hate.
This is very common in disputes around the world.
between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this article find is that in the United States today, a large proportion of Republicans and Democrats are divided on political motives.
Today, most of the politically active people in our country think they are driven by love, while the rest are driven by hate.
Think about it.
Most people always say, "My mind is based on benevolence, and I want to help people, and the other part, they're evil, they're trying to bring me down."
A society with such differences cannot progress.
It is impossible.
How are we going to solve this problem?
First, let’s be honest: differences exist.
We cannot reduce our differences because it is childish behavior.
There has been a lot of in-depth research on this.
My friend Jonathan Haidt is a regular at TED.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
He studies the ideas, values, and morals of different people, and how they differ.
He proves that conservatives and liberals have very different views on what they think is important.
Jonathan Haidt, for example, shows that liberals care more about poverty than they care about economic freedom 59%.
Conservatives, on the other hand, care about economic freedom 28 percent more than they care about poverty.
It looks like an irreconcilable difference, right?
Can't we come together? - No.
Our strength lies precisely in our differences.
Remember what stopped poverty:
It is the obsession and concern for poverty, and the free economic order worldwide.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people, we want to help another 200 million people out of poverty.
There is no other law.
Hmm.
What are we going to do?
It’s a delicate thing, isn’t it?
We need innovative thinking.
There are a lot of innovative ideas on this stage.
Yes! those extraordinary social entrepreneurship.
We want to invest overseas, in a sustainable, responsible, ethical way.
But do you know what we really need?
We need to open a new world of flexible thinking,
We need less “predictable.”
Is it?
Have you ever felt that your mind was beginning to be predictable?
Start following the rules?
Do you feel that you are always listening to people who agree with you?
Why is that dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, there are conservatives on one side, and we're always talking about taxes, rules and big government.
And on the other hand, liberals, talking about the economy, are always about income inequality.
They are important to me, and they are important to me, and they are important to you.
But when people who are starving need our help, these are just a distraction.
We should come together in the best way possible to reduce poverty as much as we can, and only when conservatives realize that they need liberals to worry about poverty, and liberals need conservative obsession with the free market.
We will succeed, and only if we choose this path will this diversity breed the powerful power of the future nation.
How do we achieve this goal? how do we achieve it together?
I have some action suggestions, for you, and for myself.
Article 1 of the Code of Action: Remember that it is not good to tolerate other people's different opinions.
Far from enough.
We want to remember the people we need who disagree with us, because there is a group of people who need the help of all of us, and they are still waiting.
What are you going to do? how do you show it?
Where to start? here!
All of us here are happy.
We have those who listen to us.
We are successful and we have leadership.
When people hear our ideology, perhaps they listen to us.
Maybe that’s the starting point of success.
This is the first point.
Second point: I am asking you, and I myself, to be a specific person who blurs boundaries, to be a vague, difficult-to-define person.
If you are a conservative, be a conservative who often talks about poverty and a fighter who insists on the moral obligation to fight for the poor.
If you're a liberal, be a liberal who often praises the glamour of the free market that we run responsibly.
If we do that, two goals are just around the corner.
First, we're going to start working on helping the next 2 billion people solve problems like we did before, and we're going to solve more problems. That's what we can do.
The second is that we may be able to overcome this terrible ideological war that afflicts us and turn it into a competition based on ideas of solidarity and mutual respect.
Maybe then, just maybe we'll find that our so-called differences are not that irreconcilable.
Thank you!
When I was in college, I was a government major, which meant that I had to write a lot of papers.
When an average student writes a thesis, they may share the task like this.
So, you understand that the beginning may be a little slow, but after a week has been written a lot, then sometimes write a little more, and finally everything is done, things don't mess up.
I want that too.
At least my plan is like that.
I was ready to get started, but, in fact, by the time I wrote the paper, I did.
This is the case every time I write a paper.
By the time you end up writing a 90-page dissertation, it should have taken a year to write a thesis.
I know that for such a paper, my usual practice does not work.
The graduation is a big project.
So I planned and decided to do it.
This is how a year’s work is arranged.
At first, do less, do a little more in the middle of the months, and finally go all out like small steps.
How hard is it to climb the stairs?
It's not a big deal, right?
But then something interesting happened.
The first few months?
Come and go, I’m basically doing nothing.
So there's this great change plan.
And then... the middle of the month went by, and I basically didn't write a few words, so it became that.
And then there were two months to another month, and then there were only two weeks left.
And then one day I suddenly realized that I was only three days away, and I didn't write a word, so I did the only thing I could do: I spent 72 hours writing 90 pages, and the workers didn't have to go through the campus two hours in a row, and they didn't go through the campus at any one time, sneak in slow motion, and submit their papers before the deadline.
I thought it was all over.
A week later, I got a call from the school.
They asked, “Are you Tim Urban?”
I said, “That’s right.”
They said, "We've got to talk to you about the paper."
I answered, “Okay.”
The other person then said, "This is the best paper we've ever seen."
(Applause) That didn't happen.
This paper is very poorly written.
I just wanted to enjoy this moment when all of you thought, “This guy’s too cowy!”
That’s not the case, the paper is super bad.
Anyway, I’m now a writer.
I wrote a blog post for “Breaking the Casserole Ask the End.”
A few years ago I decided to write an article about procrastination.
My procrastination always confuses those around me who don’t procrastinate, so I want to explain to those who don’t procrastinate what exactly is in the head, and why we procrastinators do.
My assumption is that the procrastinator's brain is different from the procrastinator's brain.
And to prove it, I found an MRI lab that allows me to scan my brain and a brain that's not procrastinator, and I can compare the two.
I brought them all today.
I hope you can carefully compare whether there is any difference between the two.
I know you're not trained brain experts, and it may not seem obvious, but let's take a look, OK?
It is the brain of a non-procrastinator.
Now,
This is my brain.
There is a difference between the two.
There's a rational decision-maker in both brains, but in the procrastinator's brain, there's a monkey called instant gratification.
What does this mean for procrastinators?
It means that everything was fine before it happened.
So when a rational decision-maker makes a rational decision-making and wants to do something productive, the monkey doesn't want to do it, so he starts to take the wheel in control, and he says, "Actually, let's read about the Scandal on Nancy Kerrigan/Tenny Yahaddin on Wikipedia, because I just remembered it."
And then let's go to the refrigerator and look at something new for 10 minutes.
After that, let's continue to browse on the video site, starting with Richard Feynman's video on magnetism, and always seeing interviews with Justin Bieber's mother.
“It all took time, so we couldn’t take the time to work on our schedule today.
I'm sorry!"
What is it?
Instant Satisfaction Monkey doesn’t seem to be the one who wants him to steer the steering wheel.
He is totally alive in the moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, he only cares about two things: simplicity and happiness.
In the animal world, that’s okay.
If you are a dog, you spend your life simply and happily, and it is already a great success!
For monkeys, humans are another animal.
You sleep well, you eat well, and you breed the next generation, and that may be okay in the tribal era.
But, if you haven’t noticed, we’re not living in tribal times right now.
We are in an advanced civilization, and the monkey does not know what it is.
That's why we have another guy in our head, the rational decision maker, who gives us the ability to do things that other animals can't.
We can predict the future.
We can take care of the whole situation.
We can have long-term plans.
And he wants to take all of that into consideration.
He wants us to do anything worth doing now.
Sometimes it makes sense to do simple, happy things like eating, sleeping, or enjoying the leisure time you deserve.
This is why there is a overlap between the instant gratification monkey and the rational decision maker.
Sometimes they agree.
But sometimes it makes more sense to do things that are harder and less enjoyable, for the sake of the overall consideration.
There will be a conflict between the two at this time.
For the procrastinator, every conflict ends in this way, which is that he spends a lot of time in the orange zone, which is the simple and happy, but meaningless area.
I call this area a dark playground.
The dark playground is a place where all procrastinators know well.
This is a place of leisure and entertainment when it should not be leisure.
The joy of being in a dark playground is not happiness, because it is completely unearned, and it brings guilt, fear, anxiety, self-hatred, which is the feeling of all procrastinators.
And the question is, in this case, how can the procrastinator take the blue zone with the monkey in control of the steering wheel, which is not so comfortable, but has a lot of important things to do.
The procrastinator has a guardian angel who always looks down on him and guards him, and in those darkest moments it is called the panic monster.
The panic monster hibernates most of the time, but when the deadline is close, in danger of being ugly in public, or in the face of a career disaster, or when there are other terrible consequences, it suddenly wakes up.
And importantly, he was the only thing the monkey was afraid of.
Recently in my life, the panic monster has become quite important because the TED staff contacted me six months ago and invited me to give a talk.
Of course, I promised.
I’ve always dreamed of doing a TED talk.
But in this excitement, rational decision makers seem to be thinking of something else.
He would say, “Do we know what we promised?”
Do we now have the capacity to complete that task in the future?
We have to sit down and start working."
And the monkey said, "I totally agree, but let's turn on Google Earth and push the lens 200 feet underground in India, and then spend two and a half hours rolling up to the surface of this country, let's get a better feel for India."
That was what I did that day.
When six months becomes four months, then two months, and then one month, the TED staff begins to publish speakers.
I opened the website and saw my face staring at myself.
Guess who woke up at this time?
So the panic monster started going crazy, and after a few seconds, the whole system was in chaos.
And the monkey, remember? he was afraid of the panic monster, he climbed to the tree!
So finally, the rational decision-maker was finally able to control the steering wheel, and I could start preparing for this talk.
In the pseudonym of the panic monster, all those pretty stupid procrastinations, like me, took two weeks and couldn't start writing the opening words of a paper, and then miraculously had an incredible amount of work, and I stayed up all night and wrote eight pages.
The whole situation, plus those three roles are the procrastinator’s system.
Not good, but at least useful.
This is something I decided to write on my blog a few years ago.
After posting, the response I received surprised me.
I get thousands of emails from people from all over the world doing different things.
There are nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and many other PhD students.
The content is basically the same: "I have this problem too."
But what impressed me was that contrast, the ease of mouth of the posts, and the contrast of the heavy tone of those emails.
These people have a strong sense of frustration because procrastination affects their lives, because monkeys control their thinking.
After thinking about it, my question is, if the procrastinator's system works, what's going on?
Why do these people have such a dark corner?
I found out that there were two kinds of delays.
As I said today, the examples above have deadlines.
When there is a deadline, the effects of procrastination are limited to a shorter period of time because the panic monster will intervene.
But for the second type of delay it occurs without a deadline.
For example, if you want to start your own business or work in the arts, there's no deadline at first, because nothing will happen before you start working hard, and there's no driving force to keep things going.
There is no deadline for important things other than career, such as visiting your family, or exercising to stay healthy, trying to improve your relationship, or leaving an unhappy relationship.
If the procrastinator does these difficult things with only one mechanism, the panic monster, then the problem is, because in the absence of a deadline, the panic monster does not appear at all.
He did not need to wake up, so the consequences of the delay were unlimited, and they would only be indefinitely postponed.
And this long delay is less obvious and less often talked about than more interesting, shorter-term, cut-off-based procrastination.
It usually affects us quietly and quietly.
It may be the source of a lot of long-term unhappiness and guilt.
I think that's why these people send emails, and that's why they're in such a bad situation.
Not because they’re running for a project,
It is this long delay that makes them feel like they are just a spectator in their own lives.
Their frustration is not that they can’t achieve their dreams; it’s that they can’t even start chasing their dreams.
So after reading these emails, I had a little understanding that I didn’t think there was anyone without delay.
Yes, I think everyone is a procrastinator.
You may not be a mess in every way, maybe some people can face deadlines well, but remember this: the most despicable trick of monkeys is the part that doesn’t have a deadline.
Now I want to show you one last thing.
I call it the calendar of life.
Suppose a person can live to be 90 years old, and every week is a lattice.
Not many, especially after we’ve lived for so many years.
I think we all need to take some time and take a hard look at this calendar of life.
We need to think hard about what we’re really procrastinating because everyone is procrastinating on something.
We must always be aware of the immediate contentment of the monkey.
That’s what we should all do.
And because there aren't many lattices, this work should probably start today.
Maybe not today, but...
You know.
in the near future.
Thank you.
We were there. The soul and the body were crammed into a church in Texas, and that was the last night of our lives.
Just like our room now, it's just that it's a creaking wooden bench, with tattered red stripes, the organ on my left, the choir behind me, and a baptistery on the back wall.
Like this room anyway.
The same strong sense of suspense, the same deep desire for salvation, the same sour sweat in the palm of the hand, and the same group of absent-minded people in the back row.
It was December 31, 1999, the night I know, the coming of Christ, and the end of the world.
I was 12 years old when I was at the age of responsibility.
I found it so unfair that Jesus was coming back at this time, and I was taking responsibility for everything I had done before, but when I stopped complaining, I thought I'd better get my house packed up.
I go to church as much as possible.
I was afraid of silence, just as people were afraid of noise, just to confirm repeatedly that God had not cheated on me, but came back early and left me behind.
But if he really came early, I also had a backup plan, which I read from the popular book The End of the Times.
I saw in the text that if it had been past the midnight orgy, I had not been taken away, and I had another chance.
I just need to be called a pagan, to defeat the devil, to overcome the plague, and to defeat the Antichrist.
It’s going to be hard – but I’m sure I can do it myself.
But the time to prepare was too early.
It was 11:50 p.m.
We had 10 minutes left, and the pastor asked us to get up from the bench and walk to the altar below, because he wanted us to pray together at the moment of midnight.
So the congregation was divided into several batches and reached the designated place.
The choir was still on the small stage, where church deacons and their wives—in fact, I preferred to call them “baby bourgeoisie” in the first row of the altar to sit down.
You know, in America, even on Advent night, there's a VIP seat.
And behind the Baptist bourgeoisie, the older generation, the young backs of these men and women, were sunburned in the cotton fields of East Texas, and the ravines were scorched with noble browns, like the clay of East Texas, and their beautiful fantasies and dreams outside of East Texas, sometimes more broken than their backs.
Yes – these men and women are my idols and stars.
They waited for this moment for a lifetime, just as their medieval forefathers longed for the end of the world, just as my grandmother longed for the Oprah talk show, which aired on Channel 8 at four o’clock every day.
As she walked toward the altar, I slipped behind her because I was so sure that my grandmother was going to heaven.
I thought that if I held her hand tightly in this prayer, I might go with her.
So I gripped, and I closed my eyes, listened, and waited.
The prayer is louder.
The cry of responding to the prayer is also greater.
The organ sounded, and the sound of the elegy was intertwined.
The heat wave swept, and the sweat of the hand was even more sour.
My hands tightened, and I didn’t want to be abandoned by God.
My eyes were closed tighter, and I didn’t want to see the essence being taken away and 糟粕 to fall.
Suddenly a voice echoed overhead: "Amen."
It's over.
I look at the clock.
It's already past midnight.
I looked at the elders, whose saviors had not come, that they were so proud that they did not show even the slightest loss, that they believed too deeply, too long, that it was too late to doubt.
But I am angry for them.
They were fooled, deceived, deceived, and deceived, but I was deceived along with them.
I prayed what they prayed, and I tried to resist the desires of my heart.
I didn’t go once, but twice, into the baptistery where people catch a cold.
I have believed.
What now?
I went home and turned on the TV just in time for Peter Jennings to announce the new millennium, and the whole world was celebrating the New Year.
I suddenly realized that it was strange to think of anything, and that Jesus was coming to earth again and again, simply because the time zones were different everywhere.
It made me feel more, really hurt.
But that night, I didn’t stop believing.
I just believe in another thing: it’s “not believing and it’s possible.”
It’s likely that the answers I know are wrong, and it’s likely that the questions themselves are wrong.
Now, the mountain of faith that once stood, there was a spring flowing to the foot of the mountain, a spring of doubt, and it was destined to become a big river.
All the dramatic stories of my life can be traced back to that night in the church, when my savior did not come; what I was so sure of, if not called a lie, it was not the truth.
Although most of you are going a very different way to welcome the millennium, I believe you are here because some of you have done the same thing as I did, after the beginning of the new century, when my mother died, after my father ran away from home, and my savior did not come.
I held out my hands and struggled to find something I could believe.
When I went to Yale when I was 18, I searched, and I believed that coming from the small town of Texas, I had the opportunity to get rid of all the hardships and hardships I had, the broken dreams, the disabled body.
But when I got home on a winter break, my head was on the ground, my hands were tied behind me, and the robber's pistol was on my head, and I knew that even the best education would not save me.
When I went to practice with Lehman Brothers in 2008, I searched.
Hope – I excitedly called my family and said we would never be poor again.
But when I watched this golden temple become a broken wall in front of my eyes, I knew that even the best work would not save me.
When I went to Washington, D.C., to be a young journalist, I searched, and I heard a voice in Illinois: "It's been too long," "But in this election, America is going to change."
But when parliamentary work stagnated completely, the country almost fell apart, and so-called hope and change turned into cruel jokes, I knew that even the new birth of politics could not save me.
I bowed down in faith in front of the altar of the American Dream, praying to the great people of the times, praying for success, asking for money, praying for power.
But every time the clock strikes midnight, I open my eyes and see that all these myths are dead.
From this grave, I began to search again, not because I was brave, but because I knew that if I had no faith, I would have died.
So I went to another shrine to worship, Harvard Business School -- and this time, I knew I couldn't simply accept the salvation that the college had given.
No, I know I have more to do.
It all started in the dark corner of the crowded party, one late night in the brutal early winter of Massachusetts, and I asked three friends a question, some young people who were really pursuing, for a long time, "How about we go out on our own?"
We don’t know where to go or how to get there, but we know we have to go.
Because we've been hungry all our lives, as Jack Kerouac wrote, "Dive into the endless dark night and disappear into the distant sky." Go out and see what people all over the country are doing.
So even if there is a voice of opposition, saying that we have taken too much risk and nothing has gained, we are still on our way.
We traveled 13,000 kilometers across the U.S. in the summer of 2013, through the dairy ranches of Montana, through the abandoned cities of Detroit, through the swamp wetlands of New Orleans, and we found people there, worked for them, they started small businesses, and made the bottom line to achieve our goals.
After studying at the “Capitalist West Point” we found the idea simply revolutionary.
The idea spread, eventually grew into a non-profit organization called the Master of Management Traveling All over the United States, which is the main reason I was able to stand on stage today.
It spreads because we have found a strong desire in this generation, the desire to achieve goals, the value of life.
It spreads because we found countless entrepreneurs in the corner of America who created jobs, changed the lives of others, and they needed a little help.
But to tell the truth, it can spread, and because I'm trying to spread it. In order to spread the gospel,
There's nothing I don't do, and in order to convince more people that we can heal the wounds of this broken country, we can rely on small businesses.
But it was this evangelistic process that led me to a different gospel, and I'm going to share it with you today.
About one evening a year ago, we were at the Museum of Natural Science in New York, attending an alumni dinner at Harvard Business School.
Under the full-size model of a whale, I sat side by side with the giants of this age, singing their companions, and their greatness.
The room is full of pride, and the total assets of these people's names add up to more than $500 billion.
We look down at all the creatures and think it is good.
And so it happened, and two days later I went to Harlin, New York, and I was sitting on an urban farm, which used to be an abandoned parking lot, and I heard a man named Tony talk about children, and they went there every day.
They are all below the poverty line.
Many people put all their belongings in their backpacks for fear of being stolen by others in the shelter.
Some came to Tony’s farm, called Harlem Grow, to get their only meal of the day.
Tony told me that he started “Harlem Growth” on his own pension, and he was a taxi driver for 20 years.
He said he didn’t leave himself a penny because, although the project was a success, resources were still extremely scarce.
He said he would accept any help he could find.
And I went to help him.
But when I left Tony, I felt a sting in my heart and wet my eyes in tears.
I felt the burden of enlightenment, and one night I could sit in my room and talk to hundreds of people worth $500 billion about the good world, but two days later in another room, only 50 blocks away, a man without pay, was going to serve his children their only meal a day.
But it's not this glaring social inequality that tears me, it's not these hungry, homeless kids, it's not anger at the 1%, or the compassion for the 99%.
No, I can't be at peace because I finally realized that this country needs a radical change, and I'm just doing it.
I realized that my story represented a group of people who wanted them to be self-reliant, even if they were poor; that my organization represented all the foundational, systematic help, that never reached Harlem, or the Appalachian Mountains and the Lower Ninth District of New Orleans; and that my shouts represented voices that sounded inconstimiated, unvarnished, out of place.
And that shame, this shame washed me, like the shame of sitting in front of the television, watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, again, again.
I was fooled, deceived, deceived,
But this time, the hypocritical savior is myself.
You know, I came all the way from that altar, and that night I felt that the world was going to be destroyed, from a small town in tongues, thinking that suffering was a gift from God to mankind, and that it was a creed, as an eternal truth.
Yes, my journey was so long that I went all the way back to the original.
Because we can't simply summarize that there is no faith in this era. No, we believe in something as much as ever.
Some people may believe the prophecies of Brenda Brown or Tony Robbins, and we may believe the New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review.
We may believe in what we worship in the church at TED, but we desperately want to believe, and we need faith.
We imitate the words and manners of charismatic leaders who promise to solve all human problems.
We feel that suffering is a gift given to us by the capitalist “God” and that we regard the development of science and technology as a creed and as an eternal truth.
But we never realize the human cost to us, and we don't question a brick because we're afraid the whole building will collapse.
But if you are uneasy about these things that we are accustomed to, the time for questioning will come.
So the gospel I preach is not a breakthrough, an innovation, or sustainable development.
I don’t even have a gospel of faith to share with you.
All I have is the gospel of question.
The questioning of the Gospel is not to make you stop believing, it asks you to believe something new: "It is possible to believe."
It’s likely that the answers we know are wrong, and it’s likely that the questions themselves are wrong.
Yes, the questioning of the Gospel may mean that our existence, in this stage, in this room, is all wrong.
Because it begs the question: “Why?”
We have such a powerful hand, why are there people in the water?
This question led me to make a decision that the organization I founded, the Master of Engineering Management, was to stop operating.
We've broken up our employees, we've closed our doors, and we've made this model open to everyone, and as long as they feel they're capable of doing it, they don't need our approval.
This questioning forced me to take off the hat of the “savior” that others had clasped on my head, because our lives were too short, our chances were too low, and we could not wait for the coming of Christ.
And this questioning, it drives me, it gives me hope that when difficulties are about to overwhelm us, when the path of fate seems to lead us astray, when our savior cannot heal the wounds, not our blind faith, but our simple questioning, will shed a little light on the darkness of our lives and the world. Let's whisper,
Screaming is okay, or simply, saying very simply, "There's another way."
Thank you.
The food crisis.
Appears in the daily news.
What is that?
In some parts of the world, food is too scarce, and in some parts of the food production is abundant.
In some places, genetically modified foods have saved the world.
Maybe genetically modified foods are a problem?
Too much GM agricultural wastewater makes polluted oceans, toxic seawater, and thin nutrients.
This cycle continues.
I find that today’s discussion is too influential.
How do we make this discussion understandable to everyone?
What is the Apple Food Crisis?
I’m sure each of you has eaten an apple in the past week.
How long do you think it took for apples to pick them?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months – That’s the average time for apples sold in U.S. malls from picking to selling.
I think it should be almost the same in Europe as it is all over the world.
We pick apples, we refrigerated them, we put oxygen into the freezer -- and there's actually documented workers trying to get an apple back and die because the air in the freezer in the cold storage is toxic to people.
Why doesn’t any of you know about it?
Why don't I know about this?
Ninety percent of the nutrients in apples — all the antioxidants in the apple — were lost when we bought them.
It's just a little candy.
Why don't we know this news and how can we improve this situation?
I think we are missing a platform.
I know the platform — I use computers, I was very young and I was active on the web.
I’ve done a lot of very weird things — on a platform like this.
But I also met other people, and I was able to express myself.
What do you think about food?
If we had a platform, we might find that the question was very beneficial.
What if the climate is democratic?
This is a global climate map.
The most efficient agricultural production areas are green and the worst are red.
They’re going to change, they’re changing, and California farmers are now Mexican farmers.
China has acquired Brazilian land to grow better food, and we are all slaves to our environment.
What if every country had its own climate to produce?
How will that change our lives?
How will this change the quality of our lives and nutrition?
The problem with the last generation was that we needed more food and it was cheap.
Welcome to the World Farm.
We built a huge simulation farm.
These line tracks -- cars, planes, trains, cars.
The ability to provide enough food to 7 billion people is a miracle, in the case of very few people involved in the food production process.
But if...
Do we build a digital farm?
The Digital World Farm.
What if you could take this apple, in a way, digitize it, teleport through the mass points in the air, and then reorganize the dots on the other side?
What if?
Look at the quotes, you know, they encouraged me to do it.
Article 1: "Japanese agriculture has no young people, no water, no land, and no future."This is the day I arrived in Nansan Lumachi, which is Fukushima and then a south station, after the nuclear power plant accident.
The children all went to Sendai and Tokyo, where the land was contaminated by the accident at the nuclear power plant and their food imports reached 70 percent.
This is not a unique phenomenon in Japan.
Only 2 percent of the U.S. population works in agriculture.
What is the answer to the fact that 2% of the population is engaged in agriculture?
Elsewhere in the world, 50% of Africa’s population is under the age of 18.
Eighty percent of them don’t want to be farmers.
Agriculture is hard.
Small farmers are working too hard.
They choose to go to the city.
In India: Farmers' families do not have access to the most basic agricultural appliances, and more farmers have committed suicide than in the past 10 years.
It’s too sad to say this.
Where are they going?
to the city.
There are no young people, young people are going to the city.
So what kind of platform do we need to build to encourage young people?
Look at this new tractor.
This is my combine harvester.
A few years ago, I went to the home chain and started looking for tools.
I made stupid things, I let plants dance, connected them to my computer, and I destroyed them -- a lot of them.
I eventually let them survive.
I created one of the most intimate relationships in my life because I learned the language of plants the most.
I want them to grow bigger.
They said, “Son, do your best!
This is an electronic studio that no one uses.
What can you do?”
Together with the team members, we built a farm in the media lab, a place that used to be thought to be related to electronic life rather than biological.
In this 60-square-meter space, we made enough rations to supply about 300 people for a month — not too much.
There is a lot of interesting technology here.
The most interesting?
Beautiful, white roots, dark green plants harvested once a month.
Is this a new restaurant?
Is this a new sales experience?
Is this a new store?
I'm sure it's the first time in a media lab that any plant can be uprooted.
We put the salad in the bag; there was nothing wrong.
But what happens when you have an image processing expert, a data scientist, a robotics expert, uprooting plants and thinking, "Well, I know about -- I can make the plan happen, I want to try it."
We'll take the plant out and we'll take some back to the lab throughout the process, because if you planted it yourself, we won't throw it away; because it's precious to you.
I have this weird tongue now, because I don't want anyone to eat them before I do, and I want it to be delicious.
I eat lettuce every day, and I know that lettuce has a pH of less than 1.
I'm like, "No, that's 6.1 -- no, you can't eat it today."
(Applause ) This lettuce was very sweet that day.
That’s because lettuce feels a lot of pressure, and it produces chemistry to protect itself: “I don’t want to die!”
The taste of plants that don't want to die tastes sweet.
Scientists are back to studying plant physiology.
I think everyone can try to get involved.
We were looking forward to seeing everyone create, so we conceived a lab that could be shipped to other places.
Create such an idea.
The front of this media lab is my lab, with 30 sensing points for each plant.
If you know the genome or genetics, this is the phenotypic group, right?
The phenomenon of the phenotype group.
When you say, “I like strawberries made in Mexico,” what you really like is strawberries made in that climate.
You can code the climate -- how much carbon dioxide, how much oxygen to create the recipe -- and you can program to control the state of the plant, the nutrient content, the size, shape, color, and texture of the plant.
We need data, so we put a lot of sensors to give us data.
You can think back to the plants in your house, and you look at the plants in the house, and you're sad because you want to think, "Why are you dead?
Farmers have the most beautiful eyes that can predict the future, when they are in their 60s and 70s.
They can tell you that the plant died because the soil was deficient in nitrogen, calcium, or because it needed a more moist air environment.
These beautiful eyes will not pass on.
These are the eyes of the farmer.
We will continue to collect data.
We combine these data points with individual plants.
These are the IP address data for all the broccoli in my lab that day.
We have broccoli that can track IP addresses.
(Applause ) If that's not weird enough, you can click here to see the plant archive.
This shows you the downloadable growth process of the plant, not what you think, not just when you are edible.
When will it meet my needs?
When does it taste like what I expected?
Is there too much water?
Has the sun been too long?
It will all be suggested.
It can talk to me, it can communicate, we can talk in language.
(Applause ) I think that's the first user of Plant Facebook, right?
At that time, the plant's archive plant will start to make friends.
I mean really -- plants start to make friends with plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, and less potassium.
We will begin to understand the complex things that can only be guessed now.
They may not be friendly with us -- I don't know, maybe they'll be good to us, depending on our behavior.
This is my lab now.
My background is designing the hospital data center, and I know how to create a controlled environment.
So -- in this environment, we experiment with all kinds of things.
This program, air-growing, was developed by NASA for the Mir space station, to reduce the amount of water they need to transfer to space.
What this program does is exactly what it gives plants what they want.Water, minerals and oxygen.
The roots aren't that complicated, and when you transport them to them, you can see amazing results.
Plants have two hearts.
Because there are two hearts, it is 4-5 times faster.
It is a perfect world.
We've been through a long process of technology, seeking a different world, and we're going to continue to do that, but we're going to have new tools, and it's going to be a perfect world.
We grow all kinds of things.
These tomatoes have not been commercially produced in the last 150 years.
Do you know that we have rare, old seed banks?
The Seed Bank.
That's awesome.
They have living germplasm, food you haven't eaten.
I was the only one in the room who had eaten this kind of tomato.
The problem is, this is sauce tomatoes, we don't know how to cook, so we don't think the sauce tomatoes seem to be delicious.
But we've grown all kinds of protein-containing things.
We’ve grown humans — maybe you can, but we can’t.
We realized that the tools were too big and too expensive.
I started putting them around the world worth about $100,000.
It’s not easy to find someone who can make $100,000, so we want to make small tools.
And this is actually a student project of me -- an undergraduate in mechanical engineering, Camille.
Camille and I, along with my team, spent the whole summer re-experimenting, how to make it cheaper, how to make it work better, how to get others to learn to operate.
And then we send these tools to school for kids in grades 7 to 11.
If you want to be humble, try to teach your child what to do.
I went to this school and said, “Set its humidity at 65%.”
A 7th grader asked, “What humidity?”
So I said, "Oh, it's water in the air."
He said, "There's no water in the air, you idiot."
So I said, “Okay, don’t believe me.
In fact—don’t trust me, right?
Set it to 100.
He set the humidity to 100, what happened?
Start to condense, produce fog, and eventually start dripping.
Then he said, “Oh, the humidity is rain.
Why didn’t you tell me that before?”
The interface we created looks like a game.
They have 3D environments and are able to log in around the world from mobile phones to computers.
There are different parts of the program - physical regulation, sensors.
They chose recipes that children in other parts of the world have already created.
They select and activate the recipe and plant the seeds.
When seeds grow, children can make changes.
They say, “Why do plants need carbon dioxide?
It can suffocate.”
Increase the supply of carbon dioxide, and the plants die.
By reducing the amount of carbon dioxide, the plants live well.
Harvesting plants, you create new electronic recipes.
This is a process of design and development and exploration.
They can download all the data on the new plant they've developed, or the new electronic recipe, and what does it do -- better or worse?
Imagine these are the core elements of processing.
We can learn a lot.
It’s a food computer we call it, and it’s been in a school for three weeks.
It was three weeks of cultivation.
More importantly, for the first time, the child thought he could be a farmer -- or he wanted to be a farmer.
That is why we open these resources.
Put it all online; go home and try to build your first food computer.
It’s going to be hard—I tell you that.
We’re in the early stages, but the resources are there.
For me, making these easy to get is very important.
We will continue to do so.
These are farmers, electronics engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, botanists, economists, urban planners.
Do what they do on a platform.
The team became too big.
This is my new experimental equipment that is starting to work.
This warehouse can be built anywhere.
That’s why I chose it.
In this warehouse, we are going to build such a shelf.
You can see it now.
Look at this,
This also exists.
One grows green vegetables, one grows the Ebola virus vaccine.
What's great is that Plants and this Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency winning program is why we're doing a good job of studying Ebola.
These plants are producing proteins that fight Ebola.
So drugs and health care products, and then lettuce cultivation.
But the two things look completely different, and that's the part of my field.
But a lot of things are not as imagined.
We're still at the stage where "we're right," like, "This is my little black box --" "No, buy me."
“No, no, no—my intellectual property is absolutely valuable.
Don't buy this, buy mine."
In fact, we are only in the beginning, and at this time, society is changing.
When we want more, cheaper food, we now need better, environmentally friendly food.
But you see McDonald's advertising about the ingredients of the chick, the most mysterious food in human history -- the McDonald's marketing plan is changing -- and everything is changing.
Now look at the world today.
Personal food computers, food servers, food data centers, operating in open phenotype groups.
It's like open the genome, but we're going to put together the little climate recipes, like Wikipedia, and you can overturn, start, plant.
How does this look?
Do you remember that the world is connected by strings?
It started to appear bacon.
We start sending information about food instead of distributing it.
It’s not just my fantasy, it’s something we’re already doing.
Food computers, food servers, and soon food data centers connect people to share information.
The future of food is not the wrong thing to fight for.
We all know it’s wrong there.
The food of the future is about connecting the next generation of a billion farmers and empowering them with a question-and-answer platform, “What if?”
Thank you.
Sometimes I feel ashamed to be a European.
More than a million people came to Europe last year who needed our help, and our response was, frankly, very sad.
There are too many contradictions here.
We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old boy, Alan Cody, but since then more than 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean.
We have an international convention that recognizes the responsibility of all countries to accept refugees, but we accept a small area of Lebanon, and we accept more Syrians than Europe as a whole.
We demoralize the existence of human smuggling, but we make it the only viable way to seek asylum in Europe.
We have a shortage of labor, but we're preventing people from entering Europe who can meet our economic and population-building needs.
We claim that our liberal values are the opposite of those pursued by the Islamic originalists, but we use a repressive policy to detain child asylum seekers to separate children from their families and forcibly confiscate refugee property.
What are we doing.
How the situation has come to be this way, and we're dealing with a humanitarian crisis in an inhumane way.
I don't believe it because people don't care, at least I don't want to believe it.
I think it's because of the lack of foresight in our politicians, the lack of adaptation to what was proposed fifty years ago in order to cope with a changing and globalizing one.
So what I'm trying to do is take a step back and ask two very basic questions that are issues that we all have to understand.
Why the existing system doesn’t work
Second, how do we solve it.
The modern refugee system was developed after World War II.
It was intended to make sure that when a country collapses or worse, the regime is hostile to the people of that country, and that people can have a place to go where they live in safety and dignity until they can return to their homeland.
Just like what we see in Syria today.
Through an international conference signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and an international organization, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), has committed itself to allowing people from other countries to enter their territories from conflict and persecution.
But now the system is collapsing.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In reality, our immigration policy is blocking the path to security.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek equal treatment or to choose to return to their home countries.
But in practice, they're trapped in a state of stagnation that is almost indefinite.
In theory, the refugee problem is the responsibility of all countries.
In practice, geographic location means that countries close to conflict are overloaded with the vast majority of refugees.
The rules of the original refugee system are not the cause of its collapse.
But we're not using enough as the world changes, and that's something we need to rethink.
So I want to explain to you how the current system works.
How does the current refugee reception system work?
But not from a top-down macroscopic perspective, but from an individual refugee perspective.
Imagine a Syrian woman.
Let's call her Amira.
Amira represents the many refugees I have met in the region.
Amira, like about a quarter of the world's refugees, is a woman with children and she can't go home because of her city, the city of Homs, which was once beautiful and historic, is now devastated.
So Amira couldn't go back.
Amira also has no hope of re-settling in a third country, because it's like winning the lottery, less than one percent of the world's refugees are allowed.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first is that Amira can take her family to the camp.
In the refugee camps, she might get help, but for Amira and her family, the prospects are very slim.
The camp is located in a deserted and barren land, usually in the desert.
In the Zatalina neighbourhood of Jordan, you can hear shells crossing the Syrian border at night.
Economic activity is limited there.
The quality of education is usually low.
And about 80 percent of the world's refugees in camps have had to stay there for at least five years.
This is a tragic place, and it may also explain why, in reality, only 9 percent of Syrians have chosen this option.
Or Amira can travel to a city in a city in a neighborhood, such as Amman or Beirut.
75% of Syrian refugees choose this option
But even there it's difficult.
Refugees in cities often do not have the right to work
They usually don’t have access to help.
So when Amira and her family ran out of basic savings, they had little left, and they were likely to face poverty.
And the third option is chosen by more and more Syrians.
Amira can seek hope for her family, embarking on a dangerous journey that could have burying lives, and going to another country, which is what we see in Europe today.
Globally, we leave refugees with an almost impossible option in these three options: refugee camps for urban poverty and dangerous journeys.
For refugees, this option is the current global refugee system.
But I think it was the wrong choice.
I think we can reconsider that option.
The reason we're limiting these options is that we think these are the only options that refugees can get, but they're not.
Politicians shape it into a problem of gain and loss, and if refugees benefit, citizens have to bear the loss.
We seem to share the assumption that refugees have an inevitable burden and cost to society.
But this is not a regularity, and refugees can contribute.
So what I want to show is that we have a way to add that option and still benefit everyone: including the host countries and communities, our societies and the refugees themselves.
And I'd like to suggest four ways to change our mindset on refugees.
These four approaches have one thing in common, and we've taken advantage of globalization, social mobility, and market opportunities to update our understanding of the refugee problem.
And the first thing I want to think about is the concept of creating the environment, and that comes from the basic understanding that refugees, like all the other people, are just in a particular environment where they're in a particular environment.
My colleagues at the University of Oxford and I started a research project in Uganda to study the economic life of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it is typical of the receiving countries.
It is precisely an exception.
Unlike most of the host countries in the world, what Uganda has done is afford economic opportunities for refugees.
Give them the right to work, give them freedom of movement.
The results are staggering, both for refugees and host countries.
In Kampala, the capital of Uganda, we found that 21 percent of refugees run their own businesses and hire others Forty percent of the employees are nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees are creating jobs for the citizens of the host country.
Even in the refugee camps, we found examples of dynamic, thriving start-ups.
In a camp called nakivalle, we found Congolese refugees who were in the business of digital music.
We found the business of the Rwandan refugees so that young people can play computer games on the recycled control consoles and on the display screen.
Breaking the extremes of the refugees are constantly innovating, and you are in front of a Congolese named Damon Kay.
He was immaculate when he arrived in the camp, but he wanted to be a filmmaker.
So with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station, he rented a camera, and he's making movies.
He's made two documentaries, and his team, and he's got a successful career with very little resources.
It is precisely this example that should lead our response to refugees.
Instead of believing that refugees are inevitably dependent on humanitarian aid, we need to give them the opportunity to achieve human prosperity.
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelters, food are very important in the emergency phase, but we also have to think long term.
We need to provide connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, the funding and the business channels.
All the pathways we take for granted access to the global economy can and should be made available to refugees.
The second idea I want to discuss is the economic zone.
Unfortunately, not all of the world's host countries have adopted Uganda's policies.
Most of the host country's economy is not open to refugees, but we still have effective alternatives.
Last April I went to Jordan, and I went to Jordan, with my colleague Paul Kolya, the development economist, and we discussed an idea there, with the international community and the local government, that was to bring jobs to Syrians and to advance Jordan's national development strategy.
The idea is to create an economic zone where we can combine the employment of refugees with the national employment in the host country, Jordan.
Just a 15-minute drive outside Zatali camp, where 83,000 refugees are resettled here is an existing economic zone known as King Hussein Development Zone.
The government has invested more than $100 million to connect the grid and the road, but there are two things missing, the labor force and foreign investment.
So what if the refugees could work there instead of being stuck in a refugee camp and be able to afford the house before they return to Syria and develop their skills through vocational training?
We recognize that doing so would benefit Jordan, and its national development strategy requires upgrading the manufacturing industry as a middle-income country.
This will benefit the refugees and also help the post-war reconstruction of Syria by recognizing that we need to train refugees as the best resource for the eventual reconstruction of Syria.
We published this in the journal Foreign Affairs.
Jordan's King Abdullah also adopted the idea.
Two weeks ago, at the Syrian conference in London, the pilot project will begin this summer.
The third idea I want to show is the matching of preferences between the state and the refugees In order to achieve this satisfying ending in this selfie, the picture shows German Chancellor Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
We rarely ask refugees what they want or what they want to go there, but I advocate that they can do it and benefit everyone.
Economist Evan Ross created the concept of pairing markets, that is, the order of preferences of both sides determines the final match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Erik Stett Boe, who are studying how to apply this concept to solve the refugee problem, they asked refugees to rank their preferred countries, but at the same time allowed countries to sort the types of refugees they wanted to receive, based on skill or language criteria, and finally matched the two sortes.
Of course, you need to establish quotas in terms of diversity and vulnerability, but it's a way to increase the likelihood of pairing.
This pairing concept has been successfully applied, for example, to pairing students and universities pairing kidney donors and patients, which also highlights the importance of the rules of operation in dating sites.
So why not use it to give refugees a better choice?
And it can also be applied at the national level, and the biggest problem we face at this level is to convince local communities to take in refugees.
Now, in my country, for example, we often send engineers to remote areas and send farmers to cities, and it makes no sense.
So matching markets provide a potential way to match these preferences and reflect the needs and demands of the people of the receiving country and the refugees.
My fourth thought is a humanitarian visa.
Most of the tragedies and chaos that we see in Europe are completely avoidable.
This is a fundamental contradiction in the European asylum policy: In order to seek refuge in Europe, you have to get to Europe on your own after a dangerous journey that I described earlier, but why these journeys are necessary.
In an era of low-cost airlines and consulates?
These are completely unnecessary journeys last year, which led to the deaths of more than three thousand people on European borders and within Europe.
If refugees can go directly to Europe and seek asylum, we can avoid these deaths, and we can do so through humanitarian visas that allow people to collect visas at embassies or consulates in neighboring countries and then pay for them to arrive in Europe by cruise ship or plane.
It would cost about a thousand euros to bring a stowaway from Turkey to the Greek islands.
Just two hundred euros on a low-cost flight from Bodrum, Turkey to Frankfurt, Germany
If we allow them to do that, it will bring great results.
And it saves lives, weed out the market for illegal smuggling, and we're going to eliminate the chaos that we're seeing on the edge of Europe, like the Greek islands.
The reason that prevents us from implementing this is political, not rational solutions.
And this is an idea that has been applied.
Brazil first adopted this policy, and more than 2,000 Syrians were granted humanitarian visas to enter Brazil and apply for refugee status upon entry.
In that plan, every Syrian got refugee status and confirmed to be a real refugee.
There is also a historical precedent.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports were used as entry and exit documents to allow 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens to travel through Europe and apply for refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
UNHCR Nansen International Awarded Nobel Peace Prize for This Viable Response
So the four ideas that I'm showing you are all ways we can add the Amilla option.
Give refugees a better alternative, not just three basic, impossible options, as I said before, and still benefit all.
And overall, we need a whole new perspective to increase the choice of refugees, while recognizing that they're not necessarily a burden on society.
It is not a question of whether refugees become a cost.
It's true that refugees are our humanitarian responsibility, but they are also human beings with the skills, talents and aspirations who have the ability to contribute to society -- if we allow it.
In a new world, migration will not disappear.
What we see in Europe will remain there for many years.
People will continue to migrate, and people will still be uprooted, and we need to find a rational and realistic way to manage it -- not based on the old logic of humanitarian aid, not on the logic of charity, but on the opportunities of globalization, markets and liquidity.
I want everyone to realize that, and I ask our government officials to meet this challenge.
Thank you all
As a child, I fantasized about the ocean.
It is colorful and vibrant, and there are many animals that look like extraterrestrial beings.
I’ve imagined big sharks at the top of the food chain, and I’ve imagined turtles dancing gracefully among coral reefs.
As a photographer who has moved from marine biologist to career, I have spent most of my career looking for places that came to my fantasies as a child.
As you can see, I started taking risks in the water from a very young age.
But the first real dive into the water came when I was 10.
I still vividly remember that I was piling in a canopy on a coral reef in order to get enough of a rusty, canopy lying on the reef.
In the end, I managed to get enough of the cannon, looked up, and found myself surrounded by fish of all colors, like rainbows.
Since then, I have been deeply in love with the ocean.
Over the past 40 years, I have had the privilege of exploring the most beautiful ocean landscape on Earth, writing for National Geographic and Save Our Oceans Foundation.
My subjects are big enough to be giant sharks, small enough to move around the palm of your hand.
In the cold sea near the Canadian bear rainforest, I have encountered humpback whales around me, and the fishy smell of mouths makes me forget.
In the Mozambique Channel, I saw the courtship ceremony of the green turtle.
Each of us will affect the ocean and will be affected by the ocean.
The pure ocean I dreamed of when I was a child is now increasingly difficult to find.
Their scope is shrinking and they are under increasing threat.
We humans have always occupied the top of the food chain on Earth, and I have seen these things with my own eyes and recorded them with my camera.
For a long time, I thought that only shocking photos could wake up my audience.
Of course, this view is also good, that is, to get me back to the beginning.
I believe the best way to make a difference is to spread love.
I feel like a bridge between man and animals, and as a photographer I have a rare opportunity to demystify the animals and ecosystems hidden in the depths of the ocean.
If you don’t know something exists, how can you love it and protect it?
This is the strength of our environmental photographers.
I’ve been to hundreds of different seas, but there are only a few that I’ll never forget.
The first time I was struck by a scene like this was almost a decade ago, off the rugged and steep coast of South Africa.
Every year in June and July, countless sardines migrate north, which we call the “sardine tide.”
Believe me, these fish have to do it.
Because there are hordes of hungry, agile hunters chasing after them.
For example, the dolphins that hunt a group, they separate a part of the sardines from the fish and gather them into balls.
Dolphins will drive the sardines closer to the sea and then rush into the fish to enjoy the moving feast.
It was followed by sharks.
Most people think that sharks and dolphins are natural enemies, but in the "sardine tide", they coexist.
In fact, with the help of dolphins, sharks eat better.
Without dolphins, garlic is difficult to cluster into a ball, and sharks often pass through the middle of the fish, like through a doughnut, sometimes drinking only one belly water.
I had a few intimate encounters with sharks in the sardine tide, and I knew the sharks weren’t looking me in the eye.
But I kept getting bumped and swept by my tail, like the other guests at this raucous feast.
We sailed east from the African coastline, through the vast Indian Ocean, to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral reefs.
During the stormy southwest monsoon season, the devilfish living in the waters of the archipelago gathers near Baa Atoll, a small island called Hanifaru.
The hordes of small shrimp crabs, mostly smaller than our pupils, are the main food of the devilfish.
When these plankton are scattered, the devilfish generally hunt alone, and they roll back in the water, like puppies chasing their tails.
And when the plankton gathers more and more, the devilfish begin to be connected end to the end, and the long-growing eating formations, the delicacy of the devil fish missed by the team leader will be swallowed clean by the companions behind.
As the plankton in the bay gathers more and more, the more the formation of the devilfish gathers, this unique method of predation, which we call the "cyclonic predation method."
The devil fish are stacked on top of each other, choking in tight formations, forming a whirlpool that sucks the plankton and sends them straight into the giant mouth of the devilfish.
Diving among hundreds of devil fishes will last a lifetime.
When I first went to Hanifaru to take pictures, it was not yet protected and the ecological environment was threatened by local development.
In collaboration with NGOs such as the Devil’s Fish Trust, my photographs eventually helped make Hanifaru a marine protected area.
Fishermen on nearby islands have hunted many devilfishes and used their skins to make traditional drums.
Today, they are the staunchest protectors of the devil’s fish, which generates more than $8 million a year in the Maldives.
I always wanted to go back in time, to that era when most of the maps were still blank, or that marked “There are dragons here.”
By far the most similar place I've ever been to a few of the remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean .
It’s far from fishing grounds and fishing boats, where diving always makes me sad because it reminds me of what the ocean used to be.
Few people have heard of India Reef, which is a small coral atoll, located in the Mozambique Channel.
The reef on its periphery forms a protective barrier in the middle of the lagoon that became a kindergarten for the Galapagos shark.
These sharks are never shy, even during the day.
I guess they’ll be more lively at night, and the number will be more.
I've never seen so many sharks in a coral lagoon before.
Documenting and sharing moments like this is a constant reminder of my original intention in choosing this path.
Earlier this year, to complete the National Geographic contract, I came to the California Peninsula.
In the middle of the peninsula, on the Pacific side, lies the San Ignacio Lagoon, an important breeding ground for gray whales.
Over the past 100 years, this stretch of coastline has been a huge slaughterhouse, where more than 20,000 gray whales have been killed and only a few hundred survivors remain.
And now, the descendants of these gray whales will push their cubs to the sea, play and play, and even interact with us.
The species has surprisingly recovered.
On the other side of the peninsula is Cape Pulmo, a quiet little fishing village.
Decades of overfishing have brought the village to the brink of bankruptcy.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded the government to list the area as a marine protected area.
What happened next can be said to be a miracle.
In 2005, after just 10 years of conservation, scientists found a record recovery in local fish populations.
See you, come with me.
Take a deep breath and dive into the ocean with me to see what the largest, densest fish I've ever encountered.
We all have the power to create hope.
I want to send a message through my own photos that it's not too late to save the ocean from now on.
I would particularly like to focus on the resilience that nature possesses, when it confronts 7.3 billion people.
I hope that in the coming time, it will be more and more difficult for me to take such photos, but more pictures of people living in harmony with the ocean.
I wish I could take photos like this every day.
To make a name for ourselves in our business, you must be an incorrigible optimist.
I'm always taking a picture with the assumption that the next great picture of the change is waiting for me right in front of me, maybe behind the next coral reef, in the next lagoon, or else, and then the next.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the heart of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
Immediately after the new government emerged from the long war of independence, it announced a socialist policy: making health care and primary education a basic free project.
The massive rural health service that makes 80 percent of the population within two hours of walking is a truly remarkable step forward.
25% of children immunized in 1980 Zimbabwe Independence Year
By 1990, just a decade later, that proportion had risen to 80 percent.
It is a great honor for me to participate in this transformation, in this revolution.
Excitement and gay fraternity are very real.
Working shoulder to shoulder with prominent Zimbabweans, scientists, doctors, activists, I feel involved not only in an African independence movement, but also a progressive global public health movement.
I also faced some daunting difficulties.
In 1985, the year I arrived, Zimbabwe reported the first case of AIDS.
I was in the early 1980s, and I was in the care of a couple of AIDS patients, and I was in medical training at Harlem Hospital, but... we had no idea what we're going to encounter in Africa.
When I first got there, the infection rate was about 2%.
When I left Harare 17 years later, one in four adults had an infection.
By the mid-1990s I told hundreds of energetic young people who tested positive for HIV.
I saw colleagues and friends die, and my students and my hospital patients died.
Faced with this, I started a clinic with my colleagues.
We show how to use a condom
We educate and promote in school education and workplace
We conduct research We advise partners on how to protect themselves from people living with HIV.
We worked very hard to do all of this, and I believe I did my best.
I offered the best treatment, at least under the conditions at the time.
But I didn't make a constructive change.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has confessed that it was his personal mistake that led to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was the head of the United Nations peacekeeping department.
At the Holocaust's commemoration, he recalled that I believed I had done everything I could, but after the Holocaust, I realized that there was so much I could do and should do to sound the alarm bells and ask for support.
The AIDS outbreak has caught the medical community off guard, and the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people die from the disease today, as I do, and many feel remorseful and regretful for not stopping it sooner.
But when I lived in Zimbabwe, I didn't realize that I was an advocate or a politician.
I thought it was because of my medical knowledge that I went there because of my clinical and infectious disease research.
I've always felt that my job is to care for the sick, and through research to better understand the demographic characteristics of the infection, I hope to slow down the spread of the virus.
I realized that the proportion of marginalized groups infected and dying of AIDS was surprisingly high.
60% of pregnant women in sucrose plantations, which are more similar to modern enterprises than modern enterprises, are tested positive for HIV.
My job is to show people that being infected is not a moral decay, but a sense of paternity related to forced alien labor and colonialism.
Most white people are safe.
As a medical expert, our means are unfortunately powerless: imploring people to change their personal behavior Use condoms and reduce the number of partners
Infection rates are still climbing as our most effective weapon against the virus When treatment is already feasible in the West, for the entire public sector in Africa, treatment is unaffordable.
I'm not bold enough to say that inequality in access to life-saving medicines, or problems in the underlying economic and political system, is the driving force behind high infection rates in such a large population.
I made an excuse for my silence, reminded myself that I was just a visitor to this country, and the alarm bells that could be deported so that I couldn't do a good job of caring for my patients, doing much-needed research.
So I didn't speak boldly about the government's early AIDS policy.
I’m not expressing my concerns loud enough.
Many doctors, health care workers, may feel that I have done nothing wrong.
Our commitment to the sick, like the Hippocratic Oath and its different versions, is a sacrosanct doctor-patient relationship.
I do everything I can for every patient.
But I know that the infectious diseases that accompany the division of our society reflect not only biological phenomena, but also marginalization, intolerance, racial discrimination, gender discrimination, class discrimination.
This is true for AIDS.
This is true of the recent Ebola.
Medical anthropologists, such as Paul Famar working on AIDS in Haiti, called structural violence: structural, because inequality is rooted in the political and economic organizations of our social environment, often ignored by privilege and regime classes; violence, because of its effects, such as early death, suffering, disease, is violent.
We do very little for the sick if we don't realize these social injustices.
Ringing the alarm is the first step in guiding public health in the right direction, and it's the way we're looking for support, breaking through together to create the way for real change.
So now, I am not silent.
I speak boldly and bluntly about a lot of things, even though it makes me feel uncomfortable.
And a lot of it is about apartheid and organized racism, and it's something that shouldn't happen in this country, and it shouldn't be in medical practice or in public health.
But they do exist, and we pay the price of shortening our lives for it.
And that's why in America is sounding alarm bells about racism, the impact of health care, and the ongoing organized, interpersonal violence against people of color, and the fact that we've been living with our tragic history, 250 years of slavery, 90 years of racial discrimination, and 60 years of imperfect equality.
In New York City, the premature death rate, that is, before the age of 65, blacks are 50% higher than whites.
In 2012, black women faced more than 10 times the risk of child-rearing-related death compared to white women.
Although we have made tremendous progress in reducing infant mortality, the first year of life in which black babies are still nearly three times more likely than white babies to die.
New York City is no exception.
These statistics are similar across the United States.
A recent New York Times analysis reported that there were about 15 million missing black men in the country.
The authors point out that black men between the ages of 25 and 54 have at least one in six who have disappeared from their daily lives or have been in prison or die prematurely.
Young blacks face disproportionate violence on a daily basis, and it's very unfair, and these are all in recent protests holding up the slogan "Black Lives Matter" slogan.
But we need to remember the current situation and outcomes in general health care, and the persistent and high rates of disease, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, the diseases that slowly and quietly devour life, the diseases that have allowed more black lives to die prematurely.
As the "Black Lives Matter" movement, I felt frustrated and angry, and the medical community was hesitant in research and work, even on the use of the word "racism."
Every time I say it, you probably already feel something.
Medical students dressed in white robes protesting against chemical and biological weapons, but medical groups face the impact of continued racial discrimination on disease and mortality largely bystand.
I'm worried about the move toward personalization and accuracy of drugs, the search for biological and genetic goals, and the ability to design therapies that can inadvertently make us unable to look at the big picture, and that's the reality of everyday life, where a person's life, growing up, working, loving, and that's an important part of the health of many of us, the health of the poor.
In daily life, as health workers, whether in the clinic or in research, we are witnesses of great injustices: wanderers, unable to follow the doctor's orders, because he wants to prioritize more urgent things; young transgender people, planning to commit suicide, because our society is too ruthless; single mothers, forced to feel the need to take responsibility for the health of their children.
As health workers, our role is not just to treat our patients, but to sound the alarm.
And whether it's reasonable or not, our social jobs make our voices more credible, and we shouldn't waste it.
I regret that I failed to be candid in Zimbabwe, and I regret that I have committed myself to being a New York City health commissioner, and I will take advantage of all the opportunities I have to sound the alarm about the equality of health care.
I will speak out against racial discrimination, and I hope you will join me, and I will join you when you speak out against sexism, or any kind of inequality.
It's time for us to rise up and stand up for structural inequality.
We don’t need to have all the answers to advocate for change.
We just need courage.
The health of our patients, our own health, depends on it.
Okay, I want you to raise your hand and say, how many people have ever blacked out their friends on Facebook because they've made inappropriate statements about politics, religion, children's rights, or food?
How many people have at least one person they don’t want to see, because you just don’t want to talk to each other?
You know, in the past, for a polite conversation, we just follow Henry Higgins’ advice in My Fair Lady: just talk about the weather and your health.
But these years, with climate change and the campaign against vaccines, it doesn't work.
So in the world we live in, every conversation has the potential to evolve into a world of debate, where politicians can't talk to each other, and even for those things that are thorny, there's a crowd for or against that, which is so normal.
The Pew Research Center surveyed 10,000 American adults and found that our level of extremeness at this point is higher than at any time in history.
We are less inclined to compromise, which means we are not listening to each other.
The various decisions we make, choose where to live, who we marry or even make friends with, are based only on the beliefs we already have.
Again, this shows that we are not listening to each other.
Conversations need to be told and heard, and somehow we lose that balance.
Technological progress is partly to blame.
For example, the smartphone, now in your hands, or right next to you, you can get it.
According to Pew Research, about one-third of U.S. teens send more than 100 text messages a day.
And a lot of people, almost everyone, are more likely to text their friends than face-to-face.
The Atlantic magazine has a great article.
The author is Paul Barnwell, a high school teacher.
He gave his students a task of communication,
I want to teach them how to give a speech on a topic without the help of notes.
Then he said, “I’m starting to realize...”
“I began to realize that communication skills were probably the most overlooked, skills that were not well taught.
Children spend hours a day touching ideas and other partners through screens, but rarely have the opportunity to discover their interpersonal skills.”
It sounds funny, but we have to ask ourselves: What skills are more important than maintaining a coherent, confident conversation in the 21st century?”
Now, my profession is to talk to people.Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, governors, plumbers.
I talk to people I like and I talk to people I don’t.
I talk to people who are very unrecognizable on a personal level.
But I still had a good conversation with them.
So I want to spend the next 10 minutes teaching you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard countless suggestions, such as looking into each other's eyes, thinking in advance about interesting topics to discuss, looking at, noding, and smiling to indicate your focus, repeating what you just heard, or summarizing.
I want you to forget all this,
All useless.
There is no need to learn how to show that you are very focused, if you are really focused.
I actually use the same techniques as professional interviewers in my daily life.
Well, I'm going to teach you how to interview people, and that will actually help you learn how to be a better communicator.
Learn to start a conversation without wasting time, not being bored, and, most importantly, not offending anyone.
We all had a great conversation.
We've all had it. We know how it feels.
That kind of conversation that ends up that makes you feel like you’re enjoying, inspiring, or making you feel like you’re making a real connection with someone else, or that you’re completely understanding.
There's no reason to say that most of your interactions can't be like that.
I have 10 basic rules. I'll explain it to you one by one, but seriously, if you choose one and you're proficient, you'll already have a more enjoyable conversation.
Number one: Don’t be two-hearted.
I’m not saying just put down your phone, your tablet, your car keys, or whatever you hold in your hand.
I mean, in the moment.
Get into that situation.
Don’t think about the dispute with your boss before.
Don’t think about what you have for dinner.
If you want to quit talking, quit talking, but don't be in Cao Yingxin in Han.
Number two: Don’t be a good teacher.
If you want to express your opinion and don’t want to leave any opportunity for people to respond, argue, rebut or elaborate, blog about it.
There’s a good reason why there’s no “expert preaching” in my conversation: because it’s really boring.
If the other person is a conservative, he must hate Obama, food stamps and abortion.
If the other party were liberal, it would hate big banks, oil companies and Dick Cheney.
Completely predictable.
You certainly don’t want that.
You need to enter every communication and assume that you can learn something.
The famous therapist M. Scott Peck once said that true listening requires putting yourself aside.
Sometimes that means putting your personal opinion aside.
He said that by feeling this acceptance, people who speak become less and less vulnerable and sensitive, and therefore more and more likely to open their inner world and present themselves to the listener.
Again, assuming you need to learn something new.
Bill Nye said, "Every person you're going to see has something you don't know."
Let me repeat: everyone is an expert in some aspects.
Third, use open-ended questions.
In this regard, please refer to the interview of the reporter's question.
Start asking questions with “who,” “what,” “when,” “where,” “why” or “how.”
If you ask a complex question, you will get a simple answer.
If I were to ask you, “Are you afraid?”
You’ll respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, “fear,” and the answer will be “yes” or “no.”
"You were angry?" "Yes, I was angry."
Let the other person describe, the other person is the person who understands the situation.
Try asking each other, “What does that look like?”
“How do you feel?”
Because then, the other person may need to stop and think about it, and you will get more interesting answers.
Fourth, let it be natural.
That is, ideas flow naturally into your mind, and you need to express them.
We often hear the guests in the interview say a few minutes, and then the host comes back and asks the question, which seems to be not knowing where it came from or has been answered.
This shows that the host may not have been listening two minutes ago, because he thought of this very witty question, so he thought about asking this question.
We will do the same.
When we sat down to talk to someone, we suddenly remembered the encounter with Hugh Jackman at the coffee shop.
Then we stopped listening.
Stories and ideas will always come to you.
But even if you can't stop it, don't let them stay too much in your mind.
Fifth, if you don’t know, say you don’t know.
People on the radio, especially on National Public Radio, understand that their conversations are going to be played out, so they're more careful about where they claim to be professional and what they're saying.
Learn to do this. Be careful.
Conversations should be a responsible behavior.
Article 6: Don’t compare your experiences with others.
If the other person talks about losing a family, don’t start talking about losing your family.
If the other person is talking about work troubles, don’t tell them how much you hate your job.
It’s different, it can never be the same.
Every experience is unique.
And, more importantly, it’s not about you.
You don't need to prove how capable you are at this moment, or how much you have endured.
When Stephen Hawking was asked what his IQ was, he replied, "I don't know. People who brag about IQ are diaosi."
Conversations are not meant to sell themselves.
Article 7: Try not to repeat your words.
It's aggressive and boring, but it's easy to do that.
Especially in a work conversation, or a conversation with a child, we want to make a statement, so we keep saying it in a different way.
Don't do that.
Article 8: Do not talk nonsense.
To put it bluntly, nobody cares about the years, the names, the dates, and so on, the details you try to recall in your head.
They don't care. They care about you.
They care about who you are and what you have in common.
So forget the details. Forget about them.
Article 9: This is not the last one, but the most important one.
Listen carefully.
I can't say how many important people have said that listening is probably the most important, the first important skill you can improve.
I said, "If you keep your mouth shut, you won't learn anything."
Calvin Coolidge once said, "No one has ever been fired for listening too much."
Why don’t we listen to each other?
First of all, we prefer to say.
Everything is under my control when I speak.
I don’t have to listen to anything that I’m not interested in.
I am the focus.
I can strengthen my identity.
But there’s another reason: we’re going to be disturbed.
People say about 225 words per minute on average, but we can listen to nearly 500 words a minute.
So our brains were taken up by the other 275 words.
I know it's very much time to really listen to people, but if you don't, you're not talking.
You are just two people in the same place and have nothing to do with each other.
You have to listen to each other.
Stephen Covey has a great talk about this.
He said, “Most of us don’t listen to me for the sake of understanding.
We listen to me in response.”
Article 10: It is concise.
“Good conversation is like a nice miniskirt; short enough to be attractive, long enough to bind the subject—my sister’s metaphor” all boils down to the same concept, which is: to be interested in others.
I grew up with a celebrity grandfather, and my family’s guests were endless.
Visitors will come and talk to my grandparents, and when those people leave, my mother will come up to us and say, "Do you know who it is?
She is the runner-up of Miss America.
He is the mayor of Sacramento.
She won the Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballerina."
I grew up by tacitly believing that everyone is wonderful.
Honestly, I think it was all that made me a better leader.
I tried to speak as little as I could, but open my mind, always ready to be surprised, and I would never be disappointed.
You can do that too.
Go out the door, talk to others, listen to what others say, and most importantly, be prepared to be surprised.
Thank you.
Hello everyone
My name is Matthew Williams, and I'm a champion.
I won medals in three different sports and at the Canadian National Games, and I was involved in international basketball and I'm very proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I spend five days a week with top coaches and psycho-doing counselors training basketball and speed skating to stay in the best of my game.
All because of the special Olympics.
Has this changed you for me and my accomplishments?
The world doesn’t see everyone like me as a champion.
Not long ago, people like me were not to be seen.
Since the beginning of the Special Olympics in 1968, this phenomenon has greatly improved, but in reality, it can often be seen that people with intellectual disabilities are often blinded compared to ordinary people.
People call me “stupid” in front of me, thinking I don’t care.
They call me "stupid" and say that I'm slow, and it's a derogatory usage.
They don’t know how much it hurts me and my friends.
I don’t want you to think I’m here to get mercy.
I'm here because the problem still exists: there are still a lot of people who see intellectually deficient people in a way that has problems, or more, many more people don't recognize their existence at all.
Did you know that the World Games are held this year?
I'm one of 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities, from 165 countries, competing in Los Angeles.
More than 62,000 viewers watched the opening ceremony and TSN and ESPN also streamed the show.
But do you know about this?
What do you think when you see people like me?
I'm here today to be bold and take care of us as equals.
The special Olympics changed the self-perception of intellectually deficient athletes and changed the perception of the audience.
If you are not familiar with the Special Olympics, let me explain that it was for people with intellectual disabilities.
It is independent of the Paralympics and the Olympic Games.
We have high-quality, intellectually deficient, year-round sports programs that can change our destiny and our perception of ourselves.
The special Olympics changed my life and changed the lives of many people, and it changed the way the world thinks about people with intellectual disabilities.
I was born with epilepsy and intellectual disability.
I was 12 years old and played hockey.
The more I grow up, the more difficult it becomes to keep up with others, and I feel angry and frustrated.
For a while, I didn't touch any sports, I didn't have many friends, I felt abandoned, and nobody cared.
For a time, people with intellectual disabilities were isolated from this society and not made public.
No one thinks they can play sports, let alone be a valuable member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of normal exercise on the health of children with intellectual disabilities.
Dr. Hayden and other researchers, through rigorous scientific research, have come to the conclusion that the reason for the decline in their health in children with intellectual disabilities is simply a lack of opportunities for exercise.
Many people who question intellectual disabilities can benefit from sports or athletics.
But it's because of Dr. Hayden, and the founder of the Special Olympics, Younis Kennedy Sharif, that they insist on the benefits of sports, and the special Olympic athletes no less than 4.5 million times prove that sports do have benefits.
I was nervous before I went to the Special Olympics because I was young and shy, I didn't have a lot of friends.
But when I got there, I found that everyone was friendly, helpful, and non-discriminatory, and made me my own.
Now, I'm a basketball player, a speed skater, I've competed in provincial and national competitions, and this year I've been to the Special Olympics in Los Angeles, where I represented the first Canadian basketball player in the world.
I'm one of the 4.5 million athletes in the world and I've heard a lot of similar stories.
Become a Special Olympics athlete and help us regain our confidence and dignity.
The game also points to important health needs.
Research shows that, on average, men with intellectually handicapped men live 13 years less than men without intellectual disabilities and women with intellectual disabilities live 20 years less than women without intellectual disabilities.
Special Olympics keeps us healthy and allows us to take the initiative to participate in sports.
Our coach also teaches us about nutrition and health.
Special Olympics also provides free health checks for athletes who have trouble communicating with their doctors or athletes who have trouble getting health attention.
At the 2015 Special Olympics, members of my Canadian team played against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the game, Nigerian basketball team members participated in the health system of the Games 7 of the 10 players who received free hearing aids for the first time in their lives.
The changes that have brought them are amazing.
They're more excited, happier, confident because their coach is finally able to communicate with them in words.
They're very excited because they can hear the sound of the basketball whistle and the cheers of the fans standing next to them, the voices that we think deserve to be.
Special Olympics events don’t just change athletes’ sports
It also changes the lives of athletes.
This year, research showed that nearly half of adults in the U.S. are more intolerant and less likely to have a 44% of Americans who don’t have contact with an intellectual disability who are significantly more intolerant and less likely to have a less positive attitude toward people with intellectual disabilities.
And then the words with the word "stupid" prove that people with intellectual disabilities are still blind and feel isolated.
People use that word, or swear.
Last year, it took more than nine million times on Twitter, and it hurt me and my 4.5 million athletes in the world.
People don't think it's insulting, but it's true.
Franklin Stephens, my fellow athlete and global messenger, wrote a letter to a political commentator who used the word "stupid" to scold people, "Look for a day to see the special Olympics.
Let's see if you're still thinking when you leave."
This year, at the 2015 Special Olympics, people lined up for hours to watch the last night's weightlifting.
When my teammate Jackie Barrett came on the field, people stood up, he was called a Newfoundland moose, he pulled up 665 pounds and squatted up and lifted 611 pounds to pass a number of new records for the Special Olympics.
Jackie is a record holder among Newfoundland weightlifters, not just the Special Olympics Games, but all weightlifters.
Jackie is now a big star in Los Angeles, and ESPN also posted in real time about his weight-breaking tweets and was shocked by his performance.
Fifty years ago, almost no one could have imagined that a person with intellectual disabilities could do that.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, watched the opening ceremony of the competition, and cheered athletes from 165 countries around the world.
We are congratulated and cheered, not hidden.
Special Olympics teaches athletes to be more confident and prouder
The special Olympic Games also taught the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve to be respected and included.
Now, in my sports career, I have dreams and achievements, and I have good training, and I'm being treated with respect, and I'm healthier, and I'm working hard on my career as a personal trainer.
I'm not being hidden, being bullied, I'm doing TED Talk here.
With the Special Olympics, the world is different, but there’s still a long way to go.
So the next time you see people with intellectual disabilities, I hope you can see their potential.
The next time someone uses the word “stupid” around you, I hope you tell them how hurtful.
I hope you will see a special Olympics.
I finally share an idea with you.
Nelson Mandela once said, “Sport has the power to change the world.”
The special Olympics are changing the world, changing 4.5 million athletes, giving us a place to be confident, to know friends, not to be discriminated against, to experience being a champion.
Thank you all!
You may have never heard of Kenema in Sierra Leone, or Aroua of Nigeria.
But I think they are two of the best places in the world.
The hospital there, a community of nurses, surgeons and scientists, has been quietly battling one of humanity’s deadliest threats for years – the Lhasa virus.
The Lhasa virus is very much like Ebola.
It can cause severe fever symptoms and is often fatal.
But these people risk their lives every day to protect every member of the community, and at the same time, to protect all of us.
The best thing I learned from them was that when I first visited many years ago, those challenging, front-line days, they started every morning -- singing.
They gather together to show their joy.
They show a spirit.
Many years have passed, and when we visit each other year after year, I can get together to sing with them, and we'll record that, and we love to do that, because it reminds us that we're not just going to search for the truth of science together, but a human bond that binds us together.
And you can imagine that when the surroundings change, this connection becomes extremely important, even indispensable.
In March 2014, a major change occurred. The Ebola outbreak broke out in Guinea.
This is the first outbreak in the West African region, at the border between Sierra Leone and Libya.
The situation was terrible and we were all shocked.
In fact, we even suspected that Lhasa and the Ebola epidemic were spreading more widely than we thought, and we feared that one day it would spread to Kenema.
So my team immediately set out, got there, and joined Dr. Humar Khan and his team, and we built diagnostic equipment to do some sensitive molecular testing, and we could detect Ebola when it crossed the Sierra Leone border.
We've already set up devices of this scale for the Lhasa virus , and we know how to deal with it, and the team is fantastic.
We just need to give them equipment and space to study Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day has come.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to a delivery room in a hospital, and our team conducted those important molecular tests and confirmed the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This is actually very great.
They can diagnose the condition at the first time, treat the patient safely, and start tracking contacts to follow the spread of the disease.
It could have stopped something.
But by the time that day came, the outbreak had been brewing for months.
After hundreds of cases were detected, it dwarfed all previous outbreaks.
And the virus didn't come to Sierra Leone by that single case, it's a huge shockwave.
We had to work closely with the international community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to deal with these cases. The next week came 31 patients, then 92, then up to 147 -- all flocked to Kenema, because this is one of the few places in Sierra Leone that can respond to the epidemic.
We worked day and night, trying to help every patient, hoping to get everyone's attention, but we also did another simple thing.
To detect Ebola, we took samples from the patient's blood, and we could, of course, throw them away.
But the fact that the other thing we can do is add chemicals to the sample to inactivate, and then seal it in a box and transport it across the ocean, and that's what we do.
We sent the sample to Boston, where my team worked.
We worked day and night, working every day, so we quickly sorted out 99 genomes of Ebola.
That's a blueprint -- the genome of a virus is a blueprint.
We humans have too.
It details everything that makes up our bodies and tells us a lot of information.
The results of these efforts are simple, but powerful.
We can take these 99 different virus variants, look at and compare them, and we can see clearly that compared to the three genomes released by Guinea, we can find that the disease has been circulating in Guinea a few months ago, and once it breaks into the population, it will be transmitted quickly through human-to-human contact.
This information is really important, especially when you're looking at how to stop the spread of the virus, but the most important thing is contact tracing.
We can also see that when the virus is spreading from person to person, it is constantly mutating.
Every variation is incredibly important because all the diagnoses, the vaccines, and the treatments we use are basically based on that specific genome sequence, which is the root cause of the spread of the epidemic.
So health professionals around the world need to respond quickly, improve research methods, and adjust everything they do.
But in my position at the time, the way I was in the scientific research was that I got the data, and I might have to shut up in the lab for months, carefully and carefully analyzed the data, wrote the papers, and then made them revised, and finally the papers were made public.
This is the current state of scientific research at that time.
Well, at that particular time that approach certainly doesn't work, does it?
Some of our friends work on the front line of the disease, and obviously the most important thing for us is outside help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we did, the genetic sequencing came out of the machine, and we immediately posted the data online.
We open it to the whole world and say, “Help us!”
Then help to follow.
We didn’t react, and there was a large group of people around the world who took the initiative to contact us, and they were pleasantly surprised to see that the data was available online.
Some of the best virus trackers in the world have suddenly become part of our team!
We work together in this virtual way, we share information, we talk to each other on the phone, keep in touch, and hopefully track the spread of the virus in seconds and find a way to contain it.
There are many ways to form such a group.
Everyone, especially when the epidemic is worldwide, is constantly getting information, participating in it, and investing in it.
Everyone wants to make a contribution.
The power of all the people in the world is really amazing, and the Internet connects us.
We’re no longer afraid to communicate with others, and we all say, “Get started.”
Let’s work together, we can do it!”
But the problem is that the data that we all use, the data we find on Google, is far from meeting the needs of our work.
When that happens, we miss a lot of opportunities.
So in the early days of Kenema, we had 106 clinical records of patients, and we made them public once again.
In our own lab, you give us the 106 records, and we can get the computer to predict the next Ebola patient, and the accuracy is close to 100 percent.
We've also made an app that publishes these predictions specifically to make this information available to health workers around the world.
However, 106 reports are far from enough to make this approach effective.
So we're waiting for more clinical reports before we can release that software.
These reports never came.
We’re still waiting, we’re still fixing the software, in the lab instead of working with everyone.
That’s... we can’t accept it at all.
You, all of you, can't accept it.
Now is the time for life to hang in the line.
But in fact, a lot of people have sacrificed, and a lot of people working in the medical field, including my beloved colleagues, have five colleagues: Mbaru Vonne, Alex Mambi, Dr. Humar Khan, Alice Kowama, and Mohammed Fuller.
These are just five out of thousands of health workers who are dying elsewhere in Kenema, and the world has been waiting, and we have been working hard, and people are independent and uncommunicative.
Ebola, like any other threat to humanity, will be exacerbated by mistrust, dispersion and estrangement between people.
When we build each other barriers and fight each other, the virus is even more arrogant.
But Ebola is not like any other threat, because this time, we became a family.
We are all on the same front.
If one person has Ebola, we may be next.
So we live in the world, with common weaknesses, common strengths, common fears, common hopes, and I sincerely hope that we can work together with joy.
One of my graduates, who had read a book about Sierra Leone, found the word “Kenema,” the name of the city, the hospital where we were working in Sierra Leone, which means “as clear and clear as a river, and touched by all eyes.”
It's very profound for us, we don't realize it, but we've always felt that in order to pay tribute to all the people in the places we've worked for in Kenema, we've got to be open and cooperative, we've got to share information, we've got to work together.
We must do that.
Everyone should demand this from ourselves and others – when disaster strikes, we should all open our hearts to each other and fight this battle together.
Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola, and it will not be the last, and there are many other microbes lurking around us, like the Lhasa virus and other organisms.
The next time a disaster happens, it could happen in a city with a population of one million, and it could break out there.
The virus may spread through the air.
Viruses can even be deliberately spread.
I know it's scary, I can understand it, but I also know that this experience tells us that we have enough technology and capability to win this battle, not only to win this battle, but to be one higher for all viruses.
But we can only do it when we work together, and we have to be happy.
So for Dr. Khan, and for all those who have sacrificed on the front lines of disease resistance, who will always be with us, let us always fight with them.
Our world should not be defined by the devastation caused by a virus, and we want billions of hearts and minds to shine on the earth.
Thank you all.
