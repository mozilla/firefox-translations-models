Well, I'm going to tell a story about how we know what we know.
This story is about this woman, Natalia Ritz-Zinsky.
She's a paleontologist, and her specialty is digging something about old things everywhere.
Natalia Ritz-Tynsky: "Yes, some people call me 'Dr. Dead things'."
I find her particularly interesting because the place where she digs things, all in the Arctic Circle at high latitudes, the distant Canadian permafrost belt.
One summer of 2006, she was a archaeological excavation site called the Farsley bed, which is less than 10 latitudes away from the geomagnetic north pole.
NR: "Sure, it doesn't really mean." "You're going to carry your bags all day, with a GPS navigator and notebook, "long on a long journey, see what might be a fossil.
At one point, however, she noticed something.
"A little rust-colored thing," probably as big as my palms. "
"It's lying on the ground."
Her first reaction was that it was nothing but a fragment of wood, because it was a prehistoric plant body that people had discovered at the Faresley bed.
But that night, back to the camp...
NR: "... I took out the hand-held microscope of Rama" I watched more carefully, and I suddenly found that "'This thing doesn't seem like it's a wheelless for years to turn around."
"It may be because of the saving problem," but it looks like it really...
"The bones."
So for the next four years, she went back to that location over and over again, and eventually collected thirty pieces of debris, all from the same bone, many of which were very tiny.
"In fact, it's not a lot. A small zip-and-spolo bag is loaded."
Then she tried to put the pieces together like a puzzle.
But it's very challenging.
"It crumbles into a lot of small pieces," "we tried to recover from the sand and ash, but it looked terrible."
"In the end, we used a 3D surface scanner."
Oh, "sound, it's beautiful, right?"
Finally, it was found that it was much easier to recover in a virtual way.
"It's really magical when they're all put together."
How big is you sure you're fighting it right, just spelling it in what it was?
Is it possible that you're going to fight in the other way and finally spell it out... a little parrot or something?
"Uh, no. We're definitely fighting right."
She found that she was spelled out, a shin, a calf bone, and that the tibia came from a mammal with a pair of hoofings, such as cows and sheep.
But it's definitely not a cow or a sheep.
It's too big.
"The size of this thing is really too big. It's a huge animal."
What animal would it be?
Now that there was a bottleneck, she showed one of the pieces of it to her some of her colleagues in Colorado, and then they had ideas.
"We used the little saw and then scraped a little bit in the corner of the fragment," and then there something very magical smell came out of it. "
It smells a bit like charred skin.
It's a smell that Natalia knew, and she smells when she cuts the skull in the general anatomy lab, which is collagen.
Collagen gives our bones a hardness.
Generally, after so many years, it will break down naturally.
Yet for this situation, the Arctic seems to be a natural freezer that preserves it.
After a year or two, Natalia went to Bristol to attend a convention where she saw one of her colleagues, named Mc Buckley, in demonstrating a new technique he called "collagen fingerprint technology .
In fact, the collagen of different species has small differences in its structure, so if you have collagen information about an unknown bone, you can compare with collagen information of known species, so who knows, maybe you found the matching information.
So she sent a piece of debris to Mac, with FedEx.
"Of course, you have to keep an eye on the progress of the distribution. It's very important."
He then processed the sample, comparing it to 37 contemporary known mammal species.
I found a pair!
The final conclusion is that Natalia's discovery in the Arctic Circle of the High Dike Pole, which is a matter of 3.5 million years of history, comes from...
A camel.
"I'm thinking, what a joke?" "If we're wrong, it's amazing."
So they tested a whole bunch of pieces and got the same result for each piece.
However, judging by the size of that bone they found, it means that the camel is 30 percent larger than the modern camel.
Then the camel is about 2.7 meters tall, and weighs a ton.
(Exclaim) Yeah.
Natalia discovered a "Arctic giant camel"
Now that you hear the word "comet", the picture that comes to mind is such a picture: the twin-peak hump hump of East Asia and Central Asia.
But it's more likely that the image in your head is more like this: a dromedary camel, a typical desert animal, which often haunts the hot desert, for example, in the Middle East or Sahara, with an oversized hump on its back, allowing it to store moisture for the long journeys in the desert, and the wide feet to help them stride across the dunes.
So how did these guys run to the Arctic Circle?
In fact, scientists have long known that before Natalia's discovery, it was known that the camel was first from the American origins.
(Music: The American National Anthem Song of the Star-Manage Flag) They originated here.
For the forty million years in which the camels existed for 40 million years, you could only find them in North America, with a total of 20 different species, perhaps more than that.
“If we were to line them up, would they look different? ”
"It's a lot of difference in their body size."
“There ’ s some necks that are particularly long, ” so they function a lot like giraffes.
Some also have long noses, like crocodiles.
"They were particularly primitive, and some of the earliest ones that might have been very small as the" almost like a little rabbit. "
What? Rabbit-sized camels?
"The first ones were."
"Those you may not recognize."
My God, I want to just "rabter camel" to make pets!
"I know, it's going to be great.
Then about three million to seven million years ago, a branch of the camel migrated southward to South America, where they evolved into a cameat or alpaca, and another branch crossed the Bering Land Bridge to Asia and Africa.
Presumably at the end of the last glacial period, the camels of North America are completely extinct.
Well, scientists have known this, but it doesn't quite explain how Natalia found camels so north.
Here, from a temperature point of view, it's simply the antithesis of the Sahara.
Honestly, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius higher than it is now.
So it can be a northern forest, a bit like today's Yue empty river basin or Siberia.
But they still have six months of winter, and all the ponds will be frozen.
You're going to have a snowstorm.
You'll have a 24-hour night.
What exactly... what's going on?
How could these superstars in the Sahara Desert survive in this bitterly cold condition?
Natalia and her colleagues felt they had found the answer.
And that answer is quite witty.
If these properties of camels are not, as we think, are produced to adapt to the environment like the Sahara, and because of the harsh winter that they evolved?
If the broad feet are not to step over the sand dune, but to walk through the snowy boots, like the snow boots?
If those humps are simply the news! It's not water but fat that is stored, the hump is actually to make the camel get food scarce, six months long winter?
If, after that, after they cross the continental bridge, they will transform these winter characteristics to adapt them to the hot desert environment?
For example, those humps may be good for camels in hot zones, because when your fat is piled up in the same place, you know, like a "fat backpack", which means that the insulation of your body does not have to cover the whole body.
This makes heat dissipation easier.
It is this crazy idea that makes the camel's seemingly typical desert properties suddenly become evidence that they originated in the high latitudes of the Arctic.
I ’ m not the first person to tell this story.
Others have already said it, raving the magic of biological evolution, or taking a glimpse into the future of climate change.
But I love this story for a different reason.
To me, it's a story about us, about how we know the world, about how that perception has changed.
My profession is a historian.
I found that many scientists are also historians.
They understand the past.
They tell the history of the universe, the Earth and the Earth.
As a historian, you need to have a mind of a thought, thinking about how this story goes on.
"We make up stories, and then we're going to go down the line of thinking and go down to the Aramed" as if the desert camel, .D.
"It's a great story! The camel is a perfect fit for the desert."
"Obviously, the camel has been living there."
But at any time, you may find small clues.
You may find something small that forces you to reinvent everything you think you know.
As in this example, this scientist found this fragment, and she thought it was wood, because of this discovery that the scientific community gave birth to a new, counter-intuitive theory, explaining why this strange, rave-like creature, grew into what it is now.
To me, it completely upended my view of the camel.
It has gone from a creature that exists only for this particular environment into a round-the-world traveler, only to happen to be in the Sahara and can be anywhere at any time.
This is Azul.
Hi Azul! Are you OK?
Come, I've brought you something to eat.
Azul has just finished her special performance, coming over from the New York Radio City Music Hall.
It's not to laugh.
Well... Seriously, Azuli is here as a living example of how the story of the world is changing rapidly.
We have to be proactive and bold to make changes and re-imagine.
Azouli, you say right?
Really, we have a new perspective on the world, only a broken bone away.
Thank you all.
Today's computers are so magical that we're even ignoring how bad they actually are.
Today I'm going to talk to you about this issue and how we can solve it with neuroscience.
First, I'm going to take you back to a cold night in Hallem in 2011, which had far-reaching implications for me.
I was sitting in a bar next to Columbia University, where I was majoring in computer and neuroscience, and I was having an interesting conversation with a classmate about the power of holography, which would replace computers one day.
Just as our conversation was at great, unsurprisingly, his phone rang.
He picked up his phone and bowed his head and started typing.
And then he looked up at me from time to time, "Go on, I'll listen."
But it was clear that his eyes were not concentrated, and a wonderful moment was so fleeting.
At the same time, opposite the bar, I noticed another student holding his phone, this time around a group of people in front of the screen.
He's rummaging through the pictures on Instagram, and the kids are laughing in sound.
They felt so happy in the face of the same technique, and I felt so much frustrated that this strong contrast immediately caused me to think.
As I thought more and more, I became more and more aware that it was clear that the problem here was not electronic information, but merely the location of the message separating me from my friend, but that brought these children together.
It's clear that they are being connected by something, just as our ancestors evolved their social cognition, such as telling stories around a bonfire.
I think that's exactly what tools should do.
They should extend our physical function.
I think today, computers are doing the opposite.
Whether you're sending an email to your wife, or giving a symphonic music, or just comforting a friend, you're almost all in the same way.
You bend over to these squares, play with buttons and menus, and more squares appear.
I felt it was the wrong way, and I felt we could start using a more natural machine.
The machines we use should be able to bring our work back to real life.
We should use machines that can use the principles of neuroscience to extend our senses, not to limit ourselves.
Now I have a machine like that.
It's called Meta 2.
Let's try it.
Now I can see the audience and I can see my hands.
In counting to 3,2,1, we'll see a holographic image that appears, a very real holography that appears in front of me, in front of the glasses I'm now wearing.
Of course this could be anything we're going to buy, or something we're going to learn, and I can control its movement with my hands very easily.
And I think Iron Man will be very proud.
We'll be back later.
If you're like I thought, you should be thinking about what you can do with this technology, let's look at some examples.
My mother was an architect, so it's natural that the first thing I imagine is to paint a three-dimensional building, rather than using these plane floor plans.
In fact, she is now touching the design to choose an interior decoration.
These were all filmed by GoPro in my glasses.
The next use case was very personal to me, was Professor Adam Gözére's glass brain project, and here thanks UCSF for its mandate.
As a neurositter, I'm always amazed at the ability to be able to learn and remember these complex brain structures with a real machine, so that I can touch and fiddle with different brain structures.
Now what you're seeing is called augmented reality, but for me, it's just a much more important part of the story of how this story is about how we started using digital devices to extend our bodies, rather than limiting our physical function.
Then the thra
In the next few years, humanity will go through a transformation, I think.
We will begin to cover an entire digital layer in the real world.
Take a moment to imagine what it means for people who tell stories, and for the painter, for the brain surgeon, for the interior decorator, and perhaps for all the people we're here today, what it really means.
I think what we have to do as a group is to really try and try to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends the human experience, rather than gamifying our reality, or mingling with reality and digital information.
That's what I'm very interested in doing.
Now, I want to tell you a little secret.
Within about five years of the Ambition, this will not be the smallest device of the "Shrone of the Meals in about five years, which will look like the strip-like glasses that are placed in front of you, capable of projecting holographic images.
Just as we don't care much about the hardware parameters of different phones, it's the â €̃â €TMs phones we buyâ €TMs look to the operating system as a neuroscientist, and I always want to build a brain-based iOS, if you can.
It's very important that we make sure it's working properly, because these things may not be shorter than our exposure to the Windows image user interface.
I don't know what you think, but living in the Windows system makes me feel a little scary.
To isolate a single most intuitive contact interface into an infinite distance, we use neuroscience to guide our designs instead of having a bunch of designers arguing in the design room.
The principle of our evolution is called "The Minimum Resistance Neural Pipeline loom
At each time of change, we connect the brain's iOS system with our brains, for the first time, with our brain language.
In other words, we're trying to create a computer with a zero learning curve.
We're building a system that you've always known how to use it.
These are the first three design guides we used in this new form of user experience.
First, you are operating systems.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract, and they make it necessary for your brain to go a few more corners to decode them.
We're going the opposite of the "minimum resistance nerve pipeline."
At the same time, in augmented reality, you can certainly put your holographic TED display here, put your holographic email on the other side of the table, and your spatial memory evolves to extract this information exactly.
You can put the hologram of Tesla in an online shopping shop here in the hologram here in the gramlas or any patterns my legal team told me before coming on stage.
(Laughter in the audience) It's fine, and your brain does know how to get back to reality.
The second interface guide we call "Contactable Visuals"
What do babies do when they see something they are interested in?
They will try to reach out and catch it.
Natural machines work in this way.
In fact, the visual system has a very basic driving force, and we can call it ontology sensory will be a feeling in the space of our body.
By direct contact with our work objects, we not only control it better, but also understand it more deeply.
This is the “touchable. ”
But it's not enough to experience things ourselves.
We are social primates.
This reminds me of our third guide, from the "holographic bonfire" of our first story:
Our mirrors' s DNA system shows that we can better relate to everyone and our work, if we can see a stereogram of faces and hands for everyone.
So, if you look at the video behind me, you can see that two Meta users are operating the same holographic image, building eye contact, focusing on this thing, rather than being distracted by external devices.
Let ’ s try again with the concept of neuroscience.
Again, our favorite interface, the brain's iOS system.
I'm going to take a step forward now and grab the pair of glasses in front. Then just put it on the table.
I'm in a moment with you now, we're connecting.
My spatial memory is working, and I can grab it in the past and take it back here and remind myself that I am an operating system.
Now that my body feels like it's working, I can fro that these glass burst into thousands of pieces in the past, and then touch the sensors that are scanning my hands at this moment.
But it's not enough to just see that, so soon my co-founder Ryan will call me a 3D call to me?
Hi Ryan, how are you?
Ladies and gentlemen, I can see this man appearing in front of me in the form of a three-dimensional projection.
And his image is very real.
(The audience applauded) thank you.
My Mirror-nerves system shows this will replace the phone in the near future.
Ryan, how are you?
Ryan: I'm fine. We can finally demonstrate it on the spot.
(Clapping of the audience) Ryan, to give you a brain of holographic photography we saw in a short film as a small gift.
Guys, this will not only change the way we call, it will change the form of our collaboration.
Thank you very much.
Thanks, Ryan.
Ryan: Not kind.
(Arrival of the audience) Meron Gribelez: So guys, I found in that bar in 2011: The future of computers is not locked inside these screens.
It's here, in our body.
(Audience clapping) So if I can leave you with an idea today, it's that the natural machine doesn't just exist in the future for the imagination, it's here, it exists in 2016.
That's why at Meta's hundreds of employees, including administrators, executives, designers, engineers, and you'll throw away our external display devices before TED2017 and replace it with a truly more natural machine.
Thank you very much.
(The audience applauded) thank you.
Thank you all.
Chris Anderson: I have a problem, and there have been a lot of shows of holography last year.
Sometimes there is a debate in the field of technology about whether we really see the real thing on the screen?
It's a problem in the field, and in a way technology is showing a broader perspective than you actually see with glasses.
Did we see the real effect?
Mellon Gribbez: Absolutely real effect.
Not only that, but we also use additional measurement techniques, and we're shooting with GoPro through real lenses, and we get a variety of different short films you see here.
We want to try to make the experience of the world realize through the things that you see through our glasses, not just to see the locality.
CA: Thank you very much for your show.
MG: Thank you very much.
I'm one of the most liberal, tolerant and most promising cities from the United States, Seattle, Washington.
I grew up in a great Seattle family.
My mother was an artist, and my father was a college professor, and I was grateful for their upbringing, because I could plan my life in the way I felt fit.
In fact, my choice is not the same as what my parents think.
When I was 19, I dropped out of school when I dropped out of school as a member of the University, or, more precisely, was fired.
I embarked on the path of becoming a professional French trumpet, which was my lifelong dream.
I've performed chamber music in the United States and Europe, and I've been on tour for a few years, along with a very good jazz guitarist Charlie Bird.
When I was in my twenties, I was thrilled to join the Spanish Barcelona Symphony Orchestra.
What a wonderful life!
My parents never complained,
They supported me from the beginning,
Even if it wasn't their dream.
They used to talk to neighbors and friends, "Our son wants to 'take up' for ten years."
And there ’ s an awkward conversation about my life that I want to share with you.
I was 27 years old when I was 27 years old, and I came home from Barcelona, and it was Christmas, and when I was there when I was helping my mother make dinner, we were both in the kitchen.
She was silent at the time, without a word.
I think something is wrong.
I asked my mother, "Mom, what are you thinking?
She said, "I'm really worried about you and your dad."
I was surprised: "What? What are you worried about now?
She replied: "I hope you answer my question honestly: Did you vote for the Republican Party
The truth is, I'm not interested in politics, I'm just a French trumpet blower.
But I got a little bit out that they perceived something, so there was a bit of confusion.
I was then a frenetic sought-after for capitalism, and let me tell you why that was.
Believe it or not, it's rooted in my research on poverty.
When I was a kid in Seattle, I remember it was the first time I've been in contact with real poverty.
My family belongs to the lower middle class, but that's certainly not really poor.
Not at all.
The first time I saw poverty for the first time, I was only six or seven years old in the early 1970s.
Like many of us, this example is ordinary.
It was a Latin American painting in National Geographic that was a child about the same size as I was, and the flies flew in his face and swelled in his stomach.
I know he can't pass, I know, but I can't do anything.
Some of you may remember a painting, not necessarily exactly the same, but a picture very similar.
It shows the Western world the unbearable poverty of the rest of the world.
That picture was lingering in my mind, along with me growing up, going to school, dropping out of school, and starting to start building my own family.
I wonder, how was that kid since?
Or what about the rest of the world like him?
I started to study this question, and even though I was no longer in college at the time, I was still looking for the answer: What happened to the poorest people in the world?
Is it getting worse or better? What's the hell?
I finally found the answer and changed my life. I want to share it with you.
In fact, most Americans feel that from childhood, they see that from the time of childhood, they have seen that scene to this day,
If you ask Americans, “The world ’ s poverty problem is worse or better, ” and .70% say that hunger has been worse since the early 1970s.
But the facts are like that.
It was a moment that changed my mind and made me an epiphan.
Since 1970, the percentage of the population whose daily cost of living is not more than 1 dollar has fallen by 80 per cent since 1970, the world has been in line with inflation correction.
The percentage of the world ’ s poorest people have decreased by 80% since I was a child.
I don ’ t know that fact.
My friends, it's a miracle!
It is something we deserve to celebrate.
This is the greatest anti-poverty achievement in human history, and it has happened in our lifetime.
When I know that fact, I think, what makes it possible to get out of poverty?
Because if you don't know the reason, it's just a blip.
We're going to replicate the success to get the 200 million people who are still struggling in poverty out of the status quo, because that's what we've been talking about: from when I was a kid, two billion of the poorest people, our brothers and sisters, out of poverty.
I want to save the remaining two billion people, so I have to know why.
I'm looking for the answer,
It's not a political answer because I don't care about the political answer at all.
Right now, still don't care.
I crave the best answers from mainstream economists, both left-wing, right-wing and centrist economists.
Below.
I started talking about specific reasons.
From childhood to the present, two billion people have been lifted out of poverty
There are five reasons. First: Globalization
Second: Free Trade
Third: Property Rights
Fourth: The rule of law
Fifth: Entrepreneurship
These are the free-market economic systems that swept the world after the 1970s.
I am not childish.
I know that the free market economy is not perfect, and I also know that the free-market economy does not meet the full needs of building a better world.
But it is great.
And beyond politics.
That's a point I learned and had an epiphany.
Capitalism is not just about capital accumulation.
The best thing about it is: it's related to ambition, something that many people on the stage have talked about, were born of dreams, and it's rooted in the free-market system.
We need to get more people to understand that.
Now, I'm going to talk about my second epiphany, which is with the first to do with the first I believe that it will not only promote the development of the world, but also our country.
Summarizing the just-out of the point of salvation with someone else's words is that the free market has created the greatest wealth in history.
And to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. ”
And whose word of word?
Like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
Wrong!
It was President Obama!
Why do I remember deeply?
Because he said to me.
I can't imagine it.
I said, "Hallelujah!"
Not only that, I also said, "What a great opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking then?
In May 2015, we did an event at Georgetown University about the topics we did,
At that time, I thought about solving the problem facing the United States today. So what is it?
It's both liberals and conservatives who come together to discuss these ideas to help those who need us the most.
Needless to say, everyone present knows that we are in a crisis in the United States and in other countries in the world that have political differences,
This issue is imminent.
It can ’ t help but worry.
Last year, an article was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, one of the most influential and cutting-edge scientific journals in the West
That was a 2014 article on asymmetric political motivation.
Psychologists describe this phenomenon as assuming that your idea is based on love and the other person's ideas on hate.
This is common in world disputes.
There are Palestinians and Israelis, for example.
What the authors of the article found is that in the United States today, a large proportion of Republicans and Democrats are at odds over political motivations.
Today, most of the people politically active in our country think that they are driven by love, and the rest are driven by hatred.
Think about it.
Most people always say, "My thoughts are based on benevolence, I want to help people, and others, they are evil, they are trying to bring down me."
Societies with such differences cannot be progressed.
It is impossible.
How are we going to address this issue?
First, let's be honest with us: disagreements exist.
We can't reduce our differences because that's childish behavior.
There is quite a bit of in-depth research on this.
My friend Jonathan Hayet is a frequent guest at TED.
He is a psychology professor at New York University.
He studied the thoughts, values and morals of different people and studied how they differed.
He has proven that conservatives and liberals have very different views on what they think is important.
Jonathan Hait, for example, shows that liberals are more concerned with poverty than about economic freedom than about economic freedom.
Conservatives, on the other hand, are 28% more about economic freedom than about poverty.
It seems irreconcilable differences, right?
Could we come together? No!
Our strength lies in the differences.
Remember what stopped poverty:
An obsession and concern about poverty, and the free economic order around the world.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people, want to help another two hundred million people out of poverty.
No other way.
Well.
What are we going to do?
It's a delicate thing, isn't it?
We want to innovate thinking.
A lot of innovative ideas are on this stage.
Yes! the entrepreneurial spirit of those extraordinary societies.
We want to invest overseas in a sustainable, responsible and ethical way.
But do you know what we really need?
We need to open a new world of flexible thinking,
We need less "foreseeable",
Right?
Have you ever felt that your thoughts were beginning to be predictable?
Start with conformism?
Do you feel that you always listen to the words of someone you agree with you?
Why is that dangerous?
Because when we're talking about the economy in this country, on one side is a conservative, and it's always about taxes, rules and big government rule.
And on the other side is liberals, when it comes to the economy is always about income inequality.
Those are important to me, and it's important to you.
But when people who are starving need our help, these are just distractions.
We should unite in the best way to do our best to reduce poverty, only when conservatives realize that they need liberals to worry about poverty, and that liberals also need conservatives' obsession with free markets.
We will succeed. Only if we choose this path, this diversity will breed the powerful power of the country of the future.
How do we achieve that goal? How can we achieve it together?
I have some action advice, for you, and for myself.
The first rule of action: It is important to remember that it is not good enough to tolerate the different opinions of others.
It's not enough.
We want to remember that we need people who disagree with us because there are a group of people who need the help of all of us and they are still waiting.
What are you ready to do? How do you behave?
Where to start? Here!
All of us here, we are happy.
We have people who listen to us,
We were successful, we have leadership.
When people hear our unknown ideology, maybe they listen to us.
Maybe that ’ s the starting point for success.
That's the first point. Second.
The second point: I am asking you, and I am also asking myself to be a specific individual with a vague, difficult to define.
If you're a conservative, be a conservative who often hangs the issue of poverty, and a warrior who insists on keeping the moral duty of fighting for the poor.
If you are liberal, be a liberal who often praises the charm of the free market that we run responsibly.
If we do that, the two goals are just around the corner.
First: We're starting to work to help the next two billion people solve them as many problems as they used to solve so many problems in the future, and we'll solve more of it.
The second is that we may be able to overcome this terrible ideological war that has caused us to suffer, and transform it into a competition based on ideas of solidarity and mutual respect.
Maybe it's time possible, it's just possible that we'll find that what we call disagreements is not so irreconcilable.
Thanks!
At the time of college, I was a major in politics, which meant I had to write a lot of papers.
When a regular student writes a thesis, they may be like this, apportioning the task.
So, you understand that the beginning may be a little slow, but a week later has been written a lot, and sometimes write more, and the last thing is done, things will not be messed up.
I want to do that too.
At least my plan is like that.
I was ready to start, however, in fact, by the time of writing the paper, I was doing it.
And it's like that every time you write a paper.
Finally, when you write a 90-page graduation thesis, it should have taken a year to write thesis.
I know that for a paper like this, my usual practice doesn't work.
Graduation is a big project.
So I planned it well and decided to do it.
One year of work is arranged.
At first, less dry, the middle of the few months to dry a little more, the last high-speed gear to go all out like a small step.
How hard is climbing the steps?
No big deal, right?
But next, interesting things happened.
In the first month?
Here and go, I basically didn't do anything.
So there was this great plan to change.
Then... the middle of a few months went so far, and I basically didn't write a few words, so it became so.
And then there are two months to a month, to just two weeks left.
Then one day I suddenly realized that there were only three days left of the deadline, and I didn't write a word, so I did the only thing I could do: I spent 72 hours writing 90 pages, and all night for two days, the workers should not stay through the campus at a continuous all-nighter, slow-moving and dive in, and handing over the papers before the deadline.
I thought it was all over.
A week later I got a call and it was the school.
They asked: "Are you Tim Irban?"
And I said, "Yes, ."
They said, "We've got to talk to you about the paper."
I answered ’ t I was good. ”
The other side continued, "This is the best paper we've ever seen."
(Applause) That didn't happen.
This paper is very, very bad.
I just want to enjoy this moment when you all think, "This guy is too cow!"
Not so, that paper is super rotten.
Anyway, I'm a blogger now.
I wrote a blog post for "breaking the casserole to the end."
A few years ago I decided to write an article about procrastination.
My procrastination behavior always confuses people around me who don't procrastinate, so I want to explain to the unscraving people what exactly is what they think in their heads, and why we procrastinators will do that.
My hypothesis is that the brain of procrastinators and the brain of the unprocrastinator are different.
To prove it, I found an MRI lab that allowed me to scan my own brain and a brain that was shown to be not procrastinators, and then I could compare both of them.
Today I brought them all.
I hope you can seriously compare whether there is any difference between the two.
I know that everyone is not a trained brain specialist, it may not seem obvious, but let's take a look, okay?
It's a brain of an unprocrastinc.
Now,
That is my brain.
There is a difference between the two.
Both brains have a rational decision-maker, but there is a procrastinator in the brain of a monkey called instant gratification.
What does this mean for procraulators?
It means everything is fine before this happens.
[Now is the best time to start working...] [not!] So when rational decision-makers make rational decisions and want to do something productive, the monkey doesn't want to do it, so he starts to take control of the steering wheel, and he says, "Actually, let's read about the scandal in Wikipedia about Nancy Kreand / Toni Yadin, because I just thought about it."
Then let's go to the fridge and rummage around what's been something new in the 10 minute.
After that, let's continue to browse on the video site, start with the video Richard Feynman talking about magnetism, and always see the interview with Justin Bieber's old Aunt Christenami.
"It's all time, so we can't get time out of the schedule today.
Sorry! "
What is this going on?
Instant Satisfying Monkey doesn ’ t seem to be the one you want him to control the wheel.
He lives completely in the moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: simplicity and joy.
In the animal world, there's no problem.
If you're a dog, you're living a simple and happy life, it's already a great success!
For monkeys, humans are another animal.
You sleep well, eat enough, reproduce the next generation, and do so in the tribal era.
But if you haven't noticed, we're not living in the tribal days now.
We are in an advanced civilization, and the monkey doesn't understand what it is at all.
That's why we have another guy in our head, the rational decision-maker, who gives us the ability to do things that other animals can't.
We can foresee the future.
We can take care of the big picture.
We can plan for the long term.
And he wants to take all of that into account.
He wants us to do anything worth doing now.
Sometimes it makes sense to do simple and happy things, such as eating, sleeping, or enjoying the leisure time you deserve.
That's why there's a coincide between instant gratification of monkeys and rational decision-makers.
Sometimes they agree.
But sometimes, it makes more sense to do things that are harder and less enjoyable, and that's for the sake of the big deal.
There is a conflict between the two.
For the procrastinator, every conflict ends this way, is that he spends a lot of time in the orange zone, which is the simple and happy but meaningless area.
I call this area the dark playground.
The dark playground is a place where all procrastinators know.
This is a place for leisure and entertainment when it should not be leisure.
The joy of the dark playground is not actually happiness, because it is completely unearned, which brings guilt, fear, anxiety, self-hatred is the feeling of all procrastinators.
And the question is, in this case, the monkeys are in control of the steering wheel, how can the procratch people take themselves to the blue area of the other side, although it is not so comfortable, but there are a lot of important things to do.
In fact, the procratized man has a guardian angel who always looks down on him and watches him, and in those darkest moments it is called a panic monster.
Panic monsters spend most of their time in hibernation, but when the deadline is close or in danger of being ugly in the public, or when faced with a career disaster, or when there are other terrible consequences, it will suddenly wake up.
And it's important that he's the only thing the monkey is afraid of.
Recently in my life, panic monsters became quite important because the TED staff contacted me six months ago and invited me to make a speech.
Of course, I promised.
I ’ ve always dreamed of a TED talk.
But in this excitement, the rational decision-makers seem to be thinking about something else.
He would say, "We know exactly what we just said?
Do we now have the capacity needed to accomplish that task in the future?
We have to sit down and start working. ”
And the monkey said, "All in total, but let's open Google Earth to push the lens to India's 200-foot, and then spend two and a half hours rolling up to the surface of the country, let's feel better about India."
That day I did that.
When the six months turn into four months, then two months, then one month, the TED staff starts posting the speaker.
I opened the website to see my face staring at myself.
Guess who woke up at this time?
So the panic monster began to go mad, and a few seconds later, the whole system was chaotic.
And the monkey, remember? He was afraid of the panic monster 嘣, and he climbed to the tree!
So finally, rational decision makers could finally control the steering wheel, and I could begin to prepare the speech.
In the panic monster's view, all the rather stupid procrastination, such as those like me, took two weeks to start writing the beginning of the paper, and then miraculously had the incredible work enthusiasm to stay up all night and write eight pages.
This whole situation, plus those three roles are the system of procrastinators.
Not good, but at least it's useful.
This is something I decided to write on a blog years ago.
After the release, the response I received took aback.
I get thousands of emails from people from different parts of the world who do a lot of different things.
There are nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and many doctoral students.
The content is basically the same: "I have this problem."
But what struck me was the contrast between that contrast, the relaxed tone of the post, and the heavy tone of those emails.
These people had a strong sense of frustration because procrastination affected their lives because the monkeys controlled their thoughts.
After thinking, my question is what happens if the procrastinator's system works?
Why do these people have such dark corners?
As a result, I found that there were two delays.
I've talked about today, and there's a deadline for the examples given above.
When there is a deadline, the effects of procrastination are limited to a shorter period because the panic monster intervenes.
But for the second delay, it happens without a deadline.
For example, if you want to start a business or work in an art class, there is no deadline at first, because there will be no progress until you start working hard, and nothing will happen to make things go on.
There are no deadlines for important things beyond your career, such as visiting your family, or exercising to stay in good health, trying to improve your relationship or leaving an unhappy relationship.
If the procrastinator does these difficult things with only one mechanism, the panic monster, then the problem is that because in these absence of an deadline, the panic monster does not appear at all.
He didn't need to wake up when, so the consequences of procrastination were not restricted, and they would only be indefinitely extended.
And this long-term procrastination is less obvious and not often talked about than the kind of more interesting, shorter-term,-based, delays than the kind of delays in the far more interesting period.
It usually affects us quietly and quietly.
It could be a source of a lot of long-term unhappiness and guilt.
I feel like that's why those people sent emails, and that's why they're in such a bad situation.
Not because they're rushing for a project,
Rather, this long procrastination makes them feel like they are in their own lives at times as if they are just a spectator.
Their frustration is not because they can't achieve their dreams; they can't even start chasing their dreams.
So after reading these emails, I have a little bit of understanding that I don't think there are people who don't have procrastinators.
Yes, I think everyone is a procrastinator.
You may not be a mess in every way like us, and maybe some people can face the deadline well, but remember: the most despicable trick of the monkeys is that there is no deadline for the part.
Now I want to show you something in the end.
I call it the life calendar.
Assuming a person can live until the age of 90, every week is a lattice.
In fact, there are not many lattice, especially since we have lived for so many years.
I think we all need to take some time to take a hard look at this life calendar.
We need to think hard about what we really procrastinate because everyone is procrastinating on something.
We must always be aware of the presence of this monkey in an instant.
That's something we all should do.
And because there are not many lattice, this work may have started today.
Well, maybe not today, but...
You know it.
In the near future.
Thanks.
We're there. The soul and body are crammed into a Texas church, and that's the last night of our lives.
It's like now in this room, except that there are squeaking wooden benches, tattered red cloth strips, the organ on my left, the choirs behind my back, and a baptism pool built on the back wall.
It's like this room.
The same strong sense of suspense, the same deep desire for salvation, the same sour sweat in the palm of the heart, and the same gang of absent-minded people in the back row.
It was the 31st of December 1999, and that night, as far as I know, Christ's coming to earth, and the world will come to the end of the day.
I was 12 at the time, to the age of responsibility.
I found it so unfair to come back at this time that I was responsible for everything I had done before, but when I stopped complaining, I had better hurry to clean up my home.
I go to the church as much as possible.
I was afraid of a silence around, just as people were afraid of noise, just to repeatedly confirm that God did not play me, but came back early and fell on me.
But if he really came early, I also had a back-up plan, which I read from the all-eveall book of The Doomsmantic.
I saw in the text that if I had passed the midnight ornithousire, I wasn't taken away, and I had another chance.
I just need not be crowned in the name of the pagans, defeating the demons, overcoming the plague, and knocking down the Antichrist.
It would be quite difficult, but I believe it can be done.
But the time for preparation is too early.
It was 11: 50 at night.
We still have ten minutes left, and the priest let us get up from the bench and walk to the altar below, because he wants us to pray together at the moment of midnight.
So the congregation is divided into several batches, to the designated location.
The choir was still on the small stage, and the deacon of the church and their wives, I prefer to call them the "baptor bourgeoisie" in the first row of the altar sitting down.
You know, in the United States, even on the Second Coming Night of the Adventist has VIP seats.
And just behind the Baptist bourgeoisie, it is the older generation of men and women young backs, in the cotton fields of East Texas by the blazing sun, the gully horizontal face is burned into noble brown, like the clay of East Texas, they have those good fantasies and dreams of life outside East Texas and the world, sometimes more shabby than their backs.
Yes, these men and women are my idols and stars.
They waited for this moment for a lifetime, just as their medieval forefathers were hungry for the end of the world, just like my grandmother's desire for the Oprah talk show, and broadcast on the 8th Channel at four o'clock every day.
As she walked toward the altar, I slipped quietly behind her, for I was so sure that my grandmother was going to go to heaven.
I thought, if I hold my hand tightly in this prayer, I might go with her.
So I gripped, and I closed my eyes, listening, waiting.
The prayer is louder.
The cry of the prayer was the same even greater.
The organ rang out, interweaving with the sound of elegy.
The heat wave swept through, and the sweat of the handy heart was more sour.
My hands were tighter, and I didn't want to be abandoned by God.
My eyes were closed tighter, and I didn't want to see the extrinsics being taken away and the dross were falling.
Suddenly a voice reverberates on the top of his head: "Amen."
It's over.
I look at the clock.
It was over midnight.
I watched the elders believers, whose savior did not come, that they were so proud that they did not show even a little loss, they believed too deeply, too long, and now they are too late to doubt.
But I was angry for them.
They were fooled, coaxed, confused, but I was still duped with them.
I did the prayers they did, and I struggled to resist the desires in my heart.
I'm not once, but twice, and one in the baptismal pool that makes people catch a cold.
I once believed it.
What now?
I went home to turn on the TV and just in time for Peter Jennings to announce the new millennium, and the whole world was celebrating the New Year.
I suddenly realized that no matter what I thought was strange, Jesus would come back to earth again and again, only because time zones were different everywhere.
It made me feel more uncomfortable in my heart, quite hurtful, really.
But that night, I didn't stop believing.
I just believe in another thing: "It's also possible to believe that it's treble
It's likely that the answers I know are all wrong, and it's likely that the question itself is wrong.
Now, the peaks of faith that once stood, there is a spring of water flowing all the way to the foot of the mountain, a clear spring of doubt, which is destined to become a big river.
All the dramatic stories of my life can be traced back to the night in the church, when my Savior did not come; something I am so sure of, if not called "lie," at least not a truth.
Although most of you are in a very different way of welcoming the millennium, I believe that you are here, because some of you have done the same thing as I, after the beginning of the new century, the death of my mother, the fact that my father ran away from home, and what my Savior did not come after it was.
I reached out my hands and searched for something I could believe.
When I got to Yale when I was 18 years old, I searched, and I believed that along the way from the small town of Texas, I had the opportunity to get rid of all the hardships and hardships I had gone through, from the broken dreams, the disabled bodies.
But when I returned home on a winter break, my head was pressed to the ground, his hands were tied behind my back, and the robber's pistol topped my head, and I knew that even the best education could save me.
When I went to Lehman Brothers for an internship in 2008, I also searched.
I called the family excitedly and said we would never be again poor.
But when I watched the financial sanctuary as it was in front of my eyes, I knew that even the best job could not save me.
When I went to Washington, D.C., to be a young reporter, I searched, and I heard a voice in Illinois: (referring to the Obama campaign speech) "It's been too long for the time to be Ambient" But it was in this election, and America is going to be transformative. "
But when parliamentary work stagnated completely, the country almost fell apart, and so-called hope and change turned into cruel cold jokes, I knew that even the new life of politics could not save me.
I knoted in front of the altar of the American dream, praying to the great people of my time, praying for success, asking for money, for power.
But every time, the midnight bell rang, and I opened my eyes and saw that all these myths had died.
From this grave, I began searching again, not because I was brave, but because I knew that if I had no faith, I would die.
So I went to another holy place to worship, Harvard Business School (AMBA), and this time I knew I couldn't simply accept the salvation given by the college.
No, I know I have more to do.
It all started in the dark corner of the crowded party, and it was the night of the brutal early winter in Massachusetts, and I asked a question from three friends, and some young people who really pursued had been asking for a long time: "How do we go out for a self-driving tour."
We don't know where to go, but we know we have to go.
Because we've crave everything we've been around for, as Jack Kerouac wrote: "Drift into the dark night and disappearing into the far-flung skyline."
So even if there is a voice of opposition that we take too much risk, there is nothing to gain, we still set off.
We traveled 13,000 kilometers across the United States in the summer of 2013, across the Cow Ranch of Montana, across the abandoned cities of Detroit, through the swamp wetlands of New Orleans, where we found people there, working for them, the little business they started, and the goals were the bottom line.
After studying at the "Capitalist West Point", we found that the idea was simply revolutionary.
The idea was spreading and eventually growing into a non-profit organization called "Master of Business Walking Across the United States, which is also the main reason I was able to stand on stage today.
It spreads because we have discovered a strong desire in our generation to achieve our goals and to achieve our goals and the value of our lives.
It spreads because we've found countless entrepreneurs in the corner of the U.S., who create jobs, change the lives of others, and they need a little help.
But to tell the truth, it can spread, because I am desperately trying to spread it.
There's nothing I'm not going to do, in order for more people to believe that we can heal the wounds of this broken country and rely on small businesses.
But it is this process of evangelism that leads me to a different gospel, and today I want to share it with you.
Probably starting one night a year ago, we attended an alumni dinner at the Harvard Business School at the Natural Science Museum in New York.
Under the full size of a whale, I sat side by side with the giants of this era, and they sang to their companions, and their great deeds.
The room was full of pride, and the total assets under the names of these people combined more than half a billion dollars.
We look down at all creatures and feel that it is good.
But that's how it happened, and two days later I went to the Harlem district of New York, and I was sitting on a city farm, where it was an abandoned parking lot, and it was a man named Tony to tell about some children, and they'll go there every day.
They are all below the poverty line.
Many people put all their belongings in their backpacks for fear of being stolen from others in the shelter.
Some came to Tony's farm, called "Harlem Growing Up", to get their only meal a day.
Tony told me that he started "Harlem growing up" on the basis that it was all his own pension, and he was a taxi driver for 20 years.
He said he didn't leave a penny on himself, because although the project was a success, the resources were extremely scarce.
He said that whatever help he could find, he would take it.
And I'm going to help him.
But as I left Tony, there was a tingle in my heart, tears stained with the corners of my eyes.
I felt the burden of inspiration, and one night I could sit in the room and talk to a hundred hundred people worth half a billion dollars about the good world, and yet two days later in another room, only 50 blocks away, a man without a salary, would provide the only meal a meal for the child every day.
But it's not this glaring social inequality that we cry, it's not these hungry, homeless children, not the anger of 1%, or pity for 99% of them.
No, I can't calm down in my heart because I finally realized that the country needs a radical change, and I'm just a small fix.
I realized that my story represented a group of people, and that people wanted them to be self-reliant, even if they were poor; that my organization represented was the basis of all the help, but never reached the Harlem, or the Appalachian Mountains and the Nine Districts of New Orleans; and that my cry represented a number of voices, those voices that soundless, untraceable, and incommodity.
And this sense of shame, this sense of shame washed me, like the feeling of shame sitting in front of the TV at that time, watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, again, again.
I was fooled, coaxed, confused,
But this time, the hypocritical savior is myself.
You know, I've come all the way from that altar, and that night I felt that the world was going to be destroyed, from a small town that used all kinds of dialects, that suffering was a gift from God to mankind, and as a creed, as an eternal truth.
Yes, my journey was so long that I peddled back to the point all the way.
Because we can't simply generalize that there is no faith in this day and age. No, we believe something as much as ever.
Some might believe the prophecies of Brylene Brown or Tony Robbins. We might believe in The New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review's Proverbs.
We may believe in the things we worship in the churches at TED, but we desperately want to believe, and we need faith.
We imitate the charismatic leaders' demeanor, who are committed to solving all human problems.
We feel that suffering is a gift from capitalism's "God" that we take scientific and technological development as a creed, as eternal truth.
But we never realized the humane price we paid, and we wouldn't question a brick because we were afraid that the whole building would collapse.
But if you are upset about these things we're accustomed to contrary to nature, the time to question it must come.
So the gospel I preach is not a breakthrough, innovation, or sustainable development.
I don ’ t even have a faith gospel to share with you.
I am the only one who doubts the gospel.
The gospel of questioning is not to let you stop believing, it asks you to believe something new: "It's also possible not to believe."
It is likely that the answers we know are wrong, and it is likely that the question itself is wrong.
Yes, the doubt of the gospel may mean that we exist, on this stage, in this room, all wrong.
Because it begs the question: "Why ."
We have so much power in our hands, why are there still people in the heat of the water?
This kind of questioning made me make a decision, and the organization I founded, "Master of Engineering and Management traveled all over the United States" to stop operating.
We've disbanded our employees, we've got the big doors, and we're going to open that model to everyone, as long as they feel they're capable of doing it, we don't have to go through our approval.
This kind of questioning forced me to remove the "savior" hat of others on my head, because our life is too short, the odds are too low, and we can't wait for the Second Coming, the fact is that there is no miracle in the world.
And this question, which drives me, it drives me, and it gives me hope, when the difficulties are about to crush us, when the path of fate seems to be about to lead us astray, when our Savior can't heal the trauma, not our blind faith, but we simply question, will sprinkle a little light in the darkness of our lives and the world.
Screams are also, or simply, and simply say, "There's a certain, there's another way."
Thanks.
The food crisis.
appearing in the daily news.
What is that?
Food is too scarce in some parts of the world, and in some places it is rich in food production.
In some places, genetically modified foods have saved the world.
Maybe genetically modified food is a problem?
Too much of a GM agricultural wastewater creates polluted marine, toxic seawater, and is so thinly nutritious.
This cycle continues.
I find that today's discussions are so unfluential.
How do we make such a discussion understand?
What is the apple food crisis?
I'm sure that in the last week you've eaten an apple.
How long do you think Apple has spent from picking to your hands?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months – This is the average time for apples sold in U.S. malls from picking to sale.
I think in Europe should be the same in the world.
We picked apples, refrigerated them, and entered oxygen into the freezer — in fact documented that there were workers trying to get into such an environment to get an apple, and then die because the air in the refrigerated depot in such an environment was toxic to people.
Why doesn't anyone know about this?
Why I don't know about this?
90% of the nutrients in apples — all the antioxidants in apples — are all lost when we bought it.
It's just a little candy.
Why don't we know the news? How can we improve this situation?
I think we lack a platform.
I know the platform -- I'm going to use computers, and I was working on the web when I was young.
I ’ ve done a lot of really weird things — on a platform like that.
But I met other people too, and I was able to express my thoughts.
What do you think about food?
If we had a platform, we might find that the problem was very favorable "if you'd have ✔
I want to ask: What if the climate is democratic?
This is a global map of the global climate.
The most efficient agricultural production areas are green and the worst is red.
They will change, and California farmers are now turning into Mexican farmers.
China has access to land in Brazil in order to grow better food, and we are all slaves to the environment.
What if every country has its own climate of production?
How will that change our lives?
How will that change the quality of our lives and nutrition?
The problem we had in previous generations was that we needed more food and were inexpensive.
Welcome to the World Farm.
We built a huge mock farm.
These lines are trajectories — cars, planes, trains and cars.
Being able to provide enough food to seven billion people is a miracle, where very few people are involved in the food-making process.
But if...
Are we building a digital farm?
Digital World Farms.
If you can take this apple, in a way, digitize it, transmit it through the prime points in the air, and then reorganize the mass point on the other side?
What if?
Take a look at these quotes, and you know, they encourage me to do so.
The first is that there are no young people in Japanese agriculture, no water, no land, and no future. This is the day I arrived in Sanluchi, that is, Fukushima and then south, after the accident at the nuclear power plant.
The children all went to Sendai and Tokyo, where the land was contaminated by nuclear power plant accidents, and their food imports amounted to 70%.
This is not a unique phenomenon in Japan.
Only two percent of Americans are working in agriculture-related jobs.
What answers do 2% of people in agriculture bring us?
We look at other parts of the world where 50% of the African population is under the age of 18.
Eighty percent of them are reluctant to be farmers.
Agriculture is too hard.
Small farmers are too hard to live.
They choose to go to the city.
In India: Farmers' families do not have access to the most basic agricultural appliances, and the number of farmers who commit suicide is more than the number of the last decade.
It's so sad to talk about that.
Where do they go?
to the city.
Without young people, young people all go to the city.
What kind of platform should we build to encourage young people?
Please see this new tractor.
This is my combine harvester.
A few years ago, I went to the home chain to start looking for tools.
I ’ ve made stupid things I ’ ve made plants dance to connect them to my computer and then I destroyed them — a lot.
I eventually let them survive.
I created the most intimate relationship in my life because I learned the language of plants the most.
I want them to grow bigger.
They said, "Child, give all the best!
This is an electronic studio that no one uses.
What can you do? .
Along with our team members, we built a farm in the Media Lab, a place that used to be thought of as being related to electronic life, rather than biologically related.
In this 60m2 space, we made enough rations for about 300 people for one month - not too much.
There's a lot of interesting technology here.
And the most interesting thing?
Beautiful, white rhizomes, dark green plants harvested once a month.
Is this a new restaurant?
Is this a new sales experience?
Is this a new store?
What I can be sure of is this is the first time any plant can be uprooted in a media lab.
We put the salad in the bag; there's nothing wrong with that.
But what happens when you have an image processing specialist, a data scientist, a robotics expert, uprooting plants and then thinking, "Well, I know about it -- I can make the plan happen, I want to try."
Throughout the process we'll take the plants out and take some back to the lab, if you're growing it yourself, we won't throw it away; because it's precious to you.
I have this strange tongue now, because I don't want anyone to eat them before I was, and I hope it's delicious.
I eat lettuce every day I can know that the pH of lettuce is less than 1
I'm like it now, "No, that's 6.1 -- not not today you can't eat it."
(Applause) This lettuce was very sweet on that day.
That's because lettuce feels a lot of pressure, it's autologous to produce a chemical reaction to protect itself: "I don't want to die rew up.
The plant doesn't want to die the taste of a sweet taste.
Scientists are back in studying plant physiology.
I think everyone can try to get involved.
We look forward to seeing everyone's creations, so we've conceived a lab that can be shipped to somewhere else.
Make that idea.
The front of this media experimental building is my laboratory, with 30 sensing points for each plant.
If you know the genome or genetics, this is the phenotype, right?
The phenomenon of the phenotypes.
When you say, “I like the Mexican-made Strawberry ’ Brienum, you really like the strawberries that are produced in that climate. ”
You can encode this climate — how much carbon dioxide, how much oxygen creates recipes — you can program to control the presentation status, and nutrient content of plants, plant size, shape, color and texture.
We need data, so we put a lot of sensors to give us data.
You can think back to the plants in the house, and you look at the plants in the house is sad because you think "Why are you dead? Will you talk to me ."
Farmers have the most beautiful eyes to predict the future, when they are at the age of sixty or seventy,
They can tell you that plant dies because the soil is nitrogen deficient, calcium, or it needs a more wetter air environment.
These beautiful eyes will not be passed on.
These are the eyes of the farmer.
We will continue to collect data.
We combine these data points with individual plants.
These were the IP address data for all broccoli in my lab that day.
We have broccoli that can be traced to the IP address.
(Applause) If that's not weird enough, you can click here to see the plant profile.
This shows you the downloadable growth process of the plant, not as you think, not just notify you when it is edible.
When does its nutrients reach my needs?
When does it taste in line with my expectations?
Is there too much water?
Is it too long to be sunny?
It will be prompt.
It is capable of dialogue with me, can communicate, we can speak in language.
(Applause) I think, that's the first plant Facebook user, right?
At that time, the plant's archival plants would start making friends.
I mean really -- plants will start making friends with plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium.
We ’ ll begin to understand the complex things that can only be guessed now.
They may not be friendly with us — I don ’ t know, maybe they ’ ll be good with us, depending on what we do.
This is my current laboratory.
It's a bit more systematic, and my background is to design the hospital's data center, and I know how to create a controlled environment.
So -- in this environment, we experimented with all sorts of things.
This program, the air-planting method, was developed by NASA for the Mill Space Station, capable of reducing the amount of water they needed to be transmitted to space.
What this procedure does is to provide the plants with exactly what they want. Water, minerals and oxygen.
The roots are not so complicated, and when you deliver it, you can see the startling effect.
Plants have two hearts.
Because there are two hearts, it is showing a high growth of 4-5 times.
It is a perfect world.
We've gone through a long period of technological development in search of a different world we will continue to do so, but we will also have new tools that will be the perfect world.
We grow all sorts of things.
These tomatoes have not been commercially available for production over the past 150 years.
Did you know we're rare, old seed banks?
The Seed Bank.
It's so great.
They have living germplasms that you haven't eaten.
I was the only one in this room who had eaten this tomato.
The problem is that it's the sauce tomato we don't know how to cook, so it doesn't seem to be delicious toy.
But we've grown all kinds of protein-containing things.
We've grown humans -- maybe you can, but we can't.
We realized that the tools were too big and too expensive.
I started to place them around the world worth about a hundred thousand dollars.
It's not easy to find someone who can dominate $100,000 at will, so we want to make small tools.
This is actually my student project – an undergraduate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Camille
Camille and I, and my team, we spent the whole summer break repeating the trial, how to make it cheaper, how to work better, and how to make others also learn to operate.
Then we sent these tools to the school to the children in grades 11.
If you want to be humble, try to teach your children what to do.
I went to this school and said, "Set its humidity at 65%"
A 7th grader asks, "What Humidity"
So I said, "Oh, it's water in the air."
He said, "There's no water in the air, you idiot."
So I said, "Well, don't believe me.
In fact, don't believe me, right?
Set it to 100.
He set the humidity to 100, what happened?
Start condensing, producing fog, and eventually starting to dripping water.
Then he said, "Oh, the humidity is rain."
Why didn ’ t you tell me that before? .
The interface we created looked like a game.
They have a 3D environment that can log in around the world from a mobile phone, computer.
There are different parts of the program - physical adjustment, sensor.
They chose the recipes that children in other parts of the world have created.
They choose and activate recipes and plant seeds.
When the seeds grow, children can make changes.
They said, "Why do plants need carbon dioxide? CO2 is not bad stuff?"
It can be suffocating. ”
Increase the supply of carbon dioxide, plants are dead.
Reduce the amount of carbon dioxide, the plants live well.
Harvest plants, you create new electronic recipes.
This is a process of repeated design and development and exploration.
They can download all the data of the new plants they've developed, or what the new electronic recipe does it do - better or worse?
Imagine these are a core element of processing.
We can learn a lot of things.
It's a computer we call food, put it in a school for three weeks.
It's three weeks of planting.
What ’ s more, for the first time, the child thinks he ’ s able to be a farmer — or, he wants to be a farmer.
So we're going to make those resources public.
Put it all online; go home and try to build your first food computer.
It would be hard — I would tell you that.
We're in the early stages, but the resources are all there.
It's very important for me to make these easy to get.
We will continue to do so too.
These are farmers, electronics engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, botanists, economists, urban planners.
On a platform, do what they are good at.
The team became too big.
This is my new experimental equipment that is starting to work.
This warehouse can be built anywhere.
That's why I chose it.
We ’ re going to build such a shelf in this warehouse.
You can see it now.
Look at this,
It also exists.
One grows green vegetables, one grows Ebola virus vaccines.
What's great is that plants and this U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency winning project is why we've been effective in studying Ebola virus.
These plants are producing proteins that fight Ebola.
So drugs and health products, and then lettuce cultivation.
But the two things look completely different, and that's the part of me in my own field.
But many things are not as imagined.
We're still in the "we're right" at this stage like, "This is my little black box --" "No, buy me."
“No, no, no – my intellectual property is absolutely valuable.
Don't buy this, buy me. "
In fact, we are just at the beginning, and at this time, society is also changing.
When we want more and cheaper food, we need better, environmentally friendly food now.
But you see McDonald ’ s ads advertising the ingredients of the Macle Chicken, the most mysterious food in human history — the McDonald ’ s market advertising plan — is changing — and everything is changing.
Now look at the world today.
Personal food computers, food servers, food data centers, operate in open phenotype groups.
It's like the public genome, but we're going to bring up the little climate recipes, like Wikipedia, you can overturn, start, and grow.
How does that look like?
Do you remember the world being connected by a rope?
It started to appear bacon.
We started sending messages about food, not distributing food.
It's not just my fantasy, it's something we're already working on.
Food computers, food servers, and soon have a food data center, connecting people together to share information.
The future of food is not its wrong fight.
We all know the wrong there.
The food of the future is about connecting the next generation of one billion farmers, and empowering them with a question-and-answer platform, "If ✔
Thanks.
Sometimes I feel very ashamed as a European.
It's very sad that more than a million people have reached Europe last year need our help and our response is frankly sad.
There's too much contradiction here.
We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old boy Alan Cody, but since then, more than two hundred children drowned in the Mediterranean.
We have international conventions that recognize the responsibility of hosting refugees as a shared responsibility of nations, but we accept the small size of Lebanon receiving more Syrians than in Europe as a whole.
We denounce the existence of people smuggling, yet we make it the only viable way to seek asylum in Europe.
We are in short labor, but we are preventing people who can meet our economic and people's building needs from entering Europe.
We claim that our liberal values are contrary to what Islamic fundamentalists are pursuing — but we use a policy of high-handedness to detain child asylum seekers from their families for forcibly confiscating refugee property.
What we are doing
How the situation has developed to this extent, we are responding to a humanitarian crisis in an inhumane way.
I don't believe it because people don't care, at least I don't want to believe it.
I think this is because our politicians lack the foresight to adapt to what was proposed fifty years ago to deal with a changing and globalisation.
The international refugee system, so what I want to do is take a step back and ask two very basic questions, which we all have to understand.
First of all, why do the existing system not work?
Second, how do we solve it.
The modern refugee system was developed after World War II by these people.
It was originally intended to ensure that when a country collapses or worse regimes are hostile to the people of that country, people can have a place to go there to live in safety and dignity until they can return to their hometowns.
It's exactly the same as what we're seeing in Syria today.
Through the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, a 1951-denominated international organization, signed by 147 governments, and a commitment by an international organization UNHCR to allow other countries to enter each other's territory to flee war and strife and persecution between member states
But now the system is collapsing.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum
Our immigration policy in reality stands for this path to security.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek equal treatment or to choose to return to their home country.
But in practice, they are trapped in a state of almost indefinite stagnation.
In theory, refugee issues are the responsibility of all countries.
The actual geographical location means that countries near the conflict are overloaded in receiving the vast majority of refugees.
The provisions of the original refugee system are not the cause of its collapse.
And we're not going to use enough of the world, and that's something we need to reconsider.
So I want to explain to you how the system works today.
How the current refugee reception system works
But it's not from the top-down macro perspective, but from the perspective of individual refugees.
Imagine a Syrian woman.
We call her Amira for a short time.
Amira represents the many refugees I met in the region.
Amira, like about a quarter of the world's refugees, is a woman with her children who can't get home, because her city, where you're seeing now, the city of Homs, which is now devastated.
Amira couldn't go back.
Amira also didn ’ t want to settle in a third country because it ’ s like less than one percent of the world ’ s refugees.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible option
They have three basic options.
The first is that Amira could take her family to the refugee camp.
She may be helped in the refugee camp but the prospects for Amira and her family are very slim
The camp is located in a desolate and barren place, usually in the desert.
In Jordan's Zatalina private, you can hear shells across the Syrian border at night
Economic activity there is limited.
The quality of education is usually low.
And about eighty percent of refugees in refugee camps around the world have to stay there for at least five years.
It's a tragic place and it might also explain why only nine percent of Syrians in reality have chosen this option
Or Amira can travel to a city in a neighboring city area, such as Amman or Beirut.
Seventy-five percent of Syrian refugees choose this option
But even there is difficult.
Refugees in cities usually do not have the right to work
They usually don't have access to aid.
So when Amira and her family had their basic savings, they had little more to face poverty.
There is also a third option chosen by a growing number of Syrians.
Amira could seek hope for her family on a dangerous journey that could bury life to another country, which is what we see in Europe today.
Globally, we leave refugees with an almost impossible option in the three options for urban poverty and dangerous journeys in refugee camps
For refugees, this choice is the global refugee system today.
But I think it's the wrong choice.
I think we can reconsider this option.
We ’ ve limited these options because we think that these are the only options that refugees can get.
Politicians have shaped it into a problem of loss if refugees benefit, and citizens need to take the loss.
We seem to agree with an assumption that refugees are inevitably burdened and spent on society.
But this is not a formula for refugees to contribute.
So what I want to show is that we have a way to add that option and still benefit everyone: including the receiving countries and communities of our society and the refugees themselves.
I'd like to come up with four ways to change our established ideas about refugees
These four ways have one thing in common, we have taken advantage of globalization, social mobility, and market opportunities to update our understanding of refugee issues.
The first thing I think about is the creation of the environment, which comes from a basic understanding that refugees, like everyone else, are just in a particular environment.
My colleagues at the University of Oxford and I started a research project in Uganda to study the economic life of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it is typical of the receiving country.
It is an exception.
Unlike most of the world ’ s host countries, Uganda has done something to give refugees economic opportunities.
Give them the right to work and give them freedom of movement
The result of this is striking, both for refugees and receiving countries.
In Ugandan capital Kampala, we found that twenty-one percent of refugees started companies to run their own business and employing forty percent of others' employees were nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees are creating jobs for citizens of the host country.
Even in refugee camps, we have found examples of dynamic, thriving start-ups.
For example, in a refugee camp known as Nakival, we found Congolese refugees to run a business of trading digital music
We found the business of Rwandan refugees so that young people can play computer games on recycling rigs and displays
Breaking through extreme constraints Refugees are facing you in the face of a Congolese named Damon-Kay.
He arrived in the refugee camp when he was a long-lost moment, but he wanted to be a filmmaker.
So with friends and colleagues he started a community radio station and he rented a camera he was now making movies.
He has filmed two documentaries and our team has a successful career for our team and he started with little resources.
It is precisely this example that should lead our response to refugees.
Rather than thinking that refugees are inevitably dependent on humanitarian aid, we need to give them the opportunity to achieve human prosperity.
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food in the emergency stage are very important, but we have to have to think long-term.
We need to provide network connectivity, electricity education, right to work and business channels
All the pathways we take for granted to the global economy can and should be provided to refugees
The second idea I want to discuss is the Economic Zone.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have adopted Ugandan policies.
Most of the host country's economies are not open to refugees, but we still have a practical alternative.
Last April I traveled to Jordan to Jordan with my colleague Paul Kyria, a development economist, and we were there to discuss an idea with the international community and the local government, which is to bring jobs to Syrians and push Jordan's national development strategy.
The idea is to create an economic zone in an economic zone where we can combine the employment of refugees with the national employment of the host country Jordan.
A 15-minute drive away from the Zatali refugee camp is a current economic zone known as King Hussein's Development Zone.
The government has invested more than $1100 million to connect the transmission grid and the road, but there are two things that are still missing from labor and foreign investment.
So what if refugees can work there instead of being trapped in refugee camps to afford home and develop skills through vocational training before they return to Syria?
We recognize that doing so would benefit Jordan's national development strategy, which calls for upgrading manufacturing as a middle-income country
Doing so to benefit refugees also helps Syria's post-war reconstruction by recognizing that we need to nurture refugees as the best resource for the eventual reconstruction of Syria.
We published this view in the journal Foreign Affairs.
Jordan's King Abdullah also adopted the idea.
Two weeks ago, at the London-Syria Conference, the pilot project would be implemented this summer.
The third idea I want to show is a matching of preferences between countries and refugees in order to reach this satisfaction final in this selfie photo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
We rarely ask refugees what they want or they want to go there, but I advocate that they can do it and benefit everyone.
Economist Evan Ross created the concept of a pairing market, which is that the order of preferences between the two sides determines the final match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Eric Statboe study how to apply this concept to solve refugee problems They ask refugees to sort their preferred countries, but at the same time allowing countries to sort the types of refugees they want to receive based on skills or language.
Of course, you need to build quotas in terms of diversity and vulnerability, but it's a way to increase the likelihood of pairing.
This concept of pairing has been successfully applied, for example, in pairing students and universities with kidney donors and patients who also highlight the importance of the rules of computing in dating sites.
So why shouldn't it be used to give refugees a better choice?
The same thing that can be applied to the national level at the national level, the biggest problem we face is to persuade local communities to take in refugees.
At present, it is completely unreasonable for us to send engineers to remote areas and send farmers to cities.
So matching markets provide a potential way to match these preferences and reflect the needs and requirements of the receiving countries and refugees.
My fourth thought is a humanitarian visa.
Most of the tragedies and chaos we see in Europe are completely avoidable.
This stems from a fundamental contradiction of European asylum policy as follows: in order to seek refuge in Europe you must reach Europe for a dangerous journey that I have described before I have described.
In an era of low-cost airlines and consulates?
These are completely unnecessary journeys last year, which led to more than three thousand deaths on European borders and within Europe.
If refugees can be able to travel directly to Europe and seek asylum, we can avoid these deaths, which can indeed achieve humanitarian visas, which allows people to get a visa at embassies or consulates in neighboring countries and then pay for themselves by cruise or plane to Europe.
It costs about a thousand euros to take a stowatzer from Turkey to the Greek islands
It only takes two hundred euros to take a budget flight from Bodrum in Turkey to the German city of Frankfurt
If we allow them to do so, it will bring great results.
It would save lives to root out the markets for illegal stowaways, eliminating the chaos we see on the edge of Europe, like the Greek Islands.
The reason to prevent us from implementing this program is political rather than rational solutions.
And that's an idea that has been applied.
Brazil first adopted this policy of more than 2,000 Syrians who have been granted humanitarian visas to enter Brazil and have been granted refugee status when they enter the country.
In that plan, every Syrian was granted refugee status and confirmed that it was a real refugee.
There is also a historical precedent.
These Nansen passports as entry-exit documents allow 450,000 Asahi people, Turks and Chechens to cross Europe and apply for refugee status elsewhere in Europe
UNHCR is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for this workable response
So all four ideas I show you are the way we can add amirial options
Let refugees have a better choice, not limited to three basic, impossible options, as I said before, and still benefit everyone.
In general, we need a whole new perspective to increase the choice of refugees, while recognizing that they are not necessarily a social burden.
The cost of refugees is not a formula.
It is true that refugees are our humanitarian responsibility, but they are also the ability to contribute to society by humans with skills, talents and aspirations – if we allow them.
Migration in a new world does not disappear.
What we're seeing in Europe will have been around for many years.
People will continue to migrate and leave people away, and we need to find a rational way to manage it — not based on the logic of charity, not on the logic of charity, but on the opportunities that globalization, markets, and mobility can come.
I hope everyone realizes this and I implore our government officials to meet this challenge.
Thank you all.
As a child, I always fancied the ocean.
It is colorful and vibrant, and there are many animals that look like alien creatures.
I imagined the big shark at the top of the food chain and fantasizing about the sea turtles dancing gracefully among the reefs.
As a photographer who transitioned from marine biologists, I spent most of my career looking for places that had appeared in my childhood fantasies.
As you can see, I've been on a natural adventure since I was so young.
But the first time I really dived into the water, it happened when I was 10 years old.
I can still remember it very clearly now that I was paddling hard for a cannon that was rusty enough to lie on the reef.
Finally, I succeeded enough to the cannon, looked up and found myself surrounded by fish, fish of all colors, like a rainbow.
From that day on, I fell deeply in love with the ocean.
(Subtitle: Thomas Pescuck) (Subtitled: Environmental Photographer) Over the past 40 years, I have had the privilege of exploring the most wonderful oceanscapes on Earth, working on National Geographic and Save Ours Foundation.
My subjects are large to giant sharks, so small that can be moved upstream in your palms.
In the cold sea next to the Canadian bear rainforest, I've met a humpback whale that's around me, and the fishy smell makes me forget.
In the Mozambican Strait, I saw the courtship ritual of the green turtles.
Each of us affects the oceans, and they will be affected by the oceans.
The pure ocean I dreamed of as a child is now more and more difficult to find.
Their scope is shrinking and the threat is increasing.
We humans have always occupied the top of the food chain on Earth, and I have seen and recorded these behaviors with the camera.
For a long time, I thought only shocking photos could alert my audience.
Of course, this perception is also good, and that is to get me back to the origin.
I believe the best way to bring about change is to spread love.
I feel like a bridge between man and animal, and as a photographer, I have a rare opportunity to demystify animals and ecosystems hidden deep in the ocean.
If you don't know that something exists, how can you love it and protect it.
And that's precisely the strength of our environmental photographer.
I've been to hundreds of different seas, but there are only a few of the sights that really make me unforgettable.
The first time I was blown away by such scenes was almost a decade ago, on the rugged and steep coast of South Africa.
Every June and July, countless sardines migrate north, which we call "saldines rambles
Believe me, these fish have to do that.
Because there are flocks of hungry and agile hunters chasing behind.
For example, the collective hunted dolphins, they separate a portion of the sardines from the fish and gather them into balls.
The dolphins will rush these sardines to the place closer to the sea and rush into the fish to eat and enjoy this moving feast.
It was followed by sharks.
Most would have thought that sharks and dolphins were natural enemies, but in the "saldex tide," they would co-exist.
Actually, with the help of dolphins, the sharks ate more chillily.
Without dolphins to drive, sardines are hard to get together into bulbs, and sharks often cross out of the middle of the fish, like passing through a doughnut and sometimes only a belly water.
I had a couple of close encounters with the shark group in the "saldine tide" and I understood that sharks did not look me in the eye.
But I was still constantly bumped and swept by the tail, like the other guests on this raucous feast.
We sail east from the African coastline, through the vast Indian Ocean, to the Maldives's archipelagos of coral reefs.
During the stormy southwest monsoon season, devilish fish living in the archipelago's waters gather near a small island called Hani Farou on Baaly Atoll.
The hordes of shrimp crabs, mostly smaller than our pupils, are the main food for devilfish.
When these planktons are more scattered, devilfish generally prey alone, and they tumble backwards in the water, like the puppies chasing their own tails.
And when plankton gathers more and more, the devil fish begins to be connected to the end, the platoon grew up in the feeding formation, and the delicacy of the dead-headed devil's fish leaks will be swallowed clean by the closer companions.
As the more plankton in the bay gathers, the formation of devilfish is also clustered, and this unique predation method, which we call "cyclonic predation"
The devilfish cascading, lined up in tight-knit formations, forming a swirl, sucking up the plankton and sending it straight into the devil's fish's mouth.
Diving in the midst of hundreds of devilfish, that scene has made me unforgettable.
When I first went to Hanifar to take a photo, it wasn't protected there and the ecological environment was threatened by local development.
By working with NGOs like the Devil's Fish Trust, my photos eventually helped Hani Farou become a marine protected area.
Fishermen on nearby islands, who once hunted many devilfish and used their skins to make traditional drums.
And now they are the most determined protector of the devilfish, and devilfish brings more than $8m in income to the Maldives every year.
I've always wanted to go back to the past, to the time when most of the maps are still blank, or marked "There's a Dragon here."
By now, the most similar thing I've ever been to is some of the remote atolls located in the western Indian Ocean.
There's a distance of it from the fishing grounds and fishing boats, where diving always makes me feel sad, because it reminds me of what the ocean once looked like.
Few people have heard of the Indian Reef, which is a very small coral atoll located in the Mozambique Strait.
Its outer reefs form the reef in the middle of the protective barrier to form a lag lake that became the kindergarten of the Galapagos shark.
These sharks are never shy, even during the day.
I guess they'll be more lively at night and more in numbers.
I've never seen so many sharks in a coral lag lake before.
Recording and sharing such moments as the Hour reminds me of the original intention of choosing this path.
Earlier this year, to complete the filming of the National Geographic magazine contract, I came to the California Peninsula.
In the middle of the peninsula, on the side of the Pacific Ocean, sits the San Ignacio lag lake, which is an important breeding ground for gray whales.
Over the past hundred years, this stretch of coastline has been a huge slaughterhouse where more than twenty million gray whales have been killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
And now, the descendants of these gray whales push their own cubs into the sea, play and even interact with us.
This species has surprisingly recovered.
On the other side of the peninsula is the Cape Purmo, a quiet little fishing village.
Decades of overfishing once brought the village to the brink of bankruptcy.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded the government to classify the sea as a marine protected area.
Everything that happened next is a miracle.
In 2005, after just 10 years of protection, scientists found that the number of local fish stocks was restored with a record amount.
See it, come with me.
Take a deep breath, dive to the bottom of the ocean with me and see what the largest and dense fish I've ever met is like.
We all have the ability to create hope.
I want to pass on a message through my own photos that it's not too late to save the ocean from now on.
I'm particularly interested in the resilience that nature has, when it's facing 73 billion humans.
I hope that in the coming time, it will be more and more difficult for me to take such photos, but rather more to reflect the harmony between people and the sea.
I wish I could take pictures like this every day.
To name a name in our line, you must be an incorrigible optimist.
I always had a hypothesis like taking pictures, and the next great picture that could bring about change was waiting for me in front, maybe just behind the next coral reef, in the next lag lake, or else, it's next.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, the issue of social justice was at the heart of Zimbabwe's national health policy
Immediately after the new government got rid of the long-running war of independence, it unveiled a socialist policy: making health care services and primary education a basic free project
A large-scale rural health service centre makes it possible for 80 per cent of the population to be within a two-hour walk, which is a truly remarkable advance.
Regular immunisation of 25 percent of children in Zimbabwe's Independence Year 1980
By 1990, after only a decade, this percentage rose to 80%
I am very honored to be involved in this transformation, in this revolution.
Excitement and fraternity are very real.
Working side-by-side with the bastion of Zimbabwean people, scientists, doctors, activists I feel involved not only as an African independence movement but also a progressive global public health movement
I ’ ve also faced some cringeable difficulties.
In 1985, the year I arrived, Zimbabwe reported the first case of AIDS.
I took care of a few people with AIDS in the early 1980s when I was trained in medicine at Harlem Hospital, but... we couldn ’ t imagine what we would encounter in Africa.
When I was there, the infection rate was about 2%.
That percentage has grown rapidly when I left Harare 17 years later with one in four adults.
By the mid-1990s, I told hundreds of energetic young people who had tested positive for HIV.
I have seen my colleagues and friends die as a result of my students and hospital patients.
Faced with this situation, I started a clinic with my colleagues.
We show how to use condoms
We conduct publicity in school education and workplaces
We conduct research on how we provide advice to HIV-infected couples on how to protect themselves.
We're trying very hard to do all this, I'm sure I was doing my best at that time.
I provided the best treatment, at least under the conditions of the time.
But I didn't make a constructive change.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has confessed that his personal mistake led to the Rwandan massacre.
In 1994, he was the head of the UN peacekeeping department
At the Holocaust Ten Commemoration Ceremony, he recalled that I believed I had done everything I could, but after the massacre I realized that there was still a lot that I could do and should have sounded the alarm bells to seek support.
The outbreak of AIDS has caught medical groups off guarding the World Health Organization, estimating that today, thirty-nine million people have died from this disease, and many people feel regret and regret as much as I have not been able to stop it sooner.
But when I lived in Zimbabwe, I didn't realize I was an advocate or a politician.
I thought it was because my medical knowledge went there before my medical knowledge because of my clinical and infectious disease research.
I've always felt that my job is to care for patients through research to better understand the demographic characteristics of contagion, and I hope it can slow the spread of the virus.
I realized that the proportion of people on the periphery of society who have contracted and died from AIDS is surprisingly high.
In sugar plantation, 60% of pregnant women who test positive for HIV in places like modern enterprises are more approximating to feudal territory.
My job is to show people that being infected is not a moral degenerate, but related to male human rights awareness with forced foreign labor and colonialism.
Most of the whites are safe.
Regrettable powerlessness as a medical expert Our means: plead with people to change their personal behavior to use condoms and reduce the number of partners
The infection rate is still rising as our most effective weapon against the virus when the treatment is already feasible in the West when it is already feasible for the entire African public sector, treatment is unaffordable.
I'm not bold enough to say that inequality in access to life-saving drugs, or the problems in the underlying economic and political system, are the driving forces that have led to high levels of infection among such large populations.
I made excuses for my silence to remind myself that I was just a visitor to this country to sound the alarm bells that could be deported to get me unable to do a good job of caring for my patients to do the much-needed research.
So I didn't say boldly about the government's early AIDS policy.
I express my concerns not loud enough.
Many doctors, health workers may think I did not do anything wrong
Our commitment to patients is as if the Hippocrates Oath and its different versions are sacrosanct.
I did everything I could with every patient.
But I know that the infectious diseases that accompany the division of our society reflect not only biological phenomena, but more important is the phenomenon of marginalization, non-inclusion, racial discrimination, sexism, class discrimination.
This is the case for AIDS
For the recent Ebola
Medical anthropologists, such as Paul Famar in Haiti, who work on AIDS in Haiti call structural sexual violence: structurally, because political and economic organizations rooted in our social environment are often ignored by the privileges and the political class of power; violence because its effects, such as early death, suffering, disease, violence
We do little for our patients if we don't realize these social injustices.
Calling the alarm is the first step in guiding public health care in the right direction, and it's the way we're looking for support, to break through together and create a way to make a real change
So now, I'm not silent.
I ’ m bold about a lot of things, although it makes the listener uncomfortable, though I feel uncomfortable.
A lot of it, a lot of it is about segregation and organized racism, that things that shouldn't happen in this country should not be in medical practice or in public health care.
But they do have the price of shortening our lives for this.
This is why we are a constant organized role in the United States against racism affecting health care, and the inter-personality violence against people of color is closely related to our tragic history of the 60-year imperfect equality of the slave system in the 90s, which sounded the alarm for me as the chief of the New York City health commissioner.
In New York City, the premature death rate, i.e. passed away before the age of 65, and the blacks were 50% higher than the whites
In 2012, black women faced more than 10 times the risk of childbearing-related death compared to white women
Although we have made great progress in reducing infant mortality, the first year of black babies after birth is still nearly three times that of white babies.
New York City is not a special case.
These statistics are similar throughout the United States.
A recent New York Times analysis reports about about 15 million missing black men across the country
The authors point out that at least one in six black men between the ages of 25 and 54 disappears from their daily lives or because of prison, or died prematurely.
Young blacks face disproportionate violence on a daily basis, which is very unfair, and these all exist in the recent protests that held up the slogan "Black Lives Matter"
But we need to remember the current situation and outcomes in general medical care, as well as the persistent and very high rates of disease, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, diseases that slowly and quietly devour life, that allow more black lives to fade prematurely.
As the "Black Lives Matter" campaign unfolded I felt frustrated and sulked medical groups in research and at work, even the use of the word "racism" was hesitant.
Every time I say it, you probably feel something
Medical students, dressed in white robes, protested against biochemical weapons, but medical groups face the impact of persistent racial discrimination on disease status and mortality to a large extent.
I'm worried that the trend toward personalized and accurate drugs to find biological and genetically targeted organisms and genetic goals to better design therapy may inadvertently make us inadvertently make us look at the big picture, and this is the scene of daily life, growth, work, and love where the health is important to affect the health of the group, for many of us, the health is bad health for many of us.
In daily life, as a health worker in the clinic or in research, we are witnesses of great injustice: the homeless, unable to follow the doctor's orders, because he prioritizes more urgent things; young transgender people, planning suicide, because our society is so ruthless; single mothers are forced to feel responsible for the health of her children.
As health care workers, our role is not just to treat our patients, but also to sound the alarm for change.
And whether it's reasonable or not, our job makes our voices more credible and we shouldn't waste it.
I regret my failure to speak candidly in Zimbabwe and regret that I have promised myself to be the New York City Health Commissioner I will use all the opportunities I have to sound the alarm to seek support for health equality.
I will speak out against racial discrimination and I hope you can join me and I will join you, when you are on sexism, or any kind of inequality, when you are out of opposition.
It's time for us to rise up against a common sense of outright rhetoric about structural inequality
To advocate for change, we don't need to have all the answers
We just need courage.
Our health of our patients depends on our own health.
OK, I want you to raise your hand to show how many people have blacked out friends on Facebook because they've made inappropriate remarks about politics, religion, children's rights, or food?
How many people at least have someone who doesn't want to see because you just don't want to talk to each other?
Know that in the past want a polite conversation, we just have to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady: just talk about the weather and your health.
But these years with climate change and the campaign against vaccines are not very useful.
So in the world we live in, this every conversation has the potential to develop into a world of debate, where politicians can't talk to each other, and even for those things that have people's rousing for approval or opposition, which is too abnormal.
The Pew Research Center conducted a survey of ten thousand American adults and found that at this moment our polarized position, to a higher degree, than at any time in history, is higher.
We're less inclined to compromise, which means we're not listening to each other.
The various decisions we make, choose where to live, and who we marry or even make friends with, are based only on the beliefs we already have.
Repeating it, it shows that we didn't listen to each other.
Talking requires a balanced talk and listening, and somehow we gradually lose that balance.
Technological progress is partly responsible.
For example, smart phones, right now in your hands, or right next to you, you can get it.
About a third of U.S. teens send more than a hundred text messages a day, according to Pew's research.
And a lot of people in the middle, almost everyone, are more inclined to text friends than talk to face-to-face.
The Atlantic magazine published a great article.
The writer is a high school teacher, Paul Baunderwell.
He has a communication task for his students,
I hope to teach them how to use notes to give a speech on a topic.
And then he said, "I'm starting to realize that
"I started to realise that communication skills were probably the most overlooked by us, without the skills to be taught well.
Children spend hours a day reaching out to creatives and other partners through screens, but rarely have the opportunity to discover their interpersonal skills. ”
It sounds funny, but we have to ask ourselves: in the 21st century, what skills are more important than maintaining a coherent, confident conversation.
Now, my profession is to talk to others. Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, governors, plumbers.
I talk to people I like and people I don't like.
I talk to people who are very unidentified on a personal level.
I still have a good relationship with them.
So I'd like to use the next 10 minutes to teach you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you have heard numerous suggestions, such as looking into each other's eyes, thinking in advance that you can discuss interesting topics, look, and smile to show your focus, repeat what you just heard, or sum up.
I want you to forget all of this,
It's all useless.
There's no need to learn how to show you're focused, if you're really focused.
I actually used the same skills as a professional interviewer in my daily life.
Well, I'm going to teach you how to interview others, which will actually help you learn how to be a better communicator.
Learn to start a conversation, not waste time, not bored, and, most importantly, not offend anyone.
We all had great conversations.
We've all had it. We know what it feels like.
The kind of conversation that makes you feel happy and inspiring after the end, or make you feel like you've built a real connection with someone else, or that you're fully understood.
There ’ s no reason to say that most of your human interactions can ’ t be that way.
I have 10 basic rules. I'll explain it to you in a line, but really, if you choose one and master it, you'll already be able to get a more pleasant conversation.
The first is: Don't have three thoughts.
I'm not saying just put down your phone, tablet, car keys, or whatever's in your hand.
I mean, in the moment.
Go into that situation.
Don ’ t think about your previous argument with your boss.
Don't think about what you're eating for dinner.
If you want to quit talking, quit talking. But don't be in Cao Yingxin in Han.
Article II: Don't be good for a teacher.
If you want to express your opinion and don't want to leave any opportunity to get people to respond, argue, rebut, or explain, blog.
There ’ s a good reason to explain why there ’ s no “expert preaching ” in my conversation: because it ’ s really boring.
If the other side is a conservative, it must hate Obama, food stamps and abortion.
If the other side were liberal, it would have hated big banks, oil companies, and Dick Cheney.
It is entirely predictable.
You certainly don't want that.
You need to assume that you can learn something every time you enter.
M. Scott Peck, a famous therapist, has said that true listening needs to put yourself aside.
Sometimes that means putting your personal views aside.
He said that feeling this acceptance, and the speaker becomes increasingly vulnerable and sensitive, so it becomes more and more likely that it is possible to open up his inner world and present it to the listener.
Again, assume that you need to learn something new.
Bill Ney said, "Every person you're going to meet has something you don't know."
Let me repeat: everyone is an expert in some way.
Third point: Use open-ended issues.
On this point, please refer to the way the reporter's question is asked.
Start asking questions "who is in what as to when it's Central,", "Why" or "How".
If you ask a complicated question, you will get a simple answer.
If I asked you, "You were afraid at that time?"
You'll respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, "fear," and the answer will be "yes" or "not tahly."
"You were angry at the time ." Yes, I was very angry at the time.
Let each other describe it, and the other is the one who knows the situation.
Try asking each other this way: "What's it like ."
“How do you feel? ”
Because in this way, the other person may need to stop and think about it, and you will get a more interesting answer.
The fourth point: to go naturally.
That is, ideas will naturally flow into your mind, and you need to express them.
We often hear interviews with guests say a few minutes, and then the host comes back to ask questions, which seems to know where it comes from or has been answered.
This shows that the host may not have been listening for two minutes ago, because he thought of this very witty question, so he thought about asking this question.
We will do the same.
When we sat down and talked to someone, we suddenly remembered that chance of meeting with Hugh Jackman at the coffee shop.
And then we don't listen anymore.
Stories and ideas will always come to you.
But even if you can't stop it, don't let them linger too much in your head.
Fifth point: If you don't know, you don't know.
People on the radio show, especially in National Public Radio, are well aware that their conversation will be broadcast out, so they are more careful about where they claim to be professional and what they are chiselled.
Learn to do this, be careful.
The conversation should be responsible behavior.
Article 6: Do not compare your experience with others.
If the other person talks about losing a family member, don't start talking about what you're losing your family.
If the other person is talking about the bother at work, don't tell them how much you hate your job.
It's different, it can never be the same.
Any experience is unique.
And, more importantly, it's not about you.
You don't need to prove how competent you are at the moment, or how much pain you have endured.
Someone once asked Stephen Hawking how much his IQ was, and he replied, "I don't know. The people who take the IQ bragging are dicoats."
Talk is not meant to sell itself.
Article 7: Try not to repeat your own words.
It's aggressive and boring, but we're easy to do it.
Especially in a job conversation, or in a conversation with your child. We want to state a point of view, so we change ways to keep saying it.
Don't be like that.
Article 8: Don't talk about nonsense.
To put it bluntly, no one cares about the years, names, dates, etc., the details you try to recall in your brain.
Others don't care. They care about you.
The other person cares about who you are and what you have in common.
Forget the details. Don't worry about them.
Title IX: It's not the last, but the most important one.
Listen carefully.
I can't say how many important people say listening is probably the most important, the first important skill you can improve.
I repeat, "If you don't have a mouth, you can't learn anything."
Calvin Coolidge once said, “No one has ever been fired because he ’ s heard too much. ”
Why don't we listen to each other?
First, we prefer to say it.
Everything is under my control when I speak.
I don't have to listen to anything I'm not interested in.
I am the focus.
I can strengthen my sense of identity.
But there's another reason: we're going to be disturbed.
People say about 2225 words per minute on average, but we can listen to nearly 500 words per minute.
So our brain was occupied by this other 275 words.
I know it's hard to really pay attention to hearing people talk about it. But if you don't do that, you're not talking.
You are just two people shouting for each other in the same place without any concerns.
You have to listen to each other.
Steven Covey has a wonderful talk about this.
He said: "Most of us are not listening for understanding.
We listen to it for the sake of the response. ”
The last article, Article X: Succinctly.
“Good conversation is like a right miniskirt; short enough to be attractive, long enough to cover the numeric subject of mingle my sister ’ s metaphor ” all of which condenses into the same concept, which is: interest in others.
I grew up around a celebrity grandfather, and my family's guests were endless.
Visitors will come to talk to my maternal grandparents, and after those people leave, my mother will come over and say to us, "Do you know who is that?"
She is a runner-up for Miss America.
He was the mayor of Sacramento.
She won the Pulitzer Prize. He was a Russian ballet dancer. "
I grew up by default that everyone has an unknown wonderful thing.
Seriously, I think it's all that makes me a better host.
I could as little as I could, but open my mind, and was always ready to be taken aback, and I was never disappointed.
You can do that too.
Go out the door, talk to others, listen to what others say, and most importantly, be prepared to take aback.
Thanks.
Everyone is good.
My name is Matthew Williams and I am a champion.
I have won medals in three different sports and at the Canadian National Games, I have participated in international basketball and I am very proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I have five days a week with top coaches and psychological counselors to train basketball and racing skating to stay at the best competitive form.
Plus, these are because of the special Olympics
Has this made you a change in my achievements and my achievements?
The world doesn't make everyone like me champions.
Not so long ago, people like me were not seen.
Since the beginning of the special Olympics in 1968, this phenomenon has been greatly improved, but in reality, it is often seen that people with intellectual disabilities compared to ordinary people are often ignored.
People call me in front of me with the word "stupid" and I think I don't care
They call me "stupid, saying my dullness is a completely derogatory usage
They don't know how much it hurts me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here to show mercy.
I am here because there is still the problem: there are still a lot of people who see intellectual deficits in the way there is a problem or, or more people don't recognize their existence.
You all know that the World Games are held this year.
I am one of the 6500 mentally deficient athletes we come from a country in 165 countries to compete in Los Angeles
At that time, more than 62,000 spectators watched the opening ceremony, and TSN and ESPN also broadcast live.
Do you know this?
What do you think when you see people like me?
I'm here today I'm here to be bold and take us as equals.
The special Olympics changed the intellectual disability of the athlete's self-recognition and changed the view of the audience.
If you are not familiar with the special Olympics, I will explain it, it is for people with intellectual defects.
It is independent of the Paralympic and Olympic Games.
We have high-quality, dedicated to intellectually flawed players, and these year-round sports programs can change our destiny and our perceptions of us.
The special Olympics changed my life and changed the lives of many people, but also changed the world's perception of people with intellectual deficits.
I was born with epilepsy and intellectual disability.
Before I was 12, I was always playing hockey
The more you grow up, the more difficult it is to keep up with others, I feel angry and depressed.
There was a time when I didn't touch any sport without many friends who felt abandoned and nobody asked
There was a time when people with intellectual defects were isolated by this society and not made public.
No one will think they can participate in sports, let alone become a valuable member of society.
In the 1960s, a scientist at the University of Toronto at the University of Toronto, he was studying the effects of normal exercise on the health of children with intellectual disabilities.
Dr. Hayden, along with other researchers, came to the conclusion of rigorous scientific research: the reasons for children with intellectual disabilities who have reduced their health simply lack of exercise
Many people who question intellectual deficits can benefit from sports or sporting events.
But it is precisely because there are Dr. Hayden, as well as the founder of the Special Olympics, Younis Kennedy Sharif, who insist on the benefits of sports, and that the special Olympic athletes do not go four and a half thousand times to prove that sport is indeed good.
I was an easily nervous person before I went to the special Olympics because I was young and shy, I wasn't confident and not as many friends.
But I got there, but I found that everyone was very friendly and helpful, and I didn't want me to do it back to myself.
Now, I am a basketball player, a speed skater who has participated in provincial and national competitions, and this year I also participated in the Summer Special Olympics in Los Angeles, where I represented the first Canadian basketball players to compete in the world.
I've heard a lot of similar stories from the four and a half million athletes in the world.
Athletes who become special Olympics help us regain our self-confidence and dignity
The Games also pointed to important health needs.
Research shows that men with intellectual deficits on average are 13 years less than men who do not have intellectual deficits and have fewer lives than women with intellectual disabilities than women who do not have intellectual disabilities
The Special Olympics Keep Us Healthy and Let ’ s Actively Participate in the Games
Our coaches also teach us nutrition and health.
The Special Olympics will also provide free health check-ups for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctors or who have difficulty getting health concerns.
Members of my Canadian team at the 2015 Special Olympics I'm playing against the Nigerian Basketball team
The day before the competition, the Nigerian basketball team members participated in the health system medical examination of the 10 members of the health system of the Games, and seven of the ten players who were free hearing aids were heard more clearly for the first time.
The changes that have brought them to you are amazing.
They're even more excited, happy, confident because their coach can finally communicate with them in words
They ’ re very excited because they can hear the sound of basketball and the voices of the fans standing next to them, and the voices of the fans who we think they should be there.
The special Olympics not only change them in the sports of athletes.
It also changes the lives of athletes.
This year, research shows that close to half of adults in the U.S. are more generally tolerant and less positive for people with intellectual disabilities who do not know 44 percent of Americans who don't have contact with intellectual disabilities
Then the word "stupid" proves that people with intellectual defects are still blind and isolated.
People use the word, either casually, or swear
On Twitter last year, it was used more than nine million times, which deeply hurt me and the world's four and a half million athletes.
People don't think it's being swearing, but it really is
My fellow athlete, also the global messenger, Franklin Stephens, wrote a letter to a political critic who once said "stupid" to curse people, "Look for the Special Olympics one day,
See if you still think the same when you leave. "
This year, in the 2015 Special Olympics, people lined up for hours to watch the weightlifting match of the last night.
When my team-mate Jackie Barrett came on the field, people got up and he stood up as he was called Newfoundland Moose, who had hard pulled up 665 pounds and squatted up and raised 611 pounds to pass a number of new records for the Special Olympics.
Jackie was the record holder among Newfoundland weightlifters not just for the Special Olympics, but all weightlifters.
Jackie is now a big star in Los Angeles, ESPN also posted Twitter in real time about his break-lifting record and was shocked by how he did.
Fifty years ago, almost no one could imagine that people with intellectual defects could do that.
This year, sixty thousand spectators filled the famous Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening of the competition also applaud athletes from 165 countries around the world
We were congratulated and cheered, and no longer hidden
Special Olympics Church Athletes are more confident and more proud of themselves
The Special Olympics also teaches the world to be mentally flawed, and deserve to be respected and included.
Now, I have dreams in my athletic career and achievements with good training to be respected for life more healthy and then I'm also trying to move forward with the personal trainer's career.
I'm not hiding, being bullied at TED I'm doing TED Talk
With the special Olympics, the world has become different, but there is still a long way to go.
So next time you see the mentally ills, I hope you can see their potential.
Next time someone is around you with the word "stupid" and I hope you tell them how hurt the word.
I hope you want to see a special Olympics.
I finally shared an idea with you.
Nelson Mandela once said, “Sport has the ability to change the world. ”
The Special Olympics are changing the world in changing the world in changing four and a half million athletes to give us a place, making us feel confident that we know friends without discrimination and experiencing as a champion.
Thank you all!
You may never have heard of Leonean Kenema, or Arua in Nigeria.
But I think they are the two best places in the world.
The hospital there, with a community of nurses, surgeons and scientists, has been quietly fighting for years against one of humanity's deadliest threats to the Lhasa virus.
Lhasa virus is like Ebola.
It can cause severe fever symptoms and is often fatal.
But these people risk their lives every day to protect every member of the community and, at the same time, protect us all.
The best thing I learned from them was that when I first visited many years ago, those challenging, struggling on the front lines, they started the thirsium every morning.
They gather together to show their delight.
They show a spirit.
Many years have passed, when we visit each other year and year after we visit each other, I can gather to sing with them, and we will record them, and we love doing it, because it reminds us that we are not just going to explore the truth of science together, but also a bond of humanity that binds us together.
And you can imagine that this connection becomes extremely important and even indispensable when the surrounding environment changes.
In March 2014, a huge change occurred. The Ebola outbreak broke out in Guinea.
It was the first outbreak in West Africa, at the junction of Sierra Leone and Libya.
The situation was terrible and we were all shocked.
In fact, we even suspected that Lhasa and Ebola outbreaks were spread more widely than we thought, and we were worried that one day it would spread to Kenema.
So my team members immediately set off, rushed there and joined Dr. Hohor Khan and his team, and we built the diagnostic equipment to do some sensitive molecular tests, and when Ebola crossed the Sierra Leone border, we could detect it.
We've long been setting up devices of this size for the Lhasa virus, and we know how to cope, and this team is extremely good.
We just need to give them equipment and space and let them go and study Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day came.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the hospital's delivery room, and our team conducted those important molecular tests and confirmed the first Ebola case in Sierra Leone.
It's actually very remarkable.
They can diagnose the condition in the first place, safely diagnose patients, and start tracing contacts to follow up on the spread of the disease.
It could have stopped something.
But by the time that day came, the outbreak had been brewing for months.
After the discovery of hundreds of cases, it dwarfs all previous outbreaks.
And the virus isn't captured Sierra Leone by that single case, and it's a huge shockwave.
We have to work closely with the international community to deal with these cases with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema. The following week came to 31 patients, then 92, and then up to 147 rustranges all flocked to Kenema, which is one of the few places in Sierra Leone that can respond to the epidemic.
We worked day and night, doing our best to help every patient, and we wanted to get everyone's attention, but we did another simple thing.
To detect Ebola, we took samples from the patient's blood, and we could of course throw them away straight away.
But in fact, the other thing we can do is to deactivate the chemicals in the sample, and then seal it in the box and ship it across the ocean.
We sent the samples to Boston, where my team worked,
We're also day and night, working in shifts every day, so we quickly sorted out the 99 genomes of Ebola.
This is the blueprint for the genome of the virus.
We have human beings too.
It details everything that makes up our bodies and tells us a lot of information.
The results of these efforts are simple, but also powerful.
We can take these 99 different virus variants, observe and compare them, and we can clearly see that, compared to the three genomes released by the Guinean side, we can find that the disease has begun to spread in Guinea a few months ago, and once it breaks into the population, it will be transmitted quickly through human contact.
This information is actually crucial, especially when you're researching how to prevent the virus from spreading. But the most important thing is contact tracing.
We can also see when the virus is spreading from person to person, it is also constantly mutating.
Each variation is incredibly important because all the diagnoses, vaccines, and the treatment we use, are basically based on that particular genome sequence, which is the root cause of the spread of the epidemic.
So global health experts should respond quickly, improve their research methods, and make adjustments in everything they do.
But as far as I was in the position at that time, the method of scientific research is that I got the data, I may have to be locked up in the laboratory for several months, analyze those data carefully and carefully, write the paper to submit, and then make repeated changes, and finally the paper is made public, and those data can be made public.
That was the current state of scientific research at that time.
Well, at that particular time this method certainly doesn't work, right?
Some of our friends work on the frontline of disease resistance, and obviously for us what needs the most is the external help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we did was, as soon as the genetic sequencing results came out of the machine, we immediately posted the data online.
We're open to the world and say, "Help us"
And so help ensue.
Before we react, there are a large group of people around the world who have taken the initiative to contact us, and they were surprised to see that the data was publicly available online.
Some of the world's best virus trackers suddenly become part of our team!
We work together in this virtual way, we share information, often connect with the phone, keep in touch, hoping to track the spread of the virus in minutes and then find ways to contain it.
In fact, there are many ways to form such groups.
Everyone, especially when the epidemic erupts around the world, is constantly getting information, and is participating and putting in.
Everyone wants to make some contributions.
The power of all people in the world is really amazing, and the Internet connects us.
Can you imagine that we are no longer afraid of communicating with others, all of us say, "Start work."
Let's work together, we must do it.
But the problem is that the data we all use, the data we find on Google, is far from meeting the needs of our jobs.
When that happens, we miss a lot of opportunities.
So in the early days of the Kainema outbreak, we had 106 clinical records of patients, and once again we made these public.
In our own lab, you've given us that 106 records, and we can get the computer to predict the next Ebola patient, and with near-100% accuracy.
We've also made an app that specifically publishes these predictions so that people in the world's health sector have access to this information.
But the 106 reports are far from enough to make this approach effective.
So we're waiting for more clinical reports to release that software,
And these reports have not come.
We're still waiting, constantly revising the software, nesting in the lab instead of working with everyone.
This is really... we are completely unacceptable.
You, you all can't accept it.
Now is the time for life to hang on.
However in fact, many people have died, and many people who work in the medical field, including my beloved colleagues, have five colleagues: Mbarou vony, Alex Mubi, Dr. Hual Khan, Alice Kovoma, and Mohammed Fuller.
It's just five of the thousands of health workers who have sacrificed elsewhere in Kenema, and the world has been waiting, we've been burying our jobs, and people are independent and unconvinced.
Ebola, like other threats to humanity, can be exacerbated by distrust, dispersion and estrangement between people.
When we build barriers and fight each other, the virus is even more arrogant.
But Ebola is not like any other threat, because this time, we became a family.
We are all on the same front.
If a person gets Ebola, we're probably next.
So we live in the world, with common weaknesses, common strengths, common fear, common hope, I sincerely hope that we can work together with joy.
One of my graduated students read a book about Sierra Leone, and she found the word "Kinema," the name of the city where we worked in Sierra Leone, the name of the hospital, which means "a transparent, clear-cut, and all eyes can be touched in the local door."
It has very far-reaching implications for us, and we don't realize it ourselves, but we've always felt that in order to pay tribute to Kenema, where we've fought, we have to be open to cooperation, we have to share information, and we have to work together.
We have to do that.
All should demand that everyone and others, ’ s qonsah, as a disaster breaks out, and we should all be open to each other and fight together.
Because this is not the first Ebola outbreak, nor will it be the last, there are many other microbes in the world that have been lurking around us, like the Lhasa virus and other creatures.
The next time a disaster occurs, it could be in a million-scale city, and it could erupt there.
The virus may be transmitted through the air.
The virus may even be deliberately spread by people.
I know it's scary, I can understand, but I also know that this experience tells us that we have enough technology and the ability to win this battle, not only to win this battle, but to be high for all viruses.
But only when we are together can we do it, and we have joy.
So for Dr. Khan, and all those who sacrifice on the frontline of disease resistance, the people who will always fight alongside us, let us also fight with them forever.
Our world should not be defined by the devastation caused by a virus, and we want to have the brilliance of billions of hearts united and cooperatively sprinkled across the earth.
Thank you all.
