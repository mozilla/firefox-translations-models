People banged glass with chairs, but the windows were indestructible.
Survivor Francishek Koval said, "At last a piece of glass was broken, and they began to escape from the window."
The star emits light and heat, because hydrogen atoms combine (or fusion) together to form heavier elements when they produce energy.
Scientists are now working to build a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
However, it's a difficult problem to solve. It will take many years before we can see the utility fusion reactor built. 
Due to the role of surface tension, steel needles can float on the surface.
The reason for the surface tension occurs is that the water molecules on the surface are so strongly attracted to each other, and the gravitational pull between them is greater than the attraction between the water molecules and the air molecules above.
Water molecules form an invisible layer of outer skin on the surface of the water, a layer of outer skin that allows something like a needle to float on the surface.
The blade of modern skates is double-edged, with a hole between the edge and the edge. The double-edged edge has a better grip for the ice (even when it is tilted).
Since the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, when the blade is cocked to one side, the knife edge in contact with the ice bends.
That way, the skater can turn. The ice knife tilts to the right, and the skater turns to the right. The ice knife tilts to the left, and the skater turns to the left.
They must eliminate the excess energy that is obtained from light before they can be restored to the previous energy level.
They do this by firing a tiny particle of light called "photon."
Scientists call this process "excluding by the radiation", because the atoms are stimulated by the strong light, causing the emission of photons, and light is also a kind of radiation.
The next image shows how atoms emit photons. Of course, photons are much smaller than what it looks like on the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the material that makes up atoms!
After a few hundred hours of use, the filament eventually burns out, and the light bulbs don't light up.
Then you need to replace the light bulb. When replacing the bulbs, you must be carefully operated.
First of all, be sure to turn off the switch of the lighting or disconnect the cable connection.
This is because, when there is still a part of the bulb connected to the socket, when you are exposed to the metal base inside the socket or the light bulb, the current will flow into the socket (the connection of the light bulb metal base) to make you seriously electrocuted.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which is responsible for delivering blood.
Blood flows out of the heart through a pipe called the artery, and then back to the heart through a pipe called the vein. The smallest pipe is called the capillaries.
The rhegonosaur's teeth can not only bite the leaves, but also the branches and roots that are very hard.
Some scientists believe that the trigonoon feeds on the sote iron, which was a very common plant during the Cretaceous period.
These plants look like a small palm tree, and the canopy consists of nail-like sharp leaves.
Before eating the trunk, the trigonoon strips off the leaves with its powerful beak mouth.
Other scientists think the plants are toxic, so dinosaurs are less likely to eat them, even though now sloths and other animals such as parrots (the offspring of dinosaurs) can eat toxic leaves or fruit.
What kind of force will the gravity of the me a Gravity? If you stand on the surface of the Ganymer, you will weigh less weight than on Earth.
A man weighing 200lb (90 kilograms) on Earth weighs about 36 pounds (16kg) on the land.
The Sun does not have a crust that can stand on it like Earth. The entire sun is made up of gas, fire, and plasma.
The farther you get from the sun's center, the thinner the gas becomes. 
The outside of the sun we see is called the light bulb layer, which means "The Ball of Light"
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe the object and found that Venus had a phase consistent with the moon.
The phase change occurs because Venus (or the moon) is only on one side of the Sun-facing. The phase transition of Venus supports Copernicus' theory that planets revolve around the sun.
Then, in 1639 years later, a British astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.

He originally named the Korean alphabet "Cultural Orthodox", which means "to teach the people to correct the tremovable tremor."
There are many claims about the origins of Sanskrit language. One of them is that the Aryans immigrated from the West to India and brought their own language here.
Sanskrit is an ancient language that is comparable to European Latin.
The earliest known books in the world were written in Sanskrit. After the book of Onyola was compiled, Sanskrit disappeared due to hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a vast and profound language and is also the origin of many modern Hindi, just as Latin is the origin of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the end of the war, Germany began to prepare for the invasion of the British Isles.
Germany named the attack code "Operation Sea Lions" when the British army withdrew most of its heavy weapons and supplies when it was retreated from Dunkirk, and the breath was greatly damaged.
But the Royal Navy is still much stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine"), which could destroy any invading fleet that crosses the English Channel.
However, few Royal Navy ships were stationed near potential incursion routes, as the generals feared the ships would be sunk by German air.
Let ’ s first explain the Italian plan.Italy basically belongs to Germany and Japan ’ s“ Little Brothers ralla
Both the country's army and navy were weaker, though they built four new ships shortly before the war began.
Italy's main target is African countries. In order to seize those countries, they need an army base so that the army can sail through the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
To this end, they had to withdraw the British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to these actions, the Italian warship should not have acted.
Now look at Japan. Like the UK, Japan is an island nation.
Submarines are designed for boats that drive under the water, and the submers stay under the water for a longer time.
Submarines were used during World War I and World War II. At that time, they were slow and shooting in very limited ranges.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly sailed on the sea, but as the radar developed and improved precision, the submarine was forced to dive underwater to avoid detection.
The German submarine is known as the U-boat. The Germans are very good at navigating and operating submarines.
Because the Germans were successful in submarines, they were not hosting large numbers of submarines after the war.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as "King Tut" or "Young King", is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings in modern times.

Learning to produce interactive media requires conventional traditional skills and tools in interactive courses (storyboard production, audio and video editing, storyline design, etc.).
Interaction design requires you to re-evaluate assumptions about media production and learn to think nonlinearly.
Interaction design requires that the various components of a project be interconnected, but can also exist as a separate entity.
The disadvantage of the zoom lens is that in order to achieve a certain focal length range, the required focal length complexity and the number of lens components are much larger than that of the fixed-focus lens.
With lens manufacturers meeting a higher standard in lens production, that's nothing short of that.
This allows the zoom lens to take photos that are comparable to the quality of the fixed focal length lens.
Another disadvantage of the zoom lens is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is usually small.
This makes it difficult for inexpensive zoom lenses to be used in low-light conditions without flashing.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert movies into DVD formats is overscanning.
Most TV shows are made for entertaining the masses.
For that reason, the frame of the frame you see on TV, including the top, bottom and side, has been cropped.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. This is called "Overscanning 燨
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, its bezels are likely to be cropped, and if the captions in the video are too close to the bottom, then the subtitles will also appear incomplete.
This traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination, reminiscent of the horse-backed spear, banquet and the chivalry of King Arthur.
Even standing in the ruins of a thousand years, it is easy to recall the sound and smell of the long-lost war, and almost all the collisions of the horseshoes on the cobbled stones can smell the whiff of fear that emerges from the dungeon pit.
But do we have a realistic basis for our imaginations? Why was it the first to build castles? How are they designed and built?
As a typical building of that period, it is not so much that the castle of Muxloe is a real castle, but rather a fortified house.
Its large glass windows and thin walls could not withstand a determined attack for long.
In the 1880s, when Lord Hastings began the construction of the castle, the country was relatively peaceful and needed only a small group of swavings.
The balance of power is the system in which European countries seek to preserve the sovereignty of all European countries.
The idea is that all European countries must try to prevent a certain country / region from becoming strong alone, so governments often change allies in order to maintain balance.
The battle for the inheritance of Spain marks the first war, with the balance of power at its core.
This marks an important change, because the European powers will no longer be able to use religious wars as an excuse. So the Thirty Years' War will be the last war to be labeled as a religious war.
On July 21, B.C., the arson of Herostratus led to the destruction of the Artemis temple in Ephesus.
According to the storyline, the person was willing to give a head at all costs. The indignant Ephesus declared that Herostratus was unspeakable.

Mysticism seeks to communicate, identify, or achieve a sense of perception with ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
Believers seek a direct experience, intuition, or epiphany of divine reality, or gods.
Followers pursue a certain way of life or practice designed to nourish these experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship, as it emphasizes the personal direct experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially those in peace, insightful, happy, and even ecstatic states of consciousness.

Sikhs believe that they believe in a different kind of religion than Hinduism, although they recognize that Sikhism is derived from Hinduism and also contains Hindu traditions.
Sikhs refer to their religion as Gurmat, which means "The Road to the Guru (Instructor)" in Punjab. Guru is a fundamental part of all Indian religions, but its status is particularly high in Sikhism, which has become the core of the Sikh faith.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nak (1469-1539), followed by nine Gurus.

The Indu River Basin civilization is a Bronze Age civilization located in the subcontinent in northwestern India, covering much of modern Pakistan, as well as parts of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
The civilization of the Indus Basin has developed and flourished, and that civilization is hence the name.
Although some scholars have speculated that given the fact that this civilization also exists in the already dry Salasavati river basin, it is appropriate to call it the "Indus-Salassi River civilization", but some people call it "the first site of the Halapian civilization" that was excavated in the region in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire promoted the advancement and development of medicine.
Emperor Augustus began recruiting doctors and even formed the first Roman medical team for postwar medical treatment.
Surgeons have knowledge of a variety of sedatives, including morphine extracted from poppy seeds and the east scopolamine alkali extracted from scopolamine seeds.
In addition to stopping blood flow with a hemostasis and arterial tots, they have become proficient in saving ganglions by amputation.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has achieved great results in medicine, constituting much of what we know today.
Pure earth origami, its limiting rule can only be folded once, does not allow reverse folding such a more complex action, and all folding positions must be simple and clear.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced origami orversians or people with poor hands-on abilities.
When children are young, they can be aware of racial and racial stereotypes, which affect their behavior.
For example, if people modelly that children of a minority are not performing well in school, then once these children learn about the pattern of their ethnicity, they often have bad performances in school.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the U.S. and currently has 5.4 million registered accounts.
These sites get a lot of attention, especially in the field of education.
These sites also have benefits, such as making it easy to create a class page with content that includes blogs, videos, photos, and more.
Simply provide a URL to easily access the page. This makes it easier to remember and the input for students who don't have a keyboard or spelling.
It can be personalized for reading, and can also use more or less color according to the requirements.
"attention deficit disorder" is a neurological syndrome, and three typical defined symptoms include impulsivity, distraction, hyperactivity, or excess energy.
It ’ s not a lack of learning ability, it ’ s a learning disability; it ’ s ‘ affecting 3% to 5% of children across the country, and the number of people can be as many as 2 million comrades.
It's hard for children with ADHD to focus on doing things, for example, but they can concentrate on doing things they like, such as playing games, watching a favorite cartoon, or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children tend to get into a lot of trouble. Because normal methods can't stimulate their brains, and in order to stimulate the brain, they "make dangerous behaviors, fights, challenge authority .
Attention deficit disorder (ADD) affects the relationship between sick children and their peers, because other children can't understand the reason patients do behavior, spell, and don't understand why their maturity is different.
When the ability to acquire knowledge and learn takes on changes as described above, the basic rate of acquiring knowledge also changes accordingly.
The methods of obtaining information vary. Stress no longer exists in personal memories, but the ability to recall texts becomes even more important.
The Renaissance fundamentally changed the way learning and knowledge were disseminated.
The place of primitive humans, unlike other primates, is that they no longer use their hands to move their bodies, hold up heavy objects, and wander around the woods.
The size and length of the chimpanzee's hands and feet are similar, which reflects the fact that the hand is used to carry weight in the back of the fingerlion walk.
The human hand is shorter than the feet, and the fingers (toes) bone is straighter.
The skull fossils of two million to three million years ago all reflect the characteristics of the hand, from the way of movement to the mode of operation, have undergone changes.
Some people think that often artificially induced, clear dreams can be exhausted.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that a clear dream prolongs the time interval between the state of rapid eye movement.
The shorter the rapid eye movement (REM) per night, the less time a good night and recovery is, the more often it is, the body may have problems.
It's like waking up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV as exhausting.
The effect depends on how often your brain dreams lucidly every night.
The situation of the Italians in North Africa was hardly idealistic from the beginning. Less than a week after Italy declared war on June 10, 1940, the British light cavalry took over Capzo Fort in Libya.
In an ambush in eastern Bhatia, the British captured General Latousi, the commander of the engineering of the Italian Tenth Army.
Marshal Italo Balbo, the governor of Libya and the successor of Mussolini, was mistakenly shot dead by friendly soldiers while he landed in Tobruk.
Modern fencing is divided into multiple levels: the level of initial study of college students, and the level of majors and Olympic athletics.
The sport is mainly in the form of a matchup, that is, one fencingist and another fencingist.
Golf is a sport that a player hits the ball in a hole with a club.
A regular round is to play an eighteen-hole, and players usually start from the first hole of the course and end of the 18th hole.
The contestant who completes the match with the minimum number of battings or the number of wavings wins.
The race was played on the grass, where the grass around the hole was trimmed to be shorter and known as the greens.
Perhaps the most common type of travel is what most people think of as soon as they think of it: leisure travel.
This refers to people going to a place that is very different from their daily lives for relaxation and entertainment.
Beaches, theme parks and campsites are often the most frequented places for leisure tourists.
If a person visits a particular place with the aim of understanding its history and culture, then this type of tourist activity is called cultural tourism.
Visitors may visit different landmarks in a particular country, or they may only focus on one area.
Seeing this activity, the colonists also demanded reinforcements.
The troops supporting the forward positions included 200-member New Hampshire 1st Regiment and 3rd Regiment, under the command of Colonel John Stark and Colonel James Reid (who later became general).
The soldiers of Stark along the defensive fence at the northern end of the colonist position.
As we ebbed, the mysterious river flowing along the northeastern part of the peninsula opened a gap, and they quickly built a short stone wall to extend the wall to the small beach at the northern end of the shore.
Gridley or Stark placed a wooden stake at 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the fence and ordered not firing before the regular army passed.
The United States plans to launch a synergistic attack from three different directions.
General John Kadwad would launch an attack on the British defenders in the town of Bourdain, diverting the enemy's attention to block any reinforcements.
General James Eugenie led 700 militiamen across the river at the Trenton crossing, capturing the bridge in Ascensionek Bay, blocking the path of enemy escape.
The main force of 2400 will cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, then divided into two groups, one group commanded by Greene, and one group under the command of Sullivan to launch an offensive before dawn.
From a quarter-mile to a half-mile race, speed has become less important, and endurance becomes an absolutely important factor.
Of course, to be a first-class half-mile runner (running in two minutes), you have to have to be fast enough to develop endurance at all costs.
In winter to practice cross-country running, coupled with the fitness exercise of the upper body, you can fully prepare for the running season.
Proper nutrition practices alone are not enough to produce outstanding performance, but this can significantly affect the overall health of young athletes.
Maintain a healthy energy balance, adhere to the habit of effective rehydration, understand the rational use of all aspects of nutritional supplements, can help athletes improve performance, increase the fun of sports.
Mid-range running is a relatively inexpensive exercise; however, participants have a lot of misconceptions about the few equipment they need.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most products have little real impact on the performance.
Athletes may think they tend to be a product, although it doesn't benefit.
Atomics can be considered to be one of the basic components of all matter.
According to the simplified Pol model, this is a very complex entity that contains a central atomic nucleus surrounded by electrons, which are a bit like the planets orbiting the sun.
The nucleus consists of two particles, neutrons and protons.
Protons with positives, neutrons do not have electricity. Electrons with negative electricity.
To examine the victim, you must first investigate the site and ensure your own safety.
Close to the victim, pay attention to its posture and any unconscious red flags.
If you want to hurt when you help someone else, you only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear, and the cataurtic mood played a role in pain and disability in people with low back pain.
Only the impact of worrisome thinking, rather than the effects of frustration and fear, can be conditionally regularly with structured physical exercise per week.
People involved in regular training need more support in passive perception of pain to help them distinguish between chronic pain and discomfort and normal physical movement.
The ability to see or look depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, i.e. the eye.
There are many kinds of eye structure, and its complexity depends on the needs of the organism.
Different constructions have different functions, are sensitive to different wavelengths, and are sensitive. They also need different processing methods to understand input, and they need different types of inputs to achieve the best results.
Population refers to a collection of organisms of a particular species within a specific geographic area.
When all individuals in a population are exactly the same on a particular phenotype trait, it is called a single type.
When individuals exhibit several variants of a certain trait, they are polymorphic.
The marching of the ar colony and nesting are also at different stages.
During the migration phase, marching an ants travel at night and stop at camp during the day.
When the available foods are reduced, the ant colony is in a migration period. At this stage, the ant colony builds temporary nests that are replaced daily.
This nomadic rampage will last for about 17 days each time.
What is a cell? "cell" derived from the Latin "cella," meaning "small room," originally created by a microscope scientist who observes the cork structure.
Cells are the basic components of all organisms, and all organisms are made of one or more cells.
In fact, cells have such a fundamental and crucial place in biological research that they are often referred to as "the basic unit of life."
The nervous system maintains balance in the body by sending nerve pulses throughout the body to keep the blood flowing smoothly.
These nerve impulses can be transmitted very quickly throughout the body, keeping the body safe from any potential threat.
Compared to other violent storms, tornadoes hit areas that are smaller, but can destroy everything passing.
Tornado wind uprooted trees, ripping the wood panels on the building and throwing the car into the sky. The tornado was the most violent and could last more than three hours.
These monster-like storms, wind speeds up to 480 km per hour (13m m/s; 300 mph).
For thousands of years, humans have been making and using magnifying glass.
However, the first real telescope was made in Europe in the late 16th century.
The telescopes used a combination of two lenses, making distant objects look both close and large.
Greed and selfish are always with us, and the essence of cooperation is that when most people benefit, short-term selfish behavior can always bring more benefits.
Hopefully most people realize that working with others is the best option in the long run.
Many people dream that humans can one day emigrate to other planets and explore other worlds. Some people wonder what the universe is; some believe there may be aliens or other life on other planets.
But if that does happen, it's likely that it won't happen again for a long time. These stars are very scattered, "adjacent" stars apart trillions of miles apart.
Perhaps one day, your children and grandchildren will live in an alien world, speculating on how their ancient ancestors had been.
Animals are made up of many cells. Animals digest them in the body after eating food. Most of the animals can move.
Only animals have brains (but not all animals have, for example, jellyfish have no brains.
There are animals in all corners of the earth. Some of them are digging holes underground, some swimming in the ocean, and some soar in the sky.
Cells are the smallest structural and functional units of all kinds of organisms.
The term Cell (cell) is derived from the Latin cella (meaning little room).
Look at the creatures under a microscope and you'll find that they are made up of small squares or small balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from the United Kingdom, saw with a microscope some small squares hidden in the cork.
They looked like rooms. He was the first to observe dead cells.
Elements and compounds can change the state in the event of a chemical change.
Gaseous nitrogen still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen has a larger density, but the molecules are still the same.
Another example is water. Compound water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Whether it is gas, liquid or solid, its molecular structure is the same.
While its physical state may change, the chemical state remains the same.
Time is around us, affecting everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
For thousands of years, time has been the subject of the study of religious, philosophical and scientific scholars.
The time we've been through is a series of events that have never come to the present and into the past.
Time is also how we compare the duration (length) of events.
You can record the passage of time by observing repeated periodic events. Cyclical events refers to what happens again and again regularly.
Today, we use computers to process pictures and videos.
Complex animations can be built on computers, and this type of animation is increasingly being applied to TV and movies.
Music is often processed with complex computers and mixed the sound together.
For a long time in the 19th and 20th centuries, it was assumed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maori, who hunted a large bird called a bird of terror.
The theory then established the view that the Maori migrated from Polynesia on a "big boat" and seized New Zealand from the Morioris to build an agrarian society.
But there is new evidence that the Morioris belong to the Continental Maori community, who have moved from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own unique culture of peace.
There was another tribe on the Chatham Islands, who were Māori who had immigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves the Morioris. There were minor conflicts, and eventually the Morioris were eliminated.
Those who have been involved in decades have helped us to recognize their strengths and passions, while honestly assessing difficulties and even failures.
As we listen to others share stories about their personal, family, and organization, we have a valuable understanding of the past and some of the characters who have a good or bad impact on the culture of the organization.
While understanding history does not mean understanding culture, it can at least help people understand their place in the history of the organization.
When it comes to success and failure, individuals and all participants have a deeper understanding of the values, mission and driving forces of the organization.
In this context, looking back at previous entrepreneurial behaviours and successful successes can help people remain open to new changes and new directions in the local church.
Such success stories have reduced the fear of change, while creating a positive tendency for future change.
Converging mindsets are problem-solving techniques that combine different ideas or fields to find solutions.
This mindset values speed, logic and accuracy, as well as identifying facts, reapproval and information gathering of existing technologies.
The most important factor in this mindset is that there is only one right answer. You only need to consider two answers, right or wrong.
This pattern of thinking is not unrelated to certain scientific or standard procedures.
This type of thinking person has logical thinking, can remember the pattern, solve the problem, and carry out scientific testing.
Until now, humans are the most good species to read the minds of others.
This means that we are able to successfully predict other people ’ s perceptions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge, or desires.
In these abilities, it is crucial to understand the intentions of others. We can use this ability to understand the ambiguous problems that physical behavior may express.
For example, if you see someone breaking a car window, there's a good chance you'll think the person is stealing a stranger's car.
If he lost the car keys and tried to open the door of his car, it might be a different thing.
Magnetic resonance imaging is based on a physical phenomenon called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (who worked at Stanford University) and Edward Perser (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves cause the atoms to emit a weak radio signal.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a medical and research scientist, discovered the rationale for using magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was approved, the world's first patent in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the manufacture of the first "whole-body" MRI scanner, which he called "unyielding dragons"
Asynchronous communication gives people time to think about how others react and react.
This allows students to learn at their own pace and control the rhythm of imparting teaching information.
In addition, due to the introduction of flexible working hours, the time limit is relatively small. (Bremmer, 1998)
Learners can access information on the Internet and the World Wide Web at any time.
Students can also submit questions to the teacher at any time of the day and can expect a quick response within a reasonable time without waiting until the next interview.
Postmodernist learning methods give people absolute freedom. There is no learning method that is a good way of learning.
In fact, nothing needs to be learned specifically. The behavior of learning happens when the learner experiences the presentation of knowledge.
At present, we are aware of all the experiences of DIY, presenting information, and learning-based TV shows.
There are a lot of people in us who find ourselves watching the TV shows that we are telling us some kind of process or experience, but we will never engage or apply that knowledge.
We'll never overhaul cars, we don't build fountains in our backyards, we don't go to Peru to examine ancient ruins, and we're not going to renovate our neighbors' houses.
Thanks to the submarine cable and broadband satellite connected to Europe, Greenland has a smooth Internet connection, and 93% of the population has access to the Internet.
Your hotel or landlord (if you live in a bed and breakfast or a private home) may be equipped with wifi or internetable computers. All settlements have a cafe or a public wifi place.
As mentioned above, while the word "Eskimos" can still be accepted in the United States, many non-Americans in the Arctic, especially Canadians, all agree that the term has a pejorative meaning.
Although you may hear the term used by Greenland natives, foreigners should avoid it.
In Canada, the indigenous people of Greenland call themselves the Inuit, and in Greenland it is called Kalaalleq (the plural of Kalaalit), which means "Greenlanders".
In Greenland, crimes and malicious acts against foreigners are almost unheard of in general. Even in towns, there is no "high-crime zone of crime"
The cold is perhaps the only real danger to those who are not prepared.
If you visit Greenland during the cold season (remember the colder you go north), be sure to bring warm enough clothing.

When at home, you can easily develop immunity to local bacteria due to frequent exposure to local germs.
But in other parts of the world where there has never been a bacterial population, you're much more likely to have a problem.
Moreover, in a warm climate, bacteria can reproduce quickly and survive more in vitro.
As a result, disasters such as "Deldily Diarrhea", "Pharadiac" and "The Death of Montezuma" appeared.
Just as cold climates are prone to respiratory problems, hot climates can also easily cause intestinal problems. In most cases, intestinal problems can be significantly uncomfortable, but not very dangerous.
If you are traveling to a developing country for the first time, or travel to a strange place, don't underestimate the possible cultural impact.
Many emotionally stable and capable travelers have been deterred by new problems of travel in developing countries, where there is a need to quickly adapt to the many minor cultural differences that follow.

Antarctica surrounds the Antarctic and is the coldest place on Earth.
Travel is expensive, physically demanding, and can only be visited from November to February in the summer months of the following year, with the main attractions limited to the peninsula, the archipelago and the Ross Sea.
In the summer, more than forty bases here will welcome thousands of staff, most of whom are stationed in the area; a small number of them are left for winter.
Antarctica's interior is a desolate plateau covered with 2-3km thick ice.
Occasionally there are dedicated air tour groups to travel inland, take part in mountaineering activities, or travel to large bases in the South and North Poles.
The South Pole Traverse () begins at the McMurdo Station in the Ross Sea, which runs straight to the Antarctic Point and is 1600km long.
The snow was compacted, the gaps were filled and marked with flags. Only specialized tractors and sleds towed with fuel and supplies could pass.
The car is not very flexible, so it has to be around the Antarctic mountains, a long bend to come to the plateau.
The most common cause of accidents in winter is the slippery road and pavement (walkways), especially the steps.
At least you need the right shoes for your soles. Wearing summer shoes to walk on snow and ice is usually slippery, and even some winter boots are inadequate.
The shoe pattern should be deep enough to be 5mm (1/5 inch) or above; the material should be soft enough at low temperatures.
Some boots have shoe nails; there are also expansion gear designed for slippery road surfaces with shoe nails, suitable for most shoes and boots, can be fitted to keep up with shoes, or at the same time on the heel and soles.
The heel should be low and wide. The road is often sprinkled with fine sand, sand or salt (calcium chloride), to increase friction.
Avalanche is not an anomaly; the amount of snow that can be accommodated on the steep slope is limited, and the excess snow falls in the form of an avalanche.
The problem is that snow is highly viscous. So it takes some triggers to snow, and a little snow falls, which may trigger other snow drops.
Sometimes the initial trigger is that the sun warms snow, sometimes because the snowfall is much more, sometimes because of other natural events, but the more common reason is often the human factor.
The tornado is a rotating airflow column with very low air pressure, which can inhale the surrounding air inwards.
The tornado produces strong winds (often 100-200 miles per hour), throwing heavy objects into the air and wrapping them around them moving forward.
At first, the funnel-like clouds stretched downwards from the thunderstorm clouds, which became "Dragon Carriots when they came into contact with the ground."
Personal VPN (Virtual Private Network) programs are an excellent tool for circumventing political censorship and geographic filtering of commercial IP.
They are better than web proxies for the following reasons: They rerouted all Internet traffic, not just the hypertext transfer protocol (http) content.
They typically offer higher bandwidth and better service. They are encrypted and harder to be monitored.
Media companies have lied as usual to cover up their purpose, claiming it was to "prevent piracy tiradu

Real-time text translation applications: An application that automatically converts the entire text from one language to another.
Some of these apps even allow users to translate the foreign language text on the virtual real-world logo or other objects.
The translation engine has improved significantly, and now it's often about more or less correct translations (and more often are rarely gagd), but it's important to note that they can still be completely wrong.
One of the most outstanding applications of this category is Google Translate. After downloading the required language data, it can be translated offline.

If you only want to travel around the world by plane in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited because there are very few trans-oceanic routes.
No airline alliance in the southern hemisphere can span all three oceans (Urtra-Tiange does not even cross-ocean routes).
However, Star Alliance covers all routes around the world, except for the South Pacific route from Santiago de Chile to the Toiti, which is a line for an airline of the South American Airlines (LATAM).
If you don't want to go through the South Pacific and the west coast of South America, there are other options besides this flight. (See below)
In 1994, the Armenian-Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan waged a war against the Azerbaijanis.

However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss people learn standard French in school, so they can understand even if you use the standard French measurement system.
In many parts of the world, waving hands is a friendly representation, meaning "Hello ..."
But in Malaysia, at least among the Malays in rural areas, the gesture is similar to swinging their own body with their index fingers in certain Western countries, signifying "coming over" and the gesture is only used to express that meaning.

The glaciers are not stable, but will flow down from the mountains. This can lead to cracks and ice rifts that can be obscured by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of the ice cave may collapse and the cracks may be closed.
On the edge of the glacier, huge ice cubes will loosen, fall, and perhaps jump or roll farther away from the edges.
