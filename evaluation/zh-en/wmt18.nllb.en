Last week, the temporary suspension of the classic drama, "The American Private Dinner", unexpectedly sparked a heated debate about counterfeiting national drama ratings.
Civil rights groups have issued travel warnings against Missouri.
Due to Missouri's discriminatory policies and racial attacks, the American Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a travel warning to the colored population preparing to travel to Missouri.
The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which took effect on August 28, 2017, called for, in light of a recent string of suspicious racial incidents in Missouri, all African-American travelers, tourists, and Missourians to exercise special caution and extreme caution when traveling to Missouri, the group said in a statement.
The NAACP notes that a recent Missouri law makes it harder to win discriminatory lawsuits, and that state law enforcement also targets minorities to some extent, prompting the organization to issue travel warnings.
Civil rights violations are happening to people.
They were questioned, beaten or killed because of their skin color, Rod Chappell, president of the Missouri NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
 We have received many complaints, unprecedented in number.
This is the first such warning issued by the organization against a state in the United States.
The group cited racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old Tennessee black man Tally Sanders.
Earlier this year, Sanders died in suspicious circumstances.He ran out of fuel while traveling to Missouri, and was detained by Missouri State Police without charge of any crime.
A recent report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office showed that black drivers in the state were 75% more likely than white drivers to be parked.
Chappell said: "The purpose of this consultation is to raise awareness, warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri".
 People need to be prepared, whether to take bail money to Missouri or to let relatives know they are traveling within the stateüèº
According to the latest data from the FBI's Hate Crimes Reporting Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; by crime count, the state ranks 16th nationally.
Travel warnings are also a response to a new Missouri law that will make it harder to sue housing or employment discrimination businesses.
Previously, states passed immigration law enforcement laws, required local law enforcement to detain immigrant offenders, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the move would increase the number of racial litigation cases, and issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government to other countries, but recently, advisory groups have adopted this approach to address certain laws and trends within the United States.
After experiencing a booming box office in 2015 and a golden age in 2016, the overall film market entered a period of calm, with whether it could break past last year's total box office performance of ¬•4406.9 billion becoming a pending issue.
From data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, in October, Beijing's new and used house prices doubled, with the ring ratio rising by only 0.6% and 1.1% respectively.
At this conference, the current UEFA chief technical officer, Lupuescu, made a technical report on the 2016 UEFA Champions League and the previous season's UEFA Champions League.
The BBC has called Beijing the most exciting city in the world: making old people feel like they're living in a new era.
According to the January 18 report, Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly becoming the modern charming city of today.
With an incredible high-speed Internet, cutting-edge technology such as facial recognition software, a huge investment in artificial intelligence and an unparalleled international energy, this Chinese capital is one of the most exciting cities for exploring-spirited foreigners.
According to the BBC website, reported on January 16, German actor Clemens Sesi said: "If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere I go". He quoted singer Frank Sinatra singing New York City's lyrics.
Sesi, creative director of Traveler's Archives, said: "If Sinatra were alive today, he would probably sing a song about a city like Beijing". He said, "Living in this city will make you feel like living in a new era, always keeping up with the pace".
Simon Norton, an elderly man in England but who has recently lived in Beijing, wrote on his personal blog site 4Corners7Seas: "There is a general feeling of being in the center of some great thing, a feeling that is difficult to describe, but that allows many foreigners to stay there for a long time.
The city's high-speed internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever.
Andy Penia Fuert, who is currently the deputy editor-in-chief of the children's website Beijing, a website from Manila, said: Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society, the Internet has integrated the functionality of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions.
But the smartphone is just the beginning of Beijing's technological ambitions, facial recognition software has become very popular, many mobile phone applications use this technology to make bank transfers and payments, allow people to enter apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of a driver.
Beijing also recently announced plans to spend 13.8 billion yuan to build an AI technology park, which will be home to more than 400 businesses after completion, focusing on developing a variety of AI technologies, from biometric to autonomous driving vehicles.
Food is also at the heart of many major festivals throughout Chinese history, and foreigners are highly esteemed for attending these festivals. Spring Festival is the most important social and economic festival, and one of the easiest for foreigners to participate in.
Sesi said:I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the new year, cleaning apartments and writing a red spring line with New Year's greetings on the doorstep is equally important, on the eve of the wedding day, all family members should gather for a lavish meal, then celebrate the new year until midnight, welcoming the new year with a bright flame
The number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but Chinese language barriers and the ease of communication between Chinese people are easily an excuse for not fully integrating into the local culture.
Sesi said: Some foreigners have been living in China for years, but have little experience with their host country. If you initially try to contact Chinese people without success, then you may have a more likely or easier feeling of being with other foreigners
In these so-called "old bubbles", foreigners are only mixed up with foreigners, without contact with locals and local cultural interpreters, foreigners are grouped in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only foreigners are friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin, which is easier than people might think.
Sesi said: A private Chinese class of one or two hours a week or an entry-level radio drama should fit everyone's busy schedulezh
Even learning a few classic phrases can be helpful when shopping, ordering meals in a restaurant or chatting in a taxi.
The report said that air pollution is also a daily occurrence, although government efforts in recent years have addressed some issues.
Residents stressed that it is important to get outdoors during the often mildly polluted warm months, to view those blue sky days as an opportunity to explore the historic Ho Chi Minh City or the popular Sunrise Park.
Norton said: "Beijing is the most Chinese city to discover under the surface, you can find great artistic and musical activity, lavish nightlife, historical wonders, supermodern business districts and ancient Ho Chi Minh City".
The report notes that the barrier effect of ageing on human capital growth is increasingly evident, especially in the Northeast region, where ageing contributes to human capital growth at an average annual rate of 1.28%.
Pan Hungsheng pointed out that the risk of cross-border capital flows is currently controllable, and that the fundamental elements that support the balance of international payments remain in place for a long time.

The European Commission accused Google in April of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre-install software such as Google Search and Chrome browser, or else not allowing them to use other Google apps.
The European Commission considers this move to be detrimental to the interests of consumers and impedes competition.
The EU regulator initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
If the antitrust charge is upheld, Google faces a maximum fine of 10% of its global revenue, or about $7.4 billion.
Google has not immediately commented on this.
Google is also facing an investigation by the European Union for its bias towards home-based shopping services in search results.

A picture of how to understand: Bitcoin's legal status around the world.
Summary: In addition to the natural price reset induced by speculative properties, the downturn in this round of digital currencies is also unrelated to regulatory risk.
From a visualized map, the attitudes of Eastern countries towards Bitcoin are more conservative than Western ones, the countries that make up the global mainstream are still observing the legality of digital currency, representing a still high risk of black holes.
*This article is from Wall Street Journal, editor Wang Mu. For more exciting information, please log in to wallstreetcn.com, or download the Wall Street Journal app.
With the regulatory storm rising in major Bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union, and the worldwide digital currency dominated by Bitcoin being bloodied this week, the price of Bitcoin fell to a psychological total of $10,000 on Tuesday, creating the biggest one-day drop in three years.
Apart from the natural price reset triggered by speculative properties, this round of digital currency decline is also unrelated to the longstanding regulatory risk.
At this important gateway, visualizing big data website HowzhMuch.net produced a chart, showing the status of Bitcoin's legality and regulated status in countries around the world.
As shown below, green represents the legal market for Bitcoin; yellow represents the neutral market, although it has not yet publicly legalized Bitcoin's status, but also has no major use restrictions; light pink represents the restricted market, i.e. the local government attempts to use digital currency using red line policies or regulations; dark pink represents Bitcoin as an illegal country; gray is a country that has not yet been commented upon.
(The above chart is from the HowMuch.Net visualization team, drawn on January 15)
The article notes that the distribution of green and non-green colored blocks in the picture shows that Eastern countries in the traditional sense are more conservative in their attitude to Bitcoin than Western ones.
Russia is currently the largest country to define Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest Bitcoin restricted markets, India is one of the largest countries that has not yet issued a review of Bitcoin and has not yet implemented a policy.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of Bitcoin, meaning that the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are markedly different, with the distribution of clusters in the above regions more confused.
Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are all legal bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, etc. have some restrictions on their trading and use, and more Latin American countries have not yet spoken out against bitcoin.
Combined, of the 246 countries surveyed globally, a total of 99 countries, or 40%, did not impose restrictions on Bitcoin transactions and use, i.e. green and yellow zones.
There are seven countries (or 3%) that are restricted markets (or 3%) and 10 countries (or 4%) that define Bitcoin as illegal (or 130 countries (or 53%) and no further treatment of digital currency information (or gray).
This indication, that the global market share of 53%, more than half) of countries are still looking at the domestic legality of the Bitcoin-based digital currency, also represents a significant risk that Bitcoin will remain, as some of these countries may eventually make legislative decisions to limit digital currencies.
Global regulators do not fully understand this emerging category of digital currency, and this is probably the main reason most countries are not yet making any comments.
Although the popularity of Bitcoin has increased exponentially since last year, it does not represent the interest of all countries, some countries may fear that local currencies are threatened or even more fearful that digital currencies are being used by criminal organizations.
The Wall Street Journal has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news against Bitcoin since last week, including China's start to crack down on the centralized online service platform and mobileApps of off-the-shelf exchanges; South Korea is still considering closing the digital currency exchange; the EU believes Bitcoin is not yet widely accepted and warns investors against the risk of losing its share of the stock, etc.
2018: The year of the global central bank's digital currency launch - as I mentioned, from any point of view of regulation, acceptance/criticism, adoption - 2018 will be the year of the global central bank's digital currency.
Great powers such as Russia have criticized the practice of Bitcoin's legality status, but in fact it is also intended to allow official digital currency issuance.
Novosti, Madrid, 8 January 2020 (Reporter SheyuÊô∫) Barcelona's new assistant Coutinho8 made his debut in the first pitch of the pitch-forward's shirt at the Nottingham.
Coutinho passed the health check-up of Bazh that morning and signed a contract with Bazh's president Batomeyu, which expires in the summer of 2023.
He then made his debut as a bass player, appearing in front of nearly 7,000 fans in North Kempz.
According to Spanish media, the total transfer fee for Coutinho, or 160 million euros (‚Ç¨1), is the first price ever paid by a Barcelona club and the Serie A history.
Since Cutienio is still injured, he will need to take a break of almost 20 days before he can make his debut in a pizza shirt.
What else is sacred?
Now the Trump White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most defining sign of the regime change was when they began attacking the statue.
Americans and anyone else agree with this. Thus, in 2003, Saddam Hussein was overthrown in Baghdad's Paradise Square by a well-planned coup.
As one of the key thinkers of the Trump administration, Stephen Miller, when he was engaged in a heated debate with Jim Acosta of the US cable news network CNN about the president's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration, was sure to know what he was going to do if he cut a symbolic axe off a statue of the goddess of freedom.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, then a group of yacht owners and liberal followers would surely devour his life.
But he did attack the meaning of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was engraved on the foundation in 1903 (the monument was completed 17 years later).
As Miller has accused Acosta of saying: "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America's freedom to light up the world".
The poem you mentioned, which was later added, was not part of the original statue of the goddess of freedom.
Miller is actually right, but as he himself says, this isn't really about history.
This involves the modern echo of Lazarus's parable, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowded crowd of people eager to breathe freely,/the suffering ones rejecting your crowded beach.
Those who do not suffer from this will refuse to take a moment to become more acute on our screen.
Miller never worked as a literary critic, he made it clear that these people would not be welcomed in Trump-era America.
This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends at the base of the throne who were holding her after-death event to inscribe her poems, were well aware that their actions were highly political.
The sculpture was intended to express the connection between French and American republicanism by using an ancient classical metaphor that incarnates women as the goddess of freedom.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poem, the image of a woman is no longer abstract, she must speak.
She gave herself a very different name: Mother of the Exile.
This poem combined with this painting was a successful feminist coup, and a devastating blow to Native Americanism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have always wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker Rush Limbaugh, a Baptist at the time of Trump's arrival, who in 2010 believed liberalism was not inviting anyone, and who is now an early neo-conservative, brought the flame of American wisdom to a world of ignorance: The goddess of freedom is brave to unprecedented.
She intended to bring the free spark from the United States to the rest of the world.
Fire is not the road to America.
Unusually, Rinzhbo was actually struck by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive angle.
Lazarus's most imaginative practice was to be able to see it.When tired, poor but hopeful people would see it on the deck of a ship after a long, often dreadful, journey, it would be possible to see it.
On the surface, this concerns the question of how people seeking asylum, who have the opportunity to improve their lives, view the world from a different perspective.
Her statue conveys to them the hope and welcome intention they need to hear.
Of course, this is not the view that Miller and Trump have wanted to admit.
They are not burning to light the way, but to ignite hatred, which is their only source of strength.

2017 World Cup: Neil Black highly praised the Scottish member of the England national team.
Elidh Doyle recalled that the England national team at the time had only two Scotsmen.
Neil Blake, executive director of the British Athletics Association, said the squad of 16 strong Scots in the World Cup squad would make a huge contribution to the national team.
The number of Scottish players selected to compete in the 2017 London Athletics World Championships, which opened on Friday, set a record.
Blake believes that Scotland is experiencing an extraordinary development and that British athletes must learn from it.
"We accept and manage to understand this, and we will stick around until we succeed", Blake said.
I found people at the Scottish Academy of Sport to talk to. they think it has something to do with their role.
Athletes from Scotland believe this is related to their performance.
The British Athletics Association believes this is related to their performance.
Even people on the streets think so.
In any case, this is extremely unusual.
Many of Scotland's top track and field athletes were medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be 5,000 metres below Mo Farah, while Elidh Doyle was chosen by the team as team captain.
Ahrid is a little humble.
Her captain's speech was incredible, Blake said.
Many athletes, whether they are Scottish or wherever they live or train, walk out of their doors proudly, with a good sense of humor.
The passion and genuine feelings that Ahrid naturally put into it are very good.
The Commonwealth silver medalist in the 400m backstroke event at his fifth World Championships said that the England national team has 16 Scots, which is incredible.
Previously, the highest number of Scottish athletes taking part in the World Championships was seven, which is the number of participants achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle distance runner Zhor is a leading figure. In the past year she has set five British and two European records.
She will compete in the 1500m and 5000m project competitions.
Chris O'Hare, who competed in the 1500m event, is another notable Scottish athlete, having previously achieved good results in the season, winning both the qualifying and Olympic anniversary races in the UK.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first World Championship, when the only other Scot in the squad was Lee McConnell.
Captain said what made her very proud was that so many of her compatriots not only joined the team, but in some cases, would challenge medals, compete in the finals.
The special thing about being a national team captain is that it is voted on by other national team members. Therefore, knowing that your teammates voted for you to pursue extraordinary achievements is a great honor for me, she added.
Of course, I am very proud of all Scotland's players.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are all old-fashioned athletes here, athletes who are about to advance to the goal of rising to the podium.
How was my captain's speech?
I think it's really cool.
I just referred to the fact that in this case we are very lucky, because we are hosting the World Championships at home.
So, it's really important that we grow with the support of the home team, and that we get back on the Olympic Stadium.
I will get a second chance to compete, and the atmosphere there will be amazingly amazing.

Blocking critics on Facebook: If you can't stand the criticism of voters, don't run for public office.
Our father-in-law knew the craft of bad media.
All Americans loved Washington, but soon the major newspapers began to lash out at him, from domestic policy to political principles, not to mention anything else.
He was certainly bitter about these criticisms.
But he did not speak up against these critics.
For as early as 1783, Washington had said, "Freedom of speech shall be deprived; we shall be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance".
This reminded me of Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who needed to study at Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 posts from his Facebook account because they shared their views on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff considered the lawsuit to be too grotesque, and online reports abounded with their fierce opposition: Who cares?
Many people say that this is just Facebook.
But, this is important.
This is especially important, as it is faced by people like Hogan.
This is a Republican who is governor of a majority state in a democracy, and he is also surprisingly popular.
Of the 50 governors nationwide, he ranks second in the best ratings.
Hogan is not a reactive, impulsive molecule.
He ran Maryland smoothly, strictly following the rules.
He is also very good at using Facebook as the primary way to connect with voters, showing his post-chemotherapy experience for the first time on the homepage.
So blocking the comments of those who come to the governor's homepage is completely unnecessary, and ultimately very dangerous. This homepage is a public forum, the official management platform for the publicly-taxed employee list.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Shas, defended the governor's actions, saying that she felt that blocking their comments was merely trying to get them to restrain themselves a bit.
But they are overly rash in describing it as a flood monster or cynical person that is sweeping the web.
I spoke face to face with people who were being shielded by Hogan.
They are nothing more than ordinary people's dialogue with their chosen leaders: their identity as teachers, small business owners and pastors, not just a flood monster.
They have expressed their comments with deep respect, not disdain.
The pastor quoted from the Bible in his post, urging Hogan to keep his Catholic faith in mind.
Lakhim Sarma Ramani, the attorney general of Zhezh, Maryland, was not cynical, but she did ask questions about hate crimes.
She wrote in the Washington Post's News Story Comment section, "I politely commented, I expressed disappointment that he did not retaliate against hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also don't like a group of people commenting on the same topic, because these people are often overlooked by some people, thinking they are so-called "public psychologists", rather than being treated as a group of concerned citizens.
The so-called "clutter of junk" bombing of information by the governor's office may, in the eyes of others, be a "persistent" claim.
The Facebook era made it easy to change a message, with only one critic to be blocked or a negative comment removed.
And to clear far cleaner than in the past, in those past decades to achieve the same effect required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical comments or arrest or silence protesters.
But that's really what's happening right now, but on a digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of gossiping about others on Facebook and other social media platforms.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
Last week, a landmark ruling was issued in Virginia on such matters.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. Katharis of the City of Alexandria, the Chairman of the Lauden County Board of Supervisors' behavior of blocking voters from her Facebook homepage violated the First Amendment.
Kentucky Governor Matt Bevan (R) has also been criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington, D.C., affordable mail and the Internet had a similar impact.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters were written to strongly criticize his leadership.
And even then, Washington had a flood monster against him anonymously.
People have used pseudonyms such as Eurythmics, Valerius, Belizarius, and Pogues to write letters to the press that harshly criticize Washington's decision.
According to historical documents compiled by George Washington's newspaper project online, his office was flooded with petitions, all of which criticized his attitude toward the friendship, trade and maritime treaties with the United States, his Majesty the King of England, which had been signed with the United Kingdom.
But he did not speak out against them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of dissent and freedom of speech are the foundation of this country.
And true leaders need to accept this.
The winds of the marketplace are moving, and they are moving people's sensitive nerves.
Limit purchases are a tough part of many urban real estate regulation policies.
In May 2017, the Jinan Provision was introduced, undergraduate students pay continuous social security half-year, and residents of the local permanent residence can enjoy equal housing purchase policies;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that states that university students can be enrolled within three years of graduation with a diploma and employment certificate.
The policy was subsequently codified, the official said, so that university students could buy a home at a price below the market price of 20%;
In July, Chengdu introduced the regulations that young talent with a bachelor's degree or higher from a foreign university can apply to settle in Chengdu only after graduation.
In addition, cities or regions such as Kunzhan, Shanghai's main port have also been introduced with the introduction of relevant policies for talent acquisition, reducing the threshold for talent acquisition.
Zhang Zhenhui believes that this is actually the main reason why cities are competitive in terms of population, especially talent, and keep the population, especially talent, and that is why these real estate policies are so important.
Some even believe that this means that the time has come for the building market to cancel the purchase limit.

In August, a total of 57 cases of continuous penalty cases were carried out nationwide, the newly amended Environmental Protection Act, which was implemented earlier this year, markedly increased China's environmental enforcement power.
Currently, environmental protection authorities across China can use punitive means such as daily continuous fines, seizures, production cuts and administrative detention to track environmental violations and cooperate with judicial authorities to punish environmental crimes.
In August, a total of 335 seizure cases were carried out across China; 177 seizure cases were carried out; 189 administrative detentions were transferred; 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution crimes were transferred.
Of these, Henan has implemented seven consecutive penalties per day, and currently, China is working on a comprehensive, integrated, comprehensive, reinforced environmental pollution management from end-to-end control.
Although the downward pressure is apparent, the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection has previously made clear that China should properly handle environmental protection's position in economic development, strengthen its green stability, the slower the economic growth, the more it can relax environmental protection, and play the role of environmental protection in optimizing the economy.

Her wooden house is located in Enairotali, the capital of Panjai province in Papua, Indonesia, and the homemaker usually simply puts a redhead called nota directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the burnt red chicken was quickly taken out by a pair of unwashed hands and eaten by the wolf.
Daisy sits on the mud and she has no furniture, and here she does her daily household chores, such as washing clothes, washing the toilet, all from the nearby swamp.
A water tank is placed in a room without a roof, which is an outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to the fields to care for.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late is dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed, and many are dirty and drunk, plus a lot of soldiers.
She said: "No one dares to walk around the village after 5 pm".
This is a rare occurrence in everyday life in the Babua highlands, a former Dutch colony, which was incorporated into Indonesia after a referendum in 1969, but was also controversial when only 1026 chiefs were forced to vote by hand in front of the occupying army.
The current movement for independence and opposition to Dutch rule is quickly turning its sights on the Jakarta government, which is exercising a high-pressure regime in the region, isolating foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Enarotalli is a remote, smoky desert; getting here requires 90 minutes of flight time from Chaipura to Nabire, then a five-hour rental car ride, one way across the river from the Gharzh to the sea.
There is no public transportation here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the wooden roofs surrounding the bamboo, iron leather roofs are all kinds of yellowish covers made of iron.
Very few Indonesians came here, let alone news reporters, and almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Mee Pagozh Babva believed in a god named Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here as well.
Daejeon said we're not used to wearing these clothes.She was referring to her brightly colored braided headscarf, dark shirt and bright half.
Previously, we covered our bodies with only leaves.
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and also the region with the highest infant mortality and lowest literacy rates in Asia.
But here is also Indonesia's golden island.
The Panay County is located on high ground, approximately the same area as New Jersey, with 153,000 people.The world's largest, most profitable gold mine, Glasgow, is only 60 miles away, and the mine is owned by the Philadelphia-based Philip McMoran Copper Gold Company.
In 2015 alone, Philips mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper in this area.
In addition, Papua's timber resources are very rich, with an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, these rich resources are also the source of the tragedy of the Babua people, and the powerful Indonesian military force has been able to suppress them continuously.
A 2005 investigation report by The New York Times showed that between 1998 and 2004, Phillip paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops, or as much as $150,000 per officer.
The Babs' demand for independence was growing stronger, threatening the Golden Lord, and they were subjected to cruel treatment.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, more than 500,000 Papua New Guineans have been killed, thousands raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass slaughter in the 1970s in the Babush tribal highlands has escalated to genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane, which included evidence of the worst atrocities of the previous year, including extrajudicial killings, torture, another report that rape and rape were particularly common, and the brutal crackdown on peace march demonstrations.
According to Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher with Human Rights Watch, violence occurs daily, so it is difficult to count the number of victims.
The resources of Babua attracted large numbers of immigrants outside Indonesia, and repression began.
83% of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but its demographic structure has changed since Muslim economic migrants arrived from the densely populated islands of Java, Garimandand, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
The Javanese snack bar sells fried and vegetable-mixed cardamom, served with peanuts.
The locals are struggling to resist.
A 24-year-old Panayzh native, who moved to Chiapra, a provincial assembly, to find work, explained that the immigrants began selling meat and vegetables at lower prices than the local Babua in the traditional market.
This caused the local Babua women (mama-mama) to lose their market.
Indonesian President Zoko Vidodo (often referred to as Zokowi) swore during his 2014 campaign to address the inequality and abuse of power in Papua.
The former carpenter on the road to the presidential palace in Jakarta has received support from 27 of the 29 districts, including Panay.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and today, the locals feel betrayed.
We are already broken in heart, and in 2014 we voted for Zokovy, hoping he could fulfill our wishes, restore justice.
In fact, only two months after Zokovy took office in October, Panijhai had the worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotali were singing Christmas carols in front of a fire outside, when two Indonesian soldiers suddenly rushed by on motorcycles.
The children were shocked and told they should turn on the headlights.
According to the local priest, Ayushit Tbay, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said the drunken soldiers used their guns to chase the children.
Then one of the soldiers fired a shot at the children.
16-year-old Julianus Yaemin was severely beaten and passed out in a coma.
Hours later, the building of the Election Commission of the nearby governmental body caught fire, and the next day the incident escalated.
About 1,000 young Babua men, women and children gathered in front of a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carry a ceremonial bow, jump the waita dance of the Babazh Mee Pago tribe, run around the circle, and imitate the bird.
Some protesters began to go to military posts and often throw stones.
According to an official document document document seen by the magazine Êó∂‰ª£zh, when the mood continued to heat up, soldiers received orders via internal radio: If the crowd resisted more than three times, immediate shooting was to be carried out. But this document was not released to local media.
Jeremiah Kaia, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotaly, sensed that a dangerous situation was imminent, and appealed to the crowd to calm down and urged them to return home.
But no one was in the mood to listen to him.
He stood on the porch of his brightly colored wooden house telling Time magazine that when I turned around, my left wrist suddenly shot.
Kaya'i still doesn't know who fired the shot, but he said the bullet came from among the soldiers who had gathered.
He added that the crowd was so full that they fired a lot of shots.
According to local sources, the brothers of Orpheus Euler's nephew witnessed a gunshot, saw three guns in Orpheus Euler's body.
Euhanez sadly told ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
I found out he was dead...and I kissed him.
Babua Police Superintendent Yuje Mend told reporters that his subordinates were only protecting the police station, as the police station was attacked.
In 2015, a spokesman for the Papua police, Police Chief Pujjo Suliscio, said that when someone threatens to kill us, we must defend ourselves.
This is a matter of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more wounded.
The news of the massacre spread slowly the next day only in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovy gave a loud and eloquent speech in Chaiprazh, expressing deep sympathy for the families of the victims, and vowing to solve the problem of the abuse of privilege of the historical heritage of Babua.
He said he hoped the case would be resolved as soon as possible so that this would never happen again in the future.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Villanueva said he would set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuse for leaving was also almost immediately answered.
He said, Most of the violations occurred long agozh
Some date back to the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have already made efforts to address these violations, but this requires a process.
Then, on June 5th, in Jakarta, Virando spoke to the magazine Zvezda, saying that he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Rather, he said that everything would be settled according to law.
The United Nations has already sued Vilanto for human rights violations in the 1999 bloody independent vote in East Timor, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,000 people, but he said 11 human rights violations in the Papua region have been resolved, including the Panjhai incident.
The family of the Panhai victims took a deep breath for these words.
Euhanez said that in the last three years, I have been interviewed four times, but nothing has improved at all.
Years later he said I was tired.
He still lives in fear now.
He said I was very scared.
I was afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid of being shot.
His brother Eukabus also believed that the people of Panizh were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said that after the body was buried, the military came to me.
The shooting has not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deai County, nearby Pani Ai County.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a man in a coma to the hospital, and the two sides clashed, killing one and injuring 17 others, including children.
A 24-year-old man, Raviyanus Doru, drowned while fishing in a nearby river, dying on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company's office.
Police said villagers threw stones at police, so police fired a warning.
But the anti-riot police started shooting at the crowd, killing one.
Dominguly Bady, 29, told Times magazine, "We were all panicked then, now afraid they would retaliate. He lived near the hospital, when he witnessed the injured being rushed to hospital".
I hid at home for two days.
The DAI parliament has called for the police to be brought to justice and the riot police to evacuate the area.
Panij has always been a no-go for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has fueled discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who are scattered in the central highlands of Panij.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel group that claims to protect the rights of the Papua people by hijacking Indonesian soldiers through dispersal raids and raids.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Panizhay, including Tadyuos Yugi and Daniel Yudas Kogaia.
As a result, thousands of Panayis have been arrested and deliberately detained in recent years by the military in an attempt to defend the sovereignty of the country.
Some of them have never appeared again.
To the Babva people, Paniay is a place of forgotten tragedy.
Poverty has grown to dissatisfaction.
Enarotaly sells rice that is poor, and the locals can't afford it.
Bread is almost impossible to reach.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly red chickpeas and some fruits and vegetables with leaves.
Farming is a woman's job, each woman can care for four or five blocks of red soil.
They usually use the majority of their harvest to retain writers, leaving the remainder to be sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of red tea are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has been drawn between local Babuans and new immigrants, and the number of these immigrants has increased dramatically since the opening of the new route to Nabireh Airport.
The small number of jobs that exist now usually fall into the hands of better educated and wealthier immigrants.
The Babs have few funds or skills to run a competitive company.
John Gobai, chairman of the Panay Tribal Council, said that young people do not want to stay in this village... because there is no work or money.
Babua is isolated from the rest of the world.
Furthermore, restrictions on international media coverage remain very strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudie and Basel Ronshan were expelled from Papua for not cooperating with relevant agencies, even though they had rarely received a filming license.
According to the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch for Asia, Felim Cain, Zokovyzh's withdrawal of the reporting limit to promote transparency and development in the election pledge was not met.
He said in a statement that if foreign journalists try to report on the most eastern Indonesian provinces of dissatisfaction, including Papua and West Papua, they are at a new risk: refusing visas and being blacklisted.
The lack of media oversight means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is basically limited to Papua's neighbouring countries.
In March, six Pacific countries - including the Pacific States of Âä†,È≤Å,Â∏ïÁΩó,ÂõæÁì¶È≤Å,È©¨ÁªçÂ∞îÁæ§Â≤õ,Á¥¢ÁΩóÈó®Áæ§Â≤õ - requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate all kinds of widespread human rights violations in Papua, including the Panyai shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arman Nataniel, who told a Jakarta reporter that he was not concerned about the allegations against the group, said Indonesia still has a democratic system, and media freedom, so evidence of human rights violations is difficult to cover up.
The locals want more attention from foreign governments.
According to a source, on May 4, Dutch human rights ambassador Kaes Van Bal, leading a delegation of officials, visited Chiapra, where the local people broke their silence, crying out, "We want freedom".
Indonesia will hold the next presidential election in 2019, but the Babua people say they are unlikely to vote for Zokovy again.
Gobay, the chairman of the tribal council, said that Zhakov's intentions were good, but that all those involved in the Paniya shooting were around him.
He wanted to let Zokovy know that the people of Paniay are not only living under the threat of a greedy army, but also that education, public health care, and other services in the region are scarce.
Gobai said that the people of Panizh, like other Babuts, felt that voting for Zokovy was a debt he had to pay.
He said they don't need money, they need justice.
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniyeh shooting still carried out their last symbolic rebellion: burying a victim's body across the street from the military police station.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let the culprits forget their crimes.
Eukabus nodded and said, "My family has been killed,
What else can we do?zh
With the help of capital, brands such as Sofia, Hollywood, Top firm are tailoring the home industry to their needs.On February 10, 2017, the Chinese Securities Commission approved the initial application of Guangdong Fashion and Home Delivery Stock Co., Ltd., which was issued for the first time on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, where more than 20 European homes in the Congo had already approved their initial IPO.

A fire once again engulfed the tower of the Dubai Fire Tower.
On Friday, a fire broke out in Dubai's tallest residential building, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter, 79-story building.
This was the second major fire in just two years to sweep through a high-rise building, and happened to occur in a skyscraper known as the "Fire Tower".
The building has been evacuated, no injuries were reported, and the cause of the fire has not yet been determined.
We were asleep, and then we were awakened by a fire alarm, and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to run down the 50th floor, a resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Authority, the fire brigade extinguished the fire around 4 a.m. local time (Greenwich Standard Time 0000) and is currently cooling the building.
The government said it was working hard to provide shelter for those affected.
This accident may again raise concerns around the world about the safety of high-rise buildings using exterior wall materials.
A survey conducted by the Meteorological Administration after its 2015 fire found that the majority of the damaged objects were overlayed wall panels used for decoration and insulation.
British police have already said they believe problems with the insulation and roofing system at the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire, which killed about 80 people.
The Williams Squadron also hinted that Massa might return, even though he had already announced his retirement.
With just a month to go before the opening of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on January 9, as the Olympic flame is transmitted from south to north, and the preparations are being conducted in a tightly packed atmosphere, the atmosphere of the Winter Olympics in South Korea is getting stronger.
South Korean officials are looking forward to this long-running Korean summit, which could bring a month's worth of rainbow eggs to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
On November 1st of last year, the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics fireworks arrived in South Korea.
The excitement of the Easter Rising was directly reflected in the ticket sales for the Winter Olympics in Beijing.
Just over two months ago, the ticket sales rate for the Winter Olympics were only 32%, and the ticket sales rate for the Winter Olympics were only 4.3%, and the low ticket sales rate once caused public concern about the popularity of the Winter Olympics in Beijing.
But as the chairman of the organizing committee of the Winter Olympics, Li Zhanfan, recently predicted to reporters, as the Holy Fire of the Winter Olympics spread throughout South Korea, the heat of the Winter Olympics was rising, confident that ticket sales would soon improve.
According to South Korean media reports, as of January 3, ticket sales for the Winter Olympics have reached 64%, and the ticket sales rate for the Winter Olympics has surpassed 50%.
To encourage foreigners to attend the South Korean Games, the Ministry of Justice of South Korea also announced on 8th June that foreigners visiting South Korea to watch the Winter Olympics would be extended their stay in South Korea, up to a maximum of 120 days.
The survey found that more than one-fifth of U.S. travelers boarded with illegal items.
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20% of passengers had intentionally or accidentally carried illegal items through the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration's checkpoint, and at least 6% of passengers accidentally boarded with prohibited tools or other blade-carrying items.
Less than 1% of passengers claimed they had only discovered they had travelled with a misplaced gun, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people conducted by the airline charter company Stratos Jet Charters Inc. found that young travelers are more likely to ignore regulations.
Of those who admitted to intentionally trying to carry TSAs on board, 19.7% were millennials, compared with less than 15% of the X generation.
The most common items that TSA security personnel intentionally stashed are food and beverages.
 Over 3% of respondents admitted to deliberately carrying a blade through the security checkpoint, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also said they deliberately carried illicit drugs on board.
The company said the survey of national travellers was conducted to find out how many people accidentally and intentionally carried smuggled goods through the airplane.
It is not surprising that those most likely to carry smuggled goods through security checkpoints - whether intentionally or unintentionally - are those who fly the most frequently.
However, the company notes that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and difficult to understand.
People are often unsure of what kind of fluid they can carry and how much they can carry.
So it's no wonder that the TSA seized the most illegal liquids.
It was once thought that the TSA might also ban books as prohibited merchandise.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry them.
The director of the Environmental Protection Agency, Prutch, changed his mind about the Obama-era emissions reduction regulations.
A day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Prutch reversed his earlier decision to postpone the Obama-era implementation of the regulations to reduce emissions of smoke-emitting air pollutants.
Prut proposed this change because, compared to previous governments, the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He did not mention the legal challenges raised by the Federal Court of Appeal against his former post.
The focus of the controversy is setting a deadline of October 1 for states to begin implementing the 2015 ground ozone standard.
In June, Prutzh announced he would delay the program for about a year, so that the EPA could have more time to study the program, avoid interfering with local decision-making or hampering economic growth.
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Prut was the attorney general of Oklahoma, and has long opposed stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Proud has repeatedly turned to restrict or delay regulations that oppose the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is one of the latest legal hurdles on the agenda for the return of Prut's regulatory oversight.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency's director of oversight, who sought to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's requirement that oil and gas companies monitor and reduce methamphetamine leakage, was required to do so.
In a statement issued Wednesday night, Prutter suggested that he had changed his attitude toward the ozone standard, said he needed to strengthen the EPA's commitment, cooperate with states, and adopt a complex process to reach new standards.
Prut said, Under previous government administration, the EPA usually did not meet the deadline, then waited for activist groups and other individuals to sue, then agreed to a deadline agreed to by agreement. He filed dozens of lawsuits against the EPA in his previous work.
 We do not believe in regulatory action, we take the deadline seriously.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously.
Nevertheless, the EPA's statement said, Prut may again use his extension authorization and all other legally available authorizations to ensure that the regulations comply with good policies and best available information.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a sweeping overhaul of the ozone layer regulations.
The House Bill, which was approved last month, is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who leads the state coalition, this week sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's reversal of the lawsuit - a victory that is of great importance to the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, and to the communities of more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smoke-emitting effects of the pollution - is a major victory for us".
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia joined the ranks of New York to participate in this case.
Ground ozone is formed by reacting with the common pollutants emitted by automobiles, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources of emissions under the sunlight of the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause severe respiratory problems for sensitive populations, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheer for Prut's amazing transformation.
Lori An Bird of the Center for Biodiversity said: "What is disturbing is that this common sense measure is under enormous pressure from the department responsible for protecting the air we breathe.
 We must fight the Trump administration to the end of the thought movement to address polluters and special interest groups

As the planting area expands, the quality of seedlings is continually improving, the value of the nursery stock is continually increasing, the high-specificity of the seedlings is more and more, and some seedlings are on sale.
Shheyong also reminded that in the face of the current booming market, producers should calmly face objective analysis, both seeing society's long-term and ever-increasing demand for flowers, and recognizing that market competition will become more intense.
In the morning news of July 13, 2013 Beijing time, US-based Somzhaltus filed a lawsuit in the East Texas District Court alleging that Apple infringed a patent on battery technology it applied for in 2010.
The company has previously filed similar patent lawsuits against Huawei, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.
The lawsuit alleges that the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices infringed upon U.S. patent 7,657,386, which is known as the Integrated Battery Service System.
The plaintiff wants to receive cash compensation, or to collect a patent fee for infringement equipment after the verdict is announced.
From the prosecution's judgment, the plaintiff appears to believe that the iPhone's fast charging capability violates the company's patent.
The fast charging iPhone will quickly charge to 80% of the power, after which it will be recharged.
Somaltus is actually a so-called "patent stream" because the company does not offer obvious products and services, and it is difficult to find relevant information online.
However, they have already successfully reached an out-of-court settlement on the patent with automakers such as Ford and Nissan.

According to leaked phone records, Trump had pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post leaked a record of conversations between US President Donald Trump and leaders from Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The US president reportedly expressed his displeasure over his public attack on the Berlin Wall, which Trump had allegedly told him: "Don't tell the media".
Trump pledged to build a wall along the southern U.S. border during his presidential campaign, and he reiterated his commitment to Mexico to pay for the project.
A record of his phone calls with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which showed a tense exchange between them, was also released.

The Mormons: activists repeated racist genocide, extended justice.
A 1948 Ford Mercury car passed through the small town of Menro, Georgia, and was driven by a group of spectators towards the small moorland bridge.
Before the car reached the bridge, a group of white men with guns, who were carrying four black passengers and a white driver, blocked the road.
The gangster's son - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - deeply sucked a cigar, his eyes into a glass of wine.
The passengers in the car are filled with fear.
We want to - Roger! - The man shouted.
Pull him out of the car!
A young black man was dragged from the front row passenger seat, screaming and breaking silence.
Fortunately, the horrific scene of July 22 was just a repeat.
However, when Roger's suit of clothes was being sued, almost all the surrounding audience exuded a genuine sigh.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Morzh Bridge, recreating the scene of two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Marcon and George and Merrill Dorothy - who were murdered by the K-Party that night in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"While we know who they are, although we have seen them in the community, but over the years they have not had a single arrest, this is incredible", said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the replay.
 This is the stain of history, the burden of our souls
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia state legislator and lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the rehearsal was a remarkable call for action, reminding the people of the Menlo community every year that the injustice was never corrected.
"We want to sue, we want to settle, we want to heal, we want to reconcile, but we must first get justice", he said.
 Unless we are granted justice, we cannot have healing and reconciliation
On July 27, 1946, the coroner's office placed a sheet over the body of a Morse murder victim.
According to FBI files obtained by the U.S. National Broadcasting Corporation, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in the murders.
But none of them have ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been in a state of remoteness for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motives behind the execution of the massacre are well known throughout the town: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens of Georgia to vote in the first primaries later that summer.
According to FBI statistics, around the same time, black farmer Roger Malcolm assassinated white landowner Barnet Hearst in a fight - it looked like it was for a woman.
According to Brooks, the town rumor was that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband.
The FBI reported that on July 25, 1946, prominent white landowner Lloyd Harrison spent $600 to bail Malcolm out of prison.
Dorothy and her cousins, Mary Merry and George Dorsey, accompanied him to prison.
However, as they returned from prison, and were about to reach the Morzh Bridge, a gang of suicide bombers surrounded the car.
It turns out that Harrison organized and ordered the murder, and an FBI report concluded that so.
 It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement agencies, which not only participated in the murder, destroyed evidence, but also concealed the identity of witnesses
Brooks is very simple.
He said,This is a disaster of voting rightszh.
 They were brutally murdered, the killer sent a message to the black people in the community: If you register and vote, you too will face the same fate'zh
For the past decade, Cassandra Green has been responsible for overseeing the annual reenactment of the Murder at the Moor Bridge disaster.
Her performance style is vivid, catchy, with a deeply racist background. Many people hope that racism no longer exists in the United States.
It's hard to see, not harder to see, but Green says that's the key.
"We don't want to talk about suicide because suicide makes us face the ugliness of everyone", she said.
But if you don't listen to me, or if you don't listen to me tell you about my experiences, I can't have a relationship with you.
This year's show began in June, with nearly 30 performers - dozens of white, the rest black - crammed into a room on the first day, listening to Green release a rehearsal of the show.
Wade Marzh served as co-director of Green.
Over the years, he has played the role of the Three K's Party, but he says this role was never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not that kind of person", says Marzh.
 But I think it's very important to keep this historical period alive, because we don't want to go back to that era.zh
In the room, actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Lascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnet Hearst, rehearse their lyrics.
When the play began, Malcolm shouted and pushed the heist, becoming angry with his sleeping wife Dorothy.
I said, "Roll out my floor plan!"
Lascona is back on the track.
Then they started to strike.
Then everyone (or at least all black actors) burst out laughing.
Green laughed the hardest.
What is it?!, Lascona asked.
He was frightened, confused.
Have I acted too much?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I just don't think white people say "ohh" when they respond.
Yes, another black actor is playing the role.
 Your accent must be toughzh
Thus, the energy in the room changed; the feeling of friendship drove away the discomfort.
Everyone strives to do this, not only to perform the play, but also to commemorate the four victims.
The scene has begun again.
This time, Lasconzh said this word, with a sharp and powerful tone.
There is no laughing stock.
The revival ended strongly and quickly.
Screaming, gunshots, and then, there's a silence.
A woman in a funeral dress in black stands beside the actor's body, singing Billy Halley's condolence for the strange fruit.
Her voice overwhelmed other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators were constantly wiping their sweat and tears.
Black and white people make up almost half of the audience.
A couple of specialists from New York's Issaca show, and many more live near the highway.
Brooks took them to the funeral services of Malcolm and Dorothy, a journey of almost eight hours, all of them enduring the uncomfortable humidity of Georgia.
Until now, the killer was still a fanatic. But now, standing on the same plot of land where the massacre took place, anxiety is in the air.
When the last note of the song disappeared, Green asked people to get closer to check the actor's body.
The children bowed their heads, staring at fake blood and corpses, whispering to each other.
They weren't really dead, a little boy was talking, as if reminding himself.
After a few minutes, Green thanked the crowd, and the show ended.
The actor opened the suicide rope, wiped his eyes.
Brad Shaw embraces a male male model in costume with the purpose of playing the three-K Party leader.
Nik Lasconara hugged his two colleagues, crying silently in their arms; the emotion in the performance eventually infected him.
It's okay, one of the women is a whisperer.
We know your innermost being is not like that.
You have a reason to do this.
Afterwards, the audience sat down to share a dinner with the cast.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted intimately with a black couple they had just met, talking about the rehearsal.
Denis Duplinsky found it difficult to find words to describe what she felt after watching.
It's hard to imagine the horrible words and actions... that people like you say or do because they look very much like you, she said.
 This for me, really makes me think that the assassination is still going on, she added, now this thing is simply called police shooting
In the room, Tilon Brooks sits at a table watching, tasting and tasting civil rights.
He said he had already started planning next year's show.
"Repetition is an inspiring way to describe the horrors we've experienced, but it's also very educational", he said.
 If you don't learn from it, this could happen again.
Those who do not study, do not understand their own history, are destined to repeat it.
The importance of the reforms to the pipeline independence is obvious for the reform of the gas market, but there is also much resistance and controversy.

Scientists at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University are studying laser satellites, which are used to clean up space debris.
According to the January 18 report, Chinese scientists have put forward a bold innovative proposal, using large lasers to clean up the messy Earth orbit, destroy old satellites and their sky debris.
According to the January 15 report on the US Newsweek website, researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper titled Traditional Space Shard Transformation Model Study, which describes how space shards can be reduced to smaller, less harmful pieces by laser radiation using a base-platform laser.
Space junk has been a concern of the International Space Agency for many years, and the U.S. Space Agency has considered multiple options for tracking, detecting and removing man-made debris.
Methods of removing large-scale space debris include a huge net of waste materials used to clean and collect, and magnets that can be used to remove them from orbit‚ô¶ Chinese scientists have conducted laser simulation studies, concluding that this would be an effective way to clean Earth's orbit‚ô¶
Summary of the paper:(Simulation Research) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris removal technology using the ground-based platform laser.
A 2014 study by Lockheed-Martin, a US defense industry giant, found that for satellites orbiting, there are about 200 threats per day.
High-speed debris along Earth's orbit is considered a serious threat to future space missions, described by experts at the European Space Agency as a series of lethal threats... Over the past year, high-speed debris has been steadily increasing.
According to the January 17th report of the American website, space is basically empty, but space adjacent to Earth is becoming increasingly crowded.Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris that runs around the Earth, and over time, these debris will pile up.
The more debris, the more likely it is that a satellite still in normal operation will be hit by debris, damaging or destroying a multi-million dollar investment.
All space agencies have developed plans to clear space garbage in the future.
NASA is considering using a jet of gas to slow the particles down, to take them off track, Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net, capturing the particles, and bringing them back to Earth, Japan's idea is to capture the particles using an electrical chain.
Now, China has also proposed a way to tackle space junk, which is to use a large laser to shred floating space junk into less harmful pieces.
According to a paper published in the German journal Zhopochemistry, a team of researchers from the Chinese Air Force Engineering University said that installing a laser like this on a satellite would clean up space efficiently enough, at least according to the simulation results.
The only way to confirm its effectiveness is to conduct tests, which are not yet scheduled, but someone may install a laser on the satellite and send it into space.
Once we do that, we can finally begin to eliminate the problem of space junk once and for all.

The U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has overturned the resolution after a lawsuit, delaying the smoking regulations.
During Obama's tenure, states issued regulations requiring states to regulate all types of smoke-causing emissions, 15 states sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for that rule.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday its decision to continue the implementation of the so-called 2015 ozone-depleting zone, and pledged to cooperate with states.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement, "We have full confidence in the dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to it".
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA planned to delay the implementation of the Ozone-Based Standard until October 2018, a one-year delay - according to the standard, measuring existing smoke pollution in some areas to determine which areas should reduce emissions of smoke pollution to meet air quality standards.

This is the first meeting between Maki Garcia and Vasily Lomashchenko, discussing the possible future of the final.
The most notable under 147 pounds boxing match will be held shortly after, with Vasily Lomachenko and Maki Garcia meeting for the first time on Thursday, while they are currently in a potentially conflict-prone situation.
They were in a separate room at the ESPN office in Los Angeles, where the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia led the way down the hall to greet World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion Lomazhchenko.
At the Showtime boxing match on Saturday, the referee unanimously ruled that Garcia defeated quarterback world champion Adrian Bruner to win, and so far, both boxers have finished in the top five of the same weight class.
Gacia stretched out her right hand and said: " Champion, are you okay?
I wish you good luck.
In a game on ESPN Saturday night at 7 p.m., Lomachenko defeated Miguel Mariaga, retaining his position.
When they took their two photos, Lomachenko's agent, Egis Klimas, noted that the potential confrontation between the two players depended on the perfect size.
I was a lightweight before, Gacia Tishto said.
I upgraded to fight against the Bronazh, but my weight is not that big.
Compared to 140 pounds, I weigh slightly less.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he must reach a lightweight level (zh135 lbs), then we can fight.
And that's what fans want.
Then we satisfy them.
Lomachenko has expressed his agreement.
The boxing world needs this fight.
Klimas asked if he should be charged a fee, and his part of the strategy was to have Lomachenko make his debut later this year against a 135 pound player, thinking next summer he would be facing Garcia (37-0,30) to set a date.
 Since all fans are asking this question, this match may be a one-off charge, Âä†Ë•ø‰∫ö said. Afterwards, he expressed an open attitude towards competition on the network that offers the best financial solutions
We are the main characters.
It is unlikely that others will generate such attention.
As long as they are ready......zh
Garcia admires Romatchenko being a great player and may be watching his Saturday boxing match live.
But Lomachenko hesitated to praise Garcia, saying he thought this three-division champion from Riverside looked too slow.
According to Garcia, the focus is on showing the strength of the fist, then the fight.
They both said they could feel the momentum of their own boxing match.
 This is a battle that must be fought,
The attention and enthusiasm of other boxing competitions are unmatched.
I am very happy to participate, says Garcia.
Romatchenko said: "I've been waiting for top fighters, this time it's Mickey's turn".
This will be a great confrontation.

The Chinese Development and Reform Commission officials' comments on the early completion of the eleventh and fifteenth emission reduction targets, allowing the steel industry, which is squeezing limited output, to have strong reproductive expectations.
While steel mills have not received a clear notification from the local government that the energy-saving work is over, industry estimates that around December 15, 2010, steel mills across the country that were originally restricted to production will continue to complete their production, steel prices will continue to rise or will begin to suffer pressure.
No notification has yet been received of the end of the production of the power limit, but in fact the pressure on various enterprises is already much greater than on October 9, a private steel company in Hebei province told reporters.
Some parts of Hebei have repeatedly lowered the electricity production limitation document, and once adopted a mandatory restriction method to limit enterprise production.
 The reporter learned from local businesses that at present the vast majority of Hebei's steelworks have been rebuilt, reducing production pressure.
My steel network analyst Zhangzhetsan predicts that, as the northern hemisphere has entered winter, the demand for terminal building materials will gradually weaken by a stronger decline.
In addition to the gradual end of the energy-saving emissions reduction, by December 15, most steel plants will be essentially re-producing, and products will continue to reach markets around the world before New Year's Eve.
Increased resource supply will put some pressure on the current stable steel prices.

The Swedish refugee age assessment test has published the latest results.
The Swedish refugee test uses the latest methodology, assessing their age from a medical perspective, the latest results show that over 80% of respondents are determined to be over 18, but not everyone believes its accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (Rttsmedicinalverket) began this test earlier this year.
After allegedly failing to accurately assess the age of some of the claimed minor refugees, the Swedish Migration Agency (Migration Agency) designed these tests in order to make a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Immigration Agency has sent out 6,880 test cases, and the Forensic Center has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
80% of respondents were determined to be 18 years of age or older, however, in another 25 tests, the Swedish National Center for Forensic Medicine determined that the subjects could be 18 years of age or older.
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was under the age of 18.
The test is only for people with age-doubts.
According to John Glantson of the Center for Forensic Medicine, these results are consistent with those of the previous few months.
He told The Local: These figures and those of the previous months are not very different, and the figures are exactly the same.
The high proportion of cases where convicted persons reach the age of 18 or older does not necessarily mean that the refugees lied about their age.
In May, the center released 581 test results, and said there were 442 cases that showed the subject was 18 years of age or older.
The Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 test results published this year, and found that 243 of the participants had publicly stated that they would turn 18 this year.
X-ray examination of IQ, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of joints, and then analysis by dentists and radiologists, this medical assessment method is also being questioned in some areas.
One of the suspects is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of Caroline College, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they experience puberty earlier or later than normal age.
He told the news paper Metrozh: "I have reason to think so, and I think the measurement method used should not be this way.
It is very inaccurate to determine the biological age in this way.
If we cannot guarantee accuracy, we should not pretend we can do it.
However, the forensic center's Glanton Center defends the accuracy of these tests: "In general, it can be said that judging a child as an adult is a small risk of uncertainty".
The greatest risk is that the person is just under 18, a condition that accounts for about 10 percent.
The governor of West Virginia announced a change of party.
On Thursday night, Democratic Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia announced at a meeting of President Trump that he would change the party.
"I like it or not, the Democrats have left me", the governor-general said.
Today, after much prayer and thought, I will tell you... Today I will tell you as a West Virginia native that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor.
The rally erupted with cheers.
"So tomorrow, I will change my party name to Republican", Justice added.
As a coach, I'll tell you it's time to start another game.
Earlier, Trump pledged to make a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42 percent of the vote in West Virginia, while Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice was named the state's only billionaire in 2016.
Forbes noted that he inherited his father's coal industry, owning coal mines in all five states.
Currently, his net worth is estimated to be about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying: "The change of the Justice Party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which will not only prevent our nation from becoming great again, but will make our nation great again".
 The Democratic Party currently has only 15 governors, and controls the number of state legislatures to the lowest ever, Justice Governor's statement is the latest rejection of a party that has lost leadership from top to bottom, failing to find a positive unified slogan, Republican National Committee chairwoman Rhona McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Sebastian Ko praised Russia for its candid apology for the doping scandal.
On Thursday, the president of the International Athletics Federation, Sebastian Ko, expressed his appreciation for Russia's apology for the doping scandal, saying the apology was very candid, but he reiterated that now was not the time for Russia to re-enter the sport.
At the International Tennis Conference on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics, Russian Athletics Federation President Dmitry Shirakhdin said that his country's ban on the sport was correct, and that he was determined to fight doping.
He expressed regret that all the athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were stripped of their medals.
Despite his comments, the International Tennis Association still voted in favor of maintaining the ban.A previous report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) mentioned that evidence had been found that Russia sponsored the use of doping, and the ban was implemented in November 2015.
I think today's response is very candid, very candid introduction, the International Tennis Association chairman's office told reporters.
 The whole council and the whole of the Tennis Association are pleased......The Russian Federation admits that it has been going through a very heated period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can participate again in the competitionzh
Ko said he was also very happy that Russia accepted the criteria for re-entry.
I think this is a very constructive day, and I think we have made some progress, but the recommendation of the panel of experts, supported by the United Athletics Conference, is not yet the time to restore Russia's eligibility for competition, said Áßë.
We need to do everything we can to make this a normal situation in the coming months.
Our guiding principle has always been to want to separate clean athletes from contaminated systems, he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict standards of International Tennis Federation will compete as neutral athletes at the World Championships in Athletics on Friday in London.
Wynn Anderson, head of the International Tennis Team, said Monday that Russia has not yet met several criteria for re-establishing the competition.
After speaking to the International Council of Athletics in London, he told reporters that drug testing was still insufficient, and that a banned coach was still coaching.

How do the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris?
The rules designed to prevent European luxury football clubs from being restricted in spending do not prevent Neymar from moving from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain in France (PSG) for a record price.
The result was a further downgrading of the UEFA European Football Association (UEFA) to Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.The UEFA is the governing body of European football matches, and has the right to ban teams from participating in the much-awaited UEFA Champions League.
The 2011 UEFA Financial Fair Competition Rules (FFP) introduced by the UEFA meant that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club would ultimately have to prove Neymar's transfer was financially supported without causing huge losses.
Barcelona have already paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to pay the Brazilian player's salary, while Neymar's salary will be in the tens of millions of dollars a year.
Below are some of the financial implications of Neymar's move to France.
Given that the team's funding comes from the financially-deprived Qatari ruling family, Paris Saint-Germain Football Club can of course sign Neymar with cash and add him to the squad of other star-studded clubs.
The clubs can spend huge sums of money to buy players, but they must use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge expenses, allowing them to achieve a loss-and-loss balance in football-related businesses.
 Financial fair competition rules is a concept proposed by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believes that for clubs that build up a high debt base to pursue success, if the bank or everyone else withdraws support funds, they are in fact cheating, putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the  rulezh shifted from the club's debt problem to the monitoring of the club's loss situation.
This change means that the business model used by Roma Abramovich when he bought Chelsea in 2003, that is, to buy a potential club, then invest heavily in improving the team and establishing a global brand, is now facing a more difficult situation.
During the three-year evaluation period up to 2018, the club could lose 30 million euros.
Despite Abu being ousted by the incumbent president in 2015, UEFA successor Alexander Ceferin is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"Of course the rules have not yet expired, we will certainly strengthen future regulations", Andrea Traverso, the UEFA's head of rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although Paris Saint-Germain will pay Neymar's terms and conditions once, it can also allocate the amount according to accounting purposes within the contract period.
Neymar has already signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee may be shown in the next five years' annual accounts as a fee of 44.4 million euros.
The first wave of sanctions imposed in 2014 has put the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, as well as the Abu Dhabi-based Manchester City club, under the most severe sanctions.
Paris Saint-Germain FC was fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the time), later reduced to 20 million euros, and demanded that the team reduce its players to 21 instead of the normal 25 players in the 2014-15 Champions League.
UEFA is looking at clubs that try to increase their income by linking up with club owners, cheating financial regulators.
Although Qatar's companies can sponsor Paris Saint-Germain, if the amount of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market price, then UEFA will not consider it a legitimate income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount of Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was exaggerated.
According to reports, Neymar's share of the revenue of Paris Saint Germain Football Club may come from payments made by the Qatar 2022 World Cup organising committee.
However, both Paris Saint-Germain and the organising committee deny Neymar will be serving as World Cup ambassador, and it is easy for the UEFA regulator to make such a move.
The recent sanctions imposed on Paris Saint-Germain mean that UEFA will be more vigilant about any attempts to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, sources familiar with the matter said that UEFA had not discussed with Paris Saint-Germain FC the transfer of Neymar.
All of the above individuals contacted the Associated Press anonymously, as they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
According to the last published accounts, Paris Saint-Germain Football Club's operating income in 2015-16 was 542 million euros, with a profit of more than 10 million euros.
The accounts for the previous financial year have not yet been disclosed.
Paris Saint-Germain football club expects Neymar's membership to bring good news to sponsorship, franchise and shirt sales.
The club expects revenues after the signing of Neymar to grow by at least 30%
Obviously, seeing the most famous of them leave, the Spanish league was furious, tried to block Neymar's move, and claimed that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was violating the rules.
The president of the Premier League, Javier Tejbas, told Spanish newspaper AS, that this was a clear example of a 'financial doping', the same club and country, referring to Qatar, which has final ownership of the Paris Saint-Germain football club.
Arsenal team (the club is owned by American sports giant) head coach Arsene Wenger, has reservations about the club's state-funded attitude and the Western Premier League.
 This is the result of ownership, which has completely changed the entire ecology of football over the past 15 years, Wenger said Thursday.
Once a country has a club, anything can happen.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the rules, because for a country, there are many different ways or various interests to require players representing a country.

The first day of camp was met with a strong response, but not only because of its absurd humor.The story is about an original story about a vegetable head that will speak, voiced by H.J. Benjamin.)
The double use of the core laughing stock - a middle-aged actor playing a child of the age of the egg - in the plot makes it a joke to not be able to go back in time.

Some of them have good visual effects, and the police watch chess on TV, and send time, because Americans like football.)
And many famous voice actors - including Jenny Schrett, Nick Overman, Mahesh Hashbaz Ali and Kolo Sevini - have created a wonderful soundtrack.
However, Detective Duolingo is so committed to creating a noisy, realistic propaganda comedy - the show features a killer wearing a Reagan mask - and he usually plays such a role.
The six-episode television series is slightly drawn, and the comedy effect is not released fast enough or often enough.

A recent interview with a journalist revealed that the benefits of steel, rail transport, shipping, mechanical engineering and other industries in the Northeast region have generally declined, even resulting in losses.
Some experts believe that, under the current situation, the new wave of industrial revival in the Northeast is not only related to the recovery of the national economy, but will also affect the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, so wait for the adjustment and transformation.
The general decline in corporate profits in traditional industries and the current losses in raw material industry and heavy machinery manufacturing, the decline in profits and even losses, is the main manifestation of the downturn in the economy in the Middle East and North Africa.
In the past, in economic downturns, the main characteristics of low-end, primary products were affected, but in this economic downturn, the traditional industrial high-end, low-end industrial products of the Northeast are affected.
Starting with the adjustment of product structure in recent years, focusing on the development of high-end boards such as container boards, steel rails, boards and consumer electronics, however, this year sales of these varieties have all declined significantly, especially boards, which fell by 50% compared to the same period last year.

The Bank of England will maintain an interest rate of 0.25%.
The Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will remain the same, as previous weak economic growth and loose inflation have already ruined hope for a higher rate.
The Bank of England has warned that as it strengthens its interest rate control while tightening household income, economic growth will continue to weaken.
The decision-makers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to maintain the 0.25% interest rate, while a small minority of members this month called for a higher rate, even if weak economic growth had weakened the leverage of the upward trend.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England shrank its growth forecast for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7 percent and 1.6 percent respectively, and warned that the family income tightening would continue, while inflation would rise to nearly 3 percent in the fall.
But it said that in the coming years, it would be necessary to raise interest rates to contain the inflation brought about by Brexit, while borrowing costs may need to be adjusted more substantially than expected from the financial markets.
A year ago, a large-scale economic promotion policy was implemented under the influence of Brexit, and its members voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce a suspension of its regular financing scheme, starting in February next year to provide low-cost finance to banks, although the bank said that under the scheme, the bank currently needs an additional ¬£15 billion on the basis of ¬£115 billion.
In a record of the interest rate decision-making meeting, the Bank of England said: In the core forecast of the MPC, GDP remains weak in the near term, as the real household income tightening will continue to squeeze consumption
Regarding interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for monetary policy tightening to suppress inflation, and to a greater extent than market expectations.
The current market is expected to achieve its first growth in the third quarter of next year, and its second growth in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any upgrades would be slow and controlled.
The bank's growth forecast for this year and next year is downward, while its May forecast was 1.9% and 1.7% respectively.
The bank maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.
The exchange rate against the dollar has fallen, followed by the euro.
The exchange rate against the dollar fell 0.5%, reaching 1.31, and the euro fell 0.4%, reaching 1.11.
Before this unchanging decision emerged, the increasingly upward expectations were shattered by recent unopposed growth data.
The bank said growth in the third quarter could remain at 0.3%, although it will rise slightly by the end of the year.
The average household is hit hard by the inflation boom, while wage growth is negligible, and the Bank of England's recent inflation report did not bring them any good news, as the bank said the tightening would get worse before it got better,
It also said that monetary policy could not prevent a blow to income over the next few years, but wages are expected to recover in large numbers by the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, as the value of the pound sterling increases sharply, the demand for British goods will increase, the economy will be stimulated, offsetting some of the effects of low consumption.
A year before the decision was taken, a shocking EU referendum caused the pound to plummet, and the August interest rate was lowered to 0.25%.
The Bank of England estimates that it may take four years before it has a full impact on the price of goods and the UK economy.
Before the bank announced its latest interest rate ruling, the call for interest rate hikes was heard, as inflation has added to the snowfall of the average family already under heavy pressure, while three policy makers called in July for the rate to be raised to 0.5%.
Inflation last month fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank of England said this was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that the overtaking of its target of 2% was already the final bottom line of the weak pound.
Andrew Montrec, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in the interest rate, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more competitive again, as lenders strongly call for more business and look forward to drawing up a perfect line for this year".
For those who may be close to closing an existing transaction, such a market looks particularly advantageous, as re-possession is becoming increasingly popular.

The UK's NHS has opened the green light for controversial HIV drugs.
After the High Court has decided the drug-funding issue for the NHS, patients will be able to receive a transformative HIV prevention treatment starting in September.
NHS England announced that Pre-Exposure Prevention (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sexual intercourse, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk populations by around 86% and is now being offered by healthcare providers to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year initial trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after the appeals court upheld a High Court ruling last year.The ruling said that although the NHS claimed local authorities should fund the drug, the NHS was entitled to pay the costs of PrEP.
The move announced Thursday was described by NHS UK chief executive Simon Stevens as a major new intervention, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a pivotal moment.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to register as registered sex health clinics. More clinics will be added in October, followed by full implementation across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylactic drug (PrEP) is an HIV drug that is taken before sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Trials have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce the spread of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that there is enough specific medication in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This medicine can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The group of people eligible for treatment includes gay, bisexual, transgender men and HIV positive carriers who have not received treatment.
The clinic will identify eligible and consenting trial participants, including men, women, transgender people and their sexual partners, and unknown people who are receiving antiretroviral therapy.

High quality living: application of the building and the ingenious design, transforming the small condo into a spacious home.
Joanne Ray, a former banker, was very keen on home improvement, and in 2014, she moved from her large house on Knight Bridge to the small apartment at the county court.
The apartment is located on the first floor of a stylish Queen Anne terrace - Joanne didn't pack her bags and sold them, which is a powerful testament to the new design.
"Before that, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a bigger house on Knight Bridge", JoAnn said.
I was looking for a house with a good price tag.
I saw this apartment in the county court, and its ceiling was very high.
I'd love to, but I made an offer that day.
After first viewing the room, this 1,000 square foot apartment has now been completely renovated.
This apartment was originally a complex single room layout - it needed to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - and Joanne wanted to add storage space and floors to make the most of the height of the ceiling.
I want a high ceiling, large windows, and plenty of light.
That's my request, she said.
To this end, she hired Elvan Azadi from Duck&Shed, an architectural and design studio in Nottingham, to use this 12.5-foot-high ceiling to carefully build a home.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to add two upper and lower spaces, so the architectural challenge is to create a building that is tall enough to stand.
Ervan must play creative, creative, to solve this problem.
 Steel structure is quite complex,he explainszh
 We must arrange space, make it stand up and down, and not need shoulder arches.
Not only is it as simple as building a simple platform, but it is also necessary to move these steels so that they are at the right height or altitude to achieve the function.
By this arrangement, Elvan was able to get two full-height rooms in the space - adding many elements of fun to them.
The building uses retrouvius branded antique bronze windows, overlooking the charming living area.
Golden furniture with mirrors, silver pieces of furniture and Serge Mouzhille's retro lighting laid the foundation for the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing atmosphere, space and light.
If mirrors are installed on either end of the short corridor, it can make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a mirrored safety panel is like a window into another room.
In the front door, a small window with mirrors provided storage space for Joanne, for the storage of dining and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an attractive sense of space, being able to collect the kitchen when not in use.
Folding kitchens are not new.
But what is unique about this folding kitchen is that it has a garage-style elevator door.
 Here, with knowledge in some engineering fields, Elvan explains the steel reinforced MDF gate.
 This is based on the principle of balance, so when you push the door, it is easy to slide.
Thanks to clever use of space and resources, Joanne was given an additional 16 square meters, plus a bedroom and an improved layout.
 Ultimately, what you sell is the area of the house - or your property valuation is based on the area of the house, says Ervan.
 Basically, the real estate agent would walk into the room and calculate based on the size of the floor.zh
They will manage to increase the space, while using quality materials, thus bringing a luxurious feeling to the space.
Ervan says,zh materials are your personal choice, so it helps to create emotional bonds in the home.
You won't fall in love with the power supply on the wall.
These things are important, but they won't hold you back.
As it turns out, with a good design and an additional area, standard apartments can swing to your surprise.
In fact, you might, like Joanne, choose to live.

The brothers played a $500 million real estate empire fighting for World War II.
Forty years after their Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers set out to fight the Great War for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth over $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a mansion in the Tucala area, three blocks from where his brother Paul lives.The latter sued him in the Supreme Court over the division of their real estate and business assets.
Since 2014, Paul had been wanting to break away from the family business, but the two brothers sparked a heated argument in the Supreme Court over the division of assets.
The brothers and their mother together own 38 properties, worth more than $500 million, which have accumulated steadily since the family bought them in 1973 in the Collingwood neighborhood of Smith Street.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, and gradually expanded it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company was sold for $85 million.
Later, that money was put into real estate.At present, the DeRuthis family's portfolio includes city offices, Blenrich and Sorrento development projects, the Gold Coast and Blair Mountain apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, known to his younger brother Paul as the main promoter and dominant figure in the Dezhrutis family, owned about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul owned about one-third.
According to court documents, according to the settlement, the assets of Colin were worth $316 million, while those of Paul were worth $176 million.
Paul believes that the division of real estate and cash proves to be the symptom of negotiations.
Colin's Property Divide Proposal left him with what I consider to be the best property he had, he wrote in a first court oath in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the Supreme Court held its first hearing.
Now, the two brothers are still fighting for control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has taken him out of the game.
Colin denied this, accusing Paul of not managing certain properties.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed his hope of resolving the dispute.
 My Italian tradition dictates that the family is the most important choice My Italian ancestry dictates that the family is the most important, he wrote
The cost of the case is rising steadily, and there are hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and company reports submitted by Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, top law firms, Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Mrs. DeRutis and her late husband Luigi were both Italian immigrants.They started running mass catering and grocery stores in the late 1950s, and in the early 1970s, they bought a store in Brunswick.
They used the mortgage to buy the Colinwood property, where Colin opened the family's first cowboy shop.
Colin said, "I was in high school when I was three, and he started Westco there, and at the time, Paul was very young (about 10 years old).
Anna de Rutis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass the property on peacefully to their son.
Louis Giezh often told me that he never wanted the brothers to finally appear in court.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of the DeRuthis Group of Companies, and Colin said that when Mark left the company, he paid him $10 million and Luke $26 million.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark both expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of their property division.
According to a biography published in 2015 by television star Eddie McGuire, although Colin is a former AFL club board member, he has remained low-key.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul, as well as their lawyer, on Friday.
However, only Colin responded by texting him, saying that since the case had already been submitted to the court, I really couldn't say much.
"My brother Paul chose to sue me and take our family affairs to court, which is very, very sad", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he had tried to satisfy his brother's demands.
He said: "Our father does not want to see Paul and I end up with a dispute like this one we have today, and he still hopes that the dispute will be resolved".
Friday, this hope seems to have been shattered.
 Our problems will soon be resolved through the courtszh, Colin wrote

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media time.
Others have tried, but all have failed.
John F. Kelly may actually be able to do that.
If so, he is the first.
According to the US political news website Politico, the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports, in order to ensure greater employer stability.
Here is a quote from journalist Josh Dawsi:
When new White House chief of staff John F. Kelly began his first day of work and discussed meeting with senior officials, he noted that he needed to address a major problem President Trump faced in the White House: the flow of bad information into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information helps the president make better decisions, so information is needed only through his hands, whether in writing or in brief.
Kelly's diagnosis is similar, but others have tried to convince her by monitoring Trump's media time, but all ended in failure.
President Trump's television roots are long gone, and now in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still deep.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Nazhberg told Politico: "If candidate Trump is frustrated with the unfair reporting, it will be very helpful to let him know that he has also received positive reports through trustworthy channels".
Tallahassee Palmerie of Politico wrote at the time, Based on the experience of six former campaign officials, the focus of controlling Trump's tweeting habits is to ensure that the media information he receives personally has always contained a certain amount of praisezh.
That's totally fine.
But the notion that Trump's Twitter habit was once controlled is actually ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know - that without their intervention, Trump's tweets would have even been more heated.
We may never know those tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his employees were able to save him from the water and fire, even if only a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing groups, people are promoting their worldview, flourishing their cause, and advancing their cause through the delivery of information that may or may not be reliable to Trump.
Politico reported in May that the advisers were keen to provide the president with suspicious information strategically.
Here is an example of what journalist Shane Goodmancher described:
 According to current and former Trump officials, Trump's reaction to negative news clips such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with destructive information leaks, would make him madly seek to find out the source.
In late February, someone maliciously copied an article on the website GotNews.com of the cyber instigator Charles C. Johnson to the president, who sued Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh for the source of the massive leakage of information to the White House, which was Trump's performance at the time.
Even though Johnson has been banned for life for tweeting harassment, he has not provided any concrete evidence, and he has blasted out a number of false accusations, which he later publicly denied.
Trump read the article and then began asking officials about Walsh's situation.
Goodmancher also said that then-Chairman Raines Prebas and White House Secretary Robert Porter tried to establish a system to manage and record the files Trump received.
What is the result?
Kelly intends to do the same thing, three months later.
He may prove himself to be a more efficient administrator than Pribbas, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his aides are still competing with each other, competing for influence.
These perennial influences will make it harder for Kelly to do his job.

Essentially, a tourist-friendly town is a complex open tourist attraction, rather than a shared living space shared by locals and foreign tourists and even travelers.

Italy has taken a tough stance on non-governmental migrant rescue boats.
Italy has issued a warning to non-governmental organizations operating migrant rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that unless they sign new rules for operations management, they will not be allowed to continue rescue operations.
Interior Minister Mark Minnitti said in an interview with the Turin Daily News: "If NGOs do not sign new rules of conduct, it is hard to see what they will do next".
The day before the warning was issued in Minniti, Italian officials suspected that the crew of a ship on which the German aid organization Youth Rescue was operating actually plotted against human traffickers, assisted illegal immigrants and seized them.
The aid group has only been in operation for a year and refused to comment on the specific allegations of Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
The group said in a social media statement, "Saving lives for us is now and will be the most important thing for the future, so we regret that we cannot currently operate in the search and rescue area".
 After collecting all the information, we can only assess all the allegations and situations at this time.zh
Italian officials have been monitoring the Iuventa ship, a youth rescue organization, since October.
Its crew were suspected of carrying traffickers of migrants who had been transported directly by small boats, and allowed smugglers to rush away, reusing the vessels.
 According to the prosecutor's records, at least one such meeting allegedly took place in the sea 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast. The document was published by Italian media.
Its crew is alleged to have publicly disregarded the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees the area's rescue efforts out of humanitarian zeal and not any other motivation.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as the Iuventa clearly require an Italian officer to supervise their activities on board.
Currently, of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations, only three have agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct, namely: Save the Children, Malta-based migrant maritime aid station and Pro-Activa Open Arms, Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring any significant changes and obstacles to its relief efforts.
Among the organizations that refused to sign were the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the number of migrants arriving in Italy has plummeted in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libya's coast guard and to unite local mayors have seen initial results.
The minister said: "In recent days, we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel.
He announced plans for a deep-rooted meeting this month: discussing economic development with various Libyan mayors, and discussing with Chad, Niger and Mali how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave these countries for Europe.
Chief financial officer of Transport Bank, Lien Ping said that as the industrial value added in the first three quarters of 2017 was characterized by the end of the quarter, it is expected that the industrial value added growth in December could accelerate to 6.6%.
Fixed-asset investments are expected to grow at a cumulative rate of 7.2% in December, down from last year, compared with the same period last month.
Although industrial production will be weaker in October, it remains essentially stable with November.
While in December Chinese manufacturing investments were running low, but infrastructure investments improved slightly, so it is expected that fixed-asset investments will remain flat in November.
More than twenty million people entered the United States, mostly for smuggling; being abroad, returning home without hope, separated from loved ones, and similar scenes continually occurring.
Beijing High Schools: New initiative: Northern Chemical University students will be relocated to the new campus in Pyongyang.
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Beijing Chemical University was held in Beijing's Pyongyang district, where the 1,800 square meters green campus was officially put into use.
The journalist learned from the ceremony that in recent years, in the context of the consolidation of the core functions of the capital, the governance of the larger cities, the development and disengagement of non-capital functions in Beijing, Beijing has accelerated the move of the Central City High School to the suburbs, and that some high school students have been gradually relocated to new campus in the suburbs of Shunxi, Daxing, and Xinjiang.
The new campus of ÂåóÂåñÂ∑• is located in the town of Âπ≥ÂçóÂè£, covering an area of 1,800 square kilometers, 40 kilometers from the city center, and is one of the key projects in Beijing's city of Beijing to remove non-capital functions.
The new campus is being built in three phases, the current phase is fully completed, the second phase is expected to be fully operational by the end of this year, and the entire post-construction program will meet the needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty members to learn and live.
Looking back at this year's film market, we find that the original script of the film and two sets of stars, both of whom are in attendance, have become an important part of the film's anticipated audience.
At 17:10 today, the 119 command center of Zhongyang City received an alert for a fire that broke out at the storage of a large-scale industrial plant in the city's Zhongqing district.
The Èò≥ City Fire Department immediately deployed 5 squadron 20 fire trucks carrying heavy chemical weapons, chemical weapons, and other equipment to the scene.
After initial detection, the fire started as a small storage of chemicals such as 4zh, which generated a larger amount of smoke.
As of the press release, firefighters are straining rescue, municipal health, safety, environmental, security, transportation, and other departments have successively rushed to the scene, with no injuries reported.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to life in prison for the suicide of Conrad Roy by texting.
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for the suicide of her boyfriend via text and phone.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months in prison, which can be commuted to probation after the expiration of the term.
Carter was convicted in June of involuntary manslaughter against Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is devastated.
My son is my best friend.
While awaiting appeal, Carter was allowed to remain free.
She faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, but her attorney's office believes she and Mr. Royzh both suffer from mental illness.
At the time of the sentencing, Carter was standing, wearing a red shirt and a pink mask, with both hands clasped, two eyes with eyes, and eyes wide open.
 Her actions killed Conrad Royzh, the prosecutor told the court.
She ended his life to live a better life for herself.
She did not take responsibility for the incident, prosecutors said.
She has no regrets.
But Carter's lawyer said it was a terrible consequence, which she regretted deeply.
However, Justice Lawrence Moniz said he did not find her age or maturity, nor did her mental illness have any significant effect on her behavior.
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said, "I have not spent a day not grieving the loss of my beloved son.
I hope he is proud of me and everything I have done.I am trying to stand with him and his sisters in all my pain, and these pains will accompany us forever.
Mr Roy's sister, Caddy Roy, testified that she was never able to attend her brother's wedding or become his child because she realized she could never be his child.
Losing someone who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and I will live with it for the rest of my life.
This case seems to have set a legal precedent, as Massachusetts law does not provide that anyone else commits suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his car; this year, Carter was 17.
Carter's text message revealed that she had committed suicide, and the case sparked national attention.
There are many ways to hang, jump, stab himself, she said in a few text messages sent two weeks before his death; he was on vacation with his family at the time.
In the time before he committed suicide, she wrote: "You need to do this, Conrad, all you have to do is start the generator, and then you will gain freedom and happiness".
Judge Monitz said Carter gained attention through Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media outlet.
In this case, there is a legal disagreement.
Among the few people who have defended Carthage, Amanda Knox was one of them, who was accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007, and was acquitted two years later.
In a column article in the Los Angeles Times, Mrs. Knox, 30, said: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not imprisonment".
Zhang Zhaoqi is destined to be a controversial film artist, since he started shooting his first film, he has also garnered a lot of uncontroversial rewards while leading the Chinese film scene.
Reporter2 learned from the Lhasa Net Earth Basketball Club that recently, the Lhasa Net Earth Basketball Junior Team finished fourth in the National Junior Basketball League Final in Beijing.
The Lhasa Net Earth youth basketball team consists of 11 local players, with head coach Lhasa Net Earth men's basketball senior team assistant coach Sub‰ªÅÊ°ëÁè†.
A Tibetan basketball player who was traveling to Beijing for the final.
Liang Jun-sup, general manager of the Lhasa Netball Club, told reporters that the team's performance has improved significantly, players' confidence and grasp of the field has improved significantly compared to last year.
After the game, team captain Jiang Zhou said he hopes to do his best for the Tibetan basketball career by gaining experience by participating in the game.
It is understood that in the Beijing Games, players overcame factors such as low altitude intoxication, displaying a Tibetan image.
Although athletics at the Olympics is a gold medal, and athletes are under the stars, the name of the sport is still in the air, more than gold-digging.
The car manufacturer is facing a shock, and Audi will upgrade up to 850,000 diesel vehicles.
The day before Audi announced the upgrade, BMW said it would provide software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW believes that driving has more intelligent choices than restrictions, meaning that major European cities - including Munich, where BMW's headquarters are located - are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it would refurbish three million European Mercedes cars to reduce diesel emissions.
No company has claimed recall.
European automakers are promoting diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
But the pollutants emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
The cost of installing automakers' equipment to offset diesel exhaust emissions is also increasing, so it is difficult to keep diesel cars competitive in price.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government led by Prime Minister Angela Merkel has also been accused of overindulging in these powerful car companies and of ignoring various signs of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid repeating the mass-produced cover-up, that is, masking their use of the so-called failed device, adjusting emissions during vehicle testing to meet legal regulations, and returning to normal driving conditions.
Several executives at the company have been charged in the United States, while other executives are under investigation in countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermo-mechanics at the Audi engine research and development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zacchero Giovannini Pumio, who is Italian and therefore not subject to extradition protection, may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the general public, the German government accusing Audi installation systems of evading European emissions requirements, expanding the scope of the investigation previously limited to the United States.
Audi is likely to have a significant impact on the general public: luxury car manufacturers account for a disproportionate share of the profits of Volkswagen.
A film, from preparation to release, takes a year or two, even years, to be said to be a regular occurrence.
The animated film Â§ßÈ±ºzhÊµ∑ announced ahead of schedule to be released on July 8, a film that took 12 years from pre-production to release!
Liang Guo, 21, from Qinghai University of Heat and Power, co-founded the company Beyond the Sun with his friend Zhang Chun, which received a million-dollar venture capital investment from a joint venture in 2008, launched the animated film Virgin of the Sea.
The film has won numerous awards at home and abroad during its creative sample stage, and has been acclaimed by the Centre d'Art Contemporain du Pidu in France as one of the most outstanding works of art.
Due to the six years of production from its creation, the film was dubbed the Godcat by millions of fans.
Â§ßÈ±ºÊµ∑zh tells a Chinese fantasy story. With the release of this prequel trailer, it brings a whole new expectation to all audiences.
Liang said: "I've only done this for 12 years, now it's become a reality from a dream, I'm both nervous and excited".
Zhang Chun said: "When people think about using one-fifth of someone else's budget, doing the exact same picture effect as everyone else, the team is going crazy with me".
The Dong World Factory, which once relied on the processing of materials and the construction of large quantities of workers, is now focusing on the high-level talent who can lead the city's relocation.
During the recent week of high-level talent events organized by the East Japan City government, the first financial reporter saw that some of the strongest local businesses were taking part in the talent talks.
On the brightly colored billboards on the red wall, each one marked a price tag that was unsatisfactory.
Therefore, the Association of the Television Production Industry of China decided to unite the national television production industry and sign the Convention on Autonomy.
The province of Provence is threatened by climate change.
Clothing has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is bad news, it is being threatened by climate change.
Due to the ongoing drought and the emergence of virus-carrying insects, the garment is declining, leaving scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution with headaches gone.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute of Agriculture in Provence (CRIEPPAM), said: "The Provence's garment industry is facing a major threat because in recent years the plant has been affected by climate change, with significantly reduced spring rainfall and prolonged autumn hail.
This will affect the life cycle of the clothing.
There is also a smaller individual, a species of leafy shell that can spread microorganisms, and in very dry weather, they appear in large numbers.
The key is that their numbers are enormous.
Apart from attracting tourists to the clean, well-kept garment shop, garment oil is also sought after by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric Jones says: "Unlike plants that can grow many large flowers, with long-grain seeds, we have problems with smaller individuals, poor development, lack or weakness".
So our essential oil content is less.
Solutions under study include adopting better irrigation techniques and reducing soil moisture evaporation, spraying protective mixtures of clay and water on plants, and developing more drought-resistant varieties.
In contrast to the science fiction elements in the film, the two main characters have expressed their greater interest in the story in the film.
On the afternoon of September 5, the reporter of the Washington Post, who interviewed several prominent figures in the photojournalism industry, and two photojournalism artists, were surprisingly almost unanimously silent.
One was a Berlin film magnate, one was an up-and-coming young actor, and one of the first female partners of Li Lizheng and Xuan.
Mexico's dangerous heavyweight, journalist killed
The entire staff of the Riodocezh Weekly usually gather on Wednesdays to review their reporting plans on the Sinaloa riots, which were caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and an endless drug war.
But today, as the shadow of tragedy overshadows themselves, they gather to discuss security issues.
They are told that it is important to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed which one made them feel safer: whether to take their children to their offices (the office was hit by a grenade in 2009) or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemy, neutral, and ally.
They have these journalists listing names under each of them without needing evidence, observation, or intuition.
If there are any doubts about the government's list of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists, or the cartel, these thugs are putting the reporting work in Mexico at risk.
Violence has never ceased, and the country is full of journalists: according to the records of the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been killed since President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after being attacked and threatened; so far this year, at least 7 journalists have died in seven states.
The last one to die was their editor and inspiration, as well as Havel Valditz Cardness, co-founder of Riodocezh.
Valdis has written many books on drug violence, one of which he wrote: "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist".
Everyone can feel deeply that he has left, although he is everywhere with a huge photo hanging in front of the Riodoce office building, Valdis with his middle finger, the motto justice; Aaron Ivala and Miriam Ramirez, two 30-year-old journalists wearing T-shirts that also show his smile, wearing glasses or his iconic Panama straw hat.
The workshop was held less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, according to records from the Committee to Protect Journalists, the office has prosecuted only two people.
Most of the thousands of criminal cases per year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so it is rare to bring the killer of a journalist to justice.
In Rio de Janeiro, they insisted on reporting on the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts were broken, even though the land had been cut down a thousand times.
If there is no information about the killer, if justice is not served, then holding a security seminar is not very useful, Iwara said.
He said that wasting time attending such a workshop was stupid.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone.
On the morning of May 15, Valdis left the Riodozhce office in the capital, Kyriac√°n.
His red Toyota Carola opened only a few blocks away and was stopped by two men; they forced him out of the car, fired 12 guns, presumably because the name of the newspaper translates to 12ÈÅìÊ≤≥.
The driver drove his car away and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is now 50 years old.
He left behind his wife and two grown children.
Kuriacan is rumored to be alive.
But regarding the subject of Valdis, there is nothing really except silence.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become the country's bloodiest battlefield, killing off enemy forces madly.
Every day, one or more people are shot dead on the streets of Sinaloa, a cemetery filled with two-story, lavishly decorated mausoleums filled with poison, which are already commonplace.
The temporary state of quiet is forgotten when only one cartel controls the state of Hawai'i and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdis was deeply aware of the dangers of this job, 60-year-old Ismail Bohoquy, co-founder and director of Riodocezh, was still not guilty of not protecting his friends.
He believes that two mistakes caused this tragedy.
First, in February, Damasso Lopez published an interview with Damasso, who led a cartel group fighting against Guzman's sons.
This report may have infuriated the sons; the newspaper was sent to the newsstand and was bought by a suspected gang member.
The second mistake was not to force Valdes to leave Mexico for his own safety after the seizure of a newspaper that reported the same story in another story.
Valdez is a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his death has significant implications for Mexico's violence against journalists.
His spirit lives on, and his friends and colleagues believe that he has always been with us.
In 2003 he was still a senior journalist for Northwest News, and that year he and five colleagues founded Riodoce, selling a $50 stake.
In Sinaloa, according to Bohoquay, journalism cannot be left untouched by the drug problem.
Over time, the paper has gained a good reputation for its bold and honest reporting, as well as increased sales and advertising.
Journalists like to report investigative reports that are harmful and can be published without worrying about censorship, and readers like to report stories that others do not dare to report.
Five years after its founding, Riodocezh received the Latin American National Maria Moscow Prize for Journalism.
That same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded Valditz the International Press Freedom Award, recognizing his courage in pursuit of the most authentic Mexican drug reporting.
He confessed that he was also very afraid.
At the awards ceremony of the Society for the Protection of Journalists, he said that he wanted to live on.
Later in late October, he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV, a local television station, that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
You must take on the task that you have as a journalist, or you must be deaf or hard of hearing.
I don't want to be asked, 'In the face of so many deaths, what have you done... why don't you speak out about what's happening?'
The entire staff of Riodocezh misses Valdis, misses him constantly cursing like a dock worker, misses this friend who never hesitated to embrace and advise, misses this teacher who knew how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat all the time.
The El Guayabozh bar, which often visits the office across the street, also always sits at the same table.
Now, they will ask: Was it his daily habits that caused his downfall?
His death also forced them to think about how to work well and live well.
"They don't like you bothering their women and children, nor do they like you affecting their legal businesses and secret airports used to transport drugs", Bohoquay said.
These have all crossed their bottom line.
The result is that even in the safest of times, a high level of self-censorship and self-protection is required.
zh believe in your own intuition.
If you smell a dangerous breath, hurry away from the area.
According to Andreas Virair, editor of Riodoce, the problem is that breathing is a feeling of being deceived... and then something like Havilland happens.
He and others say that the previous rules no longer apply to Sinaloa, just as they no longer apply to Tamalpais, Veracruz, Greer and other states, where the smuggling industry is profitable, and where institutions are fragile, government officials are corrupt, and smugglers are outnumbered.
The situation is changing all the time.
In the security training room where Riodocezh employees were attending, the use of cell phones was suddenly banned; a few days ago, spyware purportedly sold only to the government had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two policemen are walking in the cool under the tree, avoiding the high temperatures of 104 degrees Celsius.
They are state-owned to protect the offices of Riodocezh, located in a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Kuriakhan.
Some journalists jokingly said they didn't know if the police would be more than 50% of the letter the governor himself said was true.
Journalists have been in the mountainous region for several months, where drug trafficking groups are under the control of a real presence.
This week's Riodocezh mainly covered three major events.
Among them was the murder of the brother of the great former boxer from Sinaloa, Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez,
There was also the disclosure of government funding from the governor's hometown,
As well as the kidnapping of a high-end restaurant in Kulyakan, which is just one block from the prosecutor's office.
Officials have not released information about the abducted objects and the abduction process, so it takes caution and caution to write down what the city knows: that's where the restaurant is a favorite destination for drug dealers and officials alike.
A journalist learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political classes throughout the last century.
Recently, several revolutionary regime party governors have been accused of corruption in several high-profile cases.
Viraril asked the reporter to write a story about what happened at the scene before he could write about the incident, including the incident in which a son of Mexican heavyweight champion Guzman eluded a military attack.
If, months ago, readers would look through Valdis's column, looking for the most powerful information about this kidnapping incident.
Virazhiril, 46, who is known for his slim figure, said that in the past, we already knew what was happening.
Now all our communication channels from information sources are being monopolized.
Valdis' office is now used to store the signs and stickers of journalists who protested the killing of journalists, as employees become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed a sign and walked out of the room to the local prosecutor's office to participate in a march involving another journalist.
Salvador Adamey disappeared in the western state of Mijanken three days after he was killed in Valdiz.
Officials found a burned body and said that it was his body, according to DNA testing.
Across the country, journalists have become more outspoken, organizing protests, painting words to save the media on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, Director Bozhokvi was not in Washington, D.C., but was working to bring justice to the Valditz case, seeking international support.
The day after Valdis was killed, during a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez sued the official journalists for information and killed them for exposing the facts.
Given that her anger had already affected her objectivity, she also asked to resign from her position as a government affairs reporter.
Valdes has repeatedly reiterated that Mexican journalists are surrounded by organized crime, corrupt government officials and indifferent society.
In his previous book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that journalists are not only harmed by drug trafficking groups, but also on the list of politicians and security forces who have been involved in organized crime and corruption.
Article 19 of the Media Monitoring Group blames police and public officials for more than half of the attacks on journalists last year.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they let you die just to keep you quiet".
Obviously, these murders are unspeakable.
No one has forgotten that six years ago, the goddess Maria Elizabeth Marciades died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Next to her body was a caption, allegedly signed by Zetaskarl: "I came to report on my report".
Her head was cut off, with a computer keyboard and headphones next to it.
After the assassination of Miroslav Brzezinski in March, some news organizations chose to close, such as El Norte, the newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others are still going on, but they are still going on, as the director of El Manana of Nuevo Laredozh was killed in 2014.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez opened a headline news article about the drug cartel, titled What do you want from us?
Some journalists have fled their homeland, or even left the country.
It was a difficult choice.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still need to be careful, careful, and alert to the dangers of walking the streets.
Sometimes they get arrested, as reported in 2015, photographer Ruben Espinosa was killed in a Mexican city along with four women in a row three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who are still working behind the scenes, this is a daily step in making high-risk decisions.
Iwala, who once wanted to be a poet, admitted that reporting on the drug trade made him fearful.
He said Mexico was becoming hell, so I became a journalist.
On a recent Friday at midnight, the latest edition of the newspaper was printed, the editors of Riodozhce sitting in the hallway outside the office drinking beer, suddenly their cell phones rang.
A series of gunfire attacks against enemy forces and security forces have been reported by gangs near the seaside resort town of Masatlan, confirming 19 deaths.
The war is also escalating, as predicted by a series of cartel information found in the region.
They are on the way to upload the news via mobile to the website of Rizhodoce.
The next day the title had to be changed.
A whistle rang nearby and another gun battle ensued in the area.
Bozhkvizh looked at the police station guarding the area, to see if they would wake up.
If they were just a little scared, then they didn't show up.
The founder of this newspaper has died, and in his large portrait, his middle finger points to the whole of Sinaloa where the view is needed, the entire staff of Riodocezh
On the same day that Havel was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the street to report.
China's self-driving tourism market will reach trillions of dollars in size in 2020 or break through.
Against the backdrop of consumer upgrades and the rise of free movement, self-driving cars are encouraged by national policies and increasingly favored by consumers.
But at the same time, the market for self-driving cars, which is expected to surpass trillions, faces a double challenge.
Against a backdrop of consumer upgrades and a boom in free movement, self-driving cars are encouraged by national policies and increasingly favored by consumers.
But at the same time, the market for self-driving tours, which is expected to break trillions, faces a double challenge: on the one hand, the development of the self-driving touring industry is disproportionate to market demand, and self-driving tour operators such as self-driving clubs and travel agencies face a sluggish profitability; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services faced by self-driving tours are still in their infancy.
With 60% of the total domestic turnover, the market is expected to reach trillions of dollars.
In 2016, 4.4 billion domestic tourists visited the country in the whole year, self-driving travel accounting for about 60% of the total domestic tourism, and by 2020 the size of the self-driving market is expected to exceed trillion.
According to statistics from the China Cruise Ship Association on self-driving boat trips, the number of people travelling by car has been growing steadily for the past five years, with the number of people travelling by car accounting for more than half of the domestic tourist population.
At the same time, regional and national levels have shown greater attention and support for the emerging field of self-driving cars, with the introduction of a stronger set of policy regulations related to self-driving cars, RVs and camping tourism in 2016-2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourism Authority, the National Sports Directorate, jointly released a development plan for the Autonomous Sport Camps; in the same month, 14 departments, including the Development Committee, the Ministry of Finance, jointly issued a plan to promote rural tourism development and upgrade the development of the country's tourism infrastructure.
The introduction of policies has provided opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self-driving.
Self-driving clubs are a small, complete industry chain that is key.
Although the domestic market for self-driving is vast and is driven by national policies, the self-driving tourism industry is still in its infancy.
According to the 2016-2017 China Autonomous Travel Year Development Report, the number of local Autonomous Clubs, Autonomous Clubs, Autonomous Clubs, etc. reached thousands, but the proportion of self-organized tourists who took part in the most significant part, while tourists who attended various organizations such as Autonomous Clubs, Autonomous Clubs and Autonomous Clubs accounted for only about 15%.
At the same time, online travel companies and traditional travel agencies that develop autonomously self-driving products are also a number of indexes, many online travel platforms sell only self-driving products provided by some suppliers, while some self-driving clubs are also important suppliers.
From the organizational point of view, self-driving activities cover a wide range of aspects including eating, living, walking, traveling, shopping, entertainment, high fragmentation, upstream supply chain weight, and high randomness of tourist consumption.
Li Chang-jeo, founder and CEO of Beijing-Jing Tianjin Automobile Club, believes that self-driving clubs are essentially similar to travel agencies, with early mainstream profits being primarily driven by offline activities, with the focus on self-driving route products and frontline services.
But now, with the line products in the self-driving sector being seriously homogenized, the level of service in the front line being disparate, self-driving clubs face a need for a new transformation.
As you can see, self-driving cars themselves are not an independent industry, but rather a cross-regional ecosystem of industries, with their self-driving characteristics of local movement, which is crucial to the formation of a complete industrial chain.
 Experts point out that in addition to basic tourist consumption, experience is a more important consumption element
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving tourism industry, the experience characteristics, the development of the theme of self-driving tourism+ and the IP of self-driving products should be enhanced.
Landscape paths are not just roads, car camps should not be just for food.
Faced with the rise of self-driving, the development of self-driving infrastructure is also a bit more elementary.
Li Chun Jae pointed out that the tourist landscape path is not just a road, but needs to integrate elements of transport and tourism, but the road repair and tourism itself are two sectors responsible, the transport sector adds tourism elements, but also stays in the construction of facilities such as hotels, consulting centers, propaganda facilities, and tourism is not very well connected.
In contrast to the well-known self-driving routes on U.S. Route 66, construction experience is worth learning.
Landscape design is no longer the quickest route from place to place, but instead follows the design concept of experiencing driving fun, providing self-driving visitors with the best possible enjoyment of scenic views along the way; the landscape can connect pointed, facial tourist landscapes, both retaining the historical value and cultural value of the ecotourism resources along the way, and can host a variety of thematic activities that enhance visitor engagement and leisure experience, creating economic benefits for local tourism.
In addition to the scenic trails, the campground is also an important support facility for self-driving.
But of the self-driving tourists the New York Times reporter knows, few consumers choose to stay in the camp.
They believe that many camps are geared toward infrastructure, can only satisfy the need for food, low-grade, single-product, and unable to meet the demand for self-driving cars that contain many elements.
Many of the companies that have been camping in the past few years have been underground, afterground, and the infrastructure and services that have been built in the latter stages have not been updated, many of the operating conditions are at a loss, and without the investment of funds in the latter stages, it is difficult to make any corresponding support products.
zh consumer group.
According to data released by the China Cruise Ship Association in 2017, the age-specific self-driving tourism population is concentrated in the 21-40 age group, especially the 31-40 age group, which has a certain economic base, and a higher demand for personalized tourism, and more for child-friendly tourists.
According to housing surveys, the self-driving population is relatively more likely to prefer non-standard accommodation.
From the standpoint of self-driving, surrounding self-driving is the most common type of self-driving, accounting for 84.32% of all road traffic.
Self-driving is a preference of many, but a smaller proportion.
At the same time, as consumer demand rises, tourists who used to like self-driving tours begin to shift their minds, not to take pictures or sleep on the road, but to focus more on the experience and process of traveling.
The dinosaurs used disguise to hide from the enemy.
At first glance, it looks scary, but it looks like a statue.
Researchers have published the first results of research on the discovery of a rhinos-sized, incredible biofossil by Canadian miners, noting that the fossil is well preserved, and therefore, experts call it the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world.
This precious fossil is so well preserved that it can even tell the color of its reddish-brown skin, indicating that it has had some troubled experiences.
Relevant reports in the journal Contemporary Biology describe it as the best-preserved Beetle dinosaur ever discovered, and one of the best known dinosaur specimens in the world.
The fossil is a newly discovered species of dragon, which lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous period.
Its excellent preservation, which shocked the researchers, described it as truly stunning.
According to the National Geographic, this herbivorous dinosaur fossil is the best preserved dinosaur fossil ever found.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the fossil while mining at the Sencol Mill mine near McMurry Fort in northern Alberta, Canada.
At that time, he came across something that seemed to be a little like the surrounding rock, so he decided to look at it carefully.
Later, the fossils he discovered were sent to the Royal Canadian Archaeological Museum in Terreys.
It took researchers six years to bring this beast to life inside a piece of Tibetan soil weighing 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg).
After such a hard work, the final result can only be announced now.
If you look closely, you'll almost believe it's asleep, says the Royal Terrier Museum scientist and first author, Caleb Brown, who exhibits the creature in the gallery.
It will become one of the most beautiful, best-preserved specimens of dinosaurs in the history of science - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world.
By studying its skin, researchers found that this herbivore, although armored like a walking tank, could be threatened by a major threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
These dinosaurs, who were heavily disguised as red-and-white, used a cloaking technique known as "shrouding", also used by many modern animals.
Experts say that in this way, it is better able to blend in with its surroundings, thus avoiding enemies, suggesting that it was preyed upon by larger dinosaurs.
This 110 million-year-old creature belonging to the family of the knotted dragon, which made headlines for the first time in May, is currently on display at the Royal Thyrillian Archaeological Museum.
After 7,000 hours of careful discovery of the giant's face, as one of the team members, museum technician Mark Mitchell, researchers are now studying it and naming it the Borealopelta markmitchelli.
The sample is preserved extremely well, allowing Dr. Mitchell, as well as an international team of scientists, to record the patterns and shapes of the spikes and spikes on its body.
They discovered the magic of the reticulum, a common form of defense in the animal kingdom, meaning that the back of the animal is darker than the color of its sides.
Although the use of the technique is common, the results of the discovery were surprising, as the body shape of this species is far superior to that of existing animals using the technique.
This species is under pressure from predators to hunt, and thus evolves in a favorable direction, allowing it to hide in a hedge, thus serving as a means of survival.
However, most of the animals that survive using anti-aging techniques, such as deer, zebras or other animals, are as small and fragile as prey, suggesting that the organism faces real survival stress.
The fact that large, heavy-duty dinosaurs suffered from wild prey shows just how dangerous the white-eared dinosaur was, Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in its pips also showed that the dinosaur's skin color was reddish-brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the life trail of this organism, including its stomach contents, to determine the final food to eat.
They believe that the dinosaurs fell into the river at death, were then rushed into the ocean, and finally sank to the bottom of the sea in a backward manner.
At the time, the climate in Alberta was as warm as the climate in southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans may have been deeper inland than they are now.
Brown said: This type of knot is truly amazing, because it is completely covered by the preserved skin, and, even today, is preserved in the dimension space, thus preserving its original shape.
 Therefore, the shape of this species today is almost the same as that of the White Age.
You don't need to use too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look up, you'll almost believe it's asleep.
The Bianco period was a period of time when large bipedal dinosaurs roamed the Earth.
Although the dragon was the king of the dinosaurs, it appeared only millions of years after the Beetle.Beetle may have been killed by some of the Beetle's ancestors.
They include the tall thorns dragon, a giant that weighs up to 6, and is 38 feet (11.5 meters) long.
The latest study found that scientists in the journal Contemporary Biology believe that the dragon was washed into the sea after its death, and then formed into mummies in the soil.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Fink dug up the creature in a 1,000,000 mine near McMurry Fort, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved Beetle, with complete skin and armor from the nose to the chin.
This species has an average length of about 18 feet (5 meters) and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch-long, pointed horns protruding from the shoulder.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous dinosaur was active in what is now western Canada, after a flooded river erupted into the ocean.
However, this dinosaur's burial underwater has allowed it to be fully preserved.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen are preserved so well that the remaining skin is still covered by the unobstructed, flattened scales on the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko writes in the National Geographic Magazine, this degree of preservation is as rare as the middle color.
The more I look at it, the more I find it incredible.
The remaining skin fossils are still covered above the armor, which is spotted on the dinosaur bones.
Its right forearm is located on its side, extending five feet upwards.
I can put a number on it.
The reporter learned that adding natural or plant-based hydrochloric acid, corrosive acid and amino acid carrier to the urethane production process can modify the performance of traditional urethane, resulting in a 510 percentage point increase in the utilization of hydrochloric acid urethane, hydrochloric acid urethane, wheatgrass urethane urethane urethane urethane, and other hydrochloric acid additives.
 Environmentally friendly, crop-growing potential is evident, especially large-particle urine, which is a high-quality raw material for BB fat.
This total number of security personnel is twice as many as the number of security personnel at the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest ever security-related initiative.
Previously, the Brazilian government said that a total of 85,000 military and police personnel would be taking part in the joint action, including 20,000 soldiers and 65,000 police officers.
Most of the troops will be responsible for the security of the Olympic Stadium, while the new 3,000 troops will be responsible for the security of international airports, metro stations and streets.
Police patrol other parts of the city, including the subway, buses and streets.
It is reported that 6,000 soldiers have arrived in Rio for the Olympic security services.
In addition to being responsible for the four-race zone of the Rio Olympics, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport and the main roads connecting the airport and the Olympic Stadium.
The introduction of the assessment mechanism in the service sector is not new, but it is important to make the assessment mechanism more effective, not out of form.
How do radicalists learn to answer the question: Whose streets?
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was left in a state of shock and anxiety.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis native sat on a bed that Peter had rented, browsing Facebook on his cell phone.
She accidentally discovered a post from a high school student.
The above text reads: "The police just killed an 18-year-old child, still lying in the street".
She found out that no one else posted the message on the messaging, and she was confused.
A user of @TheePharozhah kept pushing her to the dynamic Times.
A live Twitter feed of rappers from the St. Louis area broadcasts the death of Michael Brown.Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black man, was shot dead by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying in the street, his body lying in the street for four hours.
He's crazy, Ferrell thought.
But for her and the community in which she lives, death is not new.
She put down her cell phone and didn't tweet again until later that night, reading about a crowd gathering on Camfield Avenue.
There were police footage and shouting photos, and a photo of a man claiming to be Brown's father, with the words: "The Ferguson cop just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live message, a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman raised his rifle and shouted: "I'll kill you all... cattle".
"This is not normal", says Zh Ferrell recalling.
 This is not what we are used to, which can be called a typical murder casezh
In that moment, I felt a tremor.
I was angry, I cried.
She had booked a return flight, and was due home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's home, and decided the two of them would leave for Ferguson the next morning.
Over the next three years, what happened between Farrell and Ferguson was the subject of a new documentary, whose street? that was released in theaters on August 11.
It is a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and determination, told from the perspective of people living in this community, crowded streets and alleys that demand answers.
While Farrell and her daughter were driving to Ferguson together in flowers and crown jewelry, the two re-examined the topics they had discussed countless times before that morning -- the black experience and the condition of black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you that black people had to fight for their faith?" she recalled.
We're going to Ferguson now, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is wrong.
I had to take her with me, Ferrell later said.
What is happening today is the climax of everything in the past.
She needs to know, see, and rise from this.
She needs to not only develop well in terms of extremism and organization, but also to understand the different levels of black experience and condition, to understand what we must do to gain freedom and emancipation.
Even though I was fortunate enough to offer her a racist experience she had never experienced, she was no different from any other black girl.
If I protect her in this matter, I feel like I'm hurting her.
They arrived at Ferguson's first stop, located across the street from the South Florida Police Station.The scene became their camp after the militants waited until Officer Darren Wilson was finally uncharged.
Farrell and her daughter contacted a local business owner who made bag-and-breakfast lunches.
They prepared bags, responsible for delivering the bags to protesters.
Slowly, Ferrell began to form a new kind of activism.
She said, "My radicalism changed dramatically after August 9th". While she was an undergraduate at Missouri State University in St. Louis, she was president of the National Minority Nursing Student Association, which focused on the issues of food justice and health disparities in the black community.
I have no organizational experience.
And that's how it all came together.
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with co-director Sabah Foleyann during a night parade.
Foleyyan said she and her photography director Lucas Alvarado Ferre just wanted to record what happened.
A question arose in Farrell's mind: Do you want to record or find a story that you can use?
This suspicion stems from many such cases: people - usually white - enter a community to benefit from its suffering and hardship.
As Foleyyan explained in a recent interview, "We hear people in Ferguson's hometown are not focusing their voices, and we want to do it differently".
Foleyyan has been in contact with co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism against death row inmates.
His involvement led to Ferrell joining the Whose Street? project team along with six other locals, who have been unwavering in their efforts for years after Brown was shot.
 This documentary is not about someone speaking for us or talking to us, it's about us.Davis said
I am primarily concerned with how these characters are presented, because that is also how I am presented.
Although the goal is not to focus on Farrell's experience, but to showcase the campaign, not about the Savior's leader, but about community cohesion, Foleyyan said, she turned out to be the most open-minded of film participants.
As a result,  Whose Street? surprisingly documented Farrell's personal life, such as falling in love, getting married.
I felt myself naked, and Ferrell laughed when he first saw the finished product.
But I understand that doing this job and making black people human must require a certain degree of vulnerability.
Moreover, Farrell's story reaffirms and re-locates the role of black women in the broader movement of black life events.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- who created #BlackLivesMatter on social media following the shooting of teenager Trevor Martin in 2012 -- have been labeled as cool.
Black cool women in leadership generally support this movement, Ferrell said, because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black cool women have to put up with all this.
Foleyyan agreed and mentioned that the movement really gained the support of black women and many black cool women.
Because of her identity, Farrell was chosen as the centerpiece of the film. However, she insists that this is not a positive action.
She is the one who inspires this energy, she said.
 Although she is on the front lines, this is no coincidence. Because in these crossroads of life, as a black cooler woman, you have a lot to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy.
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, the news cameras have long since disappeared, but the tense racial relationship between the community and the police still exists.
For attempting to block the highway during a parade, Farrell was sentenced to more than two and a half years in prison.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area she calls home: "A mess".
Nevertheless, since walking down Ferguson Street three years ago, she has been insisting on the sacred hymn she has tried to memorize.
We have a responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win the victory.
We must love one another and support one another.
We have nothing left to lose, except the locks on our bodies.
In fact, online translation services were already available on the Internet a decade ago, when in fact, long ago, there was a lot of talk about machines coming to replace humans in translation.
Similarities: The artist used a DNA portrait of Chelsea Manning.
In the center of the exhibition at the Friedman Museum in New York, there are several faces: white, black and brown, with almost imperceptible similarities between each face, and these faces are connected by lines that descend from the ceiling.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Duweig Hagborg (Dewey-Hagborg) using the Chelsea Manning tattoo and haircuts she sent her face.
Manning sent haircuts from Livenburg Prison for leaking classified diplomatic cables via the WikiLeaks website, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
The exhibition opened on August 2, with the title zh
This was the result of two years of communication between Duffy and Manning, Duffy combined her subject with herself in technology, computer science, and art, while Manning was a prominent dissident, served time in prison, and completed sex reassignment surgery in prison.
 By algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA, and thereby creating 30 portraits of what appears to be a very likely appearance, Heather DuVie Habogg made a sharp and somewhat ruthless comment on this. His comments were both multi-sensitive about DNA and about the concept of identity itself.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, had publicly admitted to being a woman in his teens when he was a teenager.In 2013, he was convicted of 20 counts, including six counts of espionage, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photo, a black and white selfie with particulate matter, she looked obviously restless, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a gold-colored fake hairstyle.
In 2015, Heather Duweiharborg had a huge success with her 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In that work, she used court evidence from cigarettes and sugar cane, and DNA extracted from fragments, to create a 3D portrait of a person with a similar appearance.
That's when she just got an email from Paper magazine.
 They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison, and they need a portrait, Heather Duweys Habogg told the media at the opening ceremony of the exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea Manning could not visit or take pictures, so they contacted Chelsea, asking if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
Thus, the artist and her imprisoned boyfriend became unlikely friends, exchanging many letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book with a repressed image, drawn by Shoili Kanzhungo.The book predicts that the president will grant Manning privileges in the future, she will be able to see an exhibition in prison.
Obama had asked for her release a few days after the book was published. This may have been a coincidence, as Manning was just completing his seventh year in a Kansas military prison.
In addition, this exhibition has another layer of profound significance. Because of the contemporary United States, the Trump administration is continually waging a war on government leakers and transgender military personnel, while also finding new ways to nudely incite divisions, this exhibition is exactly what it is to bridge such divisions.
When asked about all this special time, Heather Duway Habogg said, "Everything happens for a reason".
In an artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manzhning's signature, Supermajor (painted with a heart in his name), called for an end to the clashes between parties based on gender, sexual orientation and culture.
On the wall opposite is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, written with a twisted pencil to the Cs,Gs and As symbols.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleic acids, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heather Duweiharborg hopes to express, by drawing these strikingly similar portraits, at least physically, that humans are all like this.
I hope people get out of this dilemma, our genome doesn't care who we are, how publicly available genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is, Heather DuVie Habogger said, his 2007 video work "Fake Memories" is also on display.
DNA data can tell us many different stories, so here are 30 of them.
The last piece in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page in the novel illustrated in the foreground.
It shows a manning in the shape of a kimong floating under the American soldier's hand-held amplifier.
When they stop your speech, they win, the writing on the wall.
zh so, please don't shut up.
 These contents come directly from a letter she wrote to me zh, the Philadelphia-based artist said.
I'm scared again, I still have to say.
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person, as predicted in the comic, but when she does, she will be cheered by her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters in the center of the exhibition hall.
This is also significant, as all items on display have reached the height of her genetic double-cluster information written with her pencil (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
 In the past, I have hung them on the wall, but I hope they feel like a bunch of people, Duweiz Hagerburg said when talking about portraits.
But I want them to feel like a bunch of protesters following Chelsea, just like they did when they were protesting for her release.
A Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff are wanted in connection with the murder.
Police said that a man found stabbed to death in a Chicago luxury apartment, a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were later searched, and are currently searching for suspects nationwide.
Cook County court records show that on Monday, Wyndham Lesem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were sentenced to life in prison without parole for first-degree murder in the suspected death of Trenton H. James Cornell Durandelow.
According to documentary records, 26-year-old Corneille Durandroien died from multiple stab wounds.
According to a community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27.
Police received a call after arriving at the Grand Plaza apartment, where they found multiple cracks on the victim's body.
According to police, Corneille Durandlo was killed on the spot, the detective is investigating his murder, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Racem has been an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cowbetch, deputy director of campus relations, said in an email statement that Lesem had now been dismissed from his post and banned from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
Kaubetz said,zh now this is a criminal case, the relevant authorities are investigating, Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for Oxford University's Summerville College said in an email statement: "We have been in constant contact with the British police, ready to assist the US investigative body at any time if needed".
A statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped he would be able to testify on his own.
Anthony Guerrelli, chief liaison officer of the Chicago Police Department, said he strongly encouraged the suspect to surrender to authorities.
Guerrelli said, The police already have a rough idea of their whereabouts, and we are working to locate a possible location.
Gujrilmi said local, regional and national authorities are doing their best to assist in the search for suspects.
Guerrelli said police received a call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager, who had just received a secret tip that 1008 had been a case.
Police said the situation at the time was very dire.
Guerrelli said it was not clear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He said, according to security cameras, that confirmed that Lesem and Warren were in the building at the time.
"We believe that Professor Razem and the victim have a certain relationship", said Gurelermi.
The management team at Grand Plaza issued a statement to residents saying:zh police are currently investigating the victim's case timeline and background, investigating various motives, including possible domestic incidents together
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said, "We will complete the roadmap of the World Anti-Doping Agency in the near future".
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that implementing the remaining standards for restoring the right of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would not take too long.
 Implementation of the roadmap standard has reached a certain stage,RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard, Mutko said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutharikazh made the above statement in commenting on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency's Roadmap for Compliance with Regulations, which sets out the criteria for restoring RUSADA's rights and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the standard does not contain anything that could cause Russian concern.
He added, "Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented".
 and will soon submit the results to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian anti-doping agency must publicly accept the findings of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McClaren into the use of doping in its sport.
Speaking about the incident, Muteko said: "We are investigating, our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But behind this there is no national plan, we will not admit something that does not exist.
Mutko's words were in response to the words of Vitali Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Committee.
Smirnov admitted the problems that the Russian anti-doping agency had in the past when he was interviewed by the Russian media outlet RSport earlier that day, but he added:We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally, Zhmirnov said.
Following the November 2015 doping scandal, WADA suspended RUSADA's right to conduct doping testing within Russia.
But in June this year,RUSADA was allowed to conduct a planned and coordinated inspection under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director-General Olivia Nigri said in July, during a visit to the organization's Moscow headquarters, that RUSADA was moving in the right direction, working to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it's chess or national chess, beating humans decades ago is no longer a matter of debate.
In an interview, Croatian Football Association president Davou-Suk said that the participation in the China Cup is significant for Croatian football, and the number of bonuses in the China Cup is very high.
No need to look for replacements! these more than 8,000 products are duty-free.
During the regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, the Ministry of Commerce's press spokesman, Shikopeng, said that as of now, China has implemented 15 free trade agreements with 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 products imported with zero tariffs.
At the same time, imported chemicals, Icelandic salmon, Chilean red wine, tropical fruits from ASEAN... these products you need are no longer expensive to buy.
To date, China has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, 15 of which have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 imported products subject to zero tariffs.
For example, with the implementation of the FTA, consumers can taste agricultural products of different quality and quality, all four seasons of the year.
For example, tropical fruits such as ASEAN's durian, branches, and oranges, import duties have been reduced from 15% to 30% to zero.
The import tariff on fish from Iceland was reduced from 10% to 12% to zero;
Red wine from Georgia and Chile, import duties have been reduced from 14% to 30% to zero duty;
New Zealand's beef and dairy products, which are characteristic of the agricultural sector, have also been subject to significant tax cuts.
For example, the import tariff on certain Swiss cosmetics has been reduced to zero.
The import duties on some watches have been reduced by 50% and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
South Korea has reduced import duties on products such as refrigerators, electric cookers, massagers, beauty products by 40% and will reduce them to zero in a few years;
There are also significant tax cuts for consumer electronics, among others.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the FTA also include intermediate products and raw materials needed to manufacture many domestic consumer products, and have also contributed to some structural upgrades to domestic consumer products.
 Business Ministry press spokesman Gopeng said that almost a third of China's total imports are eligible for the preferential tariff treatment of the FTA, most of which are end-user goods, bringing real benefits to consumers.
zh further reduce tariffs on consumer goods imports.
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted tariffs on imports of certain consumer goods, further reduced import tariffs on consumer goods, and covered a total of 187 8-digit tariffs on consumer goods, including food, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, clothing, shoes, household appliances, cultural entertainment, grocery, and so on.
The average tax rate on these consumer goods will drop from 17.3% straight to 7.7%, almost being blocked!
From 1 January 2018, China has also made some adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
Import duties on certain cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shadow, perfume, etc. were reduced from 10% to 5%;
After the tariff reduction, it means that consumers no longer have to buy groceries, nor do they have to run far to buy their favorite foreign products abroad.
2018 Yiwu Import Shopping Festival: Importing red wine, snacks, fruits... all of them are cheap!
Foreign Affairs: At the end of the year, the regulations in the U.S. market differ widely  Shopping for goods and services requires caution.
The Chinese New Network December 29th
According to the U.S. News & World Report, Christmas is just around the corner, and the tide is rolling back.
According to ABC News, more than half of the merchandise sold at Christmas last year was returned.
In addition, there have been multiple online shoplifting scams, and consumers need to be more careful when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have a formal, reasonable return procedure, but if you buy gifts or e-commerce purchases from some small shops, you must be careful.
Ms. Houzh of Rolongon bought a coat at an online store that sold printed coats on December 1st, local time, and spent over 60 dollars on it, but the result has not yet been sent.
She sent an email to the client, but no response.
Another netizen exploded, who went on a US tour last year, bought a mobile phone from a third-party seller, and came across a box of dirt inside.
zh know that you have been cheated, apply for a refund to the website, and get a full refund.
But there are also customers who feel that the website's refund service is not 100% perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident of Northern California, said he had purchased two express delivery services from a certain website, four yuan for an express service, but both failed to deliver on time.
zh then reapplied for a refund, and no response was received.
Large shopping malls or shopping malls have better return policies.
Most merchandise is fully refunded within 180 days.
But the goods must retain their original shape and must have a purchase certificate such as receipt or bank purchase record.
If there is no certificate, customers can also get points from the mall, which can be used to purchase other goods.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for general merchandise, and electronic goods usually have a 15-day return period.
However, the return period for electronic and entertainment goods purchased between November 1, 2017 and December 25, 2017 has been extended to 30 days.
It is worth noting that the 30-day refund period is calculated from December 25, i.e. you must return the item by January 25, 2018.
Extreme shopping experience, business shopping development, and the coming of a new era.
Over a decade ago, China as a whole was still in a seller's market, with limited choice and limited demand.
But after a decade of development, the market has already achieved a shift from seller to buyer market, today's consumer tastes have changed, they are no longer satisfied with the simple shopping behavior of hand-to-hand delivery of money.
So how to get consumers a shopper experience that is extreme has become the next competing issue for real estate developers.
And of the many factors that affect the consumer shopping experience, the impact of shopping centers in the business world is the most significant.
See how city builders everywhere are focusing on shopping experiences.
No two pieces of leaf are exactly the same, no two shopping malls are exactly the same, a famous shopping mall must have its own characteristics.
For example, the world-famous Canyon shopping center in Turkey, whose unique wave-shaped architectural design is inspired by the Grand Canyon (hence the nickname, the Canyon), walks 200 metres down the canyon's central pedestrian path as if it were inside the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon-like design, there is a large, oval-shaped showroom in the center of the shopping center, with a unique shape, often hosting special performances.
Due to the open platform design, the tourists can walk on each floor to view the activities taking place in the canyon and have the effect of changing the landscape in stages.
While domestically, the Nanjing Forest Mall, known as China's first forest-style walking mall, combines shopping with ecological, fairy tale, and fairy tale excellence.
7000 square meters of green space, 3000 square meters of rooftop water platform, project consisting of 9,000 single-unit buildings, interconnected air corridors between buildings, overall submerged courtyard design, taking French trees over the terrain for building surface, rooftop water platforms, creating a forest-like feel.
Walking into the forest moor, like falling unknowingly into the pebble hole in Alice's adventure, the tree trunks along the way surround the building, portraying the grassland, the clear springs, and bringing people into a forest full of life and vitality.
There is also the Lijiang Waterworks, built in Chongqing, Long Lake, planning for the Alibaba business, planning for the future to introduce more than 50 international flagship stores, 100 international top brands and more than 500 domestic and foreign well-known brands, building into a service industry hub, a business center with a distinctive theme.
Not only that, but the water business community has also integrated eco-building into the building, oriented by TOD public transport, concentrating on fashion shopping, life services, catering, entertainment, education, sports, while providing consumers with a seamless shopping experience, leading them to enjoy Chongqing's unique water culture, perfectly blending shopping and water entertainment, leisure and leisure.
Overall, it can be found that, at present, some housing companies are already aware of the discovery trajectory of this new urban commercial, while industry experts say that this consumer-centric model of how to combine shopping and experience will also be a mainstream trend in future urban development.
Today's business world is not only a place of merchandise, but also a complex place of artistic culture, creative themes, and responsibility for urban living.
Thus, while meeting the demands of consumers to eat, drink and play, and buy one-stop-shop materials, maximizing the spiritual demands of cultural art to transmit multilevels, fulfilling the demands of living in a livable environment, is bound to be the high point of the future development of the business world.
In Chongqing, Jiangsan, the northern shore of the Qinghai, the land at Jiangbei, near the Beijing Bridge, the world's commercial elite, international giants, the international circle of circles, the first-class brands, the close proximity to international fashion.
Here is the step-by-step prosperity, the world's splendor;
East Rangi Jinyut has a better shopping environment, East Rangi Jinyut is close to the South Zhong business district, exclusive western and even nationally leading four-level transportation system, which has improved shopping comfort.
In addition, the park greening of the two walkways of the Hu Industrial Road and Wanda Square, landscaping landscaping, upgrades, planting about 300 seeds of Choi, renovation of the site 40,000 square meters, improved the image of the South Zhong business circle;
Long Lake, near Chongqing, the first low-density water business, surrounded by nine parks, low-density shopping blocks, high-level openness, makes people more willing to stop, sit, and enjoy the pleasure of shopping, rather than being rushed forward by a backward crowd, really achieving walking shopping.
Today's business competition will only get fiercer, how to kill a bloodline in a highly homogenous market, how to win the reputation of a shopping sanctuary in the hearts of future consumers, worthy of serious consideration by all real estate developers.
A differentiation strategy alone is far from enough, only developers who truly focus on consumers, who are quick to buy, who are thinking about what consumers think, who offer consumers a simple and extreme shopping experience can laugh in a stormy market.
Of course, I would like to say that the happiest people in Chongqing, with such a good shopping experience and business circle, were put in the position that no one could imagine a decade ago the prosperity of today.
The consumerist fanaticism masks the real environmental price.
168.2 billion yuan, which was on November 11, 2017, within 24 hours of the global celebration of the Catalan people's consumption of the catalan user.
Specifically, in just three minutes after launch, the Catalogue's turnover exceeded 10 billion yuan, in 6.05 seconds it exceeded 20 billion yuan, in 9 hours it hit 100 billion yuan.
On this day, the total number of payments made by global consumers through paypal reached 1.48 billion, a 41 percent increase from last year.
These consumption will result in 812 million logistics orders.
Whether it's the Cat's Web or the Paypal platform, all of them are owned by Mazhyun's Ali Group.
Ten years ago, no one would have imagined that the self-mockingly created Asian Youth Day, which was organized by e-commerce, would become the current phenomenon of the shopping festival.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used the marketing slogan of the first single-day promotional campaign: No one talks to you about love, so let's get our single dogs online and shop soon.
The result was surprising: on this day, the volume of transactions surpassed 52 million yuan, which was 10 times the daily volume of transactions at the time.
From then on, it has become Alibaba's shopping festival, from the beginning of domestic buyers and sellers' entertainment, to the current influx of global merchants, nine years later, the transaction volume of the 2000 billion has been more than 3,200 times that year, making Black Friday unlikely.
Along with the promotion of the Titan, there are also numerous e-commerce businesses, of which ‰∫¨‰∏ú is the strongest.
‰∫¨‰∏ú has its own shopping spending, but without significant impact, this year from November 1 to 11, ‰∫¨‰∏ú cumulative sales reached 12.71 billion yuan.
And then, next, there is the similarly-developed Christmas shopping season.
The New Year has passed, and Chinese consumers are still waiting for the Spring Break shopping period, Valentine's Day shopping period, consumption, no vacation.
Environmental issues, caused by the sudden consumption of mass, have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua Daily Telegraph, according to a typical standard conservative estimate of 0.2 kg per packaging container in the industry, at least 300,000 pieces of garbage were generated during this year's period.
Liu, director of the Green and East Asia Division's pollution control project, told China Foreign Dialogue that this year's order volume for catfish alone will generate 160,000 packaging garbage.
The National Postal Service released a report in 2016, which noted that the 2015 Zhongqing period (November 11-16) had a fast-moving volume of about 780 million pieces, used more than three billion weaving bags, 99.22 billion packaging boxes, 169.85 billion cubic meters of tape, and the length of the tape could be around the Earth's equator for 425 rounds.
This year, the National Postal Service expects the fast-moving business volume of the ZZZ to exceed 1.5 billion units.
Wangzhong, a manager of a Beijing City incineration center, told Xinhua that the daily amount of garbage entering the city after the 11th anniversary exceeded the 2000th anniversary, which is also more than the processing capacity of the incineration station.
The courier industry has already realized that the environmental pollution caused by the courier industry cannot be underestimated.
Some e-commerce logistics companies, including Suning, have already introduced recyclable plastic courier boxes that can be reused as shopping bags and reusable bags for garbage, but the discomfort of consumer acceptance is not high.
Ma Yun also called on Weibo to support the global pandemic industry in green packaging and green logistics.
This Weibo post has garnered over 68,000 likes.
What kind of mobile payment do Germans want?
Zhang Zhi: The mobile payments battle that has been waged in Germany is not promising.
Just moving the battlefield to Europe, competitors unchanged, the Chinese unchanged in their takeover positions, is that globalization?
Where there is a payment gateway, there must be a WeChat payment.
According to an agreement with German e-payment provider Wirecard, WeChat Payment officially began landing in Germany in November of this year, and is gradually being deployed to merchants across Europe.
This strange, old-fashioned foreign exchange occurred again in Europe.
Paypal and WeChat have long been on the road to globalization.
 As for China's globalization of mobile payments, the AIR Consulting China Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Research Report 2017 summarizes it in two ways: first, through strategic investment, experience outputs, investments and support for domestic mobile payments companies abroad.
Second, through the consumption of Chinese tourists abroad, the promotion of mobile payment services to foreign merchants, thus changing the recognition and acceptance of mobile payments in China on the domestic market in foreign countries.
Indeed, the Chinese must have been underground.
China's rapid economic development, coupled with its large population base, is an attractive figure for Chinese tourists to spend in Europe.
But this is also bound to be the case, this time in Germany, the Chinese mobile payment battlefield is not promising.
Is the WeChat payment and payment of money merely a shift in the battlefield to Europe, the competitors unchanged, the looters unchanged or the Chinese, and is this also globalization?
A more pioneering question is whether China's mobile payments can be rolled out in mainland Europe.
Take Germany as an example.
Magic new retail sales have been introduced.
Chen„ÄÅÂáØÊ∂µ: Amazon is announcing its entry into bookstores and grocery stores as it squeezes into the world's top ten retailers, and it's worth checking out for the time and motivation.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two more in Portland and San Diego.
In early 2017, Amazon opened a store in New York City, and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced its Amazon Go supermarket would be operating, customers would not have to queue to the store, checkout, check-in, or get the goods they wanted as soon as they left, and the purchase amount would be automatically deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
For Amazon, the frequency of sudden action on physical stores in recent years is a very unexpected phenomenon.
As early as 2007, in a letter to shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon would not open a physical store easily unless the following four conditions were met:
1. we must be sure that this new opportunity will yield a return on the shareholders' investment;
2. we must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great significance to the whole company;
3. we must make sure that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
4.We must make sure that in this market we have enough resources to differentiate customer-facing.
Bookstores and grocery stores, the most volatile of the two physical retail categories, are also the first rivals to fall since Amazon's rise.
At a time when Amazon is squeezing into the top ten retailers globally, it is announcing its entry into these two physical markets, whether for the time being or for the motives of the game.
Does Amazon's practice, and the assurances in the letter to shareholders, violate its terms?
A similar sound was heard on the other side of the earth.On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou‚Ä¢Yun Conference, Alibaba's chairman Ma Yun gave a keynote address.
He said: "From next year onwards, Alibaba will no longer use the term e-commerce".
The era of pure e-commerce is coming to an end, and the next ten or twenty years will be without e-commerce, replaced by new retail.
When offline and logistics are combined, new retail sales are generated.
For a time, the three words were like magic, often hung on the mouths of industry figures.
But what exactly does a new retail store mean?
If only the index line is combined with the subline, then this concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked 180 of the largest e-commerce companies after estimating that total e-commerce sales were about $200 billion, while the largest 25 of them accounted for more than $159 billion.
Of these 25 retailers, 18 have only started online traditional retailers in the last five years (such as Macy's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
Alibaba Group has also invested 28.3 billion yuan in Suning YunÂïÜ, a company that has a long history of investing.
Globally, retailers and e-commerce are moving from a single channel to a full-channel retail system covering physical stores, e-commerce, mobile devices and social media.
Is the new retail industry more of a summary than a vision for the future?
If not, then what is the difference between the concept of a full channel and a new retail?
Perhaps, the key to the problem is not whether the linear and sublinear will merge, but how they will merge.
Looking back on the last 20 years of retail, the rise of e-commerce, as well as the rise of early-year discount retailers, all focused on price and convenience.
Based on these two pain points, e-commerce has moved products with a very high standard of product quality, such as books and CDs, from offline to online.
As online consumer habits are developed and customer experience is continually improved, e-commerce will also be extending its reach to other brands and begin to improve efficiency.
Using Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong's words, use the ideas and technology of the Internet to comprehensively reform and upgrade the existing total of about 30 trillion social retailers, enabling the increasingly rising consumer demands of Chinese consumers to be effectively met, enabling the entire process of production, distribution, and service of goods to become more efficient due to the widespread use of the Internet and big data.
The road to e-commerce, therefore, is a road to superficially light assets, actually heavy assets.
 light, which means that the burden of fixed assets, personnel deployment, management processes, etc. is not as great as traditional retail; heavy, which means that a huge investment in logistics, warehousing, etc. is required.
Changes in the way logistics are done have ensured the high efficiency of e-commerce.
According to Chinese government news, Premier Li Zheng Zheng, who presided over the State Council's standing meeting on April 28, considered expanding domestic consumption demand an important step towards steady growth and structural adjustment.
The meeting determined that the relevant departments should be quick to draw up specific plans based on scientific evaluation.
The export of some of the domestic consumer demands for daily consumer goods abroad, which are large, will be the subject of a pilot to reduce import tariffs by the end of June this year, gradually expanding the range of goods subject to tax reductions;
Combining tax reform, improved consumer tax policy on consumer goods such as clothing, cosmetics, and more, and coordinating the adjustment of the tax scope, tax rates and collection links;
 the addition and restoration of duty-free shops at port, the reasonable expansion of duty-free varieties, the increase in the quantity of duty-free purchases, the convenience of domestic consumers to buy foreign products at home;
 further facilitate the customs and refunds of goods and services to travellers from abroad, and strictly implement the requirement to file tax returns in accordance with the law on imported goods.
 develop a check-in and quarantine policy that supports cross-border e-commerce imports, clean up unreasonable import charges;
Accelerate the development of Chinese brand improvement projects, support the development of physical stores, and realize online and offline interaction.
ÔÇ∑ regulate market order, strictly combat fake and false negligence, promote good and evil.
It allows consumers to shop conveniently and conveniently.

On January 18, Alibaba held an e-commerce poverty alleviation summit in Chongqing, where it announced that it would promote precision de-poverty and rural revitalization by exploring new ways to get rid of poverty through the Internet+ and the Internet.
This is after the introduction of a rural strategy, the launch of a rural taboo project, the online promotion of the agricultural poverty alleviation platform, the establishment of the Alibaba poverty alleviation fund, Ali once again added value to the fight against poverty.
The fight against poverty is one of China's most important national strategies today.
A complete elimination of poverty in China has never been achieved in the past few thousand years.
 E-commerce poverty alleviation is a new round of innovation in poverty alleviation development, and is an important driver of achieving precise poverty alleviation, precise poverty eradication.
The Centre attaches great importance and notes that the Internet can play a role in promoting poverty alleviation, promoting precision poverty alleviation, and getting agricultural products out of the countryside via the Internet.
As a result, Ali already in 2014 proposed a rural strategy, along with big data cloud computing and globalization, as part of Ali's three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the ruralÊ∑òÂÆù (ÊùëÊ∑ò) project, recruiting small villages in rural areas, leading farmers to become wealthy through e-commerce.
In 2017, Ali collaborated with the business sector to build the RXZH Agricultural Poverty Alleviation Channel, which is currently cumulatively linked to 13 provinces, 120 national poverty-stricken counties.
The popular village of Taobao, which was born in Ali platform, has already reached 2118 villages.
Of these, nearly 400 are in poorest provinces, 33 in 13 poor countries.
In 2017, on Alibaba China retail platform, the sales of the nationwide Taobao Village reached 120 billion yuan.
Zhang Yong said that faced with a national strategy to break the poverty line, Ali has been thinking about how to use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovation capabilities of the wealthy Ali economy to find a new way to break the poverty line.
Of these, Mura Tao is the main platform for the elimination of poverty in the e-commerce sector in Alizh, and has led to a new network of direct-to-direct Internet poverty reduction.
In the planting sector, the village of Tao and the village of Zhongguo jointly implemented agricultural equipment and small loans to support agriculture.
In 2017, out of 832 national poverty-stricken counties, Goldwyn served 795 people, providing them with convenient payments, credit, and other services.
Cabbage is responsible for storage and logistics, cat is responsible for sales, big data anti-nutrition guides agricultural production, further improves the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of e-commerce poverty alleviation requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
Ali has launched an e-commerce program through the University of Taobao, taught standardized, qualified and scale farming methods to farmers, achieved a combination of poverty alleviation and mental health, and made farmers sustainable.
These programs have already covered about 92 percent of the state's poorest counties.
A public-interest approach, a business approach to poverty alleviation, can also ensure that Ali achieves real poverty alleviation while working to alleviate poverty.
Ma Yun, chairman of Alibaba's board, said that poverty eradication should be divided into three phases: poverty alleviation, poverty eradication and enrichment.
Poverty alleviation is about giving people fish, poverty eradication is about giving people fish, wealth is about making a fish market for farmers, and farmers have fish to feed.
The industrial poverty alleviation driven by e-commerce is the fishing industry.
In the field of industrial poverty alleviation, the Locawi Fruit Industrial Poverty Alleviation Model, developed by Ali in collaboration with Zillowzhka, has been widely replicated nationwide by relevant departments as a model.
The work of the Alizh e-commerce poverty alleviation organization has also been recognized by the decision-making body.
E-commerce companies represented by Alibaba have been parasitised, via online sub-channels, to ensure that farmers' incomes increase.
Some of the villagers and workers in the gold dress were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experiences of e-commerce poverty alleviation.
Currently, the UN World Food Programme's China office has worked with Murat Tao to alleviate poverty in the e-commerce industry in places such as Anzhong.
The third edition of the New Economic Think tank conference, co-hosted by the Ali Institute, China Visionary Think tank, was held on January 16, and Zhang Li, director of the Department of E-Commerce at the Research Institute of the Ministry of Commerce, attended and spoke.
She believes that we have in fact neglected the most important issue of globalization, the question of the physical and usable aspects of globalization, and the question of the stages of globalization.
Thus many people believe that globalization is stagnant, and many developed and developing countries, in the new phase, have different attitudes towards globalization, different patterns.
The second concept is the problem of the mid-globalization phase, and what constraints are there on the mid-globalization phase?
Restrictions on the basis of the economic environment are only restricted because the economic basis has changed and globalization has only become restricted.
Zhang Li believes that the global economic adjustment will essentially end at the end of 2017, and that a new round of growth will follow in 2018, with the next round of growth bound to be product pull.
JINGDON's first freshly opened 7FRESH supermarket, planned to open more than 1,000 stores nationwide over the next three to five years, recently opened.
Along with Ali's box of fresh meat, the super-species of the evergreen, the sweet of the sun, the fresh of the fresh of the fresh of the fresh, new retail shops began to emerge, and to innovate and even price each other.
The fresh supermarket is fighting for a war-torn upgrade, which has become a phenomenon in the new retail sector, where is the new retail?
 In 2018, we will be rapidly expanding nationwide, and a large number of stores will be opened in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before Spring Festival.
CEO Marzh Marzh 10 revealed the new strategy for 2018 at the second annual New Retail Summit.
 Starting in 2018, Box Horse is not only a vibrant e-commerce business, but also a lifestyle e-commerce business that caters to consumers with instant service.
The core mode is online with input, experience, online with real sales.
Unlike traditional department stores, supermarkets, box stores are a fun and tasty place for many consumers, and even some brokers have developed the concept of box-office houses.
Both online e-commerce platforms and offline retailers have their advantages and disadvantages, while consumers appear in multiple channels, so both sides are trying a full-channel model.
Industry believes that, in the context of the large upgrades in consumer spending, more and more shops will be selling boxed tickets in 2018.
And the box horse has been continuously exploring more consumer spheres from its initial freshness, predicting that in the new year, the retail market will be more innovative.
 For example, business models that combine online and offline, attract consumer attention, and vibrant supermarkets open everywhere are called "shades".
But these relationships said so much, never again, and finally realized that if you brought a good experience to the consumer, I was willing to pay for it.
According to the CEO, in the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed, so has purchasing demand.
Originally, pure linear, linear is broken, linear is to beat linear, linear is to counter-attack linear, now a handful, because consumers no longer have a linear underline distinction.
The capitalist conflict is entering a phase of a new retail firearm that is currently represented by the freshly-made supermarket.
Analysis suggests that while the current competition for new retail in first-tier cities is far from the Red Sea pattern, and there are still large second-tier cities to be explored, the market still has a lot of opportunities and space.
Different types of industries, for the new retail layout, will bring the development of new retail into a diversified state of development.
The Institute of Financial Strategy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has prepared a briefing for you, namely this annual report on the development of Chinese e-commerce in the South China Sea.
What kind of scorecard has China's e-commerce produced this year?
What other developments are occurring in global e-commerce?
Let us come together to reveal it to all.
Sales volume and sales volume again broke record records and accelerated track record.
Since 2006, China's online retail has been growing at a fast pace, with estimates that it feels fresh online shopping, and that it's cool to buy something without going out.
But since 2013, the growth rate of online retail has started to fall below 50%, and in 2015, the growth rate fell below 40% for the first time, and in 2016, it has actually become 26.2%.
But this year's situation is different, with online retail resurgent, and on September 1 this year, growth rose to 34.2 percent.
This is significantly higher than the growth rate of 2015 and 2016.
Perhaps you'll all go out and take a look around and find that buying and buying is more physically pleasurable.
Of these, physical goods online retail sales are nearly $50.8 trillion, and services online retail sales are nearly $1.49 trillion.
The social goods retail share reached 13.6 percent, an increase of nearly three percentage points.
Classmates, don't get your sleep, focus on the service, online retail is definitely a big deal!
The second-largest French internet users, with per capita internet purchases of $1,925 per person, and the most online purchases of goods, are clothing, a country that deserves to be fashion-loving.
Do you think the most popular online shopping is for young people?
 help you avoid a company becoming the next Uber startup.
Amy Eretz once wanted to investigate the happiness of employees at her e-commerce startup, but the investigation was not successful.
The answers we get are often vague, helpless, and even worse, deceptive.
Even though she promised to use anonymous forms, some employees still do not trust the process.
Eret is responsible for managing Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce services firm in San Francisco, and she said the responses received were inconsistent and unbiased.
So she called outside for help.
A new set of HR startups, such as Rainbow and Spring, have emerged to help companies understand how employees feel.
They have built and licensed software specifically designed to measure employee engagement, thus enabling companies to quickly conduct opinion polls targeting specific teams and demographics, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines to employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass executives and report directly to the board.
 Now, you can use tools like Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is the company's Fitbit?Jim Barnet, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup company Glint, said.Glint software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement
Eret said that within three years, she used Glint to gain more insight into employees' thoughts and feelings.
In addition to the quick survey and polls of specific teams, Glint also provides a company hotshot, which units complained the most, which managers approved the lowest, and clearly  which allows her to understand why.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must master the company's workplace culture to be the next Uber.Before Uber's former employees published a blog post describing harassment, these speakers were punished by the company, and Uber was then thrown into a scandal.
For startups like Glint, this desire to oversee a company is a huge business opportunity.
According to data from the financial technology analysis website Let's Talk Payments, by 2020, the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion.
Convercent, a Denver, Colorado-based startup dedicated to helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity in this area during a period of disruption to Uber's reputation earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla.
zh Uber recently signed on to become a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent can allow companies to send personalized diagnostic surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view hotspots of their problem areas.
Convercent also offers an anonymous text hotline, allowing employees to report bad behavior.
If the chairman is caught, the complaint will go directly to the board.
Patrick Kunlan, founder and CEO of Convercent, said: "The courts have seized the authority of the regulatory authority.
If a company is found to be treating its employees unfairly or behaving immorally, even if regulators do not intervene, it could also face the high consequences of consumer boycott, employee loss and involvement in litigation, Kunlan said.
Ruby Tuesday is a chain of catering stores in over 500 locations and employs more than 25,000 people, has been using Convercent for over a year, ensuring employees understand work ethics and work schedules, providing easy access to company headquarters.
Before that, if employees want to report a problem, they must find the company's headquarters phone number or email address, file a formal complaint, and hope that the headquarters will take this seriously.
This is often a frightening and disturbing experience, as Ruby Tuesday's general counsel for law, James Vitrano, says, noting that he believes there is no good way to track employee complaints.
But now the company uses Convercent to more quickly identify and solve problems that are unknown to executives in distant offices, cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - before they can do so.
"I can get a 360-degree understanding of the work experience from a closer angle", said Vitrano, who is in charge of the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
 We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation
Kunlan said that after the Andor accounting firm went bankrupt following the security scandal that violated ethical norms, companies have been putting more emphasis on ethics, values and employee engagement since 2002.
But it wasn't until social media entered their own worlds that companies realized they couldn't stop their outbreak from spreading viral online.
 Before the use of technology to monitor ethics, people viewed hope as a strategy,zh he said.
Glint and Convercent both offer their software as a service and charge companies a regular fee for using their products.
This business model and business opportunity is backed by venture capitalists, who have already supported both startups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and its total capital has risen to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million in funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness between companies, cultures and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing body of research shows that today's employees have higher expectations of the workplace than ever before.
In a highly competitive market like Silicon Valley, high-paying and interesting projects are just a matter of time.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued, and spent time in a company with a positive mission.
When people are happy to join a company, feel their voices are heard, and their work is rewarding, they will be more committed to making the company successful, said Nina McCartney, LinkedIn's vice president of global welfare and employee experience, who said LinkedIn uses both Convercent and Glint software at the same time.
Investors earn returns when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well when they have employee loyalty and commitment.
It is not surprising that if third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and commitment, they will seek financial support.
According to workplace culture experts, mastery of employee engagement data is very important.
However, unless the company's administrator takes action, the data is useless.
In fact, if a company asks employees to provide feedback, it can be expected that the company is undergoing a change.
If the change does not progress quickly enough, or if there is little progress, it can lead to disappointment and lead to employees leaving the company.
Russell Rath, head of consulting at Cote d'Ivoire International, a business management firm, said: "If you want to seek 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to conduct 4,000 conversations.
Because if we don't follow through, the staff will think, "Did you really hear me?"
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I?
Eret said,Madison Reed now conducts a monthly employee survey, and has been able to take action on the same day as the Glint report issue.
After collecting feedback from employees about their frustrated feedback about the speed of decision making and quality of communication, she was able to solve problems by reorganizing the company's internal team, increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday  The company is gaining new insights into its employees, and in the long run, they hope to make a transition in this industry known for its high talent loss rate, better retaining employees.
 If you don't work towards creating a culture of transparency, you will lose your talent, Vitranno said.
 If you lose talent, you will lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose the company.

The NCAA canceled training twice a day, extending the daytime training of the Bears.
At nearly 11 p.m., members of the UCLA football team chatted at the team's new campus practice field next to the team.
Some players have already stripped off their sports shirts, exposed to the body sweating after hard training on the first day of training camp.
For a large part of the team, a few minutes of this space is a break.
Players who participate in the summer program will return to the dorm after three hours of practice for the final exam, then the next morning at 6:30 a.m. return to Wasserman for the conference.
"The next three days were a struggle for these guys", Bear Coach Jim Mora said as he was about to enter Tuesday on Monday.
The NCAA canceled two practice sessions per day (intended to ease the burden on players), but actually extended their training time during the day - at least until Friday.
That's why the first three rounds of training at UCLA are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate a schedule that has already been squeezed by players.
From canceling two training sessions a day to more training sessions a day, the Bears began training almost a week before last season, and Mora trained at a summer school for the first time in six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to begin training 18 games on August 20, then begin preparing for the official game in September for the first Texas farm workers' strike.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule adjustment, although this would add another element to the player's busy journey.
"In three or four days, we will give them a huge amount of training, very challenging", says Morzh.
They've just passed, too. They're being trained, they're all great kids.
I thought about Saturday, we'd have more time, really great.
After training camp, UCLA will stop training. Given the clear view of the nearby parking lot and the Luskin Center, this is no easy task. The Luskin Center Senior Hotel has been hit by a football pitch after the defensive net has been hit.
Starting this weekend, the Bears will be staying at the hotel, but Mora admitted that once these rooms are empty during the season, problems could arise.
We will take security measures, Mora saidzh.
 This is a really worrying question. The idea that someone might rent a room, sit in the room and record a training scene, is not strong.
If you have a training video tape, it's pretty good too.
But we will take security measures there, and in the parking lot number 8.
We will make the best of our available resources.
I won't worry too much about that.
We have already made a plan.

Facebook will launch fact-checking and counterfeiting of fake news.
Facebook announced Thursday that it would send more potentially malicious articles to third-party analysts, and display the results below the post. Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to crack down on so-called fake news.
Facebook said in a statement on its website that Facebook will start using updated machines to learn to detect possible hoaxes and send them to a fact checker, and may display the fact checking results below the post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main sources of so-called fake news, and many believe Facebook influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
This issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, with voters experiencing a flood of fake stories before the French presidential election in May, Germany being the first country to support the penalty program before the September election, and fined if social media networks fail to remove hate posts in time.
Facebook said in a separate statement Thursday in Germany that the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany were launching a new fact-checking feature test.
Sarah Suzh, Facebook News & Delivery Product Manager, said in a blog post: "In addition to seeing which stories are questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people also want more background to help them make informed decisions about what they read and share.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its features for related articles and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
 Created a picture book: The Story of an English Castle
Recently, the small Scotchney Castle has been the main character in a compression music video, and once served as a refuge for Margaret Thatcher's husband during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney, in a comfortable location in the Belle River Gorge, Kent, witnessed 700 years of turbulent history, now it has become the inspiration for the graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes (a Yorkshire man with a special fondness for historical documents, who kept his head dragged).
 I could see the handwriting of an ancient man 300 years ago, I found it very beautiful, he often said with his full eyes.
What a human destiny it is to have this letter fall into my hands.
Spanning the Middle Ages through the Edwardian period, a castle in England reads a book that documents the various families living in Scotland, each story written by different British artists of the future such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book of archival material: he also wrote 2014's Tooth of the Dead and other stories, a book inspired by British library literature, a work he completed with an uncontrollable creative passion.
He said: "I cannot restrain my writing impulse from the moment I saw the fingerprints left on one side of the letter, written by a double agent working for the Jacobite cause in the 18th century.
That's his fingerprints!
And the letter always smelled like smoke, because then you need to light a fire to get the light.
For us 300 years from now, this smell makes us feel like they are also around us.
zh, I like the archival literature!zh!
For those who are struck by the old paperwork, getting the support of the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in the castle for almost four months (zh, to be honest, I've been here a little longer) seems amazing, I just can't believe it's true.
Rose spent several days visiting Victoria's New Castle, browsing the archives, exploring the many treasures and antiques of the estate, such as dog heads hanging from the wall, and bottles of centuries of time spent in the Watford River, etc.
He wandered the land and ruins of the old castle, chatting with vagrants, gardeners, and sometimes with illustrators drawing for his books.
Then, at night, he would drink a whiskey and then write.
Scotney's secret history is still unclear, as the National Trust did not fully gain access until after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hesse, in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rozz arrived, the staff had only begun to process the files, and he described them as being left by the nobles of hundreds of years ago: "Put it in the attic".
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, map out the territories of each country: You'd think land disputes would be boring, says Rose, but there would be two families who would play big for a white shrub.
Let it go, guys!
Some of the stories in this work use the castle as a starting point, leading to a broader study of British history, including The Labourer, which is a story about a man who left the newly built castle to join the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.
The story of the Knights of Kent and Sussex, in the book, tells of a riot in the castle in 1380, says Rose.
The peasant uprising began in that area, and I think that's a good place to start a revolt.
Perhaps the two are related?
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darre's hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or, the narrator of the story, the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrelier, who is believed to have conducted his own funeral by holding a stone-filled coffin (his coffin was discovered years later on the ground).
The Darrells were the favourite Scotney castle family of the Roths: these gentlemen seemed to be ruthless, constantly borrowing money, and then spending money on things they could not afford.
Generations of Darryl men have solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I think they should be a group of handsome boys who know how to pursue women.
As his assignment at the castle was over, Rodz began to look for other strange writing experiences.
He completed a sketch novel in two weeks in the Finnish wilderness about Elmzhynki, an early 20th-century nursing home that was later slowly abandoned.
But Scotney holds a special place for him.
"I was very sad to leave", he said.
It's like, 'Oh, I have to face the real world of the pitcher.

Every major energy company is a wealthy enemy, so who among the many energy companies around the world is the most profitable?
Yesterday, the renowned PFC Energy Company announced the top 50 energy companies listed in 2011, after U.S. oil and gas producer ExxonMobil won the joint venture with a market value of $40.63 billion, followed by China Oil and the Royal Netherlands.
In this list of PFCs, China Oil has twice been ranked in 2007 and 2009, with the top positions in other years all held by ExxonMobil.
In the 2011 top 50 list, a total of three companies from mainland China were included, in addition to China Oil, which ranked second, China Petroleum, which ranked ninth, and China Ocean Oil, which ranked 15th.
According to PFC's statistics, however, despite the fact that the current oil price is much higher than it was four years ago, the CEO of PFC Energy Company notes that there are many reasons for the low total market value, mainly including the fall in gas prices in North America, and the low activity of global stock markets.
According to Xinhua, the heavy pollution of the area and surrounding areas from 16 January to 19 January has worsened further, with the AQI of the city of Xinjiang, Xinjiang, showing a booming trend.
The United States amended the Green Card regulations.
Media outlets quoted President Donald Trump as saying that the United States will introduce a new immigration program, amend green card regulations.
The plan aims to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 a year, and temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications are subject to stricter regulations.
The new rule was proposed by the Republican and endorsed by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both Houses.
U.S. media quoted Trump as saying, "This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars by changing the way the U.S. grants green cards to citizens of other countries".
The law will replace the current program, reducing chain migration.
This new application process is conducive to applicants who speak English, have financial support, and have the skills that are beneficial for economic development.
On May 29, the first ever China Fireworks Safety and Environmental Exhibition will be held in Browzhyang.
The two-day event, which focuses on the themes of technology, safety, and environmental protection, will bring together the most advanced fireworks machinery, the safest environmental protection materials and new products in the national fireworks industry.
The exhibition will invite a large number of experts, entrepreneurs, to hold academic exchanges in the fireworks industry, and to share the latest technological achievements in fireworks safety and environmental protection.
Among them, the exhibition of smokehouse explosive machinery production equipment and safety products will be held in the town of Mazhzh, with major exhibition projects including technologically mature, scientifically validated and safety-proven smokehouse explosive production involving pharmaceutical machinery, safe fireworks, low-sensitivity, low-explosive energy, safe non-sulfur, micro-smoking, and safe personal combustion products.

To optimize the scenic area environment, build the beautiful Nanyu, recently, the Nanyu District Tobacco Bureau (TSB) has launched a volunteer service team to protect the environment.
The event was not only supported by the entire district tobacco agency staff, but also attracted retired senior staff, staff families, and others to join environmental practices, the three generations of elderly youth, mountain rangers, garbage cleaners, and the community to dedicate their efforts to building beautiful southern mountains.
This volunteer service event, which aims to protect the landscape resources of the Southern Hemisphere, promote the concept of volunteerism, love of others, love of society, love of nature, and also allow the next generation to accept and pass on the virtues of volunteerism from a young age.
The 636 volunteer service team has grown to 16 members since its inception in early April, and has since launched a series of volunteer activities to help disabled retail customers, help tobacco farmers care for tobacco leaves, and make a generous donation to the Yanzh earthquake, becoming a volunteer life force with a passion for positive energy.

Sex robots are indeed on the rise, but we should be cautious.
Just when you think 2017 won't be any more bizarre, a new technology development report has been released in the field of sex robots.
Yes, yes, yes.
But now sex robots are a big deal.
Recently, the Responsible Robot Foundation (FRR) released a report, looking forward to the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the breast and the type of nail.
Sharkey said in the release of the new report: "People are laughing behind the scenes, but the big companies have indeed launched a lot of sex robots, and we will see more too".
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots, they have skin, feel warm, and specifically use AI to set up human-like sexual responses.
Users can also customize their robots to suit their preferences, ranging from eye color, breast shape to nail type or color.
But even more disturbing is that many robots with personality traits make a replica look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with skin.
For example, RealBotix robots are able to derive from a definition what users find attractive, such as shyness.
There is also a Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion, which can pre-set personality traits, including a slightly shy, cold-blooded, and adventurous, wild-blooded witch hunts.
The Roxy Gold robot has as much personality as possible as you, the True Companion, can find on the company's website.
So she loves you, you love her, and you love her.
She was just as emotional those days as a normal person!
She can talk, talk, or be sexually aroused!
The rise of sex robots has brought a lot of unrest - not only replacing real human relationships, but also the feminine nature of the submissive, and the suggestion of rape drawn on Farah in cold weather is the most worrying.
True Companion on its website likened Roxxxy to a man's swinging stick.
The site says that if women have vibrating rods, why can't men have Roxxzhxy?
However, these sex robots are not a mere romance, nor is they merely a sex toy.
Their appearance and maturity directly refer to a darker, deeper part of our culture: fleeing perfect gender equality, moving toward submission to sex as an option.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes that sex robots are becoming increasingly popular, they are still currently on the fringe of a consumer culture.
But something that penetrates from the edge can give us a clearer picture of the course of this age in which we are living.
Many people would not be cunning or aggressive until the free market gave them the opportunity to become so.
These sophisticated sex robots are emerging in an era where global women's rights are under threat, the White House has a president bragging about sexual violence against women, and this is no coincidence.
The most daunting part of the woman's story is not the realistic picture, not the hanging corpse, not the eyes of the pair being dug out, but the overly realistic imagery.
The Republic of Kiribati was a leap forward, but now it seems that it is not far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to use the best technology possible to create the body that most resembles a real woman's body (although in proportion to porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have a human touch and mimic real human movement.
But frankly, their personality does not represent a real woman.
They cannot separate, nor can they go out.
They have no appeal agency, no follow-up story, no independence at all, and no fantasy of slavery that can be broken.
In other words, they are slaves to passion.
Or, as the 2017 saying goes: make a woman.

What is the great achievement of Trump?
Let Mitt Romney become the shorthand of common sense.
Political divisions have led to the polarization of the American electorate, while from a microscopic perspective, they have undermined the harmony of American families.
After Christmas and Thanksgiving, major newspapers across the United States filled in commentary columns with fears about how to deal with the Trump relatives who voted for him.
It is generally thought that we are doing our best to break through our bubble.
Less to the point, Trump's force to bring his family together is a force to be reckoned with.
I mentioned this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, who has long been at odds with the Republican in our home, was coming to New York to visit me this week.
She reminded me that united against a common enemy can produce powerful results.
Because of her White House collaboration with Trump, everyone she knew, including her Republican relatives, who had been in political strife for decades, now suddenly and oddly stood on the same front line.
If all of them are at the table, that's certainly a good thing, but what shocked me was that, from a broader perspective, this would pose a significant risk.
Although the left has always been affected by Trump's policies, the twisting effect of his presidency has driven us all to the right.
When we talk about normalization and Trump, we're talking about the possibility of concern that his bizarre behavior might one day stop.
However, there is a more worrying long-term scenario, where Trump is trying to normalize his relationship with right-wing Republicans, who have previously opposed Mr. President's standards, but now suddenly seem to be a rational symbol.
I recently discovered myself suspicious of the crazy freak of Mitt Romney: putting dogs in cars, 14% income tax, but at least we know his tax returns), for these two moves seem to be too minor a crime compared to Trump.
After the Trump era has passed, the next Republican candidate will need only reasonably qualify for invaluable improvement.
When my cousin lived in town, we took the kids to the New York Park Spinning Horse, the largest spinning horse operated by the New York Central Park Authority, and if you don't need coffee, this three-dollar ticket is the most valuable consumer of your time in this city.
The sound of the Kumi horse was as huge as thunder, the central cylinder was designed with fiberglass, all clowns and animals twisted their heads, dreadfully and viciously looking at their shoulders, while the music that resounded sounded oddly.
Too many ordinary cities are disappointing: the landscape overlooking the towers is getting old, the skyline is getting too familiar and can no longer provide much excitement, while the reality of cities is not supporting the dream.
35 years later, I still don't completely forget that day, when I discovered that this Swiss cottage was not actually a Swiss cottage, but rather a theme bar located in the old Swiss Cottage, which I can't remember, but near a crossroads in north London.
However, Central Park's rotating Tomi remains a magical experience, with two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old boy, and four 40-year-old girls taking part in the event, and everyone enjoying the fun.
If I could rate a rotating horse, I would give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before I had to clean my credit card, I was asked to rate my trading experience on a scale of one to five stars.
The same is true in the coffee shop on the corner of my street, and you can also choose to score with a 15% discount, which is to buy something at the counter.
The result of doing so is not only slowing down the speed of what should have been a neutral transaction, but also putting pressure on the server, adding personal factors to the unnecessary situation.
The poor woman in that department store smiled, sorry, and I was tired, and her credit card trading experience gave her a five-star rating.
Oscar Pistoles was transferred from prison to hospital with chest pains.
This is the second time Pistolis has left prison and been transferred to a hospital.
Last year he was taken to hospital for treatment of a broken wrist, and prison officials said the injury was caused by a fall in his cell.
After the prosecutor appealed the initial mistrial, Pistoles was convicted of murder.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he shot Stingcamp multiple times through the doorway of his Pretoria home, until his death.
Pistoles claims to have mistakenly mistook his girlfriend for a nightly intruder hiding in the back room.
Prosecutors have announced that they intend to appeal again, this time for six years in prison against Pistoles, who they consider too much mercy.
The State Prosecutor's Office has said it will appeal to the South African Supreme Court, which is due to hear the appeal this year.
If the prosecutor wins, Pistoles faces an increased sentence of 15 years in prison.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

On 18 May, the Ministry of Finance announced a special allowance for the management of the restructuring of industrial enterprises, which will be arranged to promote the dismantling of coal, steel and excess capacity of the steel industry, totalling 100 billion yuan.
In recent years, several local governments in Shanghai, Shaanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, and the state of Hilangjiang have repeatedly proposed reforms regarding the dissolving of excess capacity.
Of these, many provinces even propose that they actively seek central financial support for their provinces' de-energy finances.
One proof is that only eight provinces have declared coal-mining targets that meet 90% of the national coal-mining plan.
Linbergzheng, director of the Institute of Energy Policy Research at Xiamen University, said in an interview with reporters that the decommissioning capacity of the steel and coal industries is far from sufficient to rely on the central government for 100 billion yuan alone.
In the recently published coal-fired power generation implementation details, Shaanxi Province proposed restructuring Shaanxi Joke Coal Group into a state-owned investment company, restructuring the assets and operations of the enterprise, and building a brand new business model.
The actual funding gap may be three times that of previous subsidies, said Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, Shong Min, who said that preliminary statistics put the number of employees in the coal system at 1.3 million and the steel system at 500,000.
The South Korean daily newspaper reported that the results of the 2012 Guangdong Province Environmental Protection Credit Rating are being made public.
After the evaluation, 124 of the 1251 companies included in the Environmental Protection Agency's list of companies were not rated for reasons such as shutdown, non-approval, or shutdown.
Among the companies that are rated as red-hot, most of which are heavily polluting by electricity, printing, and other means of control, some wastewater treatment plants are also well-known.
The provincial Environmental Protection Agency said that, in order to reflect the principles of openness, fairness, impartiality, acceptance of public oversight, the results of the rating will now be published on the Environmental Protection Agency's website.
During the disclosure period, the Environmental Protection Agency will accept public calls, letters, visits, and other forms of reflection, and the Environmental Protection Agency will investigate, verify, and process the reflected issues.

This type of incurable disease affects the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 Britons, causing stomach cramps and diarrhea, frequent or bleeding diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue, etc.
Researchers at the University of Washington usually recommend that patients avoid eating meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers found that the essential amino acid-serine of proteins helps promote the growth of immune cells, which can increase the resistance of the intestines.
Dr. Marco Colonna, lead researcher, explains that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not enter the body.
zh maintain a balance between the cells that cause inflammation and the cells that enhance the tolerance, protecting the body from damaging all types of sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
When the equilibrium state is too inflammatory, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
In experiments, a cell-promoting immune system was discovered in small rodents carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need serine (one of the components of protein) to form the appearance of cells.
Professor Kolonna says: We have established a link between a bacterial population (the Roe's leucotuberculosis, which is a normal part of the gut microbiome) and a cell population that can promote the development of resistant cells.
The more serine the mice ingested in their diet, the more immune cells they had.
He suggested that if humans used the same method, combining the Lute Lymphocyte Bacteria and a diet rich in serine, it might form a more resistant, less inflammatory gut environment.
 Postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studied an immune cell with an enlarged immune system, when she discovered that a group of mice had such cells, but that another group did not have them when they were breeding the same strain separately.
She suspects that this difference is related to the small rodent's intestinal microbiome (i.e. bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract).
DNA sequencing of the cholesterol in the young was found to have 6 strains of bacteria present in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
The small rodents feed in a sterile environment, so they lack gut microbiota, and cannot produce this immune cell, while the presence of Luteo is responsible for producing immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers cultivated the Lutezhella bacteria in liquid, then transferred a small amount of non-bacterial fluid to immature immune cells that had separated from the small bat.
The immune cells develop into resistant cells.
When the active ingredient is purified from a liquid, it can be proven that the active ingredient is a byproduct of serine-azide metabolism, known as -3-lactate.
When researchers doubled the amount of serine in the mouse feed, the number of these cells increased by about 50%, but when the level of serine was halved, the number of cells was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that, like humans and mice, with the same growth-resistant cells, most of us have the same L. coli bacteria in our stomachs.
Whether humans can induce cell development by cell-inducing serine byproducts from lupus erythematosus, like the experimental rat, is not yet known, but serine-associated genetic defects have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
She says: The development of these cells may be exactly what we want to get, as these cells can control inflammatory responses on the surface of the intestine.
It can be said with uncertainty that the high levels of serine in lucerne lactobacillus may lead to an increase in the number of strains of the bacterium.
Jose Mourinho believes that United have signed the talented Nemanja Matiƒá.
On Wednesday night, after Nemanja Matiƒá made his debut against Sampdoria, Mourinho confirmed that Manchester United had signed a talented midfielder.
Mattich, from Chelsea, signed a ¬£40 million deal, and on Tuesday he scored 2-1 in the league's final pre-season game before the European Super Cup against Real Madrid in Dublin, winning the favour of Paul Bogba and Andr√©s As Pereira.
However, on the Primetime Asian Tour in Brussels, Mattichi's game was seriously understaffed, finishing with only 45 minutes, Mourinho admitted before the start of the season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and a genius way of thinking", said Mourinho.
 We will help him prepare as soon as possiblezh
Mourinho started to arrange his debut squad at the start of this season. Like Matƒçiƒá, newly signed players Viktor Lindlov and Romelu Lukaku also started to play at the Injeva Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still wanted to bring in three more players, but he insisted that the club had done a great job, he had four players in his mind, the club had already brought in three of them.
 The club has introduced three of the players signed, I am very grateful. He added
 If the club could bring in all four players, I would be happier, but they have already put in a lot of effort for mezh
Is the world at the peak of the space shuttle crisis, and would China fall behind if it did not build such a warship?
As the world's major naval powers recently announced plans to build new frigates, as if the frigates had become the focus of attention for the navies of the major powers overnight, first Japan decided to purchase two new frigates in the 2018 defence budget, which finally gave Japan's DEX frigate program a substantial breakthrough, then the US Lockheed Martin recently announced the latest plans for the US FGG frigate program, then where did China's new frigate come from?
With the sinking of the latest 054A-class frigate at the end of 2017, marking that the 054A class has built up to 29 ships, it has approached the sum total of the 053H series of frigates, while the construction of the 054A has been 12 years in the making since the first 054A sinking in 2006, and even worldwide, the construction of such a large number of high-performance general frigates, apart from China, can only be compared to the Peregrine-class frigates built by the United States in the last seven or eight decades.
The reason why so many 054As are being built is simple: the Navy has been in arrears for years, and it is cheap, useful, and supplemental.
The 054A has been favored by the Chinese Navy for many years, with its high performance and excellent combat capabilities, its discharge of about 4000 mm, a 76 mm main gun, 32 units of the Red Flag-16 and Fish-8 anti-submarine missile rack-launching vertical system, 8 jets83 and a straight-9 helicopter, although construction began in 2006, the design time is rather early, but its combat capability is still not too low, and it can also reach a mid-level among the ships of the world's fleet.
But this is a type of ship designed in the early 21st century, with weapons laid aside, its power system and electronic radar equipment already present a large gap from the current world's mainstream ships, and it's time to develop new models, such as European ships of the same type already equipped with full-power propulsion, small multifunctional controlled radars, large helicopter decks, and other types of ships.
So how China's new Zhengships should evolve is directly related to their future positioning and the strategic direction of our Chinese Navy.
The future development of the Chinese navy will be one that will become a blue-water navy completely, and the future will be one that will move to the ocean, with rapid deployment in areas where China's interests are relevant, showcase its military presence, and be able to have a strong combat force when necessary to ensure that China's interests in the region are not damaged, so it seems that the new Huayjiang will move towards a greater, more oceanic development.
If we look at the positioning of the new type of frigate in the future Chinese naval sequence, the future Chinese Navy should be similar to the US Navy, removing the necessary near-sea defense ships, other major ships will be formed as a carrier battle group or as a warship strike group depending on the situation.
While the role of the new battleship in future aircraft carrier combat groups should serve as anti-submarine and mid-range airlift positions, in both attack groups it should serve as a class of battleship, then, according to such requirements, the new battleship must have strong anti-submarine capabilities and excellent mid-range area airlift capabilities.
Based on the above position, it is possible to boldly imagine a future model of the domestic patrol boat.
First of all, the discharge will increase significantly compared to the current 054A-type frigates, with the estimated discharge of the new frigates reaching 5000-6000 rounds; the propulsion system will be a combined power drive system consisting of an improved QC280 gas turbine and two diesel engines, the maximum flight speed is expected to be about 30 knots, and the durability will also increase significantly; so far as the weapon configuration of 76mm main guns and 1130 short-range guns should be maintained, but will increase the launch system of the Red Flag 10, the main gun rear should have a 32-48mm vertical system of the improved Red Flag 16 and the Fish-8 frame, the rear should have an 8-16mm vertical system for launching and patrol vessels similar to the new radar and patrol; the radar platforms, the radar platform
In this way, the overall level of the new type of submarine will reach the current world-class level, even if it is not much lower than the US FGG.
Of course, the above concept is just a guess about the newly built patrol boat, specifically how we can only wait until the new patrol boat goes down, let's look forward to it together.

In recent years, our city has encouraged businesses to take an active part in the construction of national, industry and regional group standards, to give a reward of 300,000 yuan to companies that lead or participate in the development of standards for the Zhejiang Manufacturing Group, to give a reward of 500,000 yuan to companies that have passed the Zhejiang Manufacturing Brand Certification, the highest amount of the award in the entire province, and to inspire enthusiasm for the brand.
Days ago, in the Wangli Group production workshop, the head of the group system, Kogen, together with his staff, were packing a security security case for theft prevention, as part of the Zhejiang manufacturing group's standard sample for standardised work, ready to be sent to the Shaoqing Quality Control Centre.
Just the previous two days, Wangzhye had passed a field audit of the Zhejiang Manufacturing Certification Expert Group.
The team of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations praised the group's achievements in core areas such as quality excellence, autonomous innovation, agreed to be fully consistent, and, as long as the product passes the test, Wangzheng will be one of the first to pass this standard.
Wangqi Group is just a shortened version of the standard industrial transformation upgrade.
Our city is also conducting the Zhejiang Manufacturing Group Standards for Standard and Standard Work alongside the Zhejiang Group of Lifting Groups.
Since the Zhejiang Manufacturing Team standard was developed by the Myzhong City Anti-Theft Security Gate Industry last year, companies like Star Moon, Ningdo and others have also actively applied for counter-contract work.

Is the debt-to-GDP ratio closer to the U.S. than the fact that it's worse than not being able to afford a home?
In recent times, everyone has been discussing what changes in real estate policy have recently occurred, whether real estate policy should be relaxed again, whether land policy should diversify to meet the needs of the subject, or whether it will cause house prices to fall.
But, while we were worried about real estate prices, macroeconomic regulation, and the future trends in the real estate market, the last time we were talking about the adjustment of the regulation of real estate, the last time we were talking about the regulation of real estate, now the discussion is a more serious topic than not being able to afford a home, which is whether you can afford a home, but still get a loan.
Today, we're going to talk about a more serious issue than buying a home: repayment of loans.
China's increasing housing debt crisis
The People's Daily published a commentary on January 17th in an overseas edition of the journal, which found that according to data from the text, in November 2017, the National Finance and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Center for Research on National Balance Sheet, reported on the third quarter of China's de-leveraging process, the residential sector's leverage rate continued to rise, rising from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, up 1.3 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017, up 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The residential sector's debt share in the entire physical economy is increasing, and leverage rates are rising faster.
Related studies have shown that Chinese households' liabilities in financial institutions are mainly based on consumer loans, accounting for about 2/3 of the residents' liabilities, which is about twice the amount of business loans.
Of these, consumer loans, medium-term loans, mainly home loans, account for about eighty percent, but in terms of growth, short-term consumer loans grow faster, higher than medium-term loans.
In addition, the Chinese household debt ratio is merely a statistic of the total amount of credit the household sector receives from financial institutions, while Chinese households have a large amount of hidden debt, including private loans from relatives and friends.
According to statistics from the SUNY Institute of Finance, in 1996 the Chinese population had leveraged just 3%, in 2008 it was only 18%, but since 2008 the population has been growing rapidly, doubling in just six years to 36.4%; by the third quarter of 2017, the population had reached 48.6%.
In May last year, HSBC released a survey report of nearly 10,000 respondents across nine countries.
The visiting subjects of this report were young people from 9 countries born between 1980 and 2000.
The report notes that in China, the proportion of post-80s housing for young people reaches 70%, with Mexico, the second country (46%), and the United States having twice the proportion of this indicator (35%).
These data tell us of a highly likely problem that is that, compared to the unable to buy a house, the largest potential population of Chinese residents at this stage is estimated to be unable to pay off debt.
Second, why is the mortgage crisis the most serious problem?
As we have previously analyzed, although we have always said that China's housing prices are higher, but compared to other countries in the world, China's housing ownership rate is actually quite high, so instead of saying that housing prices are too high to buy, I'm afraid now to ask many friends the question is, can you still get a loan?
We've been looking around the world at real estate markets, and the Chinese real estate market has not yet experienced a major real estate crisis due to a late start, except for the Hainan we mentioned earlier, but the origins of the global financial crisis of 2008 were the U.S. real estate crisis just a decade ago.
The real estate crisis in the United States is blamed on two houses: the Household and the Real Estate.
At the time, in the American Golden Age, real estate companies sold homes to low-income people in the United States at extremely low prices in order to expand sales, and when the U.S. economy was booming, the real estate market was booming, but the prospects were short-lived, as growth in the U.S. economy stalled, causing home buyers' incomes to fall, and large household spending began to fall.
However, at the time, the U.S. was composed of financial assets and real estate as a component of the assets of American households, and the low-income groups in the U.S. had almost all of their household assets as real estate, while the top 20% of high-income groups had most of their assets as financial assets, which resulted in higher liabilities for the property of the poorest households in the U.S.
A serious fact is that these people bought houses at a better economic time, so the money to pay the mortgage was also calculated on their better income, and when the income dropped, the pressure on the mortgage did not only drop, but even increase as some subprime plans became floating, so that under this austerity, the real estate problems of these American families gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
Since then, some people have been unable to pay their mortgages because of their low income, so banks have begun to collect their properties, and after banks have recovered their properties from borrowers who have borrowed loans, they sell them at extremely low prices, causing the house price in the area to drop gradually, this process has triggered further house prices to drop, forming a vicious cycle, and after house prices have fallen to a certain extent, more and more buyers find that their house prices are even lower than their loans, so more people stop continuing to lend, and more and more are causing bad bills.
Thus, a huge vicious cycle is formed:
 Economic uncertainty Income decline Some people still can't afford to pay mortgages Low prices in banks sell houses Deferred homes Lower prices in homes More people stop paying mortgages Banks sell homes Lower prices in banks......
The problem is that, because the house price is continually falling, you stop lending houses to banks and you don't have any debt anymore, if the money you get from the house auction is not even up to your bank loan, then you still need to repay the money, simply say, if you pay $600,000 for a home loan of $2.4 million, buy a house that was worth $3 million at the time, when the house price drops to just $2 million, you no longer lend the house to the bank, after the bank auctioned the house, you not only lose your $600,000 deposit, but you also pay $400,000 for a bank loan, you still have to repay the money.
So, just under this vicious cycle, the U.S. economy gradually collapsed, eventually triggering the 2008 U.S. financial crisis.
So, the high level of household debt at the current stage of 46.8% is a very wary issue, a figure that is currently still below that of developed countries, but the root of the problem has begun to emerge, with the country repeatedly stressing leverage since last year, a very predictable judgment, that if the household debt rate is allowed to continue to rise, it will inevitably pose a huge risk, so we must strictly guard against the emergence of financial risk.
So, with the subsequent location of the house for living, not for use, the country will more quickly establish a multi-subject supply, multi-channel security, lease and takeover, and further unravel the potential risks.
For our individual families, it is imperative to abandon the idea of real estate speculation, to make a reasonable purchase, to avoid the enormous burden of our own families, and only a reasonable assessment of our income and debt levels is a healthy way to grow our family's wealth.

British inventors implanted chips in their bodies, waving them into the car.
A British inventor installed a chip for himself, could open his front door with just a wave, enter his office and even start his car, becoming the first person in the country to do so.
Steven Northum, 33, implanted a small chip in his thumb and forefinger and is now offering this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, a service made possible by his company BioTeq zh through technology.
He has worked with Dr. Jeff Watson, a senior adviser to the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure that the implantation process meets medical standards.
This technique is similar to implanting a cat-dog chip in a human body, and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will also replace the locks of rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, costing ¬£300 each.

White House tools cost thousands of dollars.
According to military records published in the magazine ZZZZZZZ, last month the White House decided to ship a Marine Corps helicopter to South Straw to show the great glory of American manufacturing, costing up to $24,000.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3Dzh ((also known as Marine Corps No. 1 during the presidential ride) is a major exhibit at the White House on July 17 highlighting U.S. construction project activities.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufactured goods from all 50 states.
The exhibit includes a Connecticut-built helicopter, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi fork.
According to records from the Marine Corps Helicopter First Flight Squadron (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House military office required the helicopter to be in service by daily order (FRAGO), that is, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in Nanzhong to participate in this special operation.
The day before the event, the HMX-1 commander said in an email sent to the Navy's Flying Vice Commander, "I just wanted to confirm that you know, because this event is highly regarded".
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive at the South Shore at approximately 7:00 a.m. on July 17 to participate in the 3:00 p.m. event, leaving only after the 6:00-9:00 p.m. clear of the shore that night.
The information also says that if the time to leave the White House is delayed, the return flight will require a second crew because of shift time restrictions.
The original crew members were stationed at the helicopter side during the operation, while the security forces were stationed nearby when the aircraft was on the ground.
The records obtained by the magazine Êó∂‰ª£zh are not clear as to whether a second crewman is needed in the end.
The Hajj Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1zh asked if this activity violated the law.
The commander wrote that one of the questions we asked was whether this violated the Hajj Act and was told that there was no violation.
It sounds like you're locked up, the deputy commander replied.
The White House has defined this "American Manufacturing" event as an official event and is therefore not governed by the "Hadge Act".
But even official activities are politically charged.
During the event, the president introduced the Senate's then-current theme of health care reform, and boasted of regulatory oversight of government regulations.
It is no longer a new phenomenon to use the first Marine Corps or Air Force aircraft for political propaganda purposes.
All former presidents have been required to travel and board these planes.
But it is not uncommon to use it for photographic purposes alone.
Trump was the subject of much attention in February, when in Melbourne, Florida, the presidential plane was slowly sliding, finally stopping in the background of his first campaign rally, while his Twitter account was full of complaints about the former president using the presidential plane.
White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said the White House was excited about the next American Manufacturing Expo, which featured products from all 50 states, all made by American workers using American materials.
HMX-1 crews frequently fly training near Washington and South Strait, practicing the precise location of the President of the United States in the White House.
During the G20 summit in Germany in early July, during which Trump attended, HMX-1 exercised 58 landings at the White House.
An official said the flight from the U.S. manufacturing facility was included in the crew training requirements for this month.
The helicopter force also flew an additional 11 hours of non-presidential support on that day.
The White House said the taxpayer did not bear the cost of any other supplies for the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging the display of the Nanzhzhaya helicopter.
HMX-1 does not retain budgetary records of presidential flights, so it is very difficult to determine the exact cost of this event.
But according to the Department of Defense's 2017 fiscal year hourly fee record, the Department of Defense's refundable fee for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit's records record for every flight of an aircraft from the base of the Naval Air Station in Chickamauga, Virginia, is 30 minutes.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower than that.
Walters said that it is very misleading to estimate the cost of taxpayers' fees based on refundable fees.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many others, including the cost of sinking in the annual allocation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the Department of Defense's refundable costs do not include personnel costs, but do include fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Shawn Spike defended the helicopter's use for the event,
The idea is to showcase something made in the U.S. this week,
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are both proud of it, they have both contributed a force to our national security, and I guess even if not thousands or hundreds of people's jobs depend on it.
And I feel like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, the result of countless hard-working Americans.
So emphasizing this is certainly not inappropriate.
We don't know for sure whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while visiting South Strawz during the campaign, but he did sit in the fire truck's steering seat.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky on behalf of the company, joking with the media about the company's own aircraft.
He said that he knew Sikorzhsky very well.

According to Market Star, from 2005 to 2011, the province's GDP increased from the middle to the second-highest level.
But the province's economic growth still faces difficulties such as low investment efficiency, lack of core competitiveness in the industrial economy, and so on.
Based on some indicators of economic representation of the province in 2005 and 2011, it was compared with the national and central regions.

Large investments did not bring the corresponding economic benefits, and are an important reason why the quality and efficiency of our province's economic growth is not high.
To this end, experts suggest, effective measures to encourage enterprise innovation, and the scientific achievements of universities and research institutes should be transferred to enterprises in a timely manner.
