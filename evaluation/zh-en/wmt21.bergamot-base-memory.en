Where to find people?
Excellent return to the migrant workers group is an indispensable force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26th: The outstanding return migrant workers to build a rural revitalization force
The 34-year-old Zhang Xiong family is in the Orchard Village of Meishan City, Sichuan Province, and in 2010 he gave up his monthly salary in Beijing to return to his hometown to start a business.
After several years of hard work, he now runs a grape-growing family farm with an annual income of more than one million yuan, becoming a well-known wealth leader, and has also been selected into the village "two committees" team.
In recent years, under the encouragement of a series of agricultural and agricultural policies such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start a business, activating a spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a large province of population and labor export in the western part of China, has been guided by the snobby implementation of the "excellent migrant workers return to training project", and in 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were generated from the outstanding migrant workers who were attracted, 61,000 village reserve forces were cultivated, and more than 20,000 party members were developed, providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
Small well-being, the key is to see the fellow.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in rural China have increased their income, and some have created their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively, it has also led to the emergence of rural "hollowing" to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations, and the village party branch secretary and party members have shown the characteristics of "one old and one low", that is, aging age, low education, and the village party organization leader's team is not strong, and the problem of not being followed by the yellow is prominent.
If the elements such as rural talents have been flowing to the city in a one-way direction, the countryside has long been in a state of "blood loss" and "anaemia", and revitalization is an empty phrase.
Attracting those migrant workers who are capable, conscious, and interested in serving their hometowns, guiding them to return home to become rich leaders, and cultivating party members and rural cadres from them, enriching the grass-roots cadres, which is the solution to the treatment of rural party members and grass-roots party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers can lead back, but also let them stay, do a good job.
In recent years, Sichuan has started from the construction of the peasant labor force, on the basis of strict candidate standards, the establishment of excellent migrant workers directed back, service guarantee, training ability, selection and use of institutional mechanisms, so that they have an improvement in ability, work security, life is expected, really in the countryside to take root, the officer entrepreneurial sense of accomplishment.
This year is the end of the year of decisive fighting against poverty, and to do a good job in linking poverty alleviation with rural revitalization, talent is the key factor.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding migrant workers who have returned home, and through comprehensive measures, they will be built into a task force and a force that can be retained, fought, and taken away, so as to provide strong organizational support and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and well-off development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are a very special one, on the evening of July 11, bilibili summer graduation song will bring a special online live performance for graduates, old wolves, Park tree, Li Yuchun, Mao is not easy and other musicians for the recent graduates to send songs and blessings.

The natural ecology of the capital continues to improve, attracting wildlife cities to "settle"
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing.
Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned from the Municipal Bureau of Landscaping that in recent years, with the continuous improvement of the natural ecological environment of the capital, the types and number of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife living in Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including national-level protected animals such as brown horse chickens and black storks, as well as secondary protected animals such as antelopes, large swans, gray cranes, and ducks.
Whether it is a city forest planted in the second ring, or a small micro-wetland embedded in the building, it not only brings the wild interest of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In the middle of summer, it is located in the Songshan National Nature Reserve in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District.
One of the squirrels played leisurely beside the mountains, and two dogs and thugs fought each other.
Looking back, a wild boar can't help but "sting" on his body, and is rubbing the bark. Hu Qiaoli, director of the Matsuyama National Nature Reserve Management Department, introduced that by the end of 2019, in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, there were 178 species of wild animals, including the national protection of animal gold carvings and national secondary protection of spoon chickens and lantels, and nearly one-third of the city's wildlife species can be found here.
"In Songshan, wild animals are the real 'masters', and our staff can only be regarded as people's 'guards' at best."
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the situation of wild animals and plants in the protected area on the ground, more than 30 professional patrol members are patrolling along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day, and there will be a "turning circle" every month, and almost walking through the entire protected area in a whole day.
“At the time of inspection, it is not only necessary to check the recording of biodiversity, but also to check the installation of artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install infrared cameras in the wild, and so on.”
Songshan National Nature Reserve has installed more than 200 infrared cameras to record the living status of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that with the continuous enrichment of biodiversity in the protected areas in recent years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the lens, leopard cats, squatters and pigsters have become "resident guests", and the "out-of-the-box rate" of national secondary protection animals is getting higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, director of the wildlife and wetland protection department of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscaping and Landscaping, said that Beijing's terrestrial vertebrae wildlife has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 species, and the species and number of wild animals in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
The presence of wild animals in cities is becoming more common, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of the capital city in recent years.
In particular, a new round of afforestation and greening construction of one million mu began in 2018, proposing to reshape the urban ecological environment, improve the ecological function of forest green space, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
The plan strives to interact with the surrounding green space to facilitate the "visiting relatives and friends" of wild animals, and the trees are also the favorite honey and food plants of animals.
Black land "sow" out of agricultural modernization - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26th: Black land "sows" agricultural modernization
In the summer, two spraying pharmaceutical aircraft swept over the 10,000-acre high-yield demonstration field of the second operation station of the Fifth Management Zone of the Friendship Farm, forming two white lines, and the "first match in the world" with black rice seedlings in the green field was particularly eye-catching.
The station manager of this operating station, Kong Lingqiang, said that this aircraft can spray more than 6,000 acres of arable land a day, which is about 8 times more efficient than drones and hundreds of times that of artificial labor.
This farm is located in the territory of Heilongjiang Province, China's first grain-producing province, and from the past "sun" rice cutting sound through to the current "rumbling" motor sound, Chinese traditional farming and farms in this black soil belt to achieve transformation.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in modern agricultural production on Friendship Farms.
On the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve accurate fertilization, reduce agricultural inputs, and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standardized operation level of agricultural machinery in the field.
In this year's rice production process, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation unmanned cutting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology makes the seedlings plant more even, which can maximize the utilization of sunlight and arable land resources, and save 16 yuan per acre of labor costs.
Farms have tried new technologies such as informationization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of farm agricultural machinery is 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field is 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations to achieve GPS satellite navigation 100%, dry field precision sowing 100%, dry field high-horsepower locomotive operation 100%.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture, digital agriculture is the direction of agricultural modernization."
The president of the Friendship Farm, Liu Hualian, said.
The key to agricultural modernization is scientific and technological progress.
Heilongjiang agricultural reclamation, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role in modern large-scale agricultural "carriers" in recent years, and initially established a modern agricultural industry system led by large-scale planting, standardized production and industrial management.
On the outskirts of Friendship County, there is an agricultural machinery exhibition park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
Here, more than 140 (pieces) of agricultural machinery have been introduced and used by Heilongjiang agricultural reclamation over the years.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.

French church fire in Nantes: parish volunteers admit arson peace
According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the religious historical buildings of Nantes, France, the famous St. Peter and St Paul's Cathedral, were severely damaged in a fire, and the large organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, Nantes prosecutors announced that a parish volunteer in charge of defending the cathedral had been charged with "arson destruction".
He admitted that he had set fire to the church.
Senas, the local prosecutor, said the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted to igniting three places in the cathedral at night.
The man’s lawyer said the arsonists now regretted doing such a thing.
A few years ago, he entered France through the way of refuge, was sheltered in the parish where the fire occurred, and was taken in into the church.
The prosecution noted that recently, he tried to renew his visa and was in dialogue with the police.
But the church said it still couldn't believe that this usually very kind, smiling believer, but not much to talk about, will destroy the church he loves so much.
On the day of the July 18 fire, the volunteer had already received a police inquiry and investigation because of the logical problem in the narrative, but he was later released.
Firefighters are on the scene for rescue.
On the evening of the 25th, as a professional engineer at the laboratory of the Central Police in Paris obtained new evidence, the person was again arraigned.
This time, the man admitted to his act of arson.
If convicted of intentional arson damage, the suspect could face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to the report, the fire caused serious damage to the St. Pierre and St. Paul's Cathedral, the organ inside the church was completely destroyed, and the stained glass windows behind the organ were also severely damaged.
Brune, the chief architect of the French Historic Preservation, said it was conservatively estimated that the restoration of the cathedral in Nantes would take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: US unilateralism undermines bilateral relations International public opinion supports China's counter-measures against the United States
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the permission for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu and put forward specific requests for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious trouble to China-US relations, and China has responded to the unreasonable provocations taken by the United States, and it is legitimate and necessary to take countermeasures.
Andrés Borks, director of the China Studies Center at the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile, said that the unilateralist measures of the United States have damaged the bridge of understanding between the two peoples and caused a crisis in the relations between the two major countries.
China's notification of the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to unilateral measures by the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Justo, a professor at the University of Argentina and director of the Center for Argentine-Chinese Studies, said that China's decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the previous provocation of the United States, and is not aimed at ordinary American people.
The United States is trying to divert the attention of the American people by putting pressure on China to cover up its weak response to the new crown epidemic.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the United States has taken a provocative diplomatic stance, causing serious problems in bilateral relations between China and the United States, and facing serious challenges in bilateral relations.
China's notification to the United States that the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal counter-measure, in line with diplomatic practice, which reflects both China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests and the reasonable and favorable interests of China's diplomacy.
Tanzanian commentator Francis Semwenza said China's decision was a legitimate and necessary response to the provocations made by the United States.
China-US relations should return to normal, and the US should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how it can win economic and political win-win results with China and how it can benefit the two peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yusuf, executive director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, said that the countermeasures that China has been forced to take are a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States, in line with international law and basic norms of international relations, and in line with diplomatic practice.
Earlier, the US called for the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston to seriously violate international law and basic norms governing international relations.
It is hoped that the US side will rescind the previous relevant decision and create the necessary conditions for the return of bilateral relations to normal.
Singapore's "Lianhe Zaobao" published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of the US's step-by-step efforts, although China is very reluctant to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Poland to withdraw from European treaty to prevent violence against women
Poland's justice ministry said Saturday it will take steps to withdraw from the European treaty on violence against women next week.
Poland’s right-wing government cabinet says the treaty requires schools to teach students about gender issues and trample on the rights of their parents.
Poland’s Justice Minister Joblow told a news conference that his Ministry of Justice would ask the Ministry of Labour and Family Monday to begin withdrawing from the treaty.
The treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
According to Gioblo, “the treaty contains elements of a morphological nature that we consider to be harmful”.
Poland’s ruling Law and Justice Party, together with its governing coalition partners, has a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and promotes a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main topics during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, staged protests against the withdrawal from the convention in Warsaw and in some other cities.
One of the organizers of the protests, Lempat, said in a protest march in Warsaw that “the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence.”
Some protesters held banners that read “The Law and Justice Party is a woman’s hell.”
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland’s former centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice party government said the treaty did not respect religion and required liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
So far, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

FAA orders to check 2,000 Boeing passenger planes
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring emergency inspections of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737 Classic passenger aircraft registered in the United States, because the air check valve of the above passenger aircraft may cause engine air parking after corrosion.
The FAA said it had received four reports of air-parking of engines for 737NG and 737 Classic aircraft so far, leading to an emergency inspection request for passenger aircraft that had been parked for seven days or more and fewer than 11 flights since re-entry.
The Federal Aviation Administration warned that if the fifth-class check-up valve of all two engines of the passenger plane is corroded, it may die in the open position, causing the passenger to completely lose power and unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that once the check valve is found to be corroded, the airline operator must replace the key component before the passenger plane is put into service again.
Boeing later in the day responded that the outbreak of the new crown epidemic led to a decrease in travel demand, many passenger aircraft were sealed or less used, "the check valve is more likely to be corroded."
Boeing also said that it has recommended that the airline operator inspect the passenger aircraft involved in the order, and if the problem is found, Boeing will provide assistance in overhauling and replacing the check valve.
The Associated Press reported that passenger aircraft under the major U.S. airlines usually fly multiple times a day, but after the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, a large number of passenger aircraft were grounded; as passenger travel demand has recently grown slowly, some passenger aircraft have returned to operation.
The FAA did not release details of four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines revealed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The airliner said in a statement that on its flight from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, on July 15, an engine suddenly turned off and the passenger plane finally made an emergency landing at Austin airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the aircraft's engine and had inspected the engines of six aircraft in accordance with FAA instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th that their passenger aircraft did not have a fire with the engine associated with the air check valve.
Four of the American Airlines aircraft will be inspected, and 28 of United Airlines' aircraft will be inspected.
Delta said it would check its 20 planes, but did not say whether there had been a engine shutdown.
According to multiple media reports, the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive is another shock to Boeing.
Lion Air Indonesia and Ethiopian Airlines each lost 346 deaths in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively.
The series of passenger planes was subsequently grounded worldwide, discontinued in January this year, and resumed production in May.
Federal Aviation Administrator Steve Dixon admitted in June that the FAA had “made a mistake” in regulating Boeing over the 737 MAX.

"Shangjiang South" in pursuit of poetic "Yellow River dream"-Zhongxin.com
(China's poverty reduction story) "Shangjiang South" pursuit of poetry "Yellow River dream"
China News Agency Yinchuan July 26th (Yang Di) "Nine songs of the Yellow River thousands of lis, the waves from the end of the world."
The Yellow River, which has stirred up the pride of countless literates, has given birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain, and now Ningxia, which has the beauty of "Shangjiang South", is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority and green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River Dream".
The “Bibo Dream” of the River Clear Water Show
"The world's Yellow River Fu Ningxia", the Yellow River through Ningxia 397 kilometers, is the nurturing side of the "mother river."
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the imbalance between the development and utilization of rivers and lakes and the protection of management, the chaos of excessive sewage discharge, the construction of the lake, and the encroachment of the water are highlighted, resulting in the black smell of the water, the excessive water quality, the dirty environment, and the ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of water ecology, and strives to restore the Yellow River water shuixiu river.
Water should be cut from the source.
In Ningxia Yinchuan, the local "standard + pollution control + strict control" approach, the industrial park sewage all achieved centralized treatment, urban sewage treatment plants all achieved a first-class A standard discharge, the city built-up area of black and odorous water body basically eliminated, successfully declared the third batch of China's black and odorous water demonstration city.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake long system in 2017, and now has achieved full coverage of the responsibility system of the five-level river and lake system in the counties and counties, and the long-term patrol of the river and lake has become the norm.
The 64-year-old Gu Jincheng, who lives in a village on the Yellow River, witnessed the change of the Yellow River: “The water before it smelled, and after the rectification, the odor was gone.”
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is good, his life is more comfortable, and now he often goes to the Yellow River with his family for a walk and feels the blue sky.
The "Wetland Dream" of the Shaguo Xiangxiang
Birds, green trees, stacks, turquoise water... The beauty of Fan Zhongyan's "sand gulls in the Xiangjie" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River through Ningxia, along the way to the formation of rivers and wetlands, lakes and wetlands, swamp wetlands and other wetlands, to promote the rational use of water resources and water ecological balance plays an important role, but also become an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, the relevant departments of Ningxia have invested a total of about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects, at present, Yinchuan wetland area of 19,200 hectares, wetland protection rate of 78.5%, there are natural lakes, swamp wetlands nearly 200, with 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks, 8 municipal parks.
Lv Jinhu, deputy director of Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity and is particularly evident in birds, "the gull is an endangered bird, only more than 20,000 in the world, of which Yinchuan Wetland is inhabited by more than 2,000."
At the same time, Ningxia has delineated a red line of 500 meters in the wetland protection area on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, and stipulates that no unit or individual may carry out development, construction and business activities within the scope of protection except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, introduced that through the pollution source management, comprehensive remediation of river and lake ecology and the construction of the end wetlands, the water quality of Ningxia's 9 main yellow drainage ditches has reached 100% of the Class IV standard, "now the water is also clear, the fish also swim, and the flowers are also opened."
The "Drinking Water Dream" of Inclusive People's Livelihoods
Ningxia Yinchuan City once had the title of "embarrassing": the only city along the Yellow City that "guarded the lack of water and drank the Yellow River".
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing the continuous peak of summer water shortage problems, nearly a decade of "water shortage pain" has become a summer suffering experience for many high-floor residents, but in the major water sources in the limit of over-harvesting, urban underground has formed a large area of groundwater over-the-funnel area, water-based water shortage has become a problem that plagues Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, the water of the Yellow River after drinking and purification has become a good way to solve the problem of drinking water for local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Municipal Water Bureau, introduced that in order to improve the demand for water for urban and rural residents of Yinchuan, Ningxia timely launched the water supply project of the urban and rural western line of Yinchuan Metropolitan Area, replacing the original groundwater source with high-quality Yellow River water.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially connected to the three districts of Yinchuan City, and in 2020, the residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank the water of the Yellow River."
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan water conservancy department will consider the transformation of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply integration, "the next step, we will integrate the scattered rural water supply points into the western water supply project, is expected to basically realize the Yinchuan area of urban and rural integrated water supply by the end of this year."

For the first time, the United States launched a countervailing investigation against China with a "rishne exchange rate undervaluation"
In response to the US Department of Commerce recently announced that it decided to launch an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation on products originating in China, and launched an investigation on the "RMB exchange rate undervaluation" project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has investigated the so-called "yuan exchange rate undervaluation" project in the neutral case of the countervailing case, and China firmly opposes it.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China's implementation of a market-based supply and demand, reference to a basket of currencies for adjustment, managed floating exchange rate system, the market in the formation of the exchange rate plays a decisive role.
The press release stressed that, in general, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable equilibrium level and is not undervalued.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the effective exchange rate of the renminbi will appreciate by 38%, and the real effective exchange rate will appreciate by 49%, which is the strongest currency in the G20 economy and one of the most appreciated currencies in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue exceeded the authority of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization.
The United States amended its regulations in February this year to conduct a countervailing investigation into the exchange rates of other countries, which has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
The press release said that even according to U.S. regulations, there are a large number of errors in the content of the applicant's complaint, and there are no necessary elements for countervailing subsidies such as financial support, profit awarding and specificity.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop countervailing investigations into the so-called “undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate.”
Affected by the further rise in Sino-US relations, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rate against the US dollar fell sharply in the 22-day session, both falling below the 7.0 yuan mark of the US dollar.
Whether the Commerce Department's move is intended to force the yuan to rise is worthy of concern.
The RMB's spot rate against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd, closing at 6.9961.
The interim price of the yuan against the US dollar was reduced by 17 basic points to 6.9938 on the 24th.

Lewis family: John Lewis is a fighter for the weakest fight
U.S. Congressman and civil rights fighter John Lewis was remembered as a “warrie for the weakest” at his memorial service on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis' public memorial service began Saturday in Alabama.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public stern memorial service Saturday at the University of Troy in Alabama, Lewis’s five siblings and a nephew talked about him as a loving, surging, family-heavy man.
Lewis' youngest brother, Henry "Grant" Lewis, said in the meeting: "He has devoted his life to helping others."
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John "not to get in trouble, not to get into trouble."
He added that John did not heed his mother’s warning, saying, “We all know that John always gets into trouble, he’s always in trouble, but that’s because it’s right, it’s a good trouble.”
Lewis’s siblings reminded the people at the memorial that John’s most famous argument was to create “good trouble,” that is, to avoid stirring up trouble for the sake of justice.
John had applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, which was all white at the time, rejected his application for admission.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel against the chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones, from Alabama, said the current protesters are “protesting peacefully and non-violently,” as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump beats a boatman and calls all the protesters a thug, he is wrong.
The protestors are patriots who want the United States to move toward a more equal nation.”
A series of six-day events in honor of Lewis will culminate this week at his funeral in Georgia.
Lewis’s coffin was parked Saturday at a public memorial at the University of Troy, where people came to pay tribute to the civil rights pioneer.
Late Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by an open memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass through Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators who demanded the right to vote of blacks were beaten by Alabama police in front of the bridge, and the police also cast tear gas on the demonstrators.
Lewis was nearly killed.
It was later called Bloody Sunday.
Lewis' body will be transported to Montgomery, Alabama's capital.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk and go through the final journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials require the public to wear masks and maintain social distance when participating in the event.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey ordered a half-mast flag to be flown on Saturday and Sunday in honor of Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemoration, Lewis’ body will be split in the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., for public mourning.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could pay their respects to Lewis at the U.S. Capitol this Monday and Tuesday.
Due to the coronavirus outbreak, public events to mourn Lewis will be held outdoors.

Cocosiri Tibetan antelope enters the return season - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the five-way beam protection station of the Cocosiri Management Department of the Yangtze River Source Park of Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration that the monitoring showed that the Tibetan antelope that had previously gone to the neighboring chips in the Lake Zhuo Nai area of Cocosiri was ending the birth of litters and began to return to their original habitat with their cubs.
Surveillance screen near the five beam protection station shows that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led three Tibetan antelope cubs through the Qinghai-Tibet Highway 3002 kilometers, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway Wulong North Bridge, and the Tibetan antelope has begun to move back.
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the returning flock accounted for one-fourth to one-fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope sheep.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Biology Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: “In the early days of the relocation, Tibetan antelopes are at higher risk of being arrested and eaten, so the number of cubs in the flock will be less, and there may even be no cubs.”
According to the statistics of the Cocosiri Management Department of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the overall number of Tibetan antelope relocations has increased year by year, and the number of Tibetan antelope relocations in 2019 was 4,860, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Lian Xinming said: "It is expected that the return of Tibetan antelope this year will end in early September, and the number of returning Tibetan antelope is still expected to continue to increase."
Tibetan antelope is a protected animal at the national level.
Every year at the end of May, Tibetan antelopes from Qinghai Sanjiangyuan, Qiangtang, Tibet, Xinjiang Aljin Mountain and other places are required to go to the Law of Zhuo Nai, located in the hinterland of Cocosiri.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert on the protection of Tibetan antelopes in China and a researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Animal Research Institute (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said: "The return of the Tibetan antelope is the process of returning to the habitat with the cubs after the female Tibetan antelope is returned to their habitat after the return of the female Tibetan antelope.
In order to ensure the safe relocation of Tibetan antelope flocks, the reporter learned that the Cocosiri Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of Sanjiangyuan National Park has arranged for staff to continue to carry out video monitoring and patrol in the main relocation area.
If it is found that there are Tibetan antelope flocks trying to cross the road, the mountain rangers will carry out temporary traffic control in the first time, so that the flock can safely pass through the wildlife passageway and ensure that they are as little human interference as possible during the relocation.
So, how to relieve the heat in daily life?
Experts suggest that summer out to avoid the high temperature period, it is best not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sunshine of this time period is the strongest, the possibility of heat stroke is higher.

Clothing as far as possible to choose light, good breathable cotton, hemp, silk texture, less wearing chemical fiber clothing, so as not to sweat a lot of time when not timely heat dissipation, causing heat stroke.
When hot and hot weather, be prepared to drink enough water, drink it in time, do not wait for thirst to drink water, because once you feel thirsty, it means that the body is already short of water, each time the water is controlled at 150 ml to 200 ml, drink warm water, do not drink ice water.
According to the temperature, the general personnel drink 1.5 to 2 liters of water every day, and the high-temperature workers drink 3 to 5 liters of water every day.
When sweating more, you can properly supplement some salt water to make up for the salt lost by the human body due to sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to lack of potassium in the summer, making people feel tired and tired, and containing potassium tea is an excellent summer drink.
In the summer, eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc.; fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, etc., can be used to supplement water; dairy products can not only replenish water, but also to meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people who work in high-temperature environments should be supplemented with drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
In summer, the day and night are short, the temperature is high, the human body's metabolism is strong, the consumption is also large, and it is easy to feel fatigue.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and body systems, which is conducive to work and study, and is also a measure to prevent heat stroke.
Experts say the best time to go to bed is from 22:00 to 23:00, and the best time to get up is from 5:30 to 6:30.
When sleeping, be careful not to lie under the air conditioning outlet and electric fan, so as not to suffer from air conditioning disease and heat injury.
Experts suggest that in outdoor activities or high-temperature operations, you can carry ten drops of water, human dan, aromatic water or scented positive gas pills and other anti-heat drugs, or placed in the nearest workplace, at any time to use, in case of heat stroke.

Australian University develops new drug is expected to treat blood vessel blockage caused by new crown
SYDNEY, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at Monash University in Australia are working on a new drug that helps prevent heart disease and stroke, and hopes that the drug can be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by the new coronavirus.
The researchers found that an enzyme in the platelets accelerated platelet clotting before a heart attack or stroke.
From this, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet clotting, thereby avoiding blood vessel blockage and preventing heart disease and stroke.
The researchers said that the drug only inhibits the clotting effect of platelets when signs of heart disease or stroke appear.
Since studies have shown that similar vascular blockages are one of the leading causes of death in patients with new coronary disease, the researchers hope that the drug will be used in the future for the treatment of such severe patients.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and the researchers are preparing for the next stage of human clinical trials.
The results of the research have been published in the American journal Science and Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter after the CBA League rematch allowed spectators to watch the game live.
On the same day, in the second phase of the Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) rematch (Laoshan District) held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers, and public security front people went through the official ticketing platform to complete the relevant processes including nucleic acid detection and came to the court to watch the Shanghai Jiuji team against the East and West Kings of the mountains.
During the competition, the spectator must wear a mask throughout the game, enter the seat on the number, and strictly maintain a one-meter interval.
When exiting, the audience must maintain the "one-meter line" social distance in an orderly manner in accordance with the order of forward, first and second and middle.

China News Agency, Xinjiang Hami July 26th: Xinjiang deep ploughing "Sunflower field" with clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal heliostats, each 48 square meters, arranged neatly in a circle, such as a silver "sunflower field", with the sun rotating, the sun reflected to the center of more than 200 meters high heat absorption tower, to achieve power generation.
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the China Power Project Hami molten salt tower-type solar-thermal power generation plant in Yiwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower-type solar thermal power generation is to reflect the sun through the mirror to the heat-absorbing tower to form heat, and then through the traditional power generation technology to convert heat energy into electricity."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of China Electric Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd., said that its design principle is similar to the solar stove used in the rural areas of northwest China, and the sun should be gathered together.
The power plant started construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 acres, and a total of 14,500 fixed mirrors are planned to be installed.
“Compared to traditional solar power generation technology, the biggest advantage is that the concentrated heat energy can be stored and the power generation can be generated at night.”
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured by the project can keep the generator set running continuously and steadily, not affected by light changes; it can also quickly participate in the peaking of the power grid according to the peak and valley demand of the power grid load.
After the project is fully completed, it can achieve an annual power generation of 198 million degrees, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce sulfur dioxide by more than 60 tons, nitrogen oxides by more than 60 tons, smoke about 20 tons, and carbon dioxide by more than 150,000 tons, providing a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "Sunflower Field" in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
Hamival Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 acres, and the 714 power generation equipment that has been built also follows the rotation of the sun, and always maintains a 90-degree right angle of the sun and the spotlight plate.
“We use a two-axis tracking concentrated power generation technology, and through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the solar height to maintain the power generation efficiency.”
The station manager of the power station, Mengqi said that under the conditions of good light weather, the power generation technology can be increased by about 20% compared with the traditional photovoltaic power generation efficiency.
In the first half of this year, the power station has achieved more than 7 million degrees of power generation, supplementing the local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest single unit in Xinjiang, and the most complete type of photovoltaic module demonstration park, with a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects, with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, the power generation completed exceeded 110 million degrees, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resource conditions in China.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the number of sunshine hours per year is about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted a good "sunflower field".
The installed capacity of more than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power generation has been completed, and the city's photovoltaic power generation exceeded 1.4 billion degrees in the first half of this year, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power plants in Xinjiang, with an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
It is expected that the photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion degrees this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.

U.S. media uncover the truth about the unprovoked request of the United States to China to close its Consulate General in Houston

U.S. media uncover the truth about the unwarranted demand that China close the Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China decided to revoke the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requests to the Consulate General to stop all business and activities, as a counter-measure by the US side suddenly asking the Chinese Consulate General in Houston on the 21st to close.
The U.S. government's behavior has aroused a lot of concern, and its political motivation has been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is China asking to close the Consulate General?
Many foreign media said that it is not clear why the United States will choose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, foreign media bluntly said: for the election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the US request to China to close the Consulate General in Houston has caused people to question their political motives.
The article said that the U.S. government's disastrous response to the new crown epidemic has caused President Trump's poll support rate before the election to be relatively low.
White House officials said privately that the hard-line strategy against China was aimed at salvaging Trump’s approval ratings and at the same time shifting responsibility for the White House’s failed response to the epidemic.
The article believes that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven, very cautious" goal chosen by the United States, and the US government chose it "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of causing major conflict."
The BBC also believes that at the time of the US election season and the US economy being hit hard by the epidemic, Trump believes that "playing the 'China card' has a political advantage."
The current situation is “a spiraling, tit-for-tat struggle” that is driven in part by the U.S. government from a domestic perspective and will only worsen tensions between the United States and China.
CBS reported that Trump's re-election prospects were under pressure due to the outbreak, and he repeatedly blamed China for the epidemic.
Almost every day, the United States has new actions against the absurdity of Trump’s so-called “China exploitation of the United States.”
“The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries.”
The United States’ request to China to close its consulate in Houston has heightened tensions between the world’s two largest economies.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in the southern United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, and U.S. citizens seeking visas and other services are also facing difficulties.
A business group in Houston expressed regret that the United States asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of China's economy.
The U.S. Foreign Policy magazine website believes that this move by the United States is "part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen U.S.-China relations."
Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, said that since the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of any action that could be compared with the US operation against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the US move is unprecedented in the diplomatic relations between China and the United States for more than 40 years.
Analysts believe that this move may cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was built in 1979 and was the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
Currently, China has an embassy and five consulates-general in the United States.

In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great set out to form a sea fleet, creating a history of the Russian Navy.
The last Sunday of July is the Russian Navy Day.
In response to the new changes in the prevention and control of the epidemic, since July 17, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Autonomous Region and actively participated in the prevention and control of the epidemic.
Tianshan North and South trade union cadres, workers, labor models into the street community, the residents of the masses, to carry out food delivery, disinfection and sterilization, publicity of epidemic prevention knowledge and other activities, to serve the workers and the masses, with practical actions to highlight the trade union "hard nuclear force."
Recently, the condolence group of the Tianshan District Federation of Trade Unions in Urumqi City sent a number of urgently needed epidemic prevention and control living materials to the staff of 12 isolation points.
After the outbreak of the epidemic, Tianshan District invested more than 1.05 million yuan in the first time, and urgently allocated to 23 directly under the grass-roots trade unions.
Zhao Xiangguo, deputy secretary of the party committee and trade union of China Construction and Construction, received the company's notice on epidemic prevention and control, took the initiative to take the initiative, chose to stay on duty in the unit, and escort the employees.
He sent cooking utensils, food and daily necessities for the staff who lived in the dormitory of the unit and the new employees, and organized personnel to send them essential supplies for life every two days.
"Since July 21, the cadres and employees who have adhered to the front line of the war 'epidemic' have been found, and taken online orders and merchants to deliver to the door, first of all, 704 front-line workers and masses in the Urumqi region to supplement the purchase of epidemic prevention supplies and living materials."
The person in charge of the Xinjiang Transport Trade Union told reporters that in the face of the outbreak of the epidemic, they made every effort to do a good job in ensuring the protection of epidemic prevention and control services, steadily promoted the development of transportation, and created a strong atmosphere of fighting the "epidemic" with a concerted heart.
At present, it is the high temperature in the summer, and trade unions at all levels are focusing on front-line workers in key areas of epidemic prevention and control, and implementing the "sending cool" care and care.
On July 19, the Urumqi County Federation of Trade Unions launched a "cool" condolences to the front-line workers of epidemic prevention and control, and the county's police stations, card points and health systems received condolences such as drinks and fruits.
"Trade union cadres should further improve their political standing, strengthen their responsibilities, warm their hearts with care, and inspire fighting spirit with action."
It is necessary to give full play to the role of trade union organizations to unite employees and unite employees, do a good job in ensuring epidemic prevention and control services, actively safeguard the health rights and interests of the majority of employees, and send care to front-line employees."

Spokesperson of the Embassy in the UK: The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, on the 25th, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom answered reporters' questions on the wrong remarks about cyber attacks.
The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always firmly opposed and cracked down on any form of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
A reporter asked: According to the media, the hacking group related to China has interfered with the network system of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies with patent data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always firmly opposed and cracked down on any form of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
Cyberspace is virtual, difficult to trace, and actors are diverse, and sufficient evidence should be produced when investigating and qualitative network events, and cannot be guessed without cause.
The spokesman said that a series of events such as the "Prism Gate" in the past proved that the United States has been conducting the world's largest cyber-spying operation.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace serves the common interests of all countries.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation are not stolen, not stolen, but obtained through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a big country for innovation and intellectual property.
According to the data of the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China, in the first half of the year, the new loans of agriculture and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the annual increase in 2019.
In the first half of this year, the central branch of the People's Bank of China in Urumqi used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking industry to continuously increase its lending efforts, providing sufficient financial protection for epidemic prevention and control and resumption of work.
Most areas of free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi have been basically completed, and secondary testing has been carried out in high-risk areas.
Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health and Health Commission, said in a briefing on the latest epidemic and nucleic acid detection in Urumqi on the 26th that at present, most of the free nucleic acid detection work in Urumi has been basically completed.
Experts from the expert group of the State Council and the autonomous region and Urumqi are further evaluating the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigation results.
The press office of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to inform the epidemic and prevention and control of Xinjiang.
According to him, from 0:00 to 24:00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Urumqi (of which 5 were reconfirmed cases of asymptomatic infected persons) and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infection.
As of 24:00 on July 25, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infected people in Urumqi.
On the 25th, the new asymptomatic infected people were basically tested and actively screened through the city's free nucleic acid detection.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health and Health Commission, said on the 26th that most of the free nucleic acid testing work in Urumu City has been basically completed.
He also said that from the experience of other parts of the country, there are many factors that affect the nucleic acid test results, such as the sensitivity of the detection reagent, the infection time and the detoxification time of the tester, the cooperation of the tester when the specimen is taken from the material (the poor degree of cooperation may cause the specimen to not be taken in place), the detection environment, the operation proficiency of the inspection personnel, etc.
For various reasons, nucleic acid testing will also have false negative results.
The so-called false negative means that the person who is tested is indeed an infected person, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, for people who have had close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to be excluded.
For those who have been to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if there are fever and respiratory symptoms, a negative nucleic acid test may be false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are also required to be excluded.
He said that in view of the above situation, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, from today, Urumqi City will carry out secondary free nucleic acid testing in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shaybak District, and at the same time carry out "checking and filling leaks".
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shaybak District are high-risk areas of the epidemic.

White House epidemic expert Fauci: cautiously optimistic about the development of a vaccine in early 2021
Fauci made the remarks on the 25th at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation.
He cautioned that it was not clear how the new coronavirus outbreak would develop in the autumn and winter, or how the final impact of the outbreak would be, “and the only way to end it is that each of us chooses to be part of the problem.”
According to the data of Johns Hopkins University in the United States, as of 21:00 on the 25th, the number of new crown confirmed cases in the United States has reached 4.176 million, and 146,000 people have died.
Fauci said some parts of the United States are struggling with the rebounding epidemic.
Although the epidemic is different everywhere and needs local response solutions, the diversification of anti-epidemic strategies does not mean that there is no close link between the regions.
An outbreak in one region will eventually affect other areas.
“Now is not the time for complacency,” Fauci said, “Our work is not done, we must step up our efforts and we must be vigilant about the uncertainty of the future.”
He Dayi, a Chinese-American medical expert and founder of the "cocktail therapy" for AIDS treatment, pointed out at the meeting that the new crown epidemic in the United States has not yet reached its peak.
“Each of us must do our part to slow the spread of this virus.”

U.S.-China Trade Talks to Meet in August
Hong Kong's "South China Morning Post" quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as saying on the 25th that the head of the Chinese trade negotiation team, Vice Premier Liu He, and the United States team, and the trade representative Lai Haizhe are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the trade agreement between the two sides.
Although China has significantly increased the number of purchases of U.S. agricultural products in the past few months, due to factors such as the new coronavirus epidemic, China's purchases are still some way from the number of commitments made in the trade agreement.
Analysts say the recent closure of each other's consulates by the United States and China, coupled with other disputes, could undermine any progress on trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States, which entered into force one month after its signing on January 15, stipulates that the high-level trade framework group between the two sides should hold talks every six months.
The meeting will be “an important turning point” for both sides to assess progress on the agreement, according to people familiar with the matter.
But the person also said that if the U.S.-China tensions lead to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He has met the terms of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since the beginning of this year, China-US relations have deteriorated rapidly, and the dispute between the two sides includes a series of issues such as the origin of the new coronavirus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
Although US President Trump boasted at the beginning of the year about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record number of American corn in a single day, it has also bought a lot of soybeans, "but this trade agreement is no longer as meaningful to me as it was when it was reached."
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place due to the poor U.S.-China relations, and "trade issues have lost weight in Sino-US relations."
But he revealed that China's economic and trade-related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "we have tried our best to buy, so any additional procurement will be difficult."
Peng Jinning, vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said it was "more important than ever" to maintain the momentum of the first phase of the agreement, and said that China has made progress in further opening up financial markets to US companies this year.
Plenum analysts at the independent research firm Plenum said: "It's better to talk than not, although it may only be treated as a routine."
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Wei Yukun) reporter learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management on the 26th that the State Defense Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management will work with the State Food and Material Reserve Bureau to transport 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square meters of woven cloth, 130,000 square meters of geometry cloth and other 6 types of central reserve flood control materials to support Anhui flood relief work.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Emergency Management, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River basin maintain high water level fluctuations, and the "Flood No. 3 of the Yangtze River in 2020" was formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, and the risk in local areas increased.
The meteorological department expects that there will be heavy rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of Chongqing, Guizhou and the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood control situation is still severe and complicated.
According to reports, since entering the flood, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed a national comprehensive fire rescue team to pre-position professional rescue forces to key flood control areas, participating in a total of 10,364 flood rescues, dispatched more than 130,000 soldiers, 17,778 fire engines, 11,887 boats, rescued 37,777 people in distress, and evacuated and transferred more than 107,000 trapped people.
Nasdaq China chief representative Hao Yusheng: now is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States IPO - Economic Watch - Professional financial news website
Economic Observer Network reporter Zhang Bin because of the Luckin coffee fraud incident, the U.S. market on the implementation of more stringent supervision of the stock, coupled with the valuation of long-term pressure, in the United States listed in the medium-sized stock pressure, NetEase, Jingdong and other medium-sized stocks have recently opened the way back to Hong Kong listing.
Recently, companies such as shells and ideal cars have been enthusiastic about listing in the United States.
Under the epidemic and the crisis of Chinese stocks, is now the best time for Chinese enterprises to go public in the United States?
"In terms of the recent IPO case and the next company to go to the United States to go public, the IPO to the United States has not been affected in nature, but the market is very good now, and even now this time is the best time node for Chinese companies to go to the United States for IPO in the past 10 years."
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of the China region of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, said at the "Sub-Stock Branch of the 2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit" hosted by Snowball.
In April, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Public Company Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) issued a statement on the important role of audit quality and regulatory access to auditing and other international information—a challenge to the challenge of access to current information for U.S. public companies with significant business in China.
The statement said that although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, there are still problems with the US regulatory authorities in access to information, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; corresponding to the document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed companies that have encountered audit obstacles and their audit institutions, and a large number of medium-sized stock companies are listed.
In addition, in May this year, the U.S. Senate passed the Foreign Company Accountability Act, which imposes additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies to list in the United States.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the Sino-cooked stock crisis has not affected the appetite of investors.
"When the news came out, everyone was panicking, everyone was asking if we could go public in the United States in the future, but then we found that these problems are not a matter for investors, and investors may ask these questions during the recent roadshow to the US IPO, and even become a standardized problem, but this is not regarded by investors as an important factor in investing in and not investing in a Chinese company."
It is recommended that you look at the current situation as normally as possible.
Of course, this on the surface may seem to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but in terms of investor appetite, it has not been affected in any way.
So then from now until the end of this year or before the US election, the IPO boom will continue."
On May 9 this year, Jinshanyun was officially listed on the NASDAQ in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to go to the United States for IPO after the epidemic.
“The listing of Jinshanyun gives great confidence to the Chinese companies behind them that are preparing for an IPO.”
Hao Yusheng said.
Snowball released in the first half of 2020 stock data report shows that in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese companies to the United States IPO, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year; from the perspective of the total initial fundraising, 20 companies raised a total of 2.725 billion yuan, compared with the same period last year, up more than 52.4%; in terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health care industry in the first half of this year was outstanding, an increase of 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the high quality of Chinese companies going to the United States for IPOs in the first half of this year, and high-quality companies with strong fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng remains optimistic about the IPO of Ming Chinese companies in the United States.
"The short-term is that the IPO boom in the United States is still continuing; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, and US stocks, we will take the US election and Sino-US relations as a consideration for market choices and time choices; in the long run, everything will return to normal, the market fluctuations are all cycles, both political cycles and economic cycles, and eventually return to the normal stage, and the stock market has always been fluctuating forward."
Hao Yusheng also said, "This year is more uncertain, but for high-quality companies, no matter how good or bad the market is, as long as they are solid and can let investors see growth, other factors are relatively secondary, investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily July 26 commentator article: Focus on doing your own thing to create new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic focus, enhancing confidence in victory, and focusing on doing our own things are the key to our response to various risks and challenges.
At the recent entrepreneur symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, the sluggish world economy and shrinking global markets, we must focus on doing our own thing, give full play to the advantages of the domestic hyperscale market, gradually form a new development pattern with domestic large-scale circulation as the main body and domestic and international double-cycles promote each other, improve the modernization level of the industrial chain supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate key core technology research, and create new advantages for future development.
The wise man wins, the sage-seeker wins.
In the external environment of in-depth development of economic globalization, the market and resources "both sides are out" to play an important role in China's rapid development.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization has encountered headwinds and back waves.
To prepare for the long-term thinking and preparation of the external environment, to promote China's economy to ride the wind and waves, steady and far-reaching, a very important aspect is to expand and meet domestic demand as a strategic basis for development, give full play to their own advantages, through the prosperity of the domestic economy, unblock the domestic cycle to add impetus to China's economic development, driving the world economic recovery.
We must deeply understand that building a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long-term development and long-term stability.
The Party Central Committee reviewed the situation and clearly put forward the strategy of firmly implementing the expansion of domestic demand, which is the need to deal with the impact of the epidemic, the need to maintain the long-term sustained and healthy development of China's economy, and also to meet the people's growing needs for a better life.
The advantage of the economy of a large country is the internal cycle.
China has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, perfect supporting capacity, with more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million highly educated or have all kinds of professional skills, as well as a super-large domestic market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, is in the stage of new industrialization, informationization, urbanization, agricultural modernization and rapid development, investment demand potential is huge.
Public ownership is the main body, the common development of a variety of ownership economies, according to the distribution of labor as the main body, a variety of distribution methods coexist, the socialist market economy system and other socialist basic economic systems, can not only stimulate the vitality of various market entities, liberate and develop social productivity, but also promote efficiency and fairness and organic unity, and constantly achieve common prosperity.
We must firmly grasp the strategic base of expanding domestic demand, make all aspects of production, distribution and circulation more rely on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance of total supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with domestic large-scale circulation as the main body and domestic and international double-cycles promoting each other.
Openness brings progress, and closure will inevitably lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's door of opening up will not be closed, it will only open wider and wider.
Taking the domestic large-scale circulation as the main body, it is not to close the door to close the operation, but to give full play to the potential of domestic demand, so that the domestic market and the international market can be better connected, and the international and domestic two markets and resources are better utilized to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, the expansion of domestic demand and the expansion of opening-up are not contradictory, and the smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to build a new pattern of opening up, and the more conducive it is to form a new advantage of participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although the international protectionist trend is rising, we must stand on the right side of history, adhere to deepening reform, expanding opening up, strengthen opening-up and cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the construction of an open world economy, and promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but it has never been crushed, but it has become more and more courageous, constantly growing in order to rise from suffering.
On the way forward, with the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization ability and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the whole Party and the whole army of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the momentum of China's economic and social development, build a well-off society in an all-round way, and smoothly start a new journey of building a socialist modern country in an all-round way!
Balance treasure income down "90" but "retaliatory" saving money?
With the decline in the balance of treasure income, "post-90s" not only did not escape the balance treasure, but began to "retaliate" to save money.
China New Economic Research Institute and Alipay recently released the "balance treasure after 90 to save money report" (2020 version) shows that in the first half of the year, "post-90s" more like to save money: the amount of money saved per capita increased by nearly 40% compared with 2019.
Interestingly, the "post-90s" are more inclined to start from a pen "small money", and 60% of the average amount of money saved is less than 20 yuan.
Saving money with the balance has also become a "post-90s" habit of saving money.
Data show that among the 700 million balance treasure users, there are 134 million users are "post-90s".
China has 174 million "post-90s", that is, about three out of every four "post-90s" in the country are saving money with a balance.
At present, the 7-day annualized rate of return of the monetary fund such as the balance treasure has fallen from the level of higher than 2% at the beginning of the year to about 1.5%.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of "post-90s" saving money.
In the context of the improvement of the balance treasure "saving money effect", many young people who are accustomed to using balance treasures have also been directly transformed into "customers".
Alipay data show that as of July 13, the new "fundamental people" on Alipay in the past month increased by more than 1 times year-on-year, and more and more young people achieved "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the flow of funds from the balance treasure into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the IMF share in June.
The report also shows that "post-90s" girls are more inclined to save more money, on average, 20% more than boys to save money; among the users who hold funds on the Alipay platform, 60% are men, and women tend to choose a more stable financial method than men.
What is the plan for the "90s" after saving money?
Alipay data show that the "post-90s" have the habit of saving money for the goal, and the most users use travel as the goal of saving money.

France to increase military investment in space - Xinhua
French Defense Minister Florence Parly said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to the space defense budget and develop space military forces to prevent other countries from making "unfriendly actions" in outer space.
Parly told Provence that between 2019 and 2025, the budget for French space military projects will increase from the previously proposed 3.6 billion euros ($4.2 billion) to 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update the existing observation satellites and communication satellites in the future, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites, and improve the modernization of space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that a military command and an “aviation and space force” would be established within the French Air Force.
Parly said she would officially announce the creation of the Space Force when she visits a military academy in Salon, Provence, later.
Parley said the Space Force is part of the Air Force and will have 500 personnel by 2025.
“The idea that space used to serve the common good of science is gone,” she said. “Space is now the place where nations compete for global hegemony.”
Parly reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying that the French side has no intention of provoking an arms race.
“We are not engaged in an arms race. But I have a responsibility to fully recognize the threat we may face.”
Parly reintroduces the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said the “peeping” was a Russian satellite.
The Russian side denied this claim.
Parley said France would soon have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and locking in "the black hands behind those unfriendly moves."
French media believe that the reason why France is seeking to set up a space force is because US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense in February last year to draft a bill to establish a space force.
Trump signed a defense authorization bill in December that approved the creation of the sixth largest service in the United States, the Space Force.
Some experts worry that these measures by the United States have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and may trigger a new space arms race.

Experts say collecting immigration data through U.S. Census for House seats allocation is unconstitutional
Some civil rights groups and several U.S. cities and counties have sued the federal government, saying Trump’s presidential office’s attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. Census is not unconstitutional or unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the distribution of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sarah Brannon, executive lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, told VOA, “It doesn’t work.”
She went on to say that Trump’s request to identify the citizenship of people who accept the census in the census is difficult to do, and that it is “not very reliable.”
Another civil liberties organization, the Common Cause group, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump’s executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit Friday.
“The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must take an accurate look at everyone living in Arlington County, and this illegal attempt to scare off people and reduce the number of people in our immigrant communities will succeed.”
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a “victory” for the state.
“When allocating the seats of the House of Representatives of the states and the seats of the Electoral College, they must be based on the number of residents living in the states and the number of residents legally residing.”
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census table.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing the U.S. Census Bureau’s Commerce Secretary Ross to submit data on the unlicensed population from the census so that the administration can exclude these unlicensed populations from state census numbers and use it to determine whether each state is increasing or reducing or maintaining a House of Representatives seat.
The United States redistributes House of Representatives every 10 years based on demographic changes.

Move according to the momentum, promote the construction of industrial projects - see the headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
In the summer of Hunan, the heat wave is on the surface.
The enthusiasm released by the province's industrial project construction promotion site observation meeting has overshadowed the heat of the three-volt day, and the sharp guidance of "industry than strength, project theory hero" encourages Sanxiang four waters.
The development of Hunan always depends on the construction of projects and training industries.
In the face of the most unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province adhered to a game of chess, made every effort to fight the two hard battles of epidemic prevention and flood control, and took the industrial project as the "first hand" to implement the "six stability" and "six guarantees".
From the first quarter of GDP fell by 1.9% year-on-year, to the first half of the year, a year-on-year increase of 1.3%, the difficulty of the period, the efforts are huge, self-evident.
In this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery, development and stability.
It is easy, irreversible.
Industrial project construction, to put into the overall situation, not only good at accumulation, momentum, plot, but also good at understanding change, change, and strain.
In the context of the current international situation, in addition to the painstaking investment, it is also necessary to calm down to study the new characteristics of the current new situation, more grasp the law, more scientific and accurate, and better integrate into the new development pattern with domestic large-scale circulation as the main body and domestic and international double-cycle mutual promotion.
Pay more attention to improving the basic capabilities of the industry.
In the first half of the year, our province not only has a large number of emerging industrial heavyweight investment projects breaking ground and sowing hope, but also traditional advantageous industrial enterprises have accelerated their clothing and falling in the transformation of digital, intelligent and green industries.
Yiyang Oskang Third Science Park project to transform the existing production line, high-end printed circuit board intelligent production line to seize the opportunity; Hunan Zhongqi Changde cigarette factory new factory is committed to intelligent transformation, the construction of modern factory process, but also a vivid portrayal of "old tree new buds" ... ... around the national major strategy and "two new and one heavy", focus on consolidating and improving the advantages of the industry, actively cultivate the development of emerging industries, comprehensive increase in scientific and technological innovation and localization of the replacement, in order to continue to consolidate the basic conditions.
More attention should be paid to cultivating and developing new business models for the new economy.
The sudden new crown epidemic has brought the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial change: in the first half of the year, the province's computer and office equipment manufacturing industry, electronics and communication equipment manufacturing industry increased by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the limit increased by 32.2 percent year-on-year, and the online meal revenue of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
In the crisis, we will educate new opportunities and open a new situation in the change, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integration and development of the digital economy and the real economy is the trend of the times.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still space and potential on the supporting chain.
Strengthen the thinking of the industrial chain to grasp the project, not only the head of the enterprise to continue to accumulate, in the key links of the industrial chain to achieve technological breakthroughs; but also need to cultivate around the chain to strengthen the chain chain to stimulate the "chain" lock reaction, promote the coordinated layout of related supporting industries, accelerate the construction of independent controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
To overcome the difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan is still a hot land with a good business environment and the emergence of market business opportunities.
The province frequently tricks, new tricks, practical tricks, in order to enterprises to rescue the "relief" to promote high-quality development of "acceleration"; Shaoyang to implement "shareholder-style" services, for enterprises to do business without excuse, policy cash does not discount, problems to solve the problem does not overnight... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "doing everything possible", find the shortcomings of the pain point, the achievement of the opportunity of the living story.
One mind to study the industry, cultivate the industry, develop the industry, solidly optimize the business environment, will be able to win more investors' favor.
The wind and waves ahead are still there, but the state of riding the wind and breaking the waves has become the norm for the province to grasp the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
In this critical period, we must study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of important instructions and instructions, effectively respond to external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, persistently promote the construction of industrial projects, and sweat together to ensure the successful conclusion of the "Thirteenth Five-Year Plan" and the comprehensive construction of a well-off society.

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature"
Economic Daily · China Economic Net reporter Lin Fire Can
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, China's overall promotion of epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, the epidemic prevention and control situation is constantly improving, the steady recovery of the economy is obvious, the employment and price performance closely related to people's livelihood are generally stable, and China's economy has handed over a temperature economic operation report card.
In the first two months of this year, the survey unemployment rate increased.
Especially in February, many enterprises' production and business activities were basically in a state of shutdown, the demand for enterprise employment was reduced, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the unemployment rate of urban surveys increased.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the order of production and life in the whole society has been continuously restored.
The Party Central Committee adheres to the general tone of steady progress, further increases the hedging of macro policies, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes the work of assisting and stabilizing jobs and expanding employment.
China has increased its policy of hedging and stabilizing positions, playing a combination of "relief and rebate" policies, phased in the reduction of the payment part of 3 social insurance units, allowing the deferred payment of social insurance premiums, expanding the steady return of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises, benefiting from the work-based training policy, and giving absorption subsidies and apprenticeship subsidies to enterprises to absorb the employment of key groups.
With the implementation of various stable employment policies, the demand for employment of enterprises has steadily rebounded, the employment situation has gradually improved, the urban survey unemployment rate has gradually declined, and in June, the survey unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Population and Employment Statistics Department of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to be effective, and the labor force that withdrew due to the impact of the epidemic returned in the early period, and the labor force participation rate in urban areas in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February, which was close to the level of the same period last year.
Data show that the total urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached the pre-epidemic level; the average working week of enterprise employees reached 46.8 hours, an increase of 6.6 hours from February and 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices are also related to thousands of households.
In January this year, the CPI rose by 5.4% year-on-year, a new high in many years.
Entering February, although the CPI year-on-year growth rate fell slightly, but it is still in the "5 range".
The year-on-year increase in CPI is at a high level, both the factors driving consumer demand before the Spring Festival, and the factors of the wrong month of the Spring Festival and the low base of the year-on-year.
However, the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by the epidemic prevention and control, in January and February, there were logistics delays, illuctimate supply of materials, and increased material transportation costs, and some citizens hoarded and sold, and the price of some necessities rose significantly.
In order to cope with the disturbances caused by the epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, the relevant departments have included important living materials in the scope of emergency transportation guarantee to ensure the smooth transportation of materials.
Under the influence of a series of policy measures, the supply of vegetable melon and fruit market is strongly guaranteed.
In order to cope with the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government introduced a policy of ensuring stable prices, all regions and departments quickly implemented it, the supply of pork reserves improved significantly, the production capacity of pigs was restored in an orderly manner, and the order of production and sales was gradually normal.
Since March, pork prices have fallen continuously, and in May, the year-on-year increase in food prices fell to 10.6%; in June, pork prices rose slightly month-on-month due to factors such as the slowdown in pig exports, the reduction of imports and the rebound in group consumption demand.
The seasonal change in fresh vegetable prices is obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the higher base of comparison in the same period last year, fresh fruit prices continued to decline year-on-year, with an average decline of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic life of the masses is effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation is stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation logistics, the supply and demand of the market have improved.
Since March, the CPI has declined for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase has also fallen from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June, and the overall price level has returned to stable.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to maintain a moderate level, and the overall inflation pressure is not large, but it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and life order under the premise of doing a good job in the normalization of epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in the main producing areas of agricultural products such as grain, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on acts that disturb market order such as hoarding and raising prices.

White House adviser 'anti-bite' states return to work prematurely
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
For several months, US President Trump has repeatedly asked the states of the country to return to work and return to school, until recently to change their attitude and take the initiative to wear masks in public, and his advisers are "responsibly bite" that some state governments return to work too early.
On the 22nd, Kellyan Conway, the White House presidential adviser, said at a press conference that some state governments did not comply with the return to work standards and restarted places such as bars prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that the previous claim that the president has "absolute power" to decide the return to work of the states is a false rumor.
“The president is a federalist, and he believes that the states have autonomy.”
She defended Trump.
However, Conway's "rumors" were said by Trump himself at the White House epidemic briefing on April 13.
The self-slapped operation of this self-face has been ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history".

Is it right for a 3-year-old child to play in a university playground if he is smashed and sued the school after receiving compensation?

The playground was smashed, and the children were compensated and then sued the school.
□ This reporter Zhao Yifan
When the three-year-old Xiao Wen was playing in a university playground, he was accidentally hit in the head by Chen Mou of the softball team while pitching.
After Chen's compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, asking the place of operation to apologize at the school, and pay medical expenses, moral damage soothing money, etc. A total of 20,000 yuan.
Recently, after the trial of the case, the Beijing Haidian District People's Court held that the school set up a protective network in the playground at the time of the incident, and had fulfilled its appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen had already paid compensation, and the plaintiff's lawsuit was rejected by the judgment.
Mr. Wen claimed that during the summer vacation in 2019, he took Xiaowen to play in the school playground, which was when the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the resulting risks, Mr. Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents are operating in the safe area designated by the softball team.
However, Chen Mou, a member of the softball team, stepped off while pitching, causing the softball to fly across the net to the above-mentioned safe area and hit Xiao Wen's back.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiao Wen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with a head injury.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school stadium do not meet the relevant safety regulations and are not effectively managed by the team and related facilities.
The school's faults led to the above-mentioned incidents, resulting in Xiao Wen's physical and mental suffering, and at the same time, it brought greater pain to his family, and the school should bear legal responsibility for this.
In this regard, the school argued that the school has set up a protective network in the playground, and posted management regulations, training notices, told the entrance to the playground to maintain a safe distance from the training ground and remind them to pay attention to their own safety, the plaintiff can not prove that the school "has not fulfilled the safety and security obligations", so do not agree to compensation.
After the court hearing, it was found that the university involved in the incident was free of charge to the public, and although the school had a safety and security obligation for the management of the playground, this security obligation only needed to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective network in the playground, and has fulfilled its appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen also compensated Xiaowen with more than 2,000 yuan for medical expenses, transportation costs and other losses in accordance with the compensation agreement previously reached, and the two sides agreed to resolve the dispute one-time.
Afterwards, Xiao Wen's parents once again claimed the school's compensation, and the court ruled that all the plaintiff's claims were rejected by the court.
After the verdict, neither side appealed and the sentence has now entered into force.
According to Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, the school, as the administrator of a public place, has the obligation to ensure safety and security; in the case of the third party's behavior causing damage to others, the third party bears the tort liability, and the public place manager who fails to meet the safety and security obligations shall bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
The judge said that because, as a manager of a public place, it is most likely to understand the actual situation of the entire place, foresee the possible dangers and damage, so that it is most likely to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of loss or reduce the extent of damage, and to avoid and mitigate the lowest cost of damage, so the law stipulates that it is responsible for the corresponding security obligations to engage in social activities.
In this case, for the unspecified entrants in the playground, which is free to the public, the security obligations of the school shall be commensurate with the social activities it is engaged in, in particular, mainly to take basic security measures and have the obligation to inform hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not advisable to impose excessive security obligations on public place managers.
If the school has adopted a protective network and has fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be determined that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for the third party infringement, even if the school and other public places managers did not meet the safety and security obligations, the responsibility is also as a supplement to the damage, according to the latest promulgation of the civil code, the manager to bear the supplementary responsibility, can also be recovered to the third party.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should no longer expand the scope of the claim after receiving compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed inter-provincial tourism business from July 21, and on the first weekend after the opening, Xiamen, as a popular tourist destination, ushered in the peak of passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are many tourists who arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers, and the airport passenger flow is mainly based on students, tourism and family visits.
In July, Xiamen Airport operated an average of 440 times a day, and domestic flights have recovered to 80% before the epidemic.
Airlines have encrypted the air express lines from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities to seize the recovery of the tourism market.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a number of summer domestic inter-provincial travel products, and the team itinerary is mainly based on outdoor attractions.
In response to the summer passenger peaks in railway stations and airports, relevant units have increased manpower in areas where personnel are easily gathered at check-in counters, security checkpoints, etc. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Bai Min Health Code", realized the sharing of health data and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, and promoted the orderly recovery of the tourism market.

Israel strengthens repeated prevention and control of epidemic - Sino-Singapore Network

Israel to step up repeated prevention and control of the epidemic
At the beginning of the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, Israel's prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Israel has recently increased significantly, and the Israeli government has taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of new crown pneumonia was confirmed in Israel, in order to quickly close all ports of entry and exit, suspend non-essential industries, change schools to online classes, restrict public transportation and non-essential social activities, lock down cities with severe epidemics, and jointly maintain prevention and control measures for military and police.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results, and by mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Israel fell to single digits.
With the control of the epidemic, Israel's prevention and control measures have been completely unsealed, and since June, the number of new diagnoses of new crown pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
Especially after entering July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, there have been more than 1,500 new cases in Israel for eight days, and as of July 25, the number of new cases on that day reached 916.
As of July 25, there had been 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed public entertainment venues such as gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, etc., and introduced a policy to restrict public transportation, which stipulates that the passengers of each bus should not exceed 20 people.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of the "closed city" on weekends, which stipulate the implementation of the "closed city" from 1700 hours every Friday to 5 o'clock every week.
During this period, people can go out, but places such as shops, shopping malls, barbershops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic service venues such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, in all dates and times, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes will be banned from eating, and only takeaway services will be allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people have not paid enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and have not been able to form a joint effort with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After the recurrence of the epidemic in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest and march because of the impact of government prevention and control measures on their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, arguing that anti-epidemic policies affected the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's promulgation of prevention and control measures such as banning restaurants and cafes without compensation.
In addition, many people do not comply with the rules of wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters when outdoor activities, and in order to avoid fines from being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chins or hang them on their wrists.
During the repeated epidemic, the school was the hardest hit area for the spread of the new coronavirus, and according to the reporter's recent visit to the kindergarten, the kindergarten teachers and students did not wear masks according to government requirements, and did not maintain a safe social distance of two meters to each other, laying a hidden danger for a large number of teachers and students infected with the virus.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the Israeli National Security Council's expert advisory group on the fight against the epidemic, said that Israel is moving towards a "dangerous situation", pointing out that the current epidemic prevention and control measures taken by Israel are not enough, and all leisure, entertainment venues and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waksman said that Israel lacks a general plan to fight the epidemic, and the parliament and government departments should abandon their interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on the fight against the epidemic, and formulate clear steps to include relevant restrictions in different departments.
This newspaper Tel Aviv July 25th, our reporter in Tel Aviv Wang Jing
Ningxia Guyuan farmer Wu Fengfang but his wife Dai Tianfu, two people in the car, from 20 miles away from home, rushed to Liangyun Cultural Comord.
Despite the inconvenient legs of the past two years, the 77-year-old Dai Tianfu still hopes to "come here every three forks and five times, and have been addicted to tricks."
This is a humble courtyard in the original prefecture of Guyuan City, unlike the general farmhouse, the courtyard often spread melodious Qin cavity, as well as wonderful shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavity, eyebrows and so on.
The owner of the compound was named Liang Yun, who was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he began to plan the construction of a cultural compound.
With the Liangyun Cultural Complex, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
The reporter has not yet entered the Liangyun Cultural Museum, and the tune of the Qin cavity has been passed out.
For the villagers to sing the Qin cavity selection section is the neighboring village villagers Bai Lixiang.
She has loved Qin since she was a child, and now she has a small fame in the local area, and as long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform the program for the villagers.
Recently, Belli Xiang also played the webcast.
Bai Lixiang said: "There is a stage for more people to see their own performance, it is a very happy thing."
On the stage, the singer takes a look at it, and the player takes a song to the tune, although he is an amateur, but his enthusiasm is not reduced.
Just like the rustic style of the farmhouse, outside the Qin cavity, the "grassroots" art and non-heritage culture in the Liangyun Cultural Comparium are coming.
The compound also has a collection of different eras of agricultural utensils, traditional and handmade tiles, paper cutting, embroidery, shadow and other physical more than 300 pieces.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which showed his collection of old objects, old wine pots, three strings, spinning cars and so on.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
“The shadow play is my family craft, and I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old.”
Liang Yun Cultural Museum was established in 2012 and became the first rural "Intangible Cultural Heritage Exhibition Hall" in Ningxia, and is also the demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to Liangyun Cultural Complex, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in Guyuan City, including more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural College, Wang Yonghong Cultural College, Yang Lang Cultural College, etc., covering all townships and streets in the former prefecture, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grass-roots artists are active in the field, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
“As life gets better, traditional culture cannot be dropped like this.”
"Liu's spy war drama" back "win" to see Liu Yunlong Li Liqun opponent "ascension"-Xinhua.com
The 40-episode spy war drama "Winning Chance" will land on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16.
The "Winning" is based on the real historical fact, based on the Soviet military archives that have been sealed for many years and were first published.
Liu Yunlong, an actor known to the audience as a "spy war drama", broke through the image in the play and challenged a happy "stutter agent".
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as "Pressociders", "Masks" and "Kite" has proved that the spy war type drama has a strong vitality.
Unlike previous spy works, "Winning" looks at the world and extends the story to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
Set in the final stage of the 1944 War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, it tells the story of Tang Fei, a Chinese secret intelligence worker, under the leadership of the Party Secretary of the Linhe Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Underground Party and the Director of the Soviet Far Eastern Intelligence Bureau, to carry out the "Mudan Ula" plot of the Soviet Far Eastern Intelligence.
In many spy dramas, the male protagonist, as a senior spy, is a perfect image of handsomeness, high intelligence and maturity.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable for spying, "spy should be the kind of people who can't find it in the pile of people, if you play is the kind of very handsome image, I want everyone to pay attention to you, can still lurk?" "Kite" has a line: "You don't come to catch me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang", the spy to go to the elite.
So in "Winner", Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his protagonist Tang Fei to be a "stutting agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "Winning" is supported by the director of the police department, Fang Shibao, played by the Japanese Fuyuan and Li Liqun, played by Liang Guanhua.
One South, one north, two powerful play bones, for the whole play to add a lot of mastery of the point of view.
Director Yin Fei used the word "shot play" to describe the drama of Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong's opponent, "absolutely the drama, they are particularly tacit understanding, and this tacit understanding of their body is very impactful to me. Many times their plays are 'hanging now', such as we only wrote half a page length, I did not shout when shooting, they can continue to play."
The master does not rob the play, the director does not go to the play, when the actors are in the role and ensure their own character status, not only from the perspective of the characters to shape the role, but also to the audience to bring more viewing possibilities, Yin Fei said such a play is enough to be brilliant.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in the "Liu's spy war drama", the name of "Kite" was a moment, the mighty "Mountain City F4", and also gathered three in "Winning".
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiao'an and Zhao Jane, once again played Tang Fei's right arm.
Director Yin Fei said, "There is no inferiority in these two people, they just went with the flow in that era and in that environment."
Liu Yunlong also took the initiative to put forward, "We want to have a human touch. This person's love means that the people around me must have good and bad, the bad people are the enemy, but also to develop them, our team must also grow up."
The end of the two people in the play is also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, and he believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

The Lancet article praised China's anti-epidemic efforts, encouraging countries to learn from their experiences
"The Lancet" magazine 25 article said that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion, similar in size to Europe or the United States, has been effectively controlled by the new crown epidemic at this stage, and there has been no large-scale transmission, which has largely controlled the domestic epidemic.
In the past decade, China has made a lot of investment in domestic research and public health construction, which has made China's preparation for the new crown much more than the serious acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of the year.
The authors say that when the SARS outbreak in 2002, China was initially underprepared, especially the pathogen could not be determined.
When the new coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and shared genomic sequencing data with the world on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus, warning the world of the threat of the new coronavirus through a research paper published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, and such research has been carried out very quickly and strictly through close domestic cooperation under the state declaration of a state of emergency, and in May and July, respectively, the results of the early trials of the new crown vaccine developed in China were announced in the "Lancet".
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in national health and research systems and to effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are well worth learning.
In addition, China's experience has proved that on the basis of strong research, it is necessary to make the right decision with a strong high-level and decisive scientific basis, so that the new crown epidemic can be effectively controlled.
Governments and their leaders must respect science, understand the value of science, and act on it in the best way for society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, China National Defense Construction appointed three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and transmission of the new coronavirus, and their recommendations provided a basis for the decision of Wuhan's "closed city" on January 23; when experts put forward the necessity and urgency of building a cabin hospital, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly; at the same time, the broad participation of the community and the masses also made the epidemic quickly and effectively controlled.
The article concludes by emphasizing that in response to a global health emergency, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response.

The film "Auspicious" is the first realistic theme work of Dapeng's director, and it is also his second relationship with the Golden Knight Award.
The film tells such a story: a comedy director suddenly wanted to return to his hometown in the northeast countryside, hoping to make a family film for the New Year, and suffered a series of accidents.
The family members who gathered for the film completed the final meeting.
In the film poster released today, a member of this family, "Three Uncles" Wang Auspicious, sat smoking a cigarette in the middle of the picture, and the background was the northeastern black land in silver, and the prospect was that the Chinese people must hang on the red lanterns every New Year's holiday.
The red lanterns, which symbolizes festivity and reunion, form a huge contrast with the auspicious king who is in a shadow, and seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement in the relationship between this big family.
It is reported that in the film, in addition to the "three uncles" Wang's auspicious daughter played by the actor Liu Lu, the rest of the plays are completed by the real director's family, the film's experimental audio-visual style, breaking the theater and the real boundary, to bring the audience a new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, "auspicious" creation from "a godly", during the shooting of the family suddenly a series of changes, so that the original shooting plan had to change, no script of life was eventually recorded as a film, but released beyond the design of the tension.
How does the director Dapeng face this "God's will", and how can he continue to meet the changes brought about by this God's will?
There is no doubt that "Auspicious" is full of experiments, almost all-round lineup and innovative audio-visual style will turn the life in front of the camera into a movie, and under the package of real images, the audience will also find the shadow of themselves and their families from the family presented by the film, and as the end of the family gathering in the film, a series of thoughts will be evoked.

Bayu Zhuokang sentry, platoon leader Yu Wang and a soldier on duty to stand guard.
In this place with an average temperature of less than ten degrees per year, a row of simple barracks stands in the pass, a flag flying in the wind not far from the barracks, and soldiers are on duty in the wind every day, and they need to regularly go to higher altitudes to patrol.
The soldiers climbed the steep slopes of the rocks and needed hands and feet.
In late July, it is when the flowers are lush at low altitude, and in Bayu Zhuokang, only the ravine behind the barracks has relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a warrior who had been stationed at the sentry at the sentry, pointed to the ravine and said that this was their back garden, and only in July and August of each year could see the grass growing slowly, and in a short time, all turned yellow and covered in snow.
Patrols can take about nine hours.
In the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snowy mountains and glaciers all the year round, and they also have to patrol the higher altitudes on a regular basis.
A few days ago, a patrol composed of eight soldiers once again took the patrol road under the leadership of instructor Liang Yixin.
Each soldier carries a weight of about 30 pounds and advances to the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier was high and anti-war, and his comrades were urgently rescued.
In addition to the patrol mission, the fighters at the Patchokang sentry have to do tactical and physical training every day.
The time passed by, the altitude was rising, the oxygen content was getting lower and lower, and the physical strength was constantly overdrawn, which tested the will of the patrol members.
They gritted their teeth and persevered, and successively crossed several landslide points, across several emergency beaches.
At about 16 o'clock, it was the lunchtime of the patrolmen, who took out their own dry food and sat on the ground at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by sleet and snow, and supplemented their physical strength with food.
The fighters of the Balupto Sentinel conduct tactical and physical training.
During the rest period, they will play cards together, and the losers will do push-ups, both to entertain and exercise physical fitness.
After a short break in the cold wind, they climbed to the target position of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass, and solemnly swore.
Behind them is the snow-capped mountains, and in front of them are dozens of kilometers of no man's land, and they are the safest guardians of the country.

Marinichev said that the change in value was affected by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic.
He said, “The cost of services is increasing.
As a result of the epidemic, people began to spend more time on the Internet.”
Malinichev did not rule out a serious increase in internet prices over the year, arguing that carriers could offer customers higher speeds and more services to offset people’s dissatisfaction with higher prices.
"Chinese Doctor" to raise a tribute to the anti-epidemic hero - Xinhua
Recently, with the respect of the heroes of the Chinese filmmakers against the epidemic, the chairman of the Bona Film Group, Yu Dong, director Liu Weiqiang (pictured left) in Guangzhou and Zhong Nanshan academician, held a discussion and exchange on the shooting and production of the anti-epidemic film "Chinese Doctor".
Bona Film hopes that through the "Chinese Doctor", we can pay tribute to all the medical care and epidemic prevention workers who fight in the front line of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute film celebrating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.

Cultural tourism "red fruit" Ju Shaoshan - Xiangtan's first red bo meeting - Today's news - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily · New Hunan client reporter 蒋睿 correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing Red Boat Mold, Shaoshan Mao Zedong bronze statue, Yan'an cloth pile of flower crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun bacon ... July 25, 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Red Cultural Industry Expo in Xiangtan was held in the Shaoshan Global Tourism Advisory and Dispersion Center.
The exhibition area's red cultural products, the old revolutionary area of the special products and other dazzling, attracted tourists from all over the competition to buy.
"The Red Expo is not only a display of the achievements of the national red culture industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths."
The relevant person in charge of the executive committee of the first Hongboo Expo in Xiangtan introduced that the theme of the Red Expo was "promoting the red culture to help the tweet brigade heat up", with a total area of nearly 3,000 square meters, and set up an atmosphere to create a area, a scenic exhibition area and a red cultural and tourism online shopping experience area.
Zhejiang Jiaxing, Guizhou Zunyi, Shaanxi Yan'an and other 8 provinces and cities, as well as our Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang, Chenzhou and other places 137 enterprises, units to participate in the exhibition, a total of 768 kinds of exhibits, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourist routes, red training courses, red Wenchuang products and so on.
The exhibition area will be held until July 29.
As the host of the Red Expo, the highlights of the Xiangtan exhibition area are numerous.
According to the person in charge of the exhibition area, Xiangtan Exhibition is divided into two parts of the red industry and the development of the red cultural industry.
The red industrial exhibition area exhibits 31 exhibits of six enterprises such as Hualing Xiangsteel, Hualing Cable, and Xiangdian Power, and nearly 200 products from 27 units such as red series of books, red series of food, and red series of cultural and creative products are displayed in the red cultural industry development exhibition area.

Japan's new crown confirmed cases total more than 30,000 - Xinhua
According to statistics, on the 26th, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo, and more than 200 new cases were reported in a single day for six consecutive days, with a total of 11,214 cases.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka Prefecture, and 80 new cases in Aichi Prefecture.
In the first half of the year, the number of telecommunications network fraud crimes increased by 70%, and the highest inspection summary characteristics
According to the news of the Supreme People's Procuratorate website, in the first half of this year, the national procuratorial organs prosecuted a total of 58,101 people for fraud crimes, an increase of 35% year-on-year.
In particular, in the prevention and control of the epidemic, there are many fraud crimes, and the number of prosecutions of fraud crimes by procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4% of the total number of crimes against the epidemic.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance, and the ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control have been released so far, involving a total of 9 cases of fraud.
From the first half of the procuratorial organs to deal with the situation, involving a wide range of fraud crimes, from the national macro policy, down to the people's clothing, food, housing, including epidemic fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health care products" fraud, "enrolment intermediary" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, defraud state subsidies fraud, national assets unfrozen fraud, etc., constantly "recruited new", the scope of education, medical care, employment, pension, social security, land acquisition, precision poverty alleviation, financial.
In particular, some telecommunications network fraud breaks through the restrictions of national borders, regions and people, and has the characteristics of stakeholders, cross-border, remote, electronic payment, etc., and there are many non-specific victim groups, which are harmful.
For example, some set up special companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or positions, use legal online platform publicity, recruitment, training and assessment of recruiters, the use of enterprise operation mode management, wearing a "legal cloak", more confusing.
It is incumbent on the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to issue early warning to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In the judicial case, the procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only adhere to the high-pressure situation of fraud crimes, but also refine various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promote social governance through the production of procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedural customs and legal application of the arrest and prosecution of fraud cases, and take the facts as the basis for the law, so as to be in vain.
In particular, for telecommunications network fraud crimes, we should pay attention to the central role of electronic data in the identification of facts, and strive to build a chain of evidence between electronic data, speech evidence, and documentary evidence.
For example, if the procuratorate of Yinzhou District of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province handles a case involving epidemic fraud, the procuratorial organ intervenes in advance at the first time, from the occurrence of the case to the completion, and only takes 5 days, which reflects the attitude and determination to handle it from fast and strict to maintain the overall stability of society.
In the examination of arrest and prosecution, pay attention to the pursuit of omissions in the case, correct the omission of 733 people by the public security organs, and correct the omission of the public security organs to review and prosecute 1,113 co-persons.
In the first half of the year, the national procuratorial organs issued 298 procuratorial recommendations for fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting deep-seated governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes found in the case of communication enterprises, banks, intermediary organizations, etc. in the supervision of telecommunications networks, the Guangdong Provincial Procuratorate and the Dongguan Municipal Procuratorate made timely procuratorial recommendations, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision and improve mechanisms to promote the construction of long-term systems.
The fourth is to do a good job of recovering the loss of the stolen money.
Procuratorial organs around the country seized the investigation to guide evidence, review and prosecution and other important links, urging the investigation organs to actively recover the stolen money, cooperate with the relevant departments to do a good job in the recovery of stolen money, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate handled a certain routine loan case, the case involves 22 sets of production waiting to be seized, in the case of the property may be disposed of in other cases, the first production of the "suspension execution letter", timely service to the relevant court, it is recommended that the previous seizure of the court on the real estate involved in the suspension of execution, to be determined after the fact of the crime unified disposal, in order to recover the property involved, to recover the victims' losses to make the best efforts.
Prosecutors remind everyone to be very vigilant about fraud, do not expect "the pie in the sky", do not think that it is cheap to be credulous, keep their own "money bag".
Weining County, Guizhou Province: short apple tree wide road out of poverty-Zhongxin.com

In the heat of the summer, the reporter of the Economic Daily-China Economic Net walked into Zhonghai Village, Tuan Na Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
In the face of the hot sun, villagers Li Yuanzhong hoeed grass in the base, although the face was red, but his mouth from time to time hummed a few small songs.
Weining County, where the town is located, because of the low latitude, high altitude, sufficient light, large temperature difference between day and night, the output of apples with high sugar content, good taste, in the surrounding areas have a certain reputation, but also because of small, more spots, has not been able to sell a good price, failed to form an industrial scale.
The town was once a poor township of "Baogu Ogasa Spring and Autumn", and the incidence of local poverty was as high as 25.8% 10 years ago.
In the critical period of poverty alleviation into the decisive battle, it is urgent to change traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure, and increase farmers' income.
Chen Chao, secretary of the party committee of the town, and a group of people in the town after many visits, believe that the development of the industry can no longer take the old road.
To this end, the town of Xuna introduced leading enterprises and planted apples in a modern way.
Weining beyond agricultural Co., Ltd. deputy general manager Hou Jianwen from Shaanxi to the town of Xuna survey in 2015, a glance to see the local planting conditions, from 2016 to the local planting apple tree.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land out to plant apple trees, and the two Li Yuanzhong and his wife made a mutter in their hearts: "I planted apples for so many years, and I did not see who in the village planted apples to make a fortune."
“All the apples are low-cut apples, and they don’t make the apple trees grow too high.”
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that the apple planting adopted a new method, the irrigation water pipe was laid under each apple tree, the water and fertilizer were poured to the root of the tree, and when the fruit was harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard, and the fruit could be picked up while standing.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered the peak production period, the market is also as Hou Jianwen expected, Apple is not worried about selling, by Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other city consumers love.
The growing apple industry has made new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life, although it is still planting land, but the income has a new source.
Li Yuanzhong family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the apple base, every year in addition to the bottom of the land transfer fee, hanging fruit after the profit dividend, the couple usually in the base to work, "one person can get 80 yuan a day, perennial work."
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividend of more than 2,800 yuan, coupled with land transfer fees and the husband and wife's work income, an income of more than 80,000 yuan, "eat and wear, well-off days have lived."
"At present, the initial results, the annual output value of 1 acre of apples is more than 15,000 yuan, about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that the whole town currently planted 20,000 acres of apples, only in Zhonghai Village has 6000 acres, covering 4,056 households, 17,200 people, including 656 poor households, 2952 people, a year's salary of more than 6 million yuan, the real realization of the base built at the door, work without going out.
Li Yuanzhong, who is growing up in the pocket, has also begun to realize his "wish".
This year's Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought a off-road vehicle, and now driving a car to and from work every day, "there are more than a dozen acres of land at home, and the next step of Apple Base expansion, all transferred to them, the income is more."

Membrane separation technology helps to crack the "greenhouse effect"-Zhongxin.com
Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
New hybrid matrix film preparation technology diagram
Reporter reporter Shang Rui reported: A few days ago, Tianjin University's atmospheric environment and bioenergy team made significant progress in "film separation method capture carbon dioxide", successfully developed a new hybrid matrix film preparation technology, greatly improving the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
The results have been published as a cover article for the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem that plagues human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit of the "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and use carbon dioxide emitted by humans is the focus of scientists.
"Membrane separation method" is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology, which separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, and has the characteristics of high efficiency and energy saving and simple operation.
How to make the membrane material "deep breath" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck and difficulty of trapping carbon dioxide using membrane separation.
Tianjin University research team innovative ideas, through repeated experiments, to explore the impact of different solvents on the separation performance of membrane gas.
The experimental results show that with N-methylpyridone as the preparation solvent, the carbon nanotube distribution in the generated membrane material is more uniform, "more breathable", which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
With this new technology, the mixed matrix membrane, the carbon dioxide separation performance is close to the current theoretical separation limit of such membrane materials.
“New technologies provide new ideas for membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide.”
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team at Tianjin University, said: "We hope that this technology can provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies to deal with flue gas, and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions."
Before volunteering to fill in the report, first understand what is the professional level difference - Zhongxin
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning News Author: Yuxiao Responsibility Editor: Yuxiao
Before volunteering, understand what is a professional level difference.
Every year, students or parents do not understand the terms involved in the voluntary report, and then affect the voluntary filling.
This year, five universities, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing University of Chemical Technology jointly issued a 2020 enrollment policy to cancel the professional grade difference.
What does professional difference mean and what is the significance of volunteering?
There are three types of professional allocation rules.
Experts remind that before filling in the volunteer, we must read the enrollment charter of the school of our choice in detail, and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the proportion of tranches, professional allocation rules, etc.
Professional allocation rules refer to the three ways after the transfer of colleges and universities, there are three main ways of professional priority, score priority, and professional grade difference for professional admission.
The specific way of use of colleges and universities will be clear in the Admissions Charter.
However, there are also some colleges and universities that have the principle of admission that are given overall priority, and there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, candidates will queue according to the total score within the admission range, when the score does not reach the first professional volunteer admission score line, it will see whether the second professional volunteer admission score line is reached, and so on until the admission to the last professional volunteer, there is no grade difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional grade difference" is that when the college arranges the candidate's professional, according to the one or several points published in the enrollment charter, it is determined to select the admission profession of different professional volunteer candidates, which is "professional grade difference".
That is to say, the difference in the score of the college in the admission of candidates for the first professional volunteer and non-first professional volunteer, the difference between the students, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 points, etc.
For example.
Assuming that the students Xiaoming applied to A colleges and universities and took 560 points, their professional volunteers were: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, and the professional admission of A university implemented the professional level difference, and the grade difference was divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, 0 points.
In the professional allocation, if Xiaoming's first professional volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and has a planned balance of the professional, then Xiaoming is admitted to the "computer" major; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, according to the score of 558 points and the first professional volunteer to apply for "international trade" ranking, to determine whether it meets the professional admission conditions; if it is still not satisfied, the score is subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 557 points) for the third professional volunteer "automation" admission; if it is still not satisfied with the third professional volunteer "automation"; if it is still not satisfied with the third professional volunteer "automation"; if it is still not satisfied with the third professional volunteer "automation"; if it is still not satisfied with the third professional volunteer "automation"; if it is still not satisfied with the third professional volunteer "compulsion"; if it is still not enough to meet the third professional volunteer "automation"; if it is still not satisfied.By way, and so on.
Different University Professional Level Differential Settings
With the popularity of parallel volunteerism, many colleges and universities have now cancelled the professional grade difference, but this year there are still some colleges and universities have retained this method, from the school's announcement of the "enrollment charter" point of view, this year, there are mainly more than 20 universities set up professional grade difference.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight College and so on.
In these colleges and universities, the professional grade difference set by each university is different.
Some colleges and universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University, the file has been cast to the school candidates, according to the order of candidates to fill in the professional volunteer order after the reduction of 1 points by the ranking of admission.
And some universities have different professional levels between different majors.
For example, the total score of the professional volunteer level is 4 points, that is, the difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteer level is 3 points, the difference between other professional volunteers is not set, as parallel volunteer, and the professional level difference between other professional volunteers and adjustment professional volunteers is 1 point.
When filling in the volunteer, candidates and parents must carefully read the school's admission policy, to see if there is no professional grade difference, the form of poor grade is what, in full consideration of the score at the same time, but also a reasonable analysis of the proposed school and professional, if the college in the admissions charter clearly adopt the score level difference method for admission, candidates in the selection of professional, pay attention to the gradient between the majors, improve the admission rate.

The first Atlantic hurricane of the year made landfall in Texas, which was hit hard by the epidemic.
The National Hurricane Center announced early this morning that Hurricane Hanna had reached a speed of 145 kilometers per hour, and it is expected to cause heavy rainfall in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico until next Monday, and the rain will cause rapid flooding.
At present, with the gradual advancement to the land, the custom has weakened, although the local power outage, but there is no casualty statistics report.
