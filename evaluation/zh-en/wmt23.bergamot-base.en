DESCRIPTION C and C++ compilers are integrated. They all process input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, Hii (compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking).
The source file's post-level name identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the post-successor name controls the default setting:
gcc considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a c file, and sets the connection in the form of c,
g++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a C++ file and configures the C++ form of a connection.
The post-level name of the source file indicates the language type and later operation:
.c C Source Program; Preprocessor, Compilation, Compilation
C++ source programs; preprocessor, compilation, assembly
.cc C++ source programs; preprocessor, compilation, assembly
. CXX C++ Source Program; Preprocessor, Compilation, Compilation
.m Objective-C source program; preprocessor, compile, compile
.i Preprocessed c files; compilation, assembly
.ii Preprocessed C++ files; compilation, assembly
.s Assembly language source programs; Compilation
Assembly language source programs; preprocessor, assembly
.h Preprocessor files; files that do not normally appear in other post-level names on the command line are passed to the connector (Linker).
.0 Objective file (Object file)
.a Archive of file (archive file)
Unless the -cec, -s, or -E option is used (or compile errors block the complete process), the connection is always the final step.
In the connection phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, unrecognized filenames (including the specified .o H standard file and .a library file) are passed to the connector option (OPTIONS) in order from the command line.
The option must be given separately: de ' is completely different from `-d -r'.
Most ` -=E : and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Here is just a list of formats that are not the default options.
Below is a summary of all options, grouped by type, and explained in later chapters.
Code Generation Option (Code Generation Option)
Overall Option (Overall Option)
Make it clear that the language of the later input file is language (instead of the default choice obtained from the file name).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next `-x' option is optional.
Closes any explicit statements about the language, so the file RE AS E ` -x' is processed after the file name according to the file name.
If you only operate part of the four phases (preprocessed, compiled, compiled, connected), you can use the `-x' option (or after the file name Ah) to tell geo where to start, with the `~-c', `~-c', `-s' option to tell geo where to end. Note that certain combinations of options (e.g., `-x cpp-out -E') {ie MEF =c compile or compile or source files, ETER. In the default case of ERA ATI, GCC by using the `.o' Cai change source file name after the file name. .ec can use the -o option to select other names.GCC ignores the -ec option after any unrecognized input Wenber -S F thing.
Target documents.
After compilation, it stops, does not perform the compilation.
The compilers of the system do not work with templat files between different stages of the compilation process, because the assemblers of those systems cannot read data from the pipeline, and the GNU assembler does not have this problem, and the assembler can accept the C "dialect": supports C programs that conform to the ANSI standard.
This will close some ANSI Cc-compatible ANSI Cc feature keywords in GNU Cc, as well as the ANSI trigraph features such as unix and rarely used, and the forbidden, although all standard libraries under the host environment are available, the main function returns an int value, a typical example being that almost all programs except the kernel.
For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo();', it is processed in C style -- that is, the number of parameters or types are not stated. (for C++ only).
Normally, such a function foo in C++ means that the argument is empty.
The list is removed from here to some aspects of trying to support traditional C compilers.
See the NU c manual, where we have removed the details so that when the content is outdated, people will not have a HERI.
Except for one thing: for the c++ program (not C), the `-traditional' option brings an additional effect that allows for this assignment.
He and the `-Ethis-is-variable' option are the same.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of traditional Cc preprocessors.
Especially the above mentioned about the preprocessor, but does not include other effects of the `-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allow the `$' character to be used in identifiers (for C++ only).
You can specify the `"-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly prohibit the use of the `$' character.
(GNU C++ allows `$' the character by default on some target systems, but not for all systems.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion of the type of ant to enumeration (MEF c++).
Normally, GNU C++ allows conversions from enum to int, and not.
-fexternal-templates produces a smaller code for a template declaration (only in C++) by generating a copy for each template function (template function) only where they are defined.
To use this option successfully, you must mark `#pragma implementatio' (defined) or `#Pragma interface' (declaration) in all files that use the template.
When the program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates', the template instantiation is all an external type.
This can be achieved by typedef, which refers to each instance required.
Correspondingly, if the default option `-fno-exteznal-templates' is used at compile time, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.
All member functions (except the constructor function and the mnew or delete member operator) are considered virtual functions of the class.
This does not mean that each time a member function is called, it will pass through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; in this case, it can be called directly.
-fcond-mismatch allows the type of the second and third arguments of the conditional expression to not match.
The value of this expression is Void.-fthis--is-variable allows assigning a value to this (only for c++).
Merging the user-defined free storage management mechanism to C++ makes the valueable `this' seem inappropriate.
Therefore, by default, the class member function internally assigns this to an invalid operation.
However, for backward compatibility, you can make this operation work with the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, like unsigned char.
Various machines have their own default char types. It could be both unsigned char and signed char.
Ideally, when relying on the symbolism of the data, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz.
But many programs have been written only with simple char, and the promenade is the number of signed numbers (or unsigned numbers, depending on the target machine that wrote the program).
This option, and its anti-sense option, makes that program work on the corresponding default values.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly the same as one of them.
If the `signed' or "unsigned" modifier is not explicitly declared, these options are used to define a signed bitfield or unsigned bit field.
By default, the bit fields are signed, because the basic integer types they inherit, such as int, are symbols, however, if the `-traditional' option is specified, the bit field is always an unsigned number.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in writable segments without special treatment.
This is to be compatible with some old programs, they calculate that string constants are a very bad idea, and the `-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive summary
Impact of Coronary Pneumonia on the Drug Market
The impact could be similar to the economic crisis of 2008.
The global coronavirus outbreak has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has overwhelmed and nearly collapsed health-care services, and restrictions imposed by Governments have caused serious disturbances in the global economy.
For the drug market, the impact of this epidemic is unclear and difficult to predict, but it has the potential to be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Traffickers are unable to cross the border because of travel restrictions and may have to find new routes and methods.
The patterns of drug use and provision may change, and the ability of Governments to respond may be hampered.
The transformation brought about by the new crown pneumonia is unprecedented, but some lessons can be learned from previous crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to look for cheaper synthetic substances, and the use model turned to injecting drugs.
Meanwhile, governments have cut drug-related budgets.
If governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way, interventions such as drug prevention and related risky behaviors and drug treatment services could be hit hard.
In addition, the priority of interdiction operations and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Drug trafficking is expected to be the most directly affected in some countries, where drug trafficking is expected to be the most directly affected.
There are couriers who carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in carry-on backpacks or in private luggage, sometimes in large quantities. With restrictions on air passenger travel almost everywhere, the use of commercial air travel to supply drugs may be completely disrupted.
While the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, the use of dark webs and cargo mail for trafficking is likely to increase.
In the long run, the recession and related closures could disrupt the drug market.
Due to rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poor and vulnerable people will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug-related diseases and turn to drug-related illegal activities, whether in production or transport.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation by providing services to vulnerable populations and recruiting new members to build up their ranks.
As governments respond to the decline, these shifts are likely to take root quickly and become a new reality for many communities.
Expansion and Complexity
Market growth
Population growth patterns partly explain why market expansion
Drug abuse has been increasing worldwide, both in terms of overall figures and in terms of the proportion of drug users in the world population.
In 2009, it was estimated that there were 210 million drug users, representing 4.8 per cent of the global population aged 15-64, while in 2018 it was estimated that 269 million drug users, or 5.3 per cent of the population.
Over the past two decades, drug abuse in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.
This partly reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, with 7 per cent in developed countries and 28 per cent in developing countries, but also reflecting the rapid growth of young population in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults account for the largest proportion of drug users.
During the period 2000-2018, the population of this age group in developing countries increased by 16 per cent, while in developed countries the population of this age group decreased by 10 per cent.
Urbanization is a driver of the current and future drug market
In both developed and developing countries, there is more drug abuse in urban areas than in rural areas.
The overall increase in drug use is due in part to the large-scale movement of people from rural to urban areas. More than half of the world ' s population now lives in urban areas, compared with 34 per cent in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, particularly in developing countries with more pronounced urbanization trends.
The increase in wealth is linked to increased drug use, but the poorest people suffer the greatest burden of disease worldwide, with drug abuse more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are more strongly linked to the world’s wealthier regions.
Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug use among the rich in society is high.
However, the higher rates of drug use disorders are those with lower socio-economic status.
Data from a few countries indicate a link between harmful patterns of drug abuse and illness and low income.
These patterns seem less common in the more affluent social class.
The economic constraints caused by the global coronavirus crisis are likely to increase the risk of the most vulnerable, including drug users.
Changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have in the past been linked to increased drug use, an outbreak that has already forced tens of millions of people around the world out of work.
The pandemic, which could lead to a further expansion of the drug market, could lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illicit crop cultivation, or because national authorities were less able to control, or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities in the face of economic crisis.
The associated restrictions on the new coronavirus have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, which may have increased as a result of maritime trafficking, with a low risk of interception at sea and more than by air or land.
Recently, it has been reported that cocaine cargoes are shipped directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Increased complexity
The emergence of non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but potentially harmful new types of opioids are increasing the complexity of the drug market.
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. Non-medical use of pharmaceuticals is also increasing rapidly.
There are about 500 new active substances in the domestic market of Member States each year.
Currently, most of these are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and small amounts of opioids.
Although the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.
Of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, only 2% of opioids are new psychoactive substances, but by 2018, this figure has risen to 9%.
Many of the new psychoactive substances in opioids are fentanyl analogues whose efficacy and hazards have been demonstrated, resulting in overdose deaths in North America, and in other regions, but to a lesser extent.
In North America, fentanyl is used as a doping agent for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, or some for the manufacture of counterfeit medicinal opioids.
Some evidence suggests that new psychoactive stimulants are also injected in Europe: a study of waste syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes are stained with exciting new psychoactive substances.
The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become firmly entrenched in vulnerable groups
A single species of new psychoactive substances almost never forms a large market.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem in marginalized groups such as homeless people and prison inmates.
Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with the majority of them identifying synthetic cannabinoids as a major challenge.
The control of precursor chemicals has forced drug producers to innovate many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors for the synthesis of drugs such as amphetamines, methamphetamine and “ecstasy” have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and drug producers have been looking for alternatives not only to less controlled substances, but also chemicals specifically designed to circumvent controls, so-called “special precursors”.
Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of new crown pneumonia are likely to further squeeze drugmakers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: in March 2020, a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia prompted the rise in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.
The market is changing rapidly.
Substitution of opiates for synthetic drugs in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opioid market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The number of opioids intercepted by the Russian authorities has decreased by about 80 per cent, while the number of people receiving treatment for the use of opioids has decreased significantly.
But the doping market seems to be booming.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathidrogen, including mephedrone and a-pyripyrolyl abbenzone, are now ubiquitous on the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities reported a sharp rise in the number of clandestine laboratories that had recently been seized to manufacture various illicit drugs, more than doubling in two years to 152 in 2018.
Afghanistan and Iraq methamphetamine market growth
As early as 2012, surveys of hospital, prison and other institutions had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystallized methamphetamine has become another worrying major drug outside of "fenitarin" and rumado.
These findings were further confirmed by a 2015 research group, with drug users saying that cannabis is more difficult to obtain than “fennetamine” or methamphetamine.
Recently, the Iraqi authorities have discovered several methamphetamine laboratories, and the Board has expressed concern about the large number of imports of pseudoephedrine preparations using them as precursors.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacturing appears to have started in 2014.
Since then, seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily increasing.
But seizures in the first half of 2019 were ♎ ♂ octave of octave q.57 kg – a sharp increase compared to the previous year.
The large seizures of methamphetamine, believed to have originated in Afghanistan, in other countries, also indicate a rapid increase in the country ' s production.
Policy changes and trends
Most jurisdictions where non-medical cannabis use is legalized have a trend towards increased use of cannabis
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions where non-medical use of cannabis has not been legalized.
In Colorado and Washington, the two states where legislation was first passed, the increase in non-medical use of cannabis among adults, especially in the past month and every day or almost daily, has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that cannabis use has increased in Uruguay since 2011, almost doubling last month.
This indicates that the increase is mainly due to frequent and frequent cannabis use.
Short-term data from Canada also shows that usage is also increasing while the legal market expands in 2018-2019.
However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained certain products from illegal sources.
The reason behind the sharp decline in global cannabis herb seizures is the legalization of cannabis.
In 2018, global seizures of cannabis herb fell to the lowest level in 20 years, as seizures in North America declined, falling by 84 percent over the past 10 years.
In contrast, seizures in the rest of the world almost doubled over the same period. Seizures patterns suggest that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market have played a key role in the decline.
The regulatory effect of new psychoactive substances on new psychoactive substances seems to have a deterrent effect in the country that is still difficult to assess.
Some countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances have shown different prevalence rates of use of new psychoactive substances.
In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased as a result of the adoption of domestic legislation.
The use of pharmaceutical opioids for pain management and palliative care that vulnerable groups face the harm of the legal and illicit drug markets and the uneven distribution of painkillers in high-income countries, mainly in high-income countries.
In 2018, more than 90% of all medicinal opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
These countries account for about 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that low- and middle-income countries account for 88 per cent of the global population, while less than 10 per cent of the consumption of medicinal opioids is consumed.
Barriers to access to medicinal opioids are linked to a number of factors, including legislation, culture, health systems and prescribing practices.
Some 35.6 million people in poorer people were at greater risk of drug use in 2018.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use disorders and exacerbate their consequences. This is confirmed by research in high-income countries, where individuals' adverse socioeconomic trajectories are not just their condition at a certain point in time, but also linked to the risk of drug use disorders.
Drug use disorders also exacerbate socioeconomic disadvantages and further increase the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thus contributing to a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These results may also be linked to humiliating attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, groups with diverse sexual orientations, persons displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug abuse or have problems with access to treatment services.
Based on disability-adjusted life years (DALY) indicators that estimate the number of healthy life years lost due to disability and premature death, harmful drug use has had a greater social impact on a wider range of social factors over the past decade.
Between 2007 and 2018, the number of years of disability-adjusted life expectancy attributed to drug use increased by 17 percent.
The age-related disability-adjusted life of liver cancer associated with untreated hepatitis C among injecting drug users has been particularly high – up to 40%.
The complex relationship between drugs and violence makes it difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited global data suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.
But in the event of violence, alcohol seems to have a greater effect than drugs.
While drug use can lead to crime, in some cases this link can be attributed in part to multiple intermediation factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment and peer influence.
The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
Where stable criminal structures exist, large-scale organized crime, including international drug trafficking, is likely to be carried out without violence.
In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depends not so much on the number of traffickings as on certain changes that have destabilized the balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.
The Latest Trends
Cannabis is the most commonly used substance, and opioids are the most harmful.
It is estimated that 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most used drug in the world.
In comparison, there were 58 million opioids used in 2018.
However, the harm associated with opioids is ignored because there are fewer users.
Sixty-six per cent of the estimated 167,000 deaths associated with drug use disorders in 2017 were caused by such substances, and 50 per cent of the 21 million lifetimes of disability or premature death due to drug use were attributed to such substances.
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis
In West, Central and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by trumado; in North America, the two regions have little in common in terms of economic, demographic or general patterns of drug use, but are struggling to combat the opioid crisis fuelled by easily accessible and low-cost substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada reported similar results, albeit at a lower number.
Fentanyl overdose deaths are partly due to the unpredictable efficacy of fentanyl on the illicit drug market.
In West, Central and North Africa, the market for non-medical use of Trumado has grown significantly.
In the region, there are an increasing number of patients receiving treatment for the use of the condition of tumato.
In 2017, the number of tramadus intercepted worldwide increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.
But in 2018, global seizures fell to 32 tons after India passed a new law regulating trama.
The crisis in both places was contributed to the simple manufacture and low production costs, in addition to the lack of international regulation of ruma and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.
The crisis in both places has been exacerbated by the availability of these substances in both the drug market and the illicit market, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.
Increasing use of stimulants
The stimulant field is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are on the rise in use in their main markets.
About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018 because of its popularity in North America and Western Europe.
Approximately 27 million people were used in the same year, of which methamphetamine was the most commonly used amphetamine-type stimulant in South-East Asia and North America.
According to most of the indicators available, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding over the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist and sometimes replace each other, and the use of another drug declines when the use of one drug rises, sometimes increasing and decreasing at the same time to meet the needs of the same market.
New Coronary Pneumonia Increases Risk for Injecting Drug Users
It is estimated that about 11.3 million people were injected with drug use in 2018, and about 10% of the world’s HIV infections are caused by injecting drug use.
More than 1 million people are infected with HIV and 5.5 million people have hepatitis C.
In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug use, half of whom died from hepatitis C-induced liver disease, while most of the hepatitis C among injecting drug users remain untreated.
Opioid shortages caused by new coronavirus restrictions may result in users being replaced by more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or mixing opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injections or inject them more often, more harmful use may occur.

EU summit for refugee policy debate, EU officials: acceptance process step by step bottleneck
EU summit squabbles over refugee policy, EU officials: bottlenecks at every step of the reception process
According to AFP on February 10, at the latest EU summit on the same day, European Commission President von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration, so as to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants.
The move is reportedly in response to growing concerns about illegal migration in Europe, where the core problem is the small number of illegal immigrants who can eventually be repatriated.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to “immediately mobilize large amounts of EU funds” to strengthen external borders through infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU has been wrangling with member states over issues such as the payment of fence fees.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not pay the related costs.
But diplomats from some member states say that if the EU can share the installation of cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along the external border, it will free up national budgets to speed up the construction process.
EU officials acknowledge that there are bottlenecks in the refugee reception process at every step, with limited capacity and overstretched immigration authorities in member states unable to prevent refugees from filing “numerous” asylum claims in EU countries, and that the EU’s refugee reception system is in a near-permanent crisis.
The European Commission estimates that the Schengen countries in the EU received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, nearly half the increase from the previous year.
Meanwhile, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
In this context, the summit also reached an agreement on the "principle" that EU countries can repatriate illegal immigrants according to the court of another member state.
EU leaders also agreed to “increased use of the concept of a safe state,” which would open the way for the EU to develop a common list.

The United States upgrade the "chip war" hit the global semiconductor industry
Recently, the United States has greatly upgraded the "chip war" against China - first, the Netherlands and Japan, under pressure from the United States, agreed to start the export control of semiconductor manufacturing equipment in China; after foreign media reports, the US government is considering cutting off all links between US suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to issue an executive order to limit US investment in sensitive Chinese technology industry... Soon after the beginning of 2023, the United States continues to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the action of the United States to crack down on the development of China's "core" has never stopped, while accurately suppressing the semiconductor production and supply chain to China, while building a "de-Sinicization" semiconductor industry chain alliance, in an attempt to completely "flid away" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is to attract South Korea to establish a "technical alliance", or to establish a chip "quartet alliance" with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or through the United States, Japan-India-Australia "quadrilateral mechanism", "Indo-Pacific economic framework" and other mechanisms to establish a semiconductor industry chain "circle", the United States through the politicization, camping, weaponization of means into the semiconductor industry, trying to build a closed production and supply chain cycle led by the United States, so as to make up for its shortcomings in the chip manufacturing field and maintain its dominant position in the global chip industry.
However, the United States' "core tactics" against China with great fanfare are also "injuring one thousand self-injury eight hundred".
Recently, Panlin Group, a well-known chip manufacturing equipment supplier in the United States, announced that due to the latest round of export ban on chip manufacturing equipment in China, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees, and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
Global lithography giant Asmael Holdings of the Netherlands recently warned that banning the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to higher semiconductor prices.
After the US government imposed an outrageous crackdown on China's chip and semiconductor industries, many American companies suffered greatly, including developers of electronic design automation tools, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves.
The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain down.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and has long formed a closely related global semiconductor industry chain.
According to professional estimates, based on the professional division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross the borders of countries more than 70 times, the whole process to reach 100 days.
Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capacity, especially advanced process processes, and relies heavily on East Asia.
Even if the United States is trying to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to the regional development of the "small circle" led by the United States, the regional distribution and interdependence of global semiconductor-related industries are difficult to change.
The United States has strongly "remodeled" and "de-Sinicized" semiconductor industry chain, which has hit the global semiconductor industry hard.
Chip is the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the participation of all countries in the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively issued the "Innovation and Competition Act", "2022 American Competition Act", "Chip and Science Act", using the hegemony of science and technology to consolidate the country's technological leading edge; to allies "enwei", to induce Intel, TSMC, Samsung and other chip manufacturers to set up factories in the United States, and strive to ensure the global leadership of the United States in the field of chips.
In the short term, the United States has indeed created trouble for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, and gained real benefits.
However, in the long run, the United States hysterically suppressed, forcing China's chip industry to continue to break through, so that it lost the huge Chinese market, which will eventually greatly weaken the innovation willingness and innovation ability of American technology companies, and damage the development of the global chip industry.

The first batch of personal pension wealth management products can be sold for a minimum of 360 days
The first personal pension products go on sale

The first batch of personal pension wealth management products is sold, marking that individual pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the Interim Measures for the Administration of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Financial Management Companies.
The "Measures" stipulates that participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, personal pension fund products and other personal pension fund products through the personal pension fund account.
Subsequently, the three departments of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice to clarify that the personal pension system was launched in 36 leading cities and regions such as Beijing and Tianjin, as well as Shijiazhuang, Xiong'an New District, and Shanxi Jin City in Hebei Province.
By the end of 2022, the number of individual pension participants was 19.54 million, the number of contributors was 6.13 million, and the total contribution amount was 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, the participating banks only listed three types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products and personal pension public funds.
Now, after the personal pension wealth management products are also gathered, how should investors choose?
Experts from the research and development department of the Bank of China's wealth management products said that compared with other personal pension products, the pilot stage of pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products have three characteristics.
First, the robustness, the risk management mechanism is more sound, the investment strategy and philosophy are more robust, and the non-mother bank third-party independent custody is implemented.
Second, long-term, the duration of the pilot phase of pension wealth management products are 5 years or more, the next step of the issuance of personal pension wealth management products, the minimum holding period in principle is 1 year, to encourage holding more than 3 years.
The third is inclusiveness, the product purchase threshold is low, the starting point is generally 1 yuan, some as low as 0.01 yuan, and the cost of the product's hosting fee and management fee is more favorable.
Professionals point out that investors should choose according to product characteristics and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings has the characteristics of a long term, high interest rate, high security, suitable for people with weak risk tolerance; personal pension insurance products are more suitable for people who cannot bear investment risk and can accept stable returns; and personal pension wealth management products and public fund products do not guarantee returns, and have certain investment risks, but the expected return is high, suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and high risk tolerance.

Fitness industry should get rid of the crisis of trust
Another big gym "thunderstorm"?
Recently, the rights protection of health fitness members in well-known fitness institutions has aroused social concern.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores did not operate normally, and then, rumors about the closure of the agency caused panic among members, resulting in the intervention of the public security and social security departments.
Finally, the relevant person in charge of the institution responded, promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the storm was calmed down.
Some of the stores of individual fitness institutions have business problems, temporarily closed, consumers can be calm and waiting for the problem to be solved, why is the first reaction of many members is "big things are not good"?
Behind the storm of health club membership rights is the deep-seated problem of the industry's trust crisis.
Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt the prepaid model, "earning money that users do not come" is the underlying logic of its development.
Through the pre-sale of membership cards to obtain cash flow, continue to open a new store, it seems to be able to cycle, in fact, eat food, can not form a stable profit model.
The negative information of the gym running road and other industries is frequently transmitted, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From the perspective of market prospects, the gym is of course a good business with a "money road".
Although the fitness track is up and down, it has always been paid attention to by capital.
A number of data show that the heat in the field of cultural and sports consumption continues to rise, and the market continues to pick up.
Specific to the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards, the concept of healthy life is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the development of the fitness industry is promising.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, individual institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery of consumption, just came out of the crisis, and sounded the horn of opening up the territory, and invested the financing funds into the construction of new stores.
It is undeniable that in recent years, affected by the epidemic, many institutions have withdrawn, the industry has reshuffled, and powerful enterprises have selectively increased their acquisition and re-layout at this time, which is not a new opportunity.
However, in order to enter the development of the fitness market, in order to enter a virtuous circle and move towards a stable and far-reaching road, the industry must change the traditional model and change the business strategy.
Only by steadily fighting and re-establishing consumer trust and security can we truly win the market and win the future.
Compared with the construction of new stores to seize the market, the fitness industry needs to sink the heart to optimize services and stabilize users with high-quality development.
First of all, it is necessary to retain users through the service.
The gym belongs to the service industry, and its essence is to adhere to the "user orientation", and it is necessary to closely focus on user needs and focus on service quality improvement and upgrading.
Second, we need to rely on digital transformation to improve the user experience.
For example, the current popular Internet gym model enables users to pay-per-view and venue-choose.
At the same time, body data and exercise data can be effectively used to meet social needs and achieve a complete service from online to offline.
There is no private education marketing, no huge annual card, users' concerns about fitness institutions "running away" have been reduced, and trust has increased.
In addition, we must actively explore multiple formats.
Today, sports consumption has gone from a single service to scene consumption, and the health club is expected to become a new entrance to consumption, and peripheral products such as sports supplies and fitness equipment required for fitness may become new profit points, providing consumers with richer choices.

Buy the expensive price difference!
Nanjing property market reproduces "difference payout"-Zhongxin.com
Yangzi Evening News (Reporter Ma Yibo) Yangzi Evening News / Zibu News reporter found in an interview on the 10th that the "guaranteed price agreement" that has not been seen for more than a decade has returned to the Nanjing property market, and a real estate in Jiangbei New District claims that "the difference payment" is higher than the previous discount on other sources before the delivery, and the developer is willing to change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
There are many “guaranteed agreements”
The property in Jiangbei New District is named Pauli Yangzi Gengtai, and Mr. Sun, the housekeeper, told reporters that he found a "statement" when he visited the property last weekend.
The picture he sent to the reporter shows that the developer of the property promised that those who purchased the property during February 1st to February 28th, from the date of the signing of the sales contract between the two parties to the corresponding housing delivery, if the preferential discount of other sources of the project is greater than the discount on the previous purchase (limited to the same type of housing, the same building, the same unit, the same property type of other unsold commercial houses), the developer can exchange the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
Mr. Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this is actually a "guaranteed price agreement", the purpose is to let buyers feel at ease, do not worry about the development of the enterprise price reduction promotion, "now afraid to buy it after the price, go to the sales office, there is no time, if not troublesome indeed nested."
There are also many buyers who think that although the "guaranteed price agreement" is to give buyers "reassurance", but the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who intends to buy a set of just-needed houses in Jiangbei, said that the insured price of the house is first of all the same apartment, but also in the same building, the same unit, buyers can compare the price of the few, so the "threshold" is still quite high.
Some buyers believe that due to the asymmetry of information, sales do not rule out giving additional concessions, buyers "rights protection" is not difficult.
It remains to be seen whether the buyer will be able to be retained.
The reporter inquired on the Nanjing online real estate and learned that the sales of the two buildings in November last year had a total of 252 suites, with an area of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, etc., and the average price of the full decoration sales was 39,843 yuan / m2.
However, more than two months later, online real estate shows that the current total number of unsold sets of the property is 157, accounting for 62.3%, of which 128 sets of No. 8 building, 113 sets of unsold sets, 124 sets of No. 7 building are also sold, the total number of transactions of the project is only 33 sets, accounting for only 13%.
Market participants introduced that the "guaranteed price agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, in order to attract the attention of buyers, Hengtang Xiyuan, a property on Huangshan Road in Hexi Province, launched the "guaranteed price plan", the specific content is "the company solemnly promised that if the preferential range of the project within one year is expanded, the resulting difference, the company will return the difference to the old owners."
Since then, in April 2011, nine real estate in Nanjing have also taken out some of the housing sources promised to pay the "division pay".
"The property market is warming up, and at this time, it needs a shot of 'strengthening agent'."
Mr. Shen, a senior trader in the real estate industry in Nanjing, said that the "guaranteed price agreement" is also one of the marketing methods of real estate enterprises.
He believes that today's development companies need more confidence than buyers, and the introduction of "price insurance agreements" is actually cheering them up.
As for whether it can retain buyers, he said that it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, and it remains to be seen at present.
A number of data recession Taiwan's economy in the beginning of the year underperformed - Xinzhong
Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11 (Reporter Zhao Bo, Huang Yang) export trade volume "five black", the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) has been tightening for seven consecutive months, and the consumer price index (CPI) has seen the "3 word heads"... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have released economic data for January 2023.
Experts believe that Taiwan's economic performance in the first year is not good, and the growth pressure is not small.
According to the financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities, Taiwan's exports in January this year were 31.51 billion US dollars, an annual decrease of 21.2%, and the negative growth for the fifth consecutive month.
The export value of the 11 major export goods decreased compared with the same period last year.
Plastic rubber and its products, optical equipment fell the deepest, respectively, an annual decrease of 37.6%, 35.7%.
Exports of electronic components decreased by 20.1% annually, the largest decrease in 11 years.
Among them, the annual decline of integrated circuits was 18.3%, the largest decline in 14 years.
Cai Meina, director of the department's statistics department, said that this shows that the weak demand effect of the consumer electronics industry has spread, and the electronics industry has entered a correction period.
Statistics show that in January, Taiwan's imports and exports fell, with a turnover of only 2.34 billion US dollars, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities believes that the global terminal demand has decreased, the industry has adjusted inventory to curb the willingness of manufacturers to purchase materials, and the short-term decline of exports has not improved, and Taiwan's export recession in the first quarter of this year is likely to be higher than expected.
According to the Taiwan Chinese Economic Research Institute, in January this year, Taiwan's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was adjusted by 40.4% on a seasonal adjustment, down 3.3 percentage points from December last year, tightening for seven consecutive months.
In the economic monitoring index system, the PMI is 50% as the glory line, and the index is greater than 50%, which represents the expansion of the economy, and on the contrary, it is a contraction.
Among the five indicators of Taiwan's PMI in January, new orders, production and manpower employment have tightened, supplier delivery time has declined, and inventory has tightened.
The six major industries have a contraction of PMI, and the power and machinery and equipment industry (35.1%), the electronics and optics industry (35.2%), the chemical and biotechnology medical industry (39.2%), the basic raw materials industry (42.4%), the transportation industry (42.6%) and the food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the Taiwan authorities' "Chief General Office" announced that in January this year, Taiwan's CPI increased by 3.04% year, breaking through 3% again since July last year.
Among them, vegetable prices soared 28.25%, a 17-month high.
Cao Zhihong, a special member of Taiwan's "Chief Office", said frankly that the increase in vegetable prices is indeed more than expected, excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year, inflationary pressure is still there, and it is still high.
Looking forward to Taiwan's economy this year, comprehensive media reports on the island such as "United Daily News" and "Yahoo Finance", experts said pessimistic.
Wu Dazhen, a professor of economics at Taiwan's "Central University", analyzed that the export recession may cause problems in the cash flow of export manufacturers, and the risk of debt default will rise.
At the same time, the reduction of orders has led manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and household economy, which in turn has impacted consumption capacity.
Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Economic Research Institute, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the United States has been unsolved this year, and demand has continued to shrink, and it is estimated that Taiwan's export recession will continue into the first half of the year.
Because Taiwan's economy is supported by exports and affected by the export downturn, the annual economic growth performance will not be as good as last year.

At the opening ceremony of the members, alternate members and leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels of the new Central Committee to learn and implement Xi Jinping's socialist ideas with Chinese characteristics in the new era and the party's 20th spiritual seminar, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the law of modernization and systematically clarified a series of major relationships that need to be handled in practice, providing a scientific methodology for us to vigorously promote Chinese-style modernization.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization involves various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization, and is related to the governance of the party, the state and the military, internal affairs, foreign affairs and national defense, etc. It is necessary to do a good job in systematic planning, but also to be brave in reform and innovation, and constantly achieve overall promotion.
To carry out top-level design, it is necessary to deeply understand the general trend of world development, accurately grasp the common aspirations of the people, and deeply explore the laws of economic and social development, so that the formulated planning and policy system reflect the times, grasp the regularity, and be creative, so that the combination of distance and near, up and down, and the content is coordinated.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory undertaking, and there are many uncharted areas, which need to be boldly explored in practice, and the development of the cause through reform and innovation must not be engraved and the rabbits must not be engraved.
The question of strategy is a fundamental problem of a political party and a country.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, it is necessary to enhance the forward-looking strategy, to predict the future with a scientific strategy, to lead the future; to strengthen the overall nature of the strategy, focusing on solving the major problems related to the success or failure of the party and the state, involving the whole body; to enhance the stability of the strategy, once the strategy is formed, it is necessary to adhere to it for a long time, grasp to the end, and do well.
It is necessary to scientifically grasp the dialectical unity relationship between strategy and strategy, organically combine the principle of strategy and the flexibility of strategy, be flexible, flexible, and make timely decisions, and grasp the strategic initiative in accordance with local conditions, according to the situation, and the trend.
The Chinese nation is a nation that is committed to innovation.
To handle the relationship between correctness and innovation, it is necessary to keep the source, root and soul of Chinese-style modernization, unswervingly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements and major principles of Chinese-style modernization, ensure the correct direction of Chinese-style modernization, and put innovation in the prominent position of the overall development of the country, conform to the development requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively innovate and change, vigorously promote reform and innovation, constantly shape the development of new kinetic energy and new advantages, and fully stimulate the whole society to create vitality.
Efficiency is an important foundation for fairness, and fairness is a strong guarantee of efficiency.
We should promote Chinese-style modernization, not only to create higher efficiency than capitalism, but also to more effectively maintain social equity, and better achieve efficiency and fairness to be balanced, promoted and unified.
To handle the relationship between efficiency and fairness, continuously realize development for the people, development depends on the people, and the development results are shared by the people, so that the achievements of modernization will benefit the whole people more and more fairly.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we need to deal with the relationship between vitality and order, so that the society is both dynamic and stable and orderly.
We must make overall arrangements for the two major events of development and security, implement the overall national security concept, improve the national security system, enhance the ability to safeguard national security, and firmly safeguard the security of the state political power, institutional security, ideological security, and key areas.
Not only to consider security factors in development, to enhance national security strength through development, to use the results of development to consolidate the foundation of national security, but also good at creating a safe environment conducive to economic and social development, constantly stimulate the vitality of development, to achieve high-quality development and high-level security of benign interaction.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we must not only adhere to their own path, but also expand the world's vision, adhere to opening up, and continuously expand the breadth and depth of Chinese-style modernization.
We must adhere to independence, self-reliance and self-reliance, insist on putting the development of the country and the nation on the basis of their own strength, and insist on firmly taking the fate of China's development and progress into our own hands.
It is necessary to continuously expand high-level opening-up, deeply participate in the global industrial division of labor and cooperation, make good use of the two domestic and international resources, expand the development space of Chinese-style modernization, and share development opportunities and create a better future in mutual benefit and win-win results.
Follow the path, can go far.
Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, and under the guidance of Xi Jinping's socialist thought and science with Chinese characteristics in the new era, we must grasp the law, exercise our best, give full play to our enthusiasm, initiative and creativity, correctly handle a series of major relationships, work hard on the new journey of building a socialist modern country in an all-round way, and constantly open up a new realm of Chinese-style modernization.
The Biden administration on Friday blacklisted six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in the spy balloon program.
The Commerce Department said the five Chinese companies and a research facility helped modernize the Chinese military, especially aerospace programs, including airships and aircraft.
Blacklisted companies have difficulty obtaining U.S. technology exports.
Known as the “entity list,” companies will not be able to buy technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they receive a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The blacklisted companies are: Beijing Nanjiang Sky Sky Technology Co., Ltd., China Electronics Technology Group 48th Research Institute, Dongguan Lingying Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhai Xiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Earlier, the White House said it was considering broader measures to “expose and address” China’s larger surveillance activities that threaten U.S. national security.
The balloon incident triggered further tensions between China and the United States, and US Secretary of State Blinken cancelled his trip to China.
The United States shot down the balloon on February 4, and the Chinese government lodged stern representations with the U.S. Embassy in China, criticizing the U.S. for seriously impacting and undermining the efforts and process of stabilizing China-U.S. relations between the two sides.
From the existing wreckage evidence and information on the Chinese military's procurement platform, the U.S. government concluded that the balloon's manufacturer is "directly related to the People's Liberation Army" and is a supplier approved by the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said at a press conference on Friday that China has repeatedly explained the situation and clarified its position regarding the accidental incident of a Chinese unmanned civilian airship falling into U.S. airspace due to force majeure.
According to the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she added that the relevant resolutions of the US Congress are purely political manipulation and speculation.
China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed to this.
Matthew Axelrod, assistant secretary for export enforcement at the U.S. Department of Commerce, said: “Today’s action demonstrates our joint efforts to identify and prevent China from using spy balloons that have violated the airspace of the United States and more than 40 countries.
“
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. said that he was not aware of the sanctions and declined to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States and have not yet commented on the information.

Days after earthquakes in parts of Turkey and Syria, hopes of finding survivors are slim, but rescuers were gratified by the loss of a family of five rescued on Saturday.
According to the Associated Press, in the town of Nurdayi, the hardest hit area in Gaziantep province, the family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days.
Rescuers pulled the mother and daughter out of a pile of rubble and then found their father, but he insisted on saving his son and another daughter first.
When they were all rescued, cheers sounded in the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were successfully rescued in harsh and cold weather conditions.
“What day is it today?
The 129-hour boy, trapped under the rubble, asked rescuers to rescue himself after being brought back to the ground.

The miraculous successful rescue case has brought a glimmer of light to the already hopeless search and rescue work, but at the same time, the number of victims is also rising.
According to official statistics, Monday's earthquake has killed more than 20,000 people in Turkey, and the death toll in neighboring Syria is estimated at more than 3,500.
Although experts say people can survive for up to a week or more after being trapped in the rubble, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly slim.
Rescuers are still using thermal imagers to search for signs of life beneath the rubble.
At the same time, the focus of relief efforts is beginning to shift to helping survivors who are in dire need.
UN official: 'Unseen' disaster in the region
Martin Griffiths, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, told a news conference in Turkey that the quake was the region's "worst disaster in a hundred years".
He also praised Turkey’s post-disaster response as “extraordinary.”
He also told Reuters that he hoped the rescue would be made available to areas controlled by the Syrian government and the opposition, but also said the matter was "not yet clear".
The United Nations has pledged an additional $25 million in relief contributions to people affected by the earthquake in Syria.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced $25 million for relief efforts in Turkey and Syria.

However, according to NASA data, the first image of the extrasolar planet was taken by the European Southern Observatory's "Very Large Telescope" in 2004.
"Reuters” also reported on the topic of “Alphabet’s stock price plummet after Bard answered the wrong answer.”
Google, on the other hand, noted that Bard’s response “highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process” and combines external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard’s response “reaches high standards based on quality, safety, and truthful information.”
Singapore tourism recovers 19 times more inbound arrivals than in 2021

The Singapore government has taken a number of measures to accelerate the recovery of tourism.
In April 2022, the government announced nearly S$500 million to stimulate the recovery of tourism.
The Tourism Board has announced that it plans to allocate $110 million from this budget over the next two years to launch more commercial and leisure activities to attract tourists.
In order to make healthy parenting one of Singapore’s tourism highlights, the Singapore Tourism Board has launched a call for intent on 23 November 2022, with plans to develop a wellness attraction on the southern coast of Singapore.
Wang Lingli, executive director of sports and well-being tourism at the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists have put physical health at the top of various considerations.
The development of a wellness attraction in the Marina South, which has Gardens by the Marina Bay Gardens and the Marina Dam, is expected to contribute to Singapore’s tourism and economy, allowing tourists to spend and stay longer in Singapore.
Singapore Tourism Secretary Chen Jianlong said that in the next few years, healthy health will become an important part of Singapore's tourism products.
The new coronavirus outbreak has raised public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
To this end, the Tourism Bureau has been promoting health and wellness projects to the local public and international tourists in the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held its first Health Festival, providing more than 130 health activities and experiences to the public.
Singapore will continue to offer new travel experiences to tourists.

The Singapore government and tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
Ke Shudan, assistant director of the International Department of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that a survey by the Chinese travel platform shows that Singapore's security index ranks among the top three in the world, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is deeply loved by Chinese tourists.
Before the coronavirus outbreak, about 3.6 million people in China traveled to Singapore every year.
With China easing its border policy, Chinese tourists are expected to recover to 30 to 60 percent in 2019.
Ke Shudan pointed out that next, the Tourism Bureau will pay close attention to the signals further released by China's outbound travel policy to cope with changes in the demand of tourists.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare for the new trend of overseas travel in China.
Looking ahead to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that the pace of recovery in the tourism industry will be faster than expected as long as there is no significant recession affecting public revenue and there is no new large-scale deadly outbreak.

From the total point of view, there are many one-time and technical factors in this data, such as the staff returning from the strike, the revision of the statistical caliber of the survey, and the update of the quarterly adjustment factor, which may be revised in the future (refer to the new non-farmer in January 2022, which was revised down from 504,000 to the 36.4 million), and non-farm employment is not as strong as reflected in the data.
From a structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but the proportion is relatively low; new employment in high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and health care has rebounded sharply, and the data show that the labor gap in the service industry still exists.
Combined with the same much-than-expected service sector PMI, job openings and labor gap data, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service industry has ushered in a rapid repair after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that supply and demand tensions in the U.S. labor market will not improve without a recession.
At present, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor participation rate is slowly rising, especially the labor force participation rate of 25-54 years old is close to the pre-epidemic high.
On top of that, due to the strength of excess savings and consumer credit among U.S. residents, strong consumer demand will further delay the impact of austerity policies on the job market.
The continued tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market will be the background for the U.S. economy in 2023.
The superposition is now nearing the end of interest rate hikes, and inflation expectations continue to repeat, and we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Before the release of this data, the US stock bond market was too optimistic about the Fed's expectation of the path of interest rate hikes.
With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Fed has continuously maintained a fragile balance in market inflation expectations while shortening the pace of interest rate hikes, but the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's biased hawkish statement, and not only expects to stop raising interest rates early, but also expects two interest rate cuts at the end of the year.
In the case of tight labor market supply and demand, the impact of tightening policy is unclear, we believe that the Fed's guidance for interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the adjustment of the market's extreme expectations and the crowding of transactions may cause some harm to the market.
Despite this, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, with the year-on-year negative M2 data and the gradual improvement of the leading indicators of each CPI sub-index, since October, the US CPI data has turned to a rapid decline stage, the stubbornness of wage growth will only form a bottom for future inflation data, the current market is difficult to falsify, and the market or enter a new round of game after the next inflation data is released.
Sugishan founder Zheng Yonggang died of sudden heart disease, led the first transformation of Chinese clothing - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website
On February 11, the main body of certification was issued an obituary for the WeChat public account of Shanshan Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Spruce Holdings"), and Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan Enterprises and chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings, died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65 due to the ineffective treatment of sudden heart disease.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of the state-owned cotton mill, and with the transfer, in 1989, Zheng Yonggang became the factory director of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Shares.
In December 2022, at the 20th Annual Meeting of Chinese Enterprise Leaders and the 22nd Annual Meeting of Future Stars of Chinese Enterprises, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 1990s, the market share of the Shanshan brand was as high as 37%.
In 1996, Shanshan shares (600884.SH) were listed, becoming the first listed company in China's garment industry.
Just in the clothing business as the day, the cedar group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized, "once the market is released, the Chinese brand will naturally form an echelon brand market, cedar suit has been leading the way, long-term become the national suit is unlikely."
In 1999, Shanshan began to study the transformation of enterprises, Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, "we came to Shanghai, to find what to do in the end of the transformation, specifically to find a lot of experts and scholars, continue to open some Zhuge Liang meeting, retreat seminar.
In the end, we set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy materials, the other is the future of big health."
After the strategic direction was determined, the cedar began to find cooperation, when Anshan Thermal Institute for Angang supporting the carbon research institute in the national 863 project, scientific research funds are not enough, so the cedar and Anshan Institute of Energy Carbon Research Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the national 863 project "middle carbon microsphere" project industrialization, engaged in the research and development of negative materials, production and sales, in the country to achieve the commercial promotion of negative materials.
In 2001, Shanshan shares realized the large-scale production of intermediate carbon microspheres and began to replace localization, replacing Japan as the main supplier of intermediate carbon microspheres in China.
This is China's first lithium-ion battery anode material manufacturer, to achieve lithium-ion battery anode material localization.
With the rapid popularization of lithium battery applications, the lithium battery business of Shanshan shares began to gradually develop, and in 2007, the lithium battery materials business was written into the main business of Shanshan shares, and the proportion of clothing business revenue decreased year by year until 2013, the lithium battery materials business income of Shanshan shares exceeded the clothing business.
In February 2021, Shanshan successfully acquired LG chemical polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established a polarizer company, Shanjin Optoelectronics, which has a relatively high technical content in this field, and the main competitors of Shanshan are the world's top 500, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, and Nitto Electric.
Zheng Yonggang has shared the experience of post-investment management, "China's private enterprises to acquire some high-tech enterprises in the world, the probability of success is relatively low, why those acquisitions will fail?
Because everyone will consider, I spent so much money, I have to send someone to manage, right, this is usually a behavior", but Zheng Yonggang is different, the day of the successful acquisition of cedar, Zheng Yonggang to the public announcement, cedar as the majority shareholder of Shangjin, decided to implement a company and two systems, in addition to Zheng Yonggang as chairman, cedar enterprises are not sent to Shanjin, take the authorized management of the way, the original distribution system, corporate culture, management and other models unchanged.
ICC Xinfeng information released 2022 negative data show that the cedar negative electrode 2022 shipments exceeded 200,000 tons, an increase of 100% year-on-year, the market share of 16%, artificial graphite anode material shipments ranked first.
In terms of polarizer business, Yano Research statistics show that the company's Sugijin Optoelectronics 2022 global market share reached 29%, is expected to reach 32% market share in 2023, continue to rank first in the world.
In the first three quarters of 2022, the revenue of Shanshan shares was 15.841 billion yuan, and the net profit was 2.313 billion yuan, and on February 10, the stock price of Shanshan shares was 19.24 yuan / share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Shanshan said in the interactive platform that at the end of 2022, the effective production capacity of the company's graphitization was about 100,000 tons, and the graphite production capacity of the Meishan project was still climbing.
Wande shows that Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshan shares.
According to Tianyin, Zheng Yonggang's total shareholding ratio of Shanshan Holdings Limited is 40.1%.
The general manager of Shanshan shares is Li Zhihua, born in 1968, has served as Dongguan Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Shanshan New Material Technology Co., Ltd., chairman of Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., deputy general manager of Ningbo Shanshan Co., Ltd.
On February 10, Shanshan said on the investor interaction platform that the senior managers of the company do not have a kinship relationship with the actual controller of the company.

We reached a defense consensus with the United States, Japan and the Philippines against the Communist Party of China
ASIA – On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan for talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP's encroachment on the South China Sea and the East China Sea, and the Philippine and Japanese leaders issued a joint statement after the meeting, saying that they will conduct substantive defense exchanges through the signing of the trilateral defense agreement with the United States and oppose the CCP's hegemonic policy.
According to Japanese media, Kishida hopes that through this meeting, Kishida hopes to help Japan and the Philippines establish a policy against the Taiwan Strait crisis.
Marcos visited China in early January and received a $20 billion deal.
But after this, Sino-Philippine relations not only did not improve, but fell.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States to open more bases to the U.S. military to ensure security in the South China Sea.
The new base is 300 kilometers from Taiwan and is one of the closest to China.
If there is a crisis in Taiwan, the U.S. military may launch operations at bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, and even the Philippines, have formed an axis with the United States to build an "advocacy arc against the CCP" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Xia Li, Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang, conveyed Song Tao's words in China: Welcome the visit of Green Camp to the land under the 1992 consensus
Xia Lizhi, vice chairman of the Chinese Nationalist Party of Taiwan, met with Song Tao, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of China, and Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
Zhao Chunshan, a senior adviser to the National Science Foundation, an official Kuomintang organization, gave an interview to Taiwan's Central News Agency last night, positively commenting on Song Tao's remarks to Xia Lixian that as long as he agrees with the "1992 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence, China welcomes green camp people to visit the mainland.
The Nationalist Party's assessment is that it is something new.
Xia Liyan earlier met with Song Tao on the same day that the news did not mention this statement.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party has clarifies its refusal to accept the "1992 Consensus".
According to the Central News Agency today, Xia Lizhi, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, led a delegation to visit the mainland, and during his visit to Beijing, respectively, he met with Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Tao, the new director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, and Yin Li, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee.
Xia Liyan met with Song Tao to talk about the political foundation of the Communist Party of China is the "1992 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence, and Zhao Chunshan, a senior adviser to the Kuomintang National Law Foundation, said at the meeting that the Kuomintang's "92 Consensus" is the original "92 Consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analysis, which is different from the previous meetings.
The recent video discussion with the mainland academic community, as well as this discussion, did not hear Taiwan-related scholars talk about martial arts and the "anti-secession law", replaced by the resumption of exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the cross-strait war is in danger, and mainland China hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the people and the Communist Party of China, the other side is still willing to do a good job for the Taiwanese people, and the representative does not want cross-strait relations to be damaged.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also personally instructed Song Tao to say that "the requirements they (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen) put forward, you must implement", if you can not solve the whole, but also take the case to deal with.
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang's visit to the mainland mentioned in person the daily disturbance of Chinese military aircraft and warships, the problems of agriculture and fishing in a few counties and cities in Taiwan, and whether the reporter of the Central News Agency asked such questions.
French trade unions once again mobilize anti-government retirement reform plan
On Saturday, February 11, French trade unions once again launched a national campaign against the government's draft pension reform, calling on people to take to the streets to express their views.
This is the fourth day of action against the social trend of the government's reform of the pension system.
And how many people have responded to the rally call may affect the next action plan of the trade union group.
This is the fourth time in a month that France’s eight major trade union groups have jointly launched a national mobilization, and the first time the protests have scheduled a rally on Saturday.
Given that for most French people, Saturday is a public holiday, and they don’t need to choose between a protest or a pay-deductible strike, trade union groups hope that today’s rally will attract more people to participate.
The bus system subway and the trade union of the public railway company did not call on employees to strike today, the bus system should be able to operate normally, the public can travel to the meeting place, at the same time, in the areas where schools began winter holidays, people can take a normal degree of leave.
Union groups hope more than a million people will attend the rally today, while police expect a national attendance of between 600,000 and 800,000, and the city of Paris could rally between 90,000 and 120,000.
Since the beginning of the anti-government pension reform protest, although polls show that most French people do not support the measure to postpone the statutory retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people actually taking to the streets to participate in the parade has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstrations on 31 January gathered between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people across the country.
Demonstrations on Tuesday (Feb. 7) have shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million people nationwide.
The pension reform package is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, especially the opposition caucus led by the radical left, submitted numerous amendments, so that the review process was slow.
And the controversy between the fields is also becoming more and more intense.
A member of parliament from the radical left-wing French Unyielding Party recently transmitted pictures of his feet on a balloon with the head of the Minister of Labor on social media, triggering protests from the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National Assembly finally banned the member from participating in parliamentary activities for 15 days as a punishment for such acts.
While the reform package has sparked the biggest social wave in France in more than two decades, the government has so far made no major concessions, albeit with a slight tweak to the draft.
The union is ready to launch another action on Thursday, March 7, when the draft reform is sent to the Senate for discussion, and the union also plans to organize demonstrations.
China encourages high fertility rate to universities, high quality
China's Yunnan province human sperm bank issued a publicity on the 9th, soliciting college degree or above or students to donate sperm, successfully donated 8 to 12 times can be subsidized by RMB 4,500 yuan.
According to Taiwanese media reports today, the message rushed to Weibo hot search on the same day, and triggered many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing to follow up the initiative.
According to a report by the Free Times, China encourages university students to donate sperm.
Among them, Beijing has the highest threshold for sperm donation in Beijing, in addition to academic qualifications, it is also required to be more than 170 centimeters tall, five senses are correct, no obvious hair loss, and myopia can not be higher than 600 degrees.
According to the report, the human sperm bank in Yunnan Province pointed out that donors can obtain a full set of male medical examinations worth 1000 yuan, "especially semen and chromosome testing, most people have never done it, which is of great significance to understand their fertility status."
The conditions for donor sperm include those with a height of more than 165 cm, college degree or above, or in reading, color-blind color weak, hepatitis B and other genetic diseases and infectious diseases.
The report quoted China's Tianmu news as saying that the human sperm bank in Shaanxi Province was printed with a propaganda poster of "paid sperm donation, unlimited glory", calling on young people to respond to sperm donation, and encouraging netizens to forward relevant messages, "let love pass."
Shaanxi provincial price code is higher than Yunnan, qualified people can receive 300 yuan in cash at a time, the completion of a certain number of sperm donors can get a subsidy of 5,000 yuan.
At present, the highest known price is Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of 5,150 yuan.
The last communist prime minister of East Germany has died.
The successor to the East German Communist Party reported in a statement that “Hans Modrow left us last night at the age of 95.
As a result, our party has lost an important leader.
“
On November 13, 1989, four days after the Berlin Wall, which separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, Modrow said he would help turn East Germany into a democracy.
At the time, Communist leaders were forced to step down as protesters across East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
Mikhail Gorbachev, after taking office in the Soviet Union, demanded change in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe.
In March 1990, Modrow declared the first and only free election for the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results led him to no longer serve as prime minister.
Despite Modrow’s reforms, opponents accuse him of trying to delay political change and unification that took place in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for trying to reshape, rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modrow was convicted of electoral fraud in the municipal elections of May 1989, but was not jailed.
The allegations were said to be politically motivated.
Modrow continued to serve in the German Parliament from 1990 to 1994 and to the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modrow sees himself as a reformer and wants to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters he did not want the old East Germany to return, but said it should acknowledge the achievements of East Germany.
Modrow was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica, Poland) and trained as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as the platoon leader of the Youth Fire Brigade and, towards the end of the conflict, became part of the Nazi militia group Volkssturm, which enlisted men between the ages of 16 and 60 to fight the final war.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by Soviet troops and taken to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war, where he took anti-fascist classes and became a staunch Communist.
In 1949, the year East Germany was founded, he returned home to find a job as a mechanic and went on to study social sciences and economics, where he received his doctorate.
Modrow was a staff member of the Free Germany Youth Movement, which almost all young people from East Germany joined, and was promoted to president of the Dresden Regional Party through the ruling Social Unity Party (SED) from 1973 to 1989.
He also served in the East German Parliament for more than 30 years.
In 1990 Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest state office.
Iran marks anniversary of revolution, hackers who supported protests hacked presidential speech
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to mark the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ibrahim Raisi's televised address.
The president’s televised speech was interrupted on the Internet for about a minute, and a sign of a group of anti-Iran government hackers appeared on the screen under the name “Edalat Ali.”
There was also a voice shouting “Death to the Islamic Republic.”
Reuters reported today that Iran commemorates the anniversary of the revolution, hackers interrupted state television reports.
Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution, and Raisi’s hardline government faces the most audacious challenge from the young protesters who have asked them to step down, but Lacy still calls for the “deceived youth” to repent so they can get a pardon from Iran’s supreme leader.
Protests across the country continue to sweep across Iran after Mahsa Amini, 22, died in September in the custody of the country’s morality police.
Iranian security forces have carried out a deadly crackdown on protests, one of the most powerful challenges facing the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution toppled the 2,500-year-old monarchy.
As part of an amnesty to mark the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities on Friday released jailed dissident Farhad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha on the hunger strike.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty, including some prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests.
Human rights group HRANA reported that 528 protesters, including 71 minors, had been killed as of Friday.
Another 70 government security personnel were reportedly killed.
As many as 19,763 protesters are believed to have been arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and state media have called for a vote at Saturday’s rally to show opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On Friday night’s anniversary of the Iranian revolution, state media showed fireworks as part of a government-sponsored celebration, with people chanting “Allahu Akbar!”
(God is the greatest!)
However, many people can also be heard shouting “Death to the dictator!”
“The death of the Islamic Republic” in a video posted on social media.
On Saturday, government television broadcast live footage of official rallies in states across the country.
In Tehran, as part of official celebrations, domestic anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers and other military equipment were displayed.
President Raisi’s speech was often interrupted by the slogan “Death to America” — an iconic slogan at state rallies.
The crowd chanted “Death to Israel.”
Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on national security charges.
They later put her under house arrest, but in January she returned to prison.
Adelkhah has denied the allegations.
A week before Mesami’s release, supporters warned he was at risk of death as a result of the hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the mandatory wearing of a headscarf.
The French Foreign Ministry on Friday responded to Adelkhah’s release, calling for her to be restored to her freedom, “including allowing her to return to France if she so wishes.”

Is the balloon incident polishing the eyes of the United States?
Restriction of technology exports to China
According to the Wall Street Journal reported today, after the balloon incident, the United States is ready to further tighten its technology exports to China.
Current and former security officials said the balloon incident highlighted a national security threat posed by China and would garner more political support for strengthening U.S. technology protections.
The U.S. says the balloon carried antennas and sensors used for intelligence gathering and communications.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official who currently works at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.
“This is undoubtedly fueling the fire and supporting the views of hardliners against China.”
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday, “We will also consider broader actions to expose and respond to China’s larger surveillance activities that pose a threat to our national security and our allies and partners.”
U.S. officials say they have briefed governments in more than 30 countries on the balloon incident, and international coordination is critical to responding to the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the Biden administration’s actions, the newly created Ad Hoc Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party could also pressure the United States to take tougher measures to slow China’s development.
She said members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which in turn could force the White House to adopt a tougher policy.
The Wall Street Journal said that many advocates of stricter export controls are also pushing for greater control to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The U.S. government is also already working on an outbound investment review program to examine whether U.S. investment abroad poses a potential national security threat from China.
Analysts say the White House may face calls for a faster rollout of the plan.
Earthquake relief in Turkey and the rest of the day
Since the earthquake in Turkey and Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have worked hard day and night in the rubble of thousands of destroyed buildings, rescuing survivors buried under the rubble.
In the icy heat, they often called for to be quiet, as they tried to hear the sound of any life from the shabby concrete heap.
Reuters reported today that two more women survived the rubble of the earthquake and were rescued after surviving for several days.
However, the death toll from the earthquake has climbed to 24,150.
The death toll in Turkey is 20,665, and more than 3,500 in Syria.
Monday’s 7.8-magnitude quake, which continued to be followed by several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, is the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing Japan’s 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and nearly the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
A similar powerful earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
Turkish authorities said on Saturday that two women were trapped for 122 hours after the deadliest earthquake in the region in 20 years, and rescuers rescued the two women from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Turkey.
Another injured 55-year-old man was identified as Masallah Cicek, who was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In freezing temperatures, rescuers often called for to be quiet as they struggled to hear the sound of any life from the shabby concrete heap.
In the Samandag district of Turkey, rescuers squatted under concrete slabs and whispered “Inshallah” — “God for God’s grace” — they carefully reached into the rubble and rescued a 10-day-old newborn.
He opened his eyes and the baby, Yagiz Ulas, was wrapped in a warm blanket and carried to a field hospital.
Video images showed first responders also taking his mother, who was dizzy and pale on a stretcher, but sane.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that 67 people had been rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, and a total of 31,000 rescue workers had been used in the affected area.
About 80,000 people were being treated in hospitals, while 1.05 million were left homeless by the quake, he said.
With many people lacking food in cold winter conditions, there are growing questions about the two leaders’ response to the disaster relief.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, along with his wife Asma, traveled to a hospital in Aleppo, reportedly his first trip to the affected area since the quake, according to Syrian state media.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said its stockpile in rebel-held northwest of Syria was running out as a state of war complicated rescue efforts.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Turkey’s Adiyaman province, where he acknowledged that the government’s response had not reached the pace expected.
Opponents seized on the issue to attack Erdogan, who will run for re-election in the May 14 vote, but could be delayed by the disaster.
Anger over the delay in providing aid and starting relief efforts could affect the election, Reuters said.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge in Erdoğan’s two decades in power.
Erdoğan called for unity and condemned what he called “negative movements for political gain.”
Turkey’s main opposition leader, Kemal Kilidarogru, criticized the government’s reaction.
“Earthquakes are large, but more severe than earthquakes are lack of coordination, lack of planning and incompetence.”

What is the “object” shot down over Alaska?
It’s confusing, guessing.
The U.S. military again used the F-22, the most advanced stealth jet fighter, to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska on Friday afternoon.
The shooting occurred 10 miles off the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time in less than a week that the U.S. military has shot down an aerial flying object.
On Saturday, a spy balloon from China drifted off U.S. airspace and was destroyed off the coast of South Carolina.
The second downed object, which first entered U.S. airspace on Thursday night, was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet) and was about the size of a small car and much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was previously shot down, the Pentagon said.
The Pentagon also believes there is no indication that the object is manoeuvrable.
John Kirby, the White House National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications, said Friday that while the object, which flies at high altitude, is unclear, it “poses a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian aircraft.”
Bryant said the object, unlike the spy balloon found inside the United States, had no "payload" on it.
“We call it an ‘object’ that is the best description we can make at the moment.”
President Biden heeded the Pentagon’s advice before ordering the shooting down of the object, a decision he was “very cautious,” Kirby added.
The official description of the object in the United States can be roughly summarized as: the size of a car, no joystick, no suspension device, flying at a height of about 10,000 meters.
But the information doesn’t yet answer basic questions like what the object really is, what it belongs to, and what tasks it performs.
At present, many online analysis and speculation believe that this may be another Chinese balloon.
It may come from China, like the spy balloon that intruded into U.S. airspace and the Chinese balloon that fluttered over Latin America, and they are on some sort of mission at different locations.
It has also been associated with this “object” in Alaska with a “UFO.”
The Newsweek report quoted former U.S. Rep. Peter Meijer as tweeting on Friday that "I really hope this 'UFO' is also a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO."
“The irony of conflating an alien spacecraft with a weather balloon is surprising, but it’s not worth sparking an interstellar conflict,” Major said.
Major tweeted shortly after Kobe confirmed that the Alaskan object had been shot down.
Newsweek said it suspected the object was a UFO and that it was not just a Major.
Representative Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, criticized the administration’s intelligence cover-up last month, asking the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on “unidentified flying objects.”
Amazon’s attitude makes it hard to believe.
Very few people have seen it, but I’ll have to say a little bit about it.
This dress was a zipper hoodie when we bought it, and it was a short sleeve that I was given in the end.
Immediately after receiving the clothes and Amazon customer service contact, when to confirm that the clothes are still in stock, I asked for the exchange, customer service said to solve it, and then immediately saw the product name into a short sleeve, the original I bought the link off the shelf.
Then the customer service notice either retains a certain amount of compensation for the goods or returns it.
Is that the way Amazon is doing it?
It is really unbelievable, it is not my problem to make a mistake in its own clothes, as a consumer, I asked for the goods I should get, and did not put forward any exaggerated requirements, but Amazon changed its name and said that there was no inventory.
This is my first long review and I hope it’s not my last.
Incomprehensible sleeves.
It is said that it is also relatively hard, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks in the local area, it is not clear whether it is leather, and the sleeves of this dress are really incomprehensible, usually the sleeves of the jacket are longer than the jacket, but usually 1-2 cm, the clothes are long 5 cm long, the arms should naturally droop in the palm of the tiger's mouth, but the sleeves of this dress are covered with fingers.
Buying clothes is easy and returns are easy.
But when to return the money?
The clothes work well, because the version is small, only have to return, but after returning the goods, so far more than a week has passed, has not received a refund?
And the purchaser must contact the whole peak courier with the good integrity, which is the worst purchase since the purchase of Amazon items!
But the store is still good, actively cooperate with the prompt delivery of the courier timely refund, but the full peak express work is done quite angrily, dragging half a month or so to refund, this partner is to drag Amazon's hind legs, poor work efficiency, no sense of service!
More suitable for young people
99 seconds to kill.
The workmanship, color and feel of the trousers are good, soft / thin and moderate, there is no kerosene flavor.
Unfortunately, the version is thin and more suitable for young people.
3XL, tiled waist circumference 2 feet 5, tensile maximum size 4 feet, 1.79/80 kg wearing waist a little tight.
It seems that there is no tight belt between the waist, and it is quite difficult to loosen the waist circumference.
In addition, wearing is uncomfortable.
Very good color is not very bright.
I just bought it up more than 200 times, what is the situation?
The first time Amazon used the cooperation of daily bad courier, the first delivery is not at home, and then took the initiative and courier about two delivery times, the courier did not send, and then directly returned to me, the damn courier is not at all honest, it is strongly recommended not to use that every day bad courier.
This time, there was also a t-shirt that returned to me, and the price was increased by more than 100 yuan.
Amazon should not have such products.
When the product is bought at a special price, the price is not low, and the reviews are also very good products.
When I actually received the product, I was stunned, the surface of the product was large-scale wear, and there was wear in many other places, not defective or old, and later on.
I applied for a return, the manufacturer's person saw the picture and said it was caused by transportation, is this not nonsense?
How can the product be worn out?
There are only two possibilities, either the product is the product, or I deliberately damage the goods and then take them back.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence that I did not damage the goods, but in terms of my credit history of shopping on Amazon, I think such goods should not appear in Amazon's own goods, customers choose Amazon's own business is trust, customer win, we win, customer victory is the manufacturer's victory, I hope you work together to improve, thank you.
I used the product for less than a year and there were two E2s, I don’t know how to deal with it.
I bought the product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the two groups on the right side of the receiver often appear red E2, it should be the launch module problem, which is not consistent with the sustainable work of the launch module on the Amazon website for 7 years, and can not find the after-sales on the Amazon website, now I do not know how to do it?
All right.
The first purchase was bad.
It doesn’t feel like new.
The label on the box was torn, and the label on the body was also broken.
And always white.
Change it later.
The exchange is very fast, the night is a little vague, the perspective is not very wide, but the ordinary household is enough.
The shortcoming is that there is no card, bought it yourself, and I bought a mobile phone on Amazon before.
There will be stickers on the package to prevent the packaging from being opened, this time there is no, buy a mobile phone when there is a sticker-like chapter, can be attached to the warranty card, this time there is no.
I don't know if it's cheap, I'm confused.
Waiting for Supplier to Respond
The packaging does not have any logo, directly to the supplier to call, answer no logo is authentic, such as suspected use of corner materials mail to Johnson & Johnson company inspection, but also left the license plate number and phone number, promised to text message into my information into Johnson & Johnson official website warranty card, has not received SMS?
I got the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.
The second purchase.
Amazon's own products are still very reassuring.
The master of the oil change said that the oil is clear, and it is indeed a good oil.
Because it was a second purchase.
So I'm still very relieved.
Express speed, packaging is not picky, with this oil, the engine sound dropped significantly.
The price is good, it is difficult to find synthetic oil under 200.
Support the star crown, support the winning card, and effectively protect the car.
Japan's Amazon is seriously damaged by customer service problems, the interests of buyers (8c caterpillars shipped 8cm caterpillars) (8c=14cm, 8cm = 2c)
Admit mistakes, but always puffet, always emphasizing that the goods are third parties and cannot be restricted to third parties.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
I originally bought the page size option 7c, 8, 9c, when I felt that this is a trap, call the Japanese Chinese customer service, clearly told 8 is 8C, but when the goods returned to China to find, only 8cm, I think this is completely deliberately set trap to pit the Chinese (according to Amazon's after-sales), and now there is no option to view the page.
Chinese customer service: I am sorry to bring you losses, we give you two ways:
1, you return, the buyer bears all the freight.
If you do not return, we will compensate you for 1000 yen.
(I counted the accounts, shoes more than 4000 yen, counted as 200rmb, choose 1, I do not have shoes, the loss is 200 yuan.)
Option 2, I have shoes, finally compensated me 2000 yen, and finally lost at 150rmb customer service: we have recorded, we will seriously deal with, the next day back to the email, said I do not accept the Chinese customer service mediation, it is over.
I propose: when the purchase of the page is 7c, 8, 9c such a confusing option, the Chinese customer service helped me to say that the Japanese common code will not take C, similar to 140, but do you have to go to other caterpillar pages to see?
There are all beautiful codes, and the situation of daily code mixing marks appears.
In addition, why do you put 8cm in the middle of 7C and 9C, obviously the smallest size, what do you mean by putting it there?
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese services, but we do not know that you want to ship back home, so we will not pay compensation for your freight.
I don't understand this logic, I am Japanese, I also need Chinese customer service, live in Japan in China also do not need Chinese customer service, to Japan tourists, there is no that kung fu to play international long distance, then the problem is coming, who needs to call Amazon overseas to buy Chinese phone, nothing more than like me.
Amazon Chinese customer service is not convenient for these people we are in the sea?
This purchase is not satisfactory.
This is the second time from the Amazon to buy a diaper, once in the baby 2 months to buy a box, choose the European imported paper diaper, the first purchase experience is still relatively satisfied, the baby all night with a diaper, indeed can meet 12 hours without changing diapers.
But the purchase of L-shaped diapers, a box inside 2 packs separately, open the paper is more loose, and imported Bao has a clear difference, after the baby is used, it is still possible, no urine leakage and no red rash and other signs.
But to the second pack of diapers, after starting to use the baby's thigh immediately appeared red rash, has not yet faded.
Doubts that the two packs in a box are different in quality.
I will not buy it anymore!
We want to pay attention to the protection of parcels.
This is my online shopping for so long, see the worst package transport, there is no protection at all, buffer foam, package buffer layer material, etc., nothing.
Just a box with a pressure.
And the soft rubber box inside the package, the card box is pressed to deformation.
I hope that the quality of the authentic products is guaranteed, and it is not how dare the Amazon to buy things in the future.
It is more expensive than half of the country, there is a guarantee point.
And the product packaging problem, I read the review in 2016 someone commented, now 19 years, is still the same.
It shows that Amazon does not attach importance to the service feedback, and the domestic Jingdong, Tmall and so on is too far away.
Nice, but a little regret.
The color of the whole cup is what I like, orange red, although my family is a male treasure, but still feel that orange red with yellow is very bright.
It was smaller than I thought, but it was used to take it out of the house, so it is acceptable.
Last night took home to try, after the bottle cap pushed open, the distance between the straw and the lid is too close, because the position of the straw is forward vertical, so the son always wants to put the lid on the raised water, feel whether this place can be improved.
It seems that other brands of straw cups tilt the straws made by the straw is still justified, and the child's thing really cares about safety and comfort.
Lightweight capacity
Like it light, open a large, is two independent separate bags for me a little superfluous, feel do not know what to put on.
After buying it, it was found that there was another brand on the overseas purchase of Meiya, which was very similar, and it was less than two hundred yuan.
Fakes, fakes are special.
Amazon sells fakes, and I take it.
Customer service said that because it can not be returned, I did not need to know whether it is a fake.
Because of trust, so sad, after all, is a face-witted supplies, really go to the physical store to buy it, recognition is more expensive.
Because it is a second kill, so did not look at the comments, I have submitted to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce e-commerce platform, let's defend our rights together.
broken?
Fakes?
Tragedy anyway.
With the second piece of the selection of pores meticulous, but as soon as it is opened, it is a strange smell, thinking that it is normal, because it has not used this, and then when it is attached to the face, the whole can't stand it, the taste is very rushed, indescribable, the smeared immediately coughed out, the eyes are also very painful, tears, and immediately took off to wash the face.
Unbelief opened the same paragraph again, not so heavy taste, is now being applied.
It’s kind of like the smell of poor-quality hot water in the hair salon.
Can't imagine that Amazon's own skin care products will have to be avoided from now on?
The rapist.
At the time of purchase, the activity page is said to give 99 yuan to give "three-body full set", received the goods without this gift, call the customer service phone to show them the screenshot of the activity at that time, the problem is who buys things and save the screenshots of the web page, you have done activities, but also need customers to help you provide ah, the next time buyers should pay attention to the eyes, save evidence.
Feeling after use.
The first time in Amazon to buy something, feel a few points, first of all, the first is to use up the feeling of the goods, the first is indeed painless, there is no irritating taste of things, in general is very good, quietly wait about 8 minutes or so to wipe off, but there will be a small amount of sweaty slag on the top, do not look at it is not obvious, so the overall is good, as for then to continue to observe, continue to use will know.
I think this thing is really good anyway.
The second order from the 27th, the 12th received goods, a total of 15 days is half a month, Amazon's delivery staff service attitude is also very good.
Third, Amazon's Black Friday do not believe, Friday order, wait 2 days cheaper than nearly 12 dollars, that is, I bought more than 170 (plus freight or whatever), there is a feeling of getting an activity to raise the price.
What the customer service says about the price fluctuation, I pay attention to the price for more than 10 days, which is not very fluctuating.
Affordable, daily origin, Chinese label, with granular, absolute buyback!
The paste with particles, refreshing feeling just right, with the teeth after the smooth, much stronger than a second-hand East, there is an imported thing, but many things do not have a Chinese label, do not know where wholesale.
As long as Amazon has, it will never go to the second-hand East again.
Give a suggestion, how can the sun on the Amazon app sometimes not dry, hoping to improve some applications, will do better and better!
Over the years, the excellence has become worse and worse, and there is no quality of service!
Garbage excellence does not take into account customer needs When placing an order, the special delivery time is 19:00-22:00.
Because there are elderly people who are inconvenient to bed after surgery at home, it is only convenient to receive them at night.
As a result, it was delivered directly at 12 noon, and there was no prior phone call.
If the delivery time is what time your courier wants to send, why should you take a false time to let customers choose?
If your own logistics can't guarantee the service, then don't do e-commerce!
Let an old man with 3 wounds on his body get out of bed and open the door to collect the courier and find change to pay for it!
There is a phone call on the order!
No one has called to get an explanation from the beginning!
The so-called complaint customer service of the excellent network is a group of foreigners who pretend to be there, perfunctory your complaint and then give you a so-called answer.
There will be no change or compensation!
Before also encountered such a similar delivery time is not the right problem, but this time can not tolerate, too much!
After the pre-sale of the new book is purchased, the cover and the back cover are reversed, so that the quality problem is obviously the problem of closing the eyes and sending the book to the customer?
No one will contact you with a bad comment.
Over the years, the excellence has become worse and worse, and there is no quality of service!
No more spending a dime on excellence.
The quality of the picture is unacceptable.
As a title such as "ancient atlas", the book is really unacceptable in the choice, typesetting and printing of pictures, and some pictures even have mosaics, which are blurred to be unrecognizable.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even small illustrations should be worthy of the ancient literature of the ocean left by the ancestors in the catalogue!
(More than a lot of pictures can get clear original documents from relevant industry resources), and what is the difference between using such pictures to piece together books and not using pictures?
I feel sorry for that kind of education.
There is no evaluation in terms of text, and the family has its own distinction.
2 stars overall.
In the second year of high school, I read this book was just holding the mentality of boredom to see and play, and I felt that such a book should not be addicted to it, after all, the online text from the starting point was still not very attractive to me.
And then... fell into the hole.
According to this plot, the whole book is relatively relaxed and pleasant, the former part of the leaf repair is still in the online game, even if the guilds fight, but also because they are often blooded by the Ye god dog, not heavy at all.
As for the part of the competition, write a little sad feeling of the change of the times between the old and the new (maybe I am sentimental).
It took me a lot of study time to read the whole book, but I couldn’t stop.
Full-time portrayal of the characters and emotional lines is very amazing, some characters only occasionally take, will leave a deep impact on people, such as the more focused description of the character Ye Xiu Huang Shao Tiansu orange have a large number of fans, but not in the writing center of the role of such as Jiangbo Tao Chuyun show and so on are very like, in an e-sports text actually let people can not find a person who is very annoying, this is a full-time character in the character description of success.
And on the emotional line, there is no general online text to the avelas of the beautiful 30 million or beautiful or corrupt, the full text of all people's feelings, there is a common place is that they like to honor this game, and most of them want to triumph.
There is no big conspiracy, everyone looks so simple and cute.
That’s probably why there’s no annoying role full-time.
Full-time IP is big, thanks to this.
Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of online text, full-time is a good book.
How much he really would give someone some hot blood, a little moved.
In April of this year, full-time animation will be released.
In fact, want to buy this set of books for a long time, because the eternal wallet is not thick enough to start, and then want to buy when you find that tb is simply fake rampant, in fact, a full-time recently out of another version, the cover picture I myself like, but still intend to buy the old version, so look on Amazon, a one-time buy a set.
Let’s talk briefly about the situation of the goods.
The fourth book is not, but the book is new.
The seventeenth block was in it but opened, and the texture of the book was strange to feel that there was no other hard.
The 23rd and 17th books are the same, but also harder than the seventeenth, but very old ones.
The publishers of individual books are different from the publishers, as if the 23rd and 17th are the same publisher, and the others are different.
Overall, it is still satisfactory, 24 large boxes, very satisfied.
The fallen lion.
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "Lost Corner", and the result was a lot of text!
I read it three times before I finished reading this book to the children, a little lion that will shoot, and the little lion who loves to eat fruit juice fudge.
When I saw the lion eating the hunter, my heart was slightly uncomfortable, and modern urban people were a little unacceptable for such an arrangement to be eaten by animals.
Seeing that in the end, this little lion who succeeded in human society, lost himself, he was no longer a complete lion, nor a complete man.
In the end, only the back of the little lion, I don't know where he went.
Perhaps many years later, the image of this little lion is still in the impression of the grown-up children, and it is remembered when she is inadvertently one day, perhaps touching or inspiring her.
Cost-effective portfolio
I didn't know TASCHEN before, and I recently bought a lot of their books because they were too strong, whether it was the topic selection or the production itself.
The work has produced three versions, the largest version and the Michelangelo collection, are close to 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the middle version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; this version is the smallest, and has two book editions with a book box.
Personally, I think it is acceptable, once the price is cheap, and more than 700 pages are divided into two books, as a paperback book is also better to read; the second is different from Michelangelo's whole collection, the painting occupies the main body, Leonardo da Vinci this black and white manuscript accounts for most, for the budget of the limited, non-fine professional readers, this edition as the appreciation of the painting and the manuscript of the most cost-effective.
The interpretation of the painting part is great, there is composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I do not know whether it is printing or book size problems, some shadow parts of the county is too deep, can not see the details, a little regret.
Compared with Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer.
The former is already a genius, the latter is involved in a wide range of achievements, not enough to describe genius.
If you can only experience half of Leonardo da Vinci when he looked at the painting before, he would have no language after reading the manuscript.
Rubbish, who buys who regrets it!
Never give a bad review, this real garbage, buy a waste of money god horse, give a reason!
When you leave, it suddenly becomes January 1st, and the time is zero.
2, inferior belt, are not silicone, with wrist allergies bubble.
They often don’t connect to the phone.
The flight is only five days.
The sleep test does not show that the time is 0.
6. not waterproof.
7. Other.
Logistics is too slow.
Show October 16th to arrive, the result of the 21st received, bad reviews!
The courier was too bad, shopping on Amazon was already slow, I didn't expect it to be so slow!
Overall Satisfaction
At the beginning, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, this time it was good, there was an inflatable bag, the camera was three codes consistent, and it could also be registered on the official website, the number of shutters was 0, and the rest could only wait for time to test.
The delivery speed is still very fast, here Tucao a courier brother, valuable items are placed in the porter, walking fast, I can not open the box in front of him inspection, this is really speechless.
The customer is ready to go before shipping :)
Merchants are more responsible, specifically calling to ask the screen size of the camera used, really for the customer.
The delivery speed is also fast.
The gourd film is also very suitable and effective.
Batteries are displeased.
The machine is really good, I want to ask how to charge the first time on the charge ah, the charging indicator has been red.
At present, there is no official feedback channel for Amazon, so it can only be feedback in product reviews.
On March 29, through the pre-order way to use 31 yuan to buy the book, showing that March 31 will be pushed to the device, at this time Amazon's official website can not preview the book (because it has not yet been released);
2. March 31 pushed to the device book, the content is blank, only look forward to, and Amazon on the book electronic version of the price reduced to 18 yuan;
These two days repeatedly try to delete the downloaded blank book on the device, and then synchronized again, it is impossible to get an electronic version of "The Essence of Business" containing the actual content, but you can preview the book on the Amazon official website.
I have a few thoughts now.
The question of price is not the most important thing, the key is how to replace the blank book on Kindle with the actual content, rather than forever download it is "please look forward to".
The pre-ordered book should not be bought again, after all, in case of jumping tickets, and then downloading an empty content of the book, the formalities look very complicated;
I hope that Amazon can give a normal channel that can feedback such problems, and when there is a doubt about e-book download, or use, there can be local feedback (work orders, online customer service, you can refer to Microsoft's official mall how to do it).
Not recommended reading.
I read it a long time ago, and I happened to see the feeling of reading by memory.
This book is not so much a collection of short stories as a collection of fragments of love in life.
The stroke of the book is extremely flat, it is the kind of plain water, the search for simplicity is the ultimate, the plot is like the streets of the summer afternoon, the silence is flat.
Every short story is a silhouette of a short period of ordinary life, with no beginning and no ending.
“What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.”
I think, this collection of novels, and its title, like a kind of performance art, the author wants to express that love is not only the sadness and joy on the stage, the sea and rotten in the urban legend, not only you and I don't look like a glue, love is not only the above and should not be represented above, love is also a dull life like water, boring day after day, but also the life of the escape, the future.
When reading this book, you may think back to the couples you quarrel with, the tasteless marriage of people you know, and unsatisfactory feelings.
This is why I do not recommend reading, from an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of this book are tasteless, unless your life is as scary as if you live in a candy castle, otherwise you have to read the feeling is strange and boring.
In terms of depth of thought, the daily plot does not make people shine or expand one's thinking and vision (this is different from Márquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera"), and the short-lived fragments do not explore any problems, such as what kind of mistakes led to the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist’s marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book, reading or not reading it is not much point.
Authors’ ideas are expressed more in terms of technique and genre than storylines, which is why the book’s reading experience is so poor.
Suitable for rough reading, can not look closely.
The logic of the book is good, but the content is not full enough.
Explain what a lot of sales theory is and why, but it is weak in terms of how to do it, just pointing out the direction but not giving specific practices.
The book also feels like a patchwork.
Examples are both domestic and foreign; there are well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and little-known people.
I don't know if it's a story to be compiled for example, if you mention some of the author's own experience of the case, it will be more convincing.
The name of the customer or the customer has changed.
The title is still the customer, the body becomes the customer.
There are also problems with typos, missing punctuation marks, and incorrect numbering in the e-book.
In short, this book is a good choice as a theoretical introduction, but it is not suitable for people who are already engaged in sales work and want to improve their sales level.
Quick understanding of Internet finance
This book is very shallow, it can be said that it is just an introductory lesson, which can help everyone quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but to understand deeply, or to follow the Tuso, dig deep.
And the book time is earlier, and later Alipay WeChat borrowed subsidies to cultivate the user's habits of the content has not been mentioned, and now the third-party payment share is afraid that it is not so small in the book.
Now many people go out to eat are with a mobile phone, business also because the bank flow is too high reasons, abandoned UnionPay.
However, I am still very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book, and it can be seen that the author has at least many years of experience in financial observation, and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so it can be written so easy to understand.
Writing high space is easy, difficult is easy to understand.
I admire you and want you to know!
The first factor in determining a person’s job satisfaction is not salary, but whether they are valued and appreciated enough at work.
According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the most urgent thing to do is the satisfaction of psychological needs – to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated when the basic needs of man are satisfied.
Indeed, for the people of the country, most of them are "love you in the heart is difficult to open", even with love, gratitude and appreciation are silently in the heart will not be said.
In this book, the author describes five languages of appreciation: positive words, elaborate moments, acts of service, gifts of heart, and physical contact.
I think it’s not important that you know what the five languages are, but that you can use these five languages from the bottom of your heart to appreciate and be grateful to the people around you, whether it’s family, friends, or colleagues.
In fact, the more intimate people need to appreciate and be grateful, so that our lives will become better.
Learn to appreciate, enterprises can also retain talent to a certain extent, reduce the resignation rate.
Thank you to the translator for bringing us wonderful ideas and worlds abroad.
Due to the cultural background of China and the West, there will be more or less differences between languages, if you have the opportunity to see the author's original version, it will gain more.
Thank you again to the authors and translators and editors for their hard work!
Suspected fake goods, please Amazon strict audit
The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, no weight, even as the roadside stall products, no weight, no bar code, ten bags of packaging is also loose, not the characteristics of qualified products; is Amazon's worst shopping experience, has applied for returns; completely belongs to the quality problem; it is recommended that businesses polish their eyes and refuse inferior goods; supplement: and buy a heart print, supermarket 23 yuan / 10 rolls, add a few contrast photos, further verify the product's fake, in order to avoid the consumer's more clear reference.
Once again, we hope that Amazon can be meticulous and strictly control the source of goods.
There is a gap in sloppy products, and expectations
Advantages:
Large brands, cheap.
Advantage 2: The motor and blade are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and it is also OK to use, but there is a gap with my expectations.
Weaknesses:
Charging without an indicator, this most basic of your power instructions are saved, it is estimated that customers who buy 300 yuan of products, in the eyes of Panasonic Panasonic, are also handout, no respect.
When charging, even if it is only 10 minutes, you can smell the strong plastic burning.
The office tried for a day, and the whole house was full of this plastic smell.
Compared with the Philips PHILIPS at the same price as I have used before, although there is more than a knife, Panasonic this product, the quality is really sorry for consumers.
Small packaging
Receive the courier on the content of the electricity supplier version to know that it fell into the pit, better than the supermarket to buy, should be M, and the product introduction above the picture packaging is not the same, the so-called new version of it.
Three stars is to blame themselves sloppily did not see the product specifications, you sell M code e-commerce version I have no problem, you goods the wrong version is a few meaning?
The e-commerce routine is deep, and there is still time to go to the supermarket to buy.
Just the sauce purple.
The taste doesn’t like it.
Children do not like the taste of toothpaste, every time say spicy, perhaps it is more appropriate to use other words to describe, the child's thestool is only the word for the time being.
When engaging in activities to buy, it is very cheap, so I am embarrassed to give a bad review, four stars, but I will not buy it again.
Genuinely packaged.
The packaging is very complete, the inflatable bag is added, and there is no online comment only on the appearance of a bare product.
There is also a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle, as described in the picture, and the courier is also very fast, and the next day is taken.
It's genuine, just no stock, I don't know when it's on the shelf again.
A terrible shopping experience.
Black five time under the order, the result waited for a long time did not receive, after a query, the package has already been signed, asked colleagues around them said there is no help to sign, quickly contact the courier company, but said to send to the source to initiate the query, contact Amazon customer service, and wait for more than ten days, finally find out that the courier was mistakenly sent to others, and several turnovers finally took back the courier, the outer packaging has been removed, the goods are still complete, do not know is not known to be used, in short, very bad, in short, very bad.
The wrong picture.
I thought I could receive such a headset as Figure 1, but I did not expect to receive such a headset as Figure 2, even if the figure is inconsistent, what does it mean that the sound size of the earphones is different?
Although the name is the same, but I hope that everyone can pay careful attention, in addition to ask the person in charge of Amazon to replace the correct picture in time, thank you.
Operating system as usual.
It took a while, in general, the picture can not feel any difference, that is, the system makes people look at the tangled, the boot time is obviously a little slow, can not be very good set up, and then the software is not to comment, the response speed is more general, and the colleague's family is not an order of magnitude.
Look at the comments are very humanized design, I did not find where the human, remote control this commonly used up and down, back to the key design of the location is really dare not compliment.
So, be a TV, and then add a TV box and so on.
The price is too high.
The price is too high, more than 100 into the current 99!
There have been a lot of unreviewed orders at Amazon, so I used a copy of the paragraph as the evaluation content.
If I use this paragraph to evaluate, it means that this product is at least 85 points or more.
And the relatively poor products, I will never lazy to copy and paste evaluation, so that other consumers will be used as a reference when buying, and businesses will improve the quality of goods.
Low price line, no fever is enough!
Such a cheap line, but it should be to achieve the HDMI certification standard, personally compared to the domestic Akihabara these bullshit things (the price is twice as expensive), the line is strong, but also relatively soft, 7 meters transmission without noise, the low price line after the reference to think!
Something is okay, but Amazon’s after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.
After placing the order, it was found that the wrong one, but the cancellation of the order could not be cancelled, and the online customer service on the website has always displayed the wrong link, and the contact cannot be reached.
After the delivery of the goods, the delivery man called me, I said I don't want to cancel the order without canceling the success, the dispatcher took it back, said first to sign me, let me apply for a return.
When you apply for a return, you can't tell the food that once you can't return the visa, you can't call Amazon customer service, and the same is true, you can't return the signature.
I have bought items that can not be returned on the policy in Jingdong and Suning before, including milk, diapers, etc., contact customer service have been returned, and Jingdong's diapers are open after the taste is too big contact customer service is still returned, to your Amazon will not.
The rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with it?
Tell me either I take it myself, or let the sender buy it himself, people send the sender is not easy, why should I let people pay for things that are not their own?
Well, I don't give up, I took it myself, but I have to give you a service.
Don’t ask everyone to spend money in vain.
First of all full of expectations to buy, feel that the Dole brand should not be bad where to go, received after looking at the package feel OK, a good, but there is a box is basically soft, the appearance is not visible, to feel, eat to the mouth completely tasteless, bite the fruit meat is dark yellow is bad, good or bad, good or bad to sell, can eat less than a third, advise everyone not to buy, not cheap, the quality is too bad!
Eat a long and wise, and never buy fruit in the electricity supplier again!
Where is the product anti-counterfeiting mark?
The bottom corner of the bottle is decessive, should be experienced a strong impact to cause, from the outer packaging bag, feel the degree of ravages people's hearts, after all, is the food packaging is too simple, but also belongs to the international purchase, there is no obvious anti-counterfeiting logo, open the bottle very easy, the key is the cover of the inside of the honey directly out of the inside, there is almost no adhesion, foreign products are like this?
I don’t understand being born in China.
It must be genuine, right?
There is also a picture of the 20th to the 20th, this is the 14th received, the first time I bought overseas here, just write down my doubts, perhaps this is normal?
Services to be improved
I bought a total of 5 pick-up vouchers, in the extraction, the first appointment to withdraw 3, the result is only sent to 2 copies, after multi-party communication to confirm that it is a leak, promised to be issued; the second appointment, just in time for the rest day, the website and WeChat are not prompted to make an appointment on the working day, resulting in unnecessary panic, it is recommended to improve later.
Good shopping.
Something well-received!
Or more believe in Amazon's own things, now after overseas shopping is very convenient, from abroad to buy back logistics time than domestic more than a few days, have to say that Amazon overseas purchase to the domestic clearance capacity is still very strong, much faster than the transfer, so now a lot of things are bought overseas.
It is hoped that the quality and price of domestic goods can be better, and many things are domestic, but it is cheaper to go out and buy them back than in the country, and hope to improve.
Rubbish
Seeing such a package, ask everyone: Do you feel that it is roadside garbage?
A plastic fragile packaging, with a plastic bag from the so-called Germany sent, such packaging is responsible?
I think this package is the same as garbage, buy this product, packaging and its rudimentary, without any measures to prevent damage, a simple plastic bag packaging, after hand, the package is completely deformed, the items inside are also damaged.
If I just met one like this, I recognized, bought a few are like this, look for Amazon customer service, customer service can be refunded, but the freight forward payment, and then the freight back to me in the form of a gift card.
I want to ask, I pay the freight with cash, you give me back the gift card, this is to buy your gift card myself to say ah, but also to mail the product to the German warehouse, this is not a product to suffer ah!
And I have been with the customer service said, the emergence of such a problem is the responsibility of who, customer service is half a sentence does not say their responsibility, even half a sentence of responsibility do not dare to bear, such after-sales service what is the guarantee?
Very good quality 5 stars, poor logistics
1, the quality is very good, the second kill, the price is moderate, the value for money.
2, strong, with sufficient materials, strong solder joint, properly treated surface, good color.
3, logistics is hard injury, No. 3 under the order, No. 11 to the No. 11.
If Amazon does not mark the expected delivery time on February 7, I may be satisfied.
5, but marked the expected arrival time, it is equivalent to giving the user a promise, when the promise can not be fulfilled, the user is very difficult.
If you are not sure of commitment, do not make a commitment.
7, in fact, I am very concerned about the promises made by the business.
8, so I played low.
The gold line will fade.
The effect is still there, but whether the feeling is obvious depends on the individual or the psychological effect.
There is a little not very good, that is, the golden line, originally designed to look good, but in fact, this gold line will fade, put it on the car, if you move a few times, hands, and car, there will be some gold powder.
I hope the product can be improved.
This kind of square, there is no decorative effect, do not engage in the gold line, fall in the car to dirty the car is still trouble.
Things are intact, the speed can be, divided into 2 packages and different packages
The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but it is 2 pieces of 2 packages, the packaging is not the same, obviously a shock-proof too much, thick cardboard paste, sealed layer of plastic, the outer packaging is also convenient to remove, a domestic express box, put a few buffer airbags even if it is a thing, feel a little perfunctory.
Yara mattress is really good.
34CM mattress is not generally thick, do not sleep directly in the bed mattress can be.
The quality is very good, whether it is the front or the back, are very soft, sleep is very comfortable, lying on it quickly fell asleep.
After the mattress was received, because there were two stains in the violent transport of express delivery, Yalan customer service was very responsible and the efficient contact solved the problem.
It's not a self-made product, Amazon is shameless.
The page clearly marked their own business, in fact, by the supplier distribution, after-sales by the supplier responsible for the supplier, the problem of their own contact with the supplier.
Want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier, can not be canceled; want to return the goods, in Amazon successfully applied for a return exchange, sorry, no one ignored you, need to contact the supplier to return.
This Nima door itself goods.
The goods are not Amazon distribution, after-sales Amazon does not bear, customer service even said "I help you contact suppliers", but also claimed that it is self-operated, too shameless, naked shameless, naked to consumers fraud!
Depressed experience.
Before the filter in other homes online shopping, the filtration effect is good, after 28 days after the end of a day or two more without scale.
Because the quality of things that has been purchased in Amazon can be, this time I want to buy here, the first time I bought a filter element on Amazon, it feels not very good, not only began to have scale early, but also the filter element has been used for the 28th day, there will be suspended small black toner, I really do not know whether to continue to use, or directly thrown well, very depressed ~
Not as good as imagined.
Compared with the plug-in board I have used in the past, the external work is general, how to open the interior, and I hope that as described by the store, from the convenience of use, whether each independent unit is energized and lacks a display.
The packaging is damaged, and the time to check the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is more damaged, the inside of the box seems to be new, but the manual does not seem to be new, September decoration, hoarding, hope that the time will not be bad, please explain why several customers mentioned the packaging is broken, but you can safely, thank you!
Overall good, a little problem.
The first time to buy the filter kettle, read a few evaluation articles, feel that LAICA's cost-effective choice of this, received the goods according to the instructions installed in the filter, tried, feel generally good, but when the water is poured, it seems that the raw water will mix with the treated water from the pot mouth and the treated water (the original water warehouse is not too tight).
When you use it, you must wait for all the water to filter out!
Images are incomplete.
The picture does not take the details of the side, the details of the side are not consistent with the style of the main body, there is a big difference, this is one; this bead is produced in Thailand, there is no indication of the origin, this is the second; no indication of the texture, this is the third; when I buy in the UK, it is clear that each box, there is only a simple plastic bag, and there is no product logo on the bead, where I can judge whether it is true or false.
Be careful, especially if you want to buy something out of Hong Kong.
Amazon is bad.
The order placed two days ago, received today found that it fell by 40 yuan, spent a lot of time to find customer service, customer service said can not make up the difference, you can buy and return.
This kind of customer experience and service is 10,000 times worse than a certain treasure.
As a newbie, it’s worth it.
The taste is fair, and the best King Kong is not comparable, before I have seen the price of the mall, not to mention hundreds, I am the first time to play King Kong, okay.
Something is good.
Things are really good, send girlfriend, but at noon I am not in Canada courier when a little unpleasant, logistics company directly put the mail to the treasure and did not send the verification text message to me, causing me to run two times.
But baby is really good.
Worth buying.
The little monkey is cute, the Amazon offer is really big, Zhou Shengsheng's official website direct delivery, the night before the order, received this afternoon, really fast.
The postal service is also responsible.
Cheers!
Confessions of a customer.
1 Receive such a residual product, Amazon customer service told you not to hurry, we will contact you about 54 hours.
2 Then you contact the customer service, they will tell you that the problem will be handled by the commissioner, he will tell you the results.
You can never take the initiative to contact this commissioner, do not know her work number, there is no straight line contact phone, you can not contact her, only her contact you.
The tragedy was waiting for nearly 3 days, the commissioner contacted me, my mobile phone left for a while, did not receive a call from this commissioner.
I waited for two hours and didn’t wait for the commissioner’s call, during which I took the initiative to contact Amazon customer service and emailed the customer service to get her back to call me back.
Nearly 3 days later, I don't know what Amazon will do with the coffee machine I received this defective product!
There is no problem with Amazon products in the United States, and it is good to buy this way of shopping overseas, but it is far worse than the service of Meiya.
For me, I can only wait...
Bottom of Unstable
Because the reviews are very good, all the pot is very much looking forward to, get the hand also like, very light, but when the pot is found to be a problem, the bottom of the pot is not flat, the middle of the protrusion, the surrounding concave down, the oil has run to the surrounding, specially bought the pot of fat fried a lot of oil can not cover the central area, paste, the pot can not be opened, such a structure is estimated to be able to cook normally.
I don't know if I was unlucky enough to get a pot, fortunately, Amazon provided a month of return service, decisively returned.
I brushed the pot cleanly and withdrew, and was busy for half a day.
Good product design requires a matching manufacturing process to achieve
This is a very simple design design.
The shape of the cube, the designer handles the top into a slight arc.
It should have been a very smooth line.
Unfortunately, the final effect was not achieved.
Because there are two parts at the top, the front is the control panel, and the back water box top cover.
The curvivity of the top cover and the curvour of the control panel are actually inconsistent, and after the combination, there is a high difference of about 2mm.
It looks like a small gap.
But it can be said that the whole sense of design has been destroyed.
I love that product designer.
It seems that beautiful product managers have no ability to build such a level of product.
(For the after-sales lady's feedback can not be too demanding, but when I heard after-sales said that all the individuals of this product are like this, not only I bought this problem, her disapproval and real weighty emotions let me understand that the beauty can not be too demanding) 2019-7-7 pump failure water out of less, has been the second maintenance, the first maintenance two weeks after the break.
After the offer is very cost-effective, Amazon fake offer is very sad
The baby is born a week to buy, strong insulation.
The outside of the pot can not touch a trace of heat, that is, not afraid of burning to people can effectively protect the temperature does not disperse.
After a night air-conditioned room can still maintain a high temperature.
Amazon said that the anniversary activities 320 concessions, and later found that we have 249,289,299, there is a sense of deception, but to the supermarket is still more than the same price of various miscellaneous brands, the future can go out with the car.
Vitamix 6300
It has been a long time watching, seeing the 6300 discount of the United States and Asia, the same price for overseas purchases in Central Asia, and hastened to start.
September 2nd order, the expected goods is the 21st, the result of the 12th arrived, almost 10 days ahead of schedule, the speed is really fast!
The box is not large, directly using the original packaging of Vitamix, Amazon is not afraid of the sea broke!
The machine looks quite new, the accessories are complete, that is, the cup is shaking on the base, I am afraid to turn the cup directly out!
Ask a friend of 5,200, and listen to him as if it’s not as loose as mine.
Random accompanying recipes in English, look very tired, online did not find the Chinese version, this is a trouble!
After receiving the goods, buy a transformer, it is estimated that it can be reached in 3 days, and then toss!
Too small, no umbrella cover, the material is normal.
Not a big one at all!
The second Totes, 1. this umbrella cover 2.Umbrella handle material is generally 3. clearly write Large, in fact, it is a convenient umbrella for one person to use, and two people are estimated to be enough.
Instead, the one that was bought in Meiya before can use three people without pressure.
Not feeling good.
First of all, the box is not very strong, with a press on the deformation, followed by the back design of the flat to prevent the ABS scratches and can not play a role, again, the box is a cloth wrapped, pull the rod of the place highlighted out, etc., all kinds of dissatisfaction, and finally the zipper is a little smooth.
P.S. The wheels are really good.
can also
Advantages: This backpack is more delicate and looks durable.
Disadvantages: the two-dimensional code on the card can not be scanned (what the hell), the 15.6-inch notebook can not be put down (a little longer can not be), this shoulder bag zipper can be locked up, but not for the buyer to prepare a lock, can not be described as the service.
Overall, I don't know if it's leather.
The overall feeling is okay, do not know whether it is real leather, can not be blind evaluation.
It can hold A4 format of the file, installed 80 pages thick, but too thick and too hard box-like objects (cannot be deformed) is estimated to be installed.
The bag is very soft, and the inner bag separation is more humane, or quite good.
I just got this bottom of a little skating, I don't know if it's a bad character or not?
I can’t wait to exchange it back and forth, hold on.
Four stars overall, or worth it.
ForRoyal Popular Global Camera Backband SLR
The strap is designed to be more scientific, hanging shoulders, practical, and the chest is fixed and protected with soft materials, unlike other fast-shooters with screws to fix the bottom injury camera, and it is convenient to remove photography.
Garbage after sale
I bought a month and a half ago to buy a piano, missing a part, after informing Amazon gave me a phone call after the sale, after many communication, parts have not received, please ask what is the efficiency!
It is estimated that after the problem of maintenance is more troublesome, looking forward to good after-sales friends or detour, too troublesome!
Small Defects, Good Sound
The head has defects, missing a corner, feeling is a residual product, there is no giveaway, but this price is already good, the sound of the piano is also good.
Okay, the first list.
It took a long time, except for the bass, which is generally good.
Work is not as perfect as you might think.
The first time I bought it, there was a problem with things, and all the lights were flashing and could not be used.
The exchange was required, and the result was that the goods arrived in Shanghai for three days, and they were not sent.
The phone call to the delivery is also not answered.
The courier company said that they only had that contact information.
Amazon can’t find a place to complain.
No requests, in the case of delayed delivery, inexplicably delayed delivery as I asked for – such text messages came.
What else is the question of transit?
In any case, the poor shopping experience began to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics system and control system.
I don’t think I got it today either.
Label stickiness is too poor, not waterproof
Although the Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not coated; and the label is very poor stickiness, the cable label is not good at all, it is very easy to fall down, and the friends who bought it for the finishing of the cable need to pay attention to it.
The pen is OK, but the package is too simple, on a paper box, there is no protection, and the box with the pen is glued with a large piece of transparent glue, tearing down the glue is on the box.
Six hundred dollars was treated like this, and it was a disappointment to a shopping trip.
But the pen is no problem.
I hope to improve on the packaging!
Quality is not said, if you write, it is better than 925-25
First of all, praise the daily express, aviation parts, super fast, service attitude is also very good!
Has been using 925-25, very good, just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is not said, the style is also very beautiful, the reason is given to the four stars because the pen is a little heavy, not suitable for fast writing, the pen cap adjusts the length of the lead core a little shake, personal opinion: 925-25 is more handy than 85.
So it became Amazon's dead powder.
Super discount prices to buy, as a result, the child does not like to read the pen.
It has been unpacked, try to apply for a return, and actually come to the door for free.
Too much cow.
Returns are not recommended, but this service is the only one in China.
I hope not to be abused.
Later books were transferred to buy here.
Headphones, and noise.
This headset is real garbage, I don't know if it's my ear, or this headset is really not as good as before.
I bought a blue two years ago, the sound quality is not bad, there is no noise bass is also good, with more than two years of bad plan to buy another (urbeats), after all, feel good.
I saw a purple look very good, and I bought this one today to open it to feel wrong, and the sound was small on the other side.
At first I thought it was the sound of the song because I didn't think much, but then I heard it for half a day, I found that this problem was very serious, not only the partial tone, the bass effect did not sound good before me, and there was a little noise, is it only the purple I bought this phenomenon?
Very poor assessment, very disappointing.
Returns will be made tomorrow during the day.
PS is good.
This AV amplifier is set up in a complex, rough appearance, and heat.
Sounds over for a while!
On August 14, just got the German version of DN1080.
The front panel, the knobs are plastic.
The back panel audio input socket, the speaker output terminal is very bad, just find a 1000-2000 CD amplifier machine is much better than this one.
The top cover is relatively thin, my transformer is still concave, had to open the box to restore by hand, the top cover and the front panel combined loose.
The center of gravity of the whole machine is biased towards the transformer end, and it is very awkward when moving.
It feels like Sony's entry-level machine, just working, produced in Malaysia.
It feels better for Sony to be foundry in China than a pony.
The machine is hot, and the two-channel cover used to watch the movie for about 2 hours is about 40-50 °C by hand, and I do not know whether the transformer is too large and the heat is too large.
Now multi-use switching power supply, this silly transformer is estimated to have 4KG.
Sony should use a silent fan of active heat dissipation inside the machine, and only see the large aluminum plate heat sink on the pipe after opening the box.

Not opened.
Batteries are in use.
I want to do an autopsy and see what’s in his stomach.
Later, think about it, if you are disappointed after opening, spending so much money is too wrong; if you are satisfied after opening, it will be difficult to install again, and it will not be easy to use.
Even if Sony uses a good battery.
As for the detailed description of the electricity, the average person will look at the heart will be false.
I am still good, long-term work in the mobile phone factory, in addition to not understanding the circuit, but also half a battery engineer, can withstand.
Overjoyed
There is really no bottom in your heart before buying, until you open it and feel very positive!
Finally, when I touched the headphone cable, I felt particularly flexible and the quality was too good to plug in the QQ music on my phone.
I was surprised that the sound quality was around 3D!
I asked in the physical communication shop, almost 30 or so, but not a winning brand, is a miscellaneous brand, so this product although 27, but the price is absolutely worth it!
The worst online shopping experience.
After the order was placed on September 28, the system showed that it had been shipped, and the results were not received until October 12.
Check the status of Amazon's order, the seller did not provide a courier number, can not find where the order is.
So sent an email to the seller to ask if you can provide a courier number, after two days have not responded.
In desperation, call Amazon customer service, customer service told the seller's mobile phone number, I called to ask the store, after a few times, the phone spoke, was told that the courier lost, you can immediately re-issue me again.
Although I was particularly angry, due to the urgent need of the computer, so I did not tell the seller more, as long as I immediately sent it to me.
The next day, I called and asked, did you ship it?
The seller said it was not yet, and it could be sent in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon, the seller said that he must send, shipped after five or six in the afternoon, and when I called at 7 p.m., no one answered the phone.
On the morning of the third day, I called again and asked the goods to go?
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said no, told me if I was in a hurry to order from another home, if I could wait, I would send it in the afternoon.
I can't wait to order from other homes for a long time.
Just ask the seller to ship quickly.
Finally, after countless phone tracking, I got my computer on October 16.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because it was bought by others, and then add comments.
Just bought six months did not use a few times, now contact bad, ask can be repaired?
Because there is a desktop, I have not used it a few times after I bought it.
Just travel the fashion bag with a few times.
Recently found on the power supply, do not charge, need to use the hand to help a few charger and line connection, in order to charge.
Doubts that the interface is bad contact, do not know now can be repaired?
I highly recommend Amazon to stop using EMS!
Five stars for goods, one star in logistics, and an average of three stars.
I don't know why Amazon has to send EMS, the industry is not reliable, well, the computer is also valuable!
After the purchase, the order shows that it is expected to be delivered on the 20th, so the family waited at home for three days!
From Xiamen to Fuzhou, why four or five days!
On the morning of the 22nd, check the logistics finally arrived in Fuzhou, ready to open the happy to receive the goods, as a result, in the evening in the case of not confiscating any phone calls, SMS, a check logistics, even at noon was signed, but also showed that I signed!
I was instantly shocked!
Who am I? where am I? - I bought this computer.
I doubt life is good!
Finally, I ran a trip to collect the collection point to move the computer back.
The specific reason is simply because the courier brother reversed the two single numbers, but it is not lost.
I strongly recommend that Amazon do not use EMS, in the future if Amazon uses EMS to send couriers, I will definitely not buy it again.
Goods are good.
First of all, just bought a few days to find the price reduction, bad reviews, this is still good, cost-effective, CPU and graphics card enough to cope with the mainstream online game and a considerable part of the large stand-alone, heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a little leaky (ips screen of the disease), the sound quality is not very good, the hard disk is not good (recommended to spend a little money to add a solid state), yesterday to take the after-sales inspection of the hardware, no problems, bring Win8.1 is not very easy to use, it is recommended to upgrade to 10, the seller shipped quickly.
(By the way, buy a keyboard film must not go to a certain treasure called E cool digital center store to buy, slow delivery quality is poor, product problems do not return, the boss is full of dirty words, especially exposed )
Things are good, the platform bureaucrats are still
The hard disk quality is very good, the price is absolutely high, cheaper than Hong Kong to buy, not in a hurry and can tolerate logistics, absolutely recommend buying.
But I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still, and a few years ago I vowed absolutely not to improve, you can never find the actual logistics situation, the information is always sent a few weeks later, can never complain, is so bureaucratic!
The goods have been received for a few days, and the logistics information is still 10 days later you will receive the goods!
Logistics is not easy.
Send to this way, not only the packaging is flattened, the electrical packaging is also open, and I do not know whether there is a package.
FYI
I haven't tried it yet, I have always trusted Philips, and I hope that the battery life is longer than other brands.
Checking the Internet, it may be a problem of water, and there is no warranty.
Depressed!
Now wrapped in plastic wrap to continue to use, I do not know how long can be used?
Buy what others have opened.
More than 300 machines to more than a hundred taxes is indeed relatively high, see now more than 600 more heart balance.
When received, the state of the sealing glue strip is very wrong, as if it was opened, quickly took a picture, it was quickly taken, and the cardboard inside was opened, and there was damage to the cardboard after opening, worried that others would retreat, and it was not until the anniversary of the husband to try it, the result was that the machine had no electricity at all, and there was no scum in the knife head.
Whether there is any problem or whether there will be any problems in the short term is unknown, such as the previous evaluation, what is issued when out of stock is really not reliable!
The level of experience.
Almost the top electric, there are many kinds of tooth cleaning mode, but few people will change the different mode brush every day.
It took half a year without any problems, brush every day, almost more than 1 Monday.
Brush head accessories are also cheap to buy on Amazon.
App is a bit difficult to use, in addition to changing the color of those, other seemingly compatible problems are the reasons for the overseas version?
I want to study law.
Cost-effective
It has been used 3-4 times.
1, the packaging is intact.
2, the use is very simple, cleaning is also very convenient.
3, you can DIY haircut, save money.
In summary, a very successful purchase.
There are fakes.
Last time I bought two bags, actually two different versions, the bottom left corner of the package is green, the result is a bag is not, is a white word, the result cat eats it and pulls the stomach.
Whether Amazon's source is fake or was the employee dropped the package when it was shipped, I can't be sure.
I will buy it again, and if it is still a fake, I will find your relevant person to be held accountable.
It's cross-section!
Amazon picture is a slash, the result sent me is a crossbar, this is not a lie?
The effect is okay.
Cats like to eat, that’s the point.
It is also really effective.
Tight, narrow, hoofed, and ground the back of the foot.
Not recommended.
UN is the most comfortable series for Clarks, but unfortunately this one is too bad.
Addition: Today compared the previous UN series of insoles (shoes thrown the pads to keep), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, the breathable is not as good as before, is the fake soft.
The back of my feet is not high, and the part of my feet is about 3 centimeters forward at the top of the back of my feet.
Buy three pairs of clarks overseas, only one pair is suitable.
It scared me to cut off all the fun in the collection.
Try rockport, you can't just go to the Ecco store.
Good, bad quality control.
First of all, it is worth mentioning that Prime's overseas purchase of Ups is very powerful, and the No. 31 under the single No. 6 received.
The color of the shoes is much better than the pictures, and the cortex feels good.
The shoe size is slightly larger, the 25-foot length is 10.5 wide shot 7.5W, the upper foot is a little loose, but usually like to wear looser, a pair of insoles just right.
Secondly, this shoe quality control really dare not compliment, a sole glue is damaged, the other side of the upper has a variety of wipe marks and a needle eye, the upper and the sole connection of the glue strip is misplaced, clearly set up again!
A little regret!
Do the activity of 280 yuan to buy, this price to buy Arthurs is quite cost-effective, of course, to see the reviews and lower prices.
Now let's talk about shoes, the advantages: shoes are very light, running is very comfortable, but also more suitable, will not loose and collapse.
The face value is very high, but the shortcomings are also obvious: I generally wear 40 shoes, this time buy 40.5, wear into the front of the shoes about a thumb distance, but this does not affect anything.
The shoe is very "narrow", although there is still a distance in front, but it feels tight.
Another point, the shoes may not be very good, and now wear the feet are very hot.
Foot pressure on the back
First of all, the shoes work well and are worth the price.
My feet are very standard kind of kind, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, Amazon's love step also bought a few pairs, never appeared without feet, but this pair of I refer to the comments, buy the big one uk7, the upper foot because the size of a yard length is obviously long, but because the insoles are too thick, or the foot pressure is strong, coupled with the hiking shoes are very hard, resulting in very uncomfortable feet.
If your feet are not particularly thin, it is not recommended to buy this one.
If you must buy, change the insoles can also be solved, but the original insoles look very advanced, no need and a pity.
A perfect shopping!
Very satisfied, very like, Amazon overseas shopping is authentic, the quality is also very good, cheap, buy at ease, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service attitude is very cordial and amiable, handling the problem is patient and efficient, perfect to solve the worries, supporting the express delivery door is very convenient and safe, delivery master is very for the customer's sake, each time will remind the timely pick-up from the express container, thank Amazon to provide customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
In short, our whole family likes to shop on Amazon overseas!
Absolutely bad reviews!
This is very silent about the agency and Amazon.
Be careful when buying electronics on Amazon.
It’s been a long time, but I still have to complain.
In the winter, it was bought, less than 200, and it was useless to put it at home for several months.
When it is used in the spring, it is found that the bracelet is not connected, and the two equipment instructions are supportive of each other, and later it is found that it should be a problem with the heart rate band, because other equipment can't be found.
Call Amazon, let me contact the agency, the agency let me send the device to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After nearly half a month, the things were sent back as they were, and even the courier box was the one I used to send!
There are no responses and receipts and test reports!
Tell me if it's good or bad!
Call to ask, say this to send back to say that the equipment is no problem, is good.
But how can I still not connect, the agency replied: that is not their business.
I’m so bad that I don’t want to be tossed for something of $200.
Serious goods are not on the board.
Very bad for the board.
The headband material is good.
Much better than Nike.
Breathability is also good.
Just the hat in front.
Very fine.
Is it going to be funny?!
Completely unobtained from the sun.
Do not return because it functions well as a headband.
Wear it up, but it doesn’t cover the sun.
But it is different from other headband styles.
Keep it used.
The quality of the goods is good, Amazon lacks the spirit of contract, and the delivery man is very good.
I ask for Saturday and Sunday delivery!
Amazon’s rules cannot be delivered on Saturdays and Sundays.
Drive 200 kilometers from the field to pick up!
Amazon, how do I love you again?
The delivery staff is very active and enthusiastic.
Give a compliment!
The product, simply tried, is good.
But have not bought a similar product before, can not compare the price!
Size Logistics
Work can also be, that is, the logistics is too slow, the previous shoes are DHL, this time Apex really ... domestic bought a lot of UA, the price is not low, feel more high than Nike ADIDAS grade?
It’s all the same, so the sea.
Size: I am 176CM, 68KG, my shoulders wide general clothes are 180, buy M, the hem is slightly longer, the other wear just right, I see the recommended S code, the body is so slender? or like tight?
The size is right.
Bust circumference 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, before the purchase consultation customer service was told should buy xxl, and then read the comments decisively to start L, after receiving the goods found that the size is just right, almost got into the pit.
Double 11 is much more expensive than Black Five.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
Z affordable goods problem is troublesome!
The order under the 18th, the goods received on the 25th, the speed of the snail from Guangzhou to Beijing!
Buy Z affordable goods, the instructions told there are scratches, but after receiving the goods found 4 screws and nuts!
The child is not willing to return, thinking that the problem is not big, but accessories such small parts, the child's grandfather ran around several hardware stores did not buy!
Finally, Grandpa sticks!
It seems that you can't buy Z affordable products anymore!
The quality of toys is not good.
Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, the bolts are very laborious, it can be seen that the processing quality is not good, and they do not know how long they can play, because the frying is something promised to the child, it will not return.
Other comments say that the installation is not difficult, is there only a problem with the one I bought?
Very ordinary
Was it my bad luck?
The packaging is too old; the work is very ordinary; the music is only one and only 8 seconds long and then repeated; the action is to shake the head and go forward, without any change.
Not worth that price.
Hurry up, don't return.
The quality of the toys is good, Tucao a package
Yesterday received the courier, Amazon bought, marked EMS delivery, and finally Tmall courier sent, which turned how many corners?
In addition, the packaging, is wrapped with plastic wrap a few layers, not even a package of plastic bubble paper, open a look, all the parts are placed in an empty box, good toy quality is good, there is no broken parts, is much smaller than imagined, because not with batteries, handways often derailed, feel the gap between the two sides of the track is too large, the design is unreasonable.
Good quality, fun.
It is very fun, the components are very high, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is similar to Lego, and the price is very favorable when doing activities.
The process of assembling is very interesting, I came to fight, 5-year-old son to play, very good.
He would probably continue to buy this brand of toys.
New machine, good sea.
Christmas has been read, before the purchase of 150 yuan, but now the delivery is a little slower.
The machine is good, all new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then connect the genie ball will send a dream.
It’s better than the PS4, which is more portable.
I bought Zelda, wait for the game, and try again.
Production of rotten goods, the sale of rotten goods, the result of rotten goods service, bought six watches to send to the child, one of the fast numbers is not complete, six pieces of time are inconsistent, the difference of more than a dozen hours.
They replied that since there is, then why the time difference is so much, it is certainly the watch without accuracy, simply said that it is a seafood product, not my words, see, obviously the quality problem (digital display is not complete) are out to sell, is not garbage goods.
I contacted the seller, the seller said a lot of reasons, but also complained that they should not buy their things, such products, such sellers, such after-sales service, who will dare to buy things on Amazon in the future.
In short, I recommend not to buy things with this seller, and buying is also garbage.
Amazon shipping issues
After receiving the goods, the inspection found that:
1, the table packaging is seriously dilapidated.
2, the table has serious use of folds.
3, the table does not go, the lamp charging is not used, can not adjust the time.
4, contact Amazon customer service, can only be mailed to the United States at their own expense, and then make up postage.
5, 2 points is the reason for the customer service is good.
I can only say that it is still together.
Time is not very accurate, about a second a day, it took only a few months has been more than two minutes.
I have used a piece of Nitetsu before, and it feels that a year or two will not be a few seconds away.
The perennial calendar function is quite good, the timing function is a little chicken ribs, basically not used, and occasionally accidentally touches the timing mode.
Solar Sports Watch
Advantages: Solar charging does not have to worry about replacing the battery, with world time, a variety of alarms and full reminders.
Insufficient: the mirror is easy to scratch and enter dust.
Value for money: the general price in China is between 220-300, and more than 180 overseas purchases (about 1 week).
Very satisfied with the watch.
It must be authentic, go to the counter to check the goods, the appearance of the watch is very beautiful, fine workmanship, with sufficient materials, plus and imported mechanical movements, so there is a certain amount of weight, those three or four hundred so-called mechanical watches can not be compared, this is true.
The watch is very accurate, the error is completely within the acceptable range, the watch packaging has a jewelry identification certificate, the dial of the 12 words where the real diamond, this wear is very suitable, as a gift to send out is also very face.
The Bentley watch is really good.
The worst shopping ever.
On the evening of September 23, the wife's mobile phone fell, and Amazon ordered an 8p, which was available but not self-operated and did not increase the price (heart was secretly happy), because it was not a slow delivery of the company, the system showed that it was expected to arrive at the latest on September 27.
My wife did not have a mobile phone to die, the next morning at 6 o'clock in the morning to ask me to think of a way, and then Jingdong to see 256G goods can be delivered on the same day, only to order one more immediately.
If you buy a new one, I want to cancel Amazon’s order right away.
Since the order is under midnight, it is impossible to receive the courier in the early morning, and the customer service is called at 7 o'clock to ask the customer service to cancel the order, the customer service response has been cancelled, please wait for the SMS notification.
Well, I waited patiently, to noon on the mobile phone to see, the order is still in the state is still in the undelivery, immediately contact customer service to ask to cancel the order quickly, customer service reply has been OK.
At 3 p.m., the mobile phone to see the order is still there, no way to contact the customer service again to clearly inform the third call, please cancel the order and notify the seller not to ship!
Customer service at my request to contact the seller on the spot, and told me that the seller is not familiar with the system, to wait for the system to be familiar with the system before the operation to cancel the order.
But clearly tell me that the seller already knows, and you will not be able to ship it.
When I looked at the order on Monday, I was speechless.
Since it is not possible to contact the seller directly, you can only call the customer service again.
The back of the treatment is almost speechless, basically I say a step, customer service then operate.
Orders are still in the state of delivery rejection so far, and are preparing to send again!
Wouldn’t Amazon follow suit?
It doesn't matter if the seller company also receives money and does not follow up.
After the summary, the big money will not be paid in advance, this is too troublesome.
Looks good.
I looked at this camera a long time ago, but because there are some other reasons besides the price, there are no other reasons, so I did not buy it, this time because of the package mail, the price can also be bought.
After buying the others are no problem, that is, when the software connection, how can not connect, my home is TP router, after checking the Internet found that many people have this problem, get more than two hours, a variety of router settings, and finally I use 360 WIFI as a medium to get it, during the millet customer service call, they have no solution to this problem, directly let me contact Amazon after-sales.
Another noteworthy point is that I saw the user's comment on the Internet, the minimum memory card supported by this camera is 8G, and the storage capacity is smaller and cannot be recognized, I hope you pay attention to this.
It can be used to feel it, the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor, the machine has a certain degree of heat, if it has been turned on, it feels that this degree of fever is a little difficult to accept.
To sum up, there are still many shortcomings in this product, and I hope that everyone should be careful when buying.
The reason for giving 3 stars is because this was bought with the first love of life, and I have been in a relationship for nearly 3 years, so I left me last year, until now.
The reason to give 3 stars, because this is bought with the first love of life, now I don't know how much to use, maybe throw it away!
I have been dating for nearly 3 years, so I left me last year, and now I think of her, I want to leave this world with heartache, the first woman in my life, the shadow and heartache of my life, so far has not been able to come out.
When buying this mobile phone, think about the two feelings at that time, or can work together, but now it is unbearable to look back, life may be like this, some people do not want to meet for a lifetime, some things do not want to know for a lifetime, but what is the way?
How many times as I saw the Samsung mobile phone, the mind thought of her, that kind of pain followed by the whole body, I never willing to use more than 2,000 yuan of mobile phone, but when I bought her, I did not hesitate, no one is good, but one day when she changed her heart, all the vows of the mountains will disappear.
Fine products in domestic brands
Huawei is a boutique in the national goods.
Low-key boss and enterprise, relying on technology and quality to win customers to win, which is very different from the current business culture of increasing popularity by advertising!
Companies without strength can't do this at all, and they don't dare to do it!
That’s why I chose HUAWEI.
It took me more than six months to buy it, and it always felt good, very good.
The reason why I didn't give a full score is because there was a lack of positioning when I used it for offline navigation, and I didn't find out the reason in the end, and it was good at other times.
And its online input destination, after the search automatically designed the route, after leaving the wifi departure, its automatic offline navigation function is very practical, do not run traffic, it directly with the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation, very good!
Sony Law.
Sony's low-end machine, the design is still full, and the price is cheap, the screen is large enough, the endurance of the first-class rod, to the elderly to use is very appropriate.
Although the time has passed for a long time, there is still nothing wrong with this machine.
But because my Z2 was decentralized, the phone also completed its mission.
