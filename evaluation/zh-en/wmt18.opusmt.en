Last week, there was a temporary suspension of the play " American private room food ", which unexpectedly triggered a lively debate about the counterfeiting of national production.
Civil rights groups have issued travel warnings against Missouri.
As a result of Missouri's discriminatory policies and racist attacks, the American Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued travel warnings to colored populations preparing to travel to Missouri.
“As called in the NAACP Missouri Travel Consultation, which came into effect on 28 August 2017, all African-American travellers, tourists and Missouri travelling in Missouri should pay particular attention and be extremely cautious in the light of the recent series of suspicious racial incidents in Missouri, I would like to inform you that the group's statement states”.
NAACP noted that the recent adoption of a Missouri law made it more difficult for people to win discrimination suits and that the State's enforcement of laws targeted minority groups to some extent, prompting the organization to issue travel warnings.
Violations of the rights of citizens are happening to people.
They were questioned by parking and beaten or killed because of their skin colour, “Missuri NAACP President Rod Chapel told The Kansas City Star.
“We have received an unprecedented number of complaints.”
This was the first such warning issued by the organization against a state in the United States.
The organization cited the racial defamation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of a black male, Tori Sanders, 28 years old, in Tennessee.
Earlier this year, Saunders died under suspicious circumstances. He spent fuel fuel while travelling in Missouri and was detained without charge by the Missouri police.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by the Office of the Attorney-General of Missouri indicated that “Black drivers in the State are 75 per cent more likely to be stopped and examined than whites”.
Chapel said: “The consultation was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri.”
“People need to be prepared to travel to Missouri with bail or to let relatives know that they are travelling within the state”.
According to the latest data from the FBI hate crime reporting programme, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; according to the crime volume, the state ranked 16th in the country.
Travel warnings were also a response to the new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to prosecute businesses that discriminated against housing or employment.
Prior to the adoption of immigration law enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to detain immigration offenders, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) indicated that it would increase the number of racial litigations and issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the United States Government against other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have adopted this approach in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
After the “Golden Age” of the 2015 surge, the overall film market entered a cooling period in 2016, and the ability to break through last year's $4,069 billion gross house performance became a suspense.
According to data published by the National Statistical Office, in October the prices of the new and second-hand houses in Beijing fell by only 0.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent.

BBC called Beijing the most exciting city: to make the foreigners feel “living in a new era”.
According to the English media, on 18 January, Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly becoming today's modern city of charm.
The Chinese capital, which has an alarmingly fast Internet, has sophisticated technologies such as face-to-face recognition software, has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has unmatched internationalized energy, and it is one of the most exciting cities for a foreign country rich in exploration.
According to the BBC website on January 16, German expatriate Clemens Sethi says, “If I succeed there, I will succeed anywhere in the future.” He quotes a singer, Frank Sinatra, who sings the words of New York City.
Seth, who is the creative director of Traveler Archives, says, “If Sinatra survives today, he will probably sing about a city like Beijing.” He says, living in this city will make you feel like a “new age” and always keep up with the tide.
Simon Norton, who is home in England but has recently lived in Beijing, wrote on his personal blog website, 4 Corners7 Seas: "People generally have a feeling that they are at the centre of something big, and it's hard to say, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it looks like, and they want to see it with their own eyes."
It was reported that the city's high-quality and high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment made daily life easier than ever before.
Andy Peña Fuert, from Manila, who is currently the Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Beijing Children's Web site, says: “Beijing is rapidly turning into a cashless society, where the Internet integrates traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions.”
However, reports indicate that smart phones are only the beginning of Beijing's technological ambitions, that facial recognition software has become widely available, and that many mobile phone applications use this technology for bank transfers and payments, for access to apartments and offices, and even for verification of the identity of network drivers.
Beijing has also recently announced plans to invest 13.8 billion yuan in the construction of an artificial smart technology park, where more than 400 enterprises will be established and will focus on the development of various artificial intelligence technologies, from biometrics to autopilot.
Food is also at the core of many major festivals in China over the years, which are celebrated by foreigners. Spring is one of the most important social and economic festivals and one of the most easy days for foreigners to participate.
Sethi said, “I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year, cleaning their apartments and putting a new year's blessing on their doorsteps are as important as the Red Spring League. On New Year's Eve, all family members have to come together to eat a great meal, and then wait until midnight and greet the New Year with a radiant flame. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and family is a real opportunity for integration.”
It was reported that the number of foreigners in Beijing was large and growing, but the language barriers in China and the ease of communication among the diaspora could easily be used as a pretext for their incomplete integration into local cultures.
“Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but they have had little experience with their host countries. If your initial attempts to reach out to the Chinese have not been successful, then it is easy for you to feel more comfortable with other foreigners.
In these so-called “foreign bubbles” (“foreign bubbles” are those in which foreigners mix only among foreigners and do not touch local people and local culture — translaters note), foreigners congregate in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and friends only foreigners.
The simplest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin — which is simpler than one might imagine.
Seth said, “The Chinese private classes of one or two hours a week, or the introductory radio drama, should suit everyone's busy schedule.”
Even a few classic short sentences can help with shopping, ordering meals in restaurants or chatting in taxis.
It has been reported that persistent air pollution is also a fact of daily life, although in recent years the Government has made efforts to contain some problems.
Residents stressed the importance of outdoor activities during the often lighter warm months of pollution, using the blue days as an opportunity to tangle in long-standing alleys or to explore popular solar parks.
According to Norton, “Beijing is the Chinese city that can find the most things on the surface, and you can find great artistic and musical activities, angry night life, historical wonders, super-modern commercial zones and ancient alleys”.
The report argues that the role of ageing as an impediment to the growth of human capital is increasingly evident, particularly in the north-east, where ageing contributes to human capital growth at an average annual rate of -1.28 per cent.
He noted that the risks of cross-border capital flows were currently manageable and that the underlying factors underpinning the balance of payments remained long-term.
On December 17th, the China-China-News-China World Summit Forum on the Restoration and Conservation of Chinese Ancient Books, 2016, was opened at the People's University of China on December 17th.
In April this year, the European Commission accused Google of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre-package software such as Google Search and Chrome Browser, otherwise they would not be allowed to use other Google applications.
The EU Commission considered this to be detrimental to the interests of consumers and an impediment to competition.
EU regulators initially requested Google to respond by 27 July.
If an anti-monopoly charge were to be found, Google would face a fine of up to 10 per cent of its global revenue, amounting to approximately $7.4 billion.
Google has not yet commented on this immediately.
Google is also being investigated by the European Union for favouring home shopping services in search results.
Zhang Yuning's legacy is solid, and it can be said that it was not by chance that he “stepped” from the youth to the Olympics, and that his leap to growth was still surprising.
A picture of Bitcoin's legal status around the world.
Summary: In addition to the price retrenchment that is naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the collapse of the current round of digital currency is also linked to the “hosting enemy” - regulatory risk.
From visual maps, Eastern countries have a more conservative attitude than the West, countries with global dominance are still looking at digital monetary legitimacy and represent a “black swan risk” that remains high.
*This is from Wall Street (Web ID:walltreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more excellent information, please visit Walltreetcn.com or download the Wall Street APP.*
With the rise of regulatory storms in key Bitcoin markets such as China, the Republic of Korea and the European Union, the global digital currency headed by Bitcoin has been bled out since this week, with the price of bitcoin falling by $10,000 on Tuesday and the largest single-day fall in three years.
In addition to the price reversals that are naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the fall in the current round of digital currency is also related to the constant “hosting enemy” - regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, the big visual data site HowMuch.net has produced a map showing the legitimacy and degree of regulation of Bitcoin in countries across the globe.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legitimate market of bitcoin; orange yellow represents the neutral market, although it has not publicly legalized bitcoin status, but there are no major restrictions on its use; light pink represents the restricted market, where local governments try to use digital currency through red-line policies or regulation; dark pink represents the country defined as illegal; grey is the country that has not yet been evaluated.
(The above figure is drawn by the HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15)
According to the article, the traditional attitude of Eastern countries of Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West, as can be seen from the green mass distribution in Central Africa.
Russia is currently the largest country to define Bitcoin as illegal; China is one of the largest restricted markets in Bitcoin; and India is one of the largest countries in which Bitcoin has not yet been evaluated and has not yet introduced relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of bitcoin, i.e. the more concentrated distribution of green pieces.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America are clearly divided among them, with a more mixed distribution of coloured matter in the above-mentioned regions.
Of these, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil are legitimate bitcoin markets, and Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bolivia have some restrictions on their trade and use, while more Latin American countries have yet to make a sound.
Combined with the above data, a total of 99 (or 40 per cent) of the 246 countries surveyed globally have unrestricted transactions and use of bitcoin, i.e., green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3 per cent) were restricted markets (light pink), 10 countries (or 4 per cent) defined Bitcoin as illegal (deep pink) and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) did not treat digital currency information more (grey).
This suggests that countries that make up the global majority (53 per cent, more than half) are still waiting to see the legitimacy of the digital currency headed by bitcoin within their borders, and that the “black swan risk” of bitcoin remains significant, as some of them may eventually take legislative decisions to limit the digital currency.
According to the article, the emerging category of digital currencies is not fully understood by global regulators and may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made a pronouncement.
Although the “human face” of Bitcoin has grown exponentially since last year, it does not represent the interest of all countries, and there may be concerns in some countries about the threat of local French currency or, more importantly, about the use of digital currency by criminal organizations.
Wall Street interviews have written a detailed summary of international regulatory news against Bitcoin since last week, including China’s launch of a centralized online service platform and mobile App against off-site exchanges, South Korea’s ongoing consideration of closing the digital currency exchange, the EU’s view that bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of “compensation for the loss of blood”.
The editor-in-chief of Wall Street selects the Year of Digital Currency as the year of the global central bank's digital currency, either from the point of view of regulation, acceptance/criticisation or adoption.
Major Powers such as Russia have criticized the legitimacy of Bitcoin, in fact in order to give way to the official issuance of digital currency.
Xinhua Society in Madrid on 8 January (Reporter Xie Woo-ji), Barcelona's New Aid Kutinio 8, first time in a pizza shirt in Nokamp.
Cutinio passed a medical check-up in Bassa that morning and signed a contract with Basa President Bartoméu, which will expire in the summer of 2023.
He then appeared as a Bassa player in front of nearly 7,000 fans in Nokamp.
According to the Spanish media, Curtiño's total transfer of contributions, amounting to Euro160 million (approximately RMB 7.77 (Euro 1)), is the first price for the Basa Club and the history of Nishika.
As Kutinio is still wounded, he will have to rest for nearly 20 days before he will be able to meet himself in a virgin show in a pizzard.
What else is sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most definite sign of regime change was when they started attacking the statue.
Americans, like anyone else, agree with this. So, in 2003, Saddam Hussein of Paradise Square in Baghdad was deliberately pushed down.
Stephen Miller, one of the key thinkers of the Trump government, must have known what would happen to his symbolic ax to the Statue of Liberty, when Jim Acosta, of CNN, argued fiercely about the President's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, a group of cruise ship owners and liberal followers would surely eat him alive.
But he did attack the meaning of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was carved on the base in 1903 (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller denounced Acosta, “I do not want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America's freedom to light the world...
The poem to which you refer, which was added later, and which is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
In fact, Miller was right, but, as he himself said, this is not really about history.
This relates to the modern echo of the language of Lazarus, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: “Your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowd of people who want to breathe freely,/the suffering reject your crowded beaches”.
There is no “rejection of the suffering” at a time when our screen has become more dazzling.
Miller had not worked on literary reviews, and he had made it clear that those people would not be welcome in the United States of America in the Trump era.
This conflict over the meaning of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is in fact a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, as well as her friends, who engraved her poems on the ground after her death, are well aware of the highly political nature of the acts in which they are participating.
The purpose of the sculpture was to express the link between French and American republicanism through the ancient classic metaphors of the femininity of the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poem, the image of a woman was no longer abstract, and she had to speak.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of exile.
The poem, combined with the painting, was a successful feminist coup d'état and a devastating blow to United States indigenousism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers always wanted it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker, Rush Limbagh, a temporary Baptist from Trump, argued in 2010 that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, but that he was an early neo-conservative who brought America's flame of wisdom to a foolish world: “The Statue of Liberty has no way to go.
Her intention was to bring the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not the path of America.”
What is unusual is that Limbo is actually touched by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive angle.
The most imaginative thing about Lazarus is to be able to see it. When weary, poor but hopeful people can see it on the deck after a long and often terrible journey.
On the face of it, this relates to the world view of those who seek refuge and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveys to them and requires the hope and welcome they hear.
Of course, that is not the point that Miller and Trump wanted to acknowledge.
Their torches are not intended to light the way, but to ignite hatred from their sole source of strength.
In 2006, Sacap became the first Chinese to sign a contract with Universal British Headquarters with a unique musical style.
The 2017 World Cup: Neil Black highly praises Scotland's team in the British National Team.
Eilidh Doyle remembered that there were only two Scottishs in the British National Team at the time.
Neil Black, Executive Director of the Athletics Association of England, said that a 16-strong Scottish team from the World Cup team would make a huge contribution to the National Team.
The number of Scottish field athletes selected for the London Athletics World Cup in 2017, which opened on Friday, was the highest in history.
Black believes that “Scotland is making extraordinary progress”, from which UK trackers must learn.
“We accept and try to understand this, and we will persevere until we succeed”, Black says.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute. They think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish trackers think this has something to do with what they're doing.
The Athletic Association of England considers this to be relevant to their actions.
Even street people think so.
Whatever it is, it's brilliant."
A number of Scottish trackers are contestants, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be 5,000 metres below Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle is selected by the team as team leader.
“Erid is a little modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible." Blake said.
“Many trackers, whether Scottish or not, or wherever they live or train, walk out of the house with pride and energy.
Eric's natural passion and true feelings are very good."
The winner of the Commonwealth silver medal, who will be participating in the 400-metre cross-column contest in his fifth World Cup, says that there are 16 Scottishs in the British National Team, which is “unbelievable”.
Previously, the number of Scottish track and track athletes participating in the World Series was up to seven, i.e. in 1983 and 2015.
Midrunner Muir is a leader. She has made five British records and two European records over the past year.
She's going to the 1,500-metre and 5,000-metre project competitions.
Chris O'Hare, who took part in the 1500-metres contest, was another notable Scottish player who had done well in the season and won the pre-selections and the annual Olympics in British countries.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first World Championship, when the only other Scottish on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said that she was very proud that so many of her compatriots would not only join the team, but also, in some cases, challenge the medal and enter the finals.
“The special thing about being a captain of the national team is that it was elected by the other members of the national team. So, knowing that your teammates voted for your extraordinary achievement, it was a great honour for me anyway”, she added.
“Of course, I am very proud of all the Scottish team members.
This is just an indication of how far we have gone.
And they're all old track and track athletes here, track and track athletes who are about to move towards the purposes of the Medal.
What did my captain say?
Well, I think it's very good.
I have just referred to the fact that, under these circumstances, we are very fortunate because we hold the World Cup in the main arena.
That is why it is really important that we grow up with home support and by returning to the Olympic stadium.
I will be given a second chance to compete, and there will be a wonderful atmosphere.”
The total number of employees in 2016 was 180,000 and the cost of employees amounted to $121.8 billion, an increase of 21 per cent over the same period.
Curb critics on Facebook: if you can't stand the blame of voters, don't run for office.
Our Father is aware of the bad media.
The Americans loved Washington, but shortly after that, major newspapers began to speak out against him, from domestic policy to political principles.
He was angry at those criticisms, no doubt.
But he did not silence those critics.
Because, as early as 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of expression is denied — we will be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance”.
This reminds me of the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff blocked and deleted at least 450 people’s posts because they had published their views on his official Facebook home page.
The American Civil Liberties Union instituted proceedings against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff described the lawsuit as hasty and the online coverage was full of their fierce resistance: “Who cares?”
A lot of people say, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
This is particularly important because people like Hogan are confronted.
It was a Republican who served as governor in a state with a democratic majority, and he was surprisingly popular.
Of the country's 50 governors, he was ranked second in good ratings.
Hogan is not a reactionary maniac.
He has smooth control of Maryland and strictly abides by the rules.
He was also very good at using Facebook as the main way to communicate with voters, showing his bald head after chemotherapy for the first time on the home page.
So the people who came to the governor’s home page for comment are completely unnecessary, and ultimately dangerous. The home page is a public forum, an official management platform for public tax-supporting employees.
In an interview with the Washington Post, the spokesperson for Hogan, Amelia Shas, defended the Governor's behaviour by saying that she believed that she was merely trying to shield their comments from restraint.
But they were too hasty to describe it as a flood beast or cynic overflowing the network.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with people who had been blocked by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their chosen leaders: they are teachers, small business owners and priests, not flood beasts.
They have often said that their comments are profound, respectful and undisguised.
In his post, the priest quoted the Bible and called on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Lamani, a barrister in Boye, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked about hate crimes.
As she wrote in the news story review section of the Washington Post, “I am very polite to comment that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes and other recent news incidents.
Nor do I like to have a group of people comment on the same subject, because they are simply ignored by those who think that they are so-called people's minds, rather than treating them as citizens who are worried about their country.”
In the view of others, what the governor's staff termed “intense garbage information bombing” may be “persistent”.
The Facebook era has made it easy to modify a message by blocking a critics or removing a negative comment.
It was also much cleaner than in the past, when the same effect required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical comments or to arrest or silence protesters.
But that is what is happening now, just at the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for scolding others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was being sued by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
Last week there was a landmark ruling in the state of Virginia on such issues.
According to the District Judge of Alexandria, James c. Cacharis, in the United States, the Chairman of the Lawden County Supervisory Board blocked voters from her Facebook page in violation of the First Amendment.
The state governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevan (R), was also targeted by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet had a similar impact.
The number of newspapers had quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters criticised his leadership.
And even then, Washington had an anonymous flood beast against him.
The pseudonyms of Yulikla, Valerius, Belisaeu and Pozius were used to write to newspapers to criticize Washington's decision-making harshly.
According to historical documentation collected by the George Washington newspaper online project, his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his attitude to the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America, signed with the United Kingdom.
But he didn't snort them.
Freedom of expression, dissent and speech are the foundations of this country.
And true leaders need to accept that.
The wiring of the city's wind and motion is holding on to people's sensitive nerves.
Restricted purchases are a hard bar for many urban property regulation policies.
(a) In May 2017, Jinan introduced a six-month period in which undergraduates would be eligible for equal access to housing for residents of the local permanent household;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy whereby university students could be registered within three years of graduation on the basis of a diploma and an employment certificate.
The policy was then added to the official statement that “university students can buy a house at less than 20 per cent of the market price”;
In July, Chengdu introduced the requirement that young people with undergraduate and higher degrees in field universities could apply for a residence permit.
In addition, cities or regions such as Kunshan and Shanghai have introduced “brain-in-kind” policies that lower the threshold for home-buying.
Zhang Xuan believes that it is in fact the cities that compete for and retain people, especially people, that are competitive, which is the most important aspect of these real estate policies.
It has even been argued that this means that the time has come for the “restrictive purchase” of the building city to be cancelled.
The director said on that day that the film was planned for a very long time, that the first script was adapted in 1999 and that he was even looking for the Golden City Wu to play Yan XIII.
Ronan Lafferty looks forward to enjoying his home at the Renaissance Club.
The East Loosean Renaissance Club holds the 25th Scottish Open Springs, and Ronan Lafferty, the former European champion, will enjoy coming home in the next three days.
This Northerner led the next-door Archerfield Links to the finals last year, but eventually lost to Paul Iles. He now works for the new conference, representing Jerry Salvatti, founder and CEO of the club, as an ambassador for the race.
Lafferty said, “I witnessed the establishment of the Renaissance Club, and we will witness its glory through this game.
The athletes will see the best face and state of the field.
Jerry built this place like nothing else.
He was a keen supporter of the game and was very proud of what had been achieved here.
This is the best stage to show the field."
The Englishman, Ils, looks forward to the first crown, although in 32 years of his career, he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
This Southport player says, "This is really special.
I didn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was cancelled the second year I won.
It's amazing to be here.
It's wonderful to play golf here.
Last year's memory came to light, and for me and my wife Sharon, the victory last year was of special significance to us.
It's really a special memory, and we'll always remember it."
Returning to their homeland was Gary Orr, who had just turned 50 earlier this year and then participated in the European Youth Tour.
This is his first competition in Scotland since the 2013 Scottish Golf Open.
“There will always be more meaning in homecoming games,” said Helensburger Orr.
You want to be good; but you can feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed being able to play again. I've been playing golf.
I am satisfied with the current state of affairs.”
The three-member group on the scene was the former winner of the master race, Ian Woosnan, and the champions of the Evergreen race, Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNuit.
There were six Scottish athletes on the scene, two of whom were Sam Torrance, Al and former Leader of the Leed Cup, and four of whom were Andrew Odcohn, Stephen McCallyst, Bill Langmue and Ross Drummond.
Entry is free of charge and parking fees are £5 per vehicle for one passenger and £10 per vehicle for two or more passengers.

In August, the Director-General of the Environment Inspectorate of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China introduced in Beijing a total of 57 cases of daily and continuous punishment throughout the country. The new amendment to the Environmental Protection Law, introduced earlier this year, significantly added to China's environmental enforcement efforts.
At present, environmental protection agencies in all parts of China can use such punishments as continuous daily punishment, seizure, lock-down and transfer to administrative detention to detect and punish environmental offences and cooperate with the judicial authorities to punish them.
According to the head of Zou, in August, a total of 335 seizure and seizure cases were carried out throughout China; 177 were restricted or suspended; 189 were transferred to administrative detention; and 166 were transferred to suspected environmental pollution offences.
Of these, Henan has imposed seven consecutive daily punishments, and China is now moving from end-of-pipe control to full-scale environmental pollution control.
Despite the downward pressure on the economy, China's Ministry of the Environment had previously made it clear that China should properly address the positioning of environmental protection in economic development and enhance the “green force” and that the more the economy grows, the less the environment can be relaxed and the better the role of environmental protection for the economy can be optimized.
Not the highest, but the higher, and the high value of ownership on the path to innovation cannot be stopped at all in Guizhou.
On 9 January, A's “Sharelord” in Guizhou once again made an all-time high of $782.52, with a total market value of $983 billion and just one step away from the trillion market value.
The guidance price of $1499 increased by $200 over the previous retail price of $1,299.
An announcement was issued on 28 December 2017 in Maotai, Guizhou, stating that, as a result of the study, the prices of the taupulega products had been adjusted appropriately since 2018, with an average increase of about 18 per cent.
This price increase has stimulated a sharp rise in market prices in Maotai, Guizhou, where according to the Beijing Morning Reporters, the price has risen by more than 14 per cent since the announcement of eight transactions in Maotai, Guizhou, where prices have increased by more than 95 dollars.
Statistics show that in 2017 the province of Guizhou had a total production value of 950 billion yuan in the first three quarters and that the market value of Maotai had pushed the province's GDP far behind in the first three quarters of the year.
Under the leadership of Maotai, white wine-listed companies have opened up the price-fixing rhythm to reap the dividends of rising consumption.
Since 2017, the stock prices of most of the companies listed on the white wine market have continued to increase significantly, with the shares of the wells, the five grains, the Shanxi wine and the Kuotai in Guizhou having more than doubled.

This year, they're working on the intellectual management of rural sewage.
How to manage it well is, in fact, a very serious challenge.
The Eco-Environment Institute of the Qinghua Triangular Institute of Zhejiang is located in the area where the spirit of the Red Ship originates.
From nothing more than a decade ago to the present.
The Qinghua Triangular Institute of Zhejiang has developed into a regional innovation gathering of nearly 400 overseas students living in Zhejiang, with three national priority innovation platforms.
The spirit of the red ship is a force that we must follow and understand, and innovation is difficult.
Every innovation in this.
You're going to have to hold on at this stage, and you're going on and on and on.
So it was the people who came to the door, and now they're coming up and down, so that's it.
Do something real for the people.

In recent days, the IU-China has organized a group of 19 representatives of the arts and arts community and prominent artists to travel to Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Shanghai, Guangdong and Guizhou to lecture on the spirit of the 19th.
They went to grass-roots mass art galleries in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Gansu, local campuses and some high schools, where they carried out a new cultural mission to the nineteen spiritual Chinese artists.
I'm deeply proud and happy, and I'm willing to sink again and write more about the fate of the big-time characters.
What kind of advice can you have on this grass-roots artistic development?
There's a lot of popular literature going on right now. It's a little bit popular.
It's a time-honoured masterpiece that is constantly being introduced.
It should take root at the grass roots, go deep into life, and then produce works with a certain cultural thickness, positive upwards and long-standing artistic charms.

Our first star in the space science satellite series, and also the world's first dark matter particle detection satellite, Goku.
Over the past two years of on-orbit operation, four scans of the entire sky zone were conducted, detecting more than 35 billion high-energy particles and obtaining the most accurate particles in the world.
This result has been published in the international academic journal Nature.

The significance of this research is multiple, and most importantly it shows that Chinese scientists use the cutting edge of technology.
The ability to manufacture scientific instruments to detect a very difficult scientific problem.
It's been the last century, and there's a lot of memories of Chinese toilets.
And more and more human design.

Not just to change the hardware, but to keep up with the software.
The tourism sector requires toilets in the landscape area to be equipped with toilet paper and hand-washing fluids.
But in some parts of the world,
Is it because of the uncivilizational behavior of a certain individual, that this civilian service is stopped?
The local administrators have made their choice.
On the one hand, savings are being promoted through civilizational alerts and, on the other hand, technological innovation is taking place.
Public toilets in Jiangsu Namking, Cebu, etc.
You'll get a free toilet paper for three seconds, but it'll take another 10 minutes to get a double.
Avoiding the misuse of public resources
It's a habit that some tourists do want to take the paper back, but on the other hand, we have to reflect.
Isn't the next toilet we're going to have no paper, so that's what we're focusing on in the new three-year plan?
We need to fix this imbalance that's not enough.
To push the toilet revolution deeper is to think more about what people think.
A third toilet must be available to facilitate family escorting the elderly and children to the toilet.
We're bringing the baby. We're embarrassed to be in the men's room.
It's like a little awkward when a girl's room is so small, that the board is very comfortable and it's very convenient for us to take the kids with us.
When people feel civilization, they become the builders of civilization. In the countryside, villagers from the Guangxi River pool are building new flush toilets in their homes.
Much has been achieved, and the active promotion of the toilet revolution will not only help people to stay away from disease, but will also lead to economic development to narrow regional development gaps.
The issue of the toilet is a public issue and a node for the development of social issues.
It is a national civilizational project that guides the layout from a national point of view and then addresses small social problems with varying degrees of participation.
That's how we complete all our shorts.

Strength and dedication are the spiritual driving forces that inspire our party's tenacity and growing strength, and are a valuable spiritual asset for our party to prosper and govern.
It's also the strength of the new era to uphold and develop China's special socialism.
It is important to combine the promotion of the spirit of the Red Ship with the promotion of the Party's 19th spiritual learning campaign, and to take a firm position on Xi Jinping's idea of socialism in China's new era.
I'm learning to do my best.
There is a need to deepen the dissemination of learning about the spirit of the revolution, such as the spirit of the Red Ship, and to develop a variety of educational practices that will lead people actively to the great practice of socialism of the Chinese character of the new era.
Prior to the symposium, participants met with the South Lake Red Ship.
Visited the South Lake Revolution Memorial.
On the same day, the Office of the Central Military Commission (CMC) issued a circular for Xi Jinping on the management of volume II of the administration of the State.
The entire army and the armed forces were asked to learn more about Xi Jinping’s new era of Chinese-style socialism, and to learn to promote the 19th party’s spirit.
The Circular states that learning to implement Xi Jinping's socialist philosophy of Chinese identity in the new era is a major political task for the whole party in the current and future period
Xi Jinping’s second and first editions of Xi’s National Governance are to be published at all levels with a high degree of political self-consciousness and at the forefront of the standards.
Volume 1 of Xi Jinping's talk of governance as an in-depth study of Xi Jinping's Chinese-style socialist ideology and the spirit of the Party
Unite to the party's 19th most decisive decision-making.
Poverty and death in Phnom Penh, Indonesia
Baddina Dejay doesn't cook with stoves.
She doesn't even use pots.
Her cabin is located in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai district, Papua, Indonesia, where the housewife usually simply puts a potato — referred to by the local people as “nota” — directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the burnt potato was taken out by an unwashed hand and eaten by the swallowing.
Daiji sits on the mud — she has no furniture, and this is where she does her daily household chores, such as washing clothes and washing water, which is so thick that it comes from nearby swamps.
There's a bucket in a room without a roof. It's an outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of the four wives of her husband, so she was not assigned to the field.
Polygamy is common here.
It is of course dangerous to work late: most of the men in the village are unemployed and many are drunk and there are many soldiers here.
She said, "No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.."
This is a rare glimpse of everyday life in the highlands of Papua, once a colony of the Netherlands, incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, which was also controversial when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands in front of the army occupying the area.
The current campaign, which is strongly for independence and opposition to Dutch rule, soon again targets the Jakarta Government, which exercises high-handed rule over the region and isolates foreign journalists and defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is remote and empty; it takes 90 minutes from the provincial capital, Jayapula, to fly to Nabyre and then rent a car for five hours, and rides all the way across the river's stomach.
There's no public transport here.
In this town of approximately 19,000 people, outside the cabin is surrounded by bamboo fences, and the wrinkled iron-coated roofs are all kinds of rusty shades.
Few Indonesians came, let alone journalists, and few foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian preacher, Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here as well.
Djay says, "We're not used to these clothes." She means her beautiful handkerchief, her dark shirt and her fancy half skirt.
"We used to cover our bodies with leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and is the region with the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also Indonesia's gold continent.
Paniai County is located in highlands, approximately the same size as New Jersey, with 153,000 people. The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Glasberg, is only 60 miles from here, owned by Philip McMollan Copper, based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Felipe mined around $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, the timber resources in Papua are abundant, with an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, these vast resources are also the source of the tragedy of the Papuans, and that is why the strong military power of Indonesia has been able to keep them down.
According to a 2005 New York Times survey report, Philips paid nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004 to local military personnel and troops, up to $150,000 for one official alone.
The growing claim of the Papuans to independence threatens the gold owner and as a result they have been subjected to cruel treatment.
According to defenders, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the highlands of the Papua tribe in the 1970s escalated into genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Brisbane General diocese, " We will lose everything ", contains evidence of the perfidence of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture — another reported that rape and electrocution were particularly widespread — and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
According to Human Rights Watch Indonesian researcher Andrias Harsono, “violence occurs every day, and it is therefore difficult to calculate the number of victims”.
The repression began when the resources of Papua brought in large numbers of immigrants outside Indonesia.
Eighty-three per cent of the 3.5 million people in the province are Christians, but the demographic structure of Muslim economic migrants has changed since they arrived from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Javan snack stand sells a combination of fried chicken and vegetables, with peanut butter.
The locals struggled.
The 24-year-old Paniai native, Abos Yu, moved to Chayapura, the provincial capital, to find work, explaining that “those immigrants began selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans.
This has caused the local Papuans — the mama-mama — to lose their market.”
During his 2014 campaign, Indonesian President Zorko Widodo, commonly called him Zokovi, vowed to address the inequality and abuse of power in Papua.
The carpenter's road to the Jakarta presidential palace was supported by 27 out of 29 districts, including Paniai.
But there has been no change in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
You said, "We're heartbroken, and in 2014 we voted for Zorkovi, hoping that he will live up to our wishes and restore justice."
In fact, just two months after Zokovi took office in October, Paniai had the worst nightmare ever.
On December 7, 2014, Enarotali 11 children sang a Christmas hymn in front of the bonfire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly came on a motorcycle.
The frightened kids told them to turn on the headlights.
According to the local pastor, Aveit Tebai, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
The victims and witnesses claimed that the drunken soldiers were chasing the children with their guns.
One of the soldiers then opened fire on the children.
The 16-year-old Yulianus Yemmo was severely beaten and unconscious.
A few hours later, a fire broke out in the nearby government agency, the Electoral Commission building, and the incident escalated the following day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of local police stations and military command centres to demand justice.
With ritual bows, they danced the waita of the Babouya Mee Pago tribe -- running around and imitating birds.
Some of the protesters started throwing stones at regular military checkpoints.
According to an official document seen in Times magazine, when the mood continued to intensify, soldiers were ordered by internal radio: “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot immediately.” This document was not made available to the local media.
The young Jeremiah Kayamu, the leader of the Enerotali Kego Koto neighbourhood, felt the imminent danger and appealed to the crowd to calm down and beg them to return home.
But no one's in the mood to listen to him.
He stood on the porch of his beautiful cabin and told Time magazine, "When I turned back, my left wrist was suddenly shot."
Kayamu still does not know who fired the gun, but he said that the bullets came from among the assembled soldiers.
And he said, "It was crowded and they fired a lot of shots."
According to the cousin of a local citizen, Alfyous Yur, he witnessed the shooting and saw that Alfyous Yur was shot three times in his body.
Juhanes sadly told Time magazine, "I ran over to check his body to see if he was him.
I found him dead and I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yoji Mende, told journalists that his subordinates were only at the “protective” police station, which had been attacked.
In 2015, Puggio Sulistio, police spokesperson and police chief of police in Papua, said, “When there are threats to kill us, we must defend ourselves.
It's a matter of life and death."
According to HRW, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killing the following day spread slowly only in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi gave a well-spoken speech in Jayapura, expressing deep sympathy to the families of the victims and vowing to address the abuse of power inherited from the history of Papua.
He said, “I hope that this case will be settled as soon as possible so that it will not happen again in the future”.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Valando, stated that he would establish a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuse for the escape is almost instantaneous.
He said, “Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but that still requires a process.”
Then, on 5 June, in Jakarta, during a conversation with the Times magazine, Vilando went back and said that he had no plans to establish a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, “everything will be settled in accordance with the law”.
The United Nations had filed a complaint against Virando for “crimes against human rights” in the 1999 bloody independence vote in East Timor, but he said that 11 cases of human rights violations in the Papua area had been resolved, including the Panié incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai incident were scorned by these statements.
Juhanes said, “I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed at all”.
Years later, he said, "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I fear being arrested and shot by the army.”
His brother Yukabus also felt that the people of Paniai were afraid to talk about the incident.
He stated that he had been beaten by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
He said, "When the body was buried, the military came to me."
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police opened fire on villagers in Deyai district, Paniai neighbourhood.
A construction company manager refused to assist in transporting a unconscious man to the hospital, and a clash resulted in the death of one man and the wounding of 17 others, including children.
A 24-year-old man, Lavianus Dowu, drowned while fishing near the river and died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company's field office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at the police, so the police fired warning shots.
However, the mobile anti-riot forces (the Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and one person was killed.
Dominiya Bady, aged, told Time magazine that “we were all panicking and now are afraid that they will retaliate.” He lived near the hospital when he witnessed the wounded being rushed into the hospital.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deyai Parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and for the mobile anti-riot forces to be withdrawn from the area.
Panai has always been a land of right and wrong for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has contributed to the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which are scattered in the central highlands of Paniai.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the Papuans by spreading its attacks and abducting Indonesian soldiers by surprise.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Paniai, including Tadius Yuji and Daniel Yodas Kogoa.
As a result, in recent years, thousands of Pani have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military under the guise of “preservation of national sovereignty”.
Some never showed up again.
In the eyes of Papuans, Paniai is a “forgotten place of tragedy”.
Poverty breeds discontent.
Enarotali sells rice that is poor, and the locals can't afford it.
The bread is so far away.
The people here grow what they can eat: mainly potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and each woman can take care of four or five pieces of sweet potatoes.
They usually use the bulk of the harvest for re-authorization and the rest for sale on the local market.
Ten potatoes worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has spread among the local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased significantly since the opening of new routes to the airport at Nabyre.
The few jobs available are usually in the hands of better educated and richer migrants.
Papuans have little money or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
The Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council, John Gobai, said, “Youth do not want to stay in this village because there is no job or money”.
Papua is isolated from the world.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Lonchen were expelled from Papua because they “did not cooperate with the agencies concerned”, even though they had rarely obtained authorization to film.
According to Felim Kane, Deputy Director of Asia, Human Rights Watch, the electoral oath to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development was not met.
In one statement, he stated that “if foreign journalists try to cover the disgruntled provinces of Papua and West Papua in the easternmost parts of Indonesia, there is a new risk that they will be denied visas and blacklisted”.
The absence of media oversight means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely confined to neighbouring countries in Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “all types of widespread human rights violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Almanata Nassir, who had no interest in the group's allegations, told journalists in Jakarta that “the democratic institutions in Indonesia and the freedom of the media make it difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations”.
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention.
According to an informed source, on 4 May, when the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights, Keith Van Bar, led a delegation of officials to Jayapura, the local people broke the silence and cried “We want freedom.” He also attended the meeting, but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans claim that they are unlikely to vote again.
The Chairman of the Tribal Council, Gobai, said that “Zokovi's intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting”.
He wanted to let Zokowi know that the people of Paniai lived not only under the threat of a greedy army but also with nothing, that the region was poorly educated and that public health-care services were scarce.
Gobai said that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, believed that the vote they had cast for Zokovi was a debt that he had to pay.
He said, "They don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting made their last symbolic protest: the body of the victim was buried opposite the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family was killed.
What else can we do?"
On 10 February 2017, the CSRC approved an initial application from Guangdong Sang-Hyun Homes Co. Ltd. and issued a permit to enter the market for a long-term settlement, after having just been approved by IPO for more than 20 days.
According to the industry, with the matchmaking of the home and the succession of the European family, the area of custom-made home, which was already in the air, would shift from competition for products to competition for capital.
At the beginning of the new year, the announcement that a typical representative-brand-based home in the area of customizing the home was about to be placed on the market attracted the attention of the entire household industry.
Reuters, 9 Beijing Time, stated that the release on Tuesday of the first set of auto-drive components developed jointly with Harman International, as well as the information and entertainment solution, was an important initiative for the company to enter the electronic market for military vehicles.
Three star electronics acquired Haman International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Fair (CES) held in Las Vegas this week, Samsung issued vehicle cameras with collision alerts, traffic diversion alerts and cruise control functions, which were developed in cooperation with Haman.
The Samsung project started this year with the delivery of the camera system, which is built on technology such as automatic machine learning and scaling-up.
The three stars also display a “digital cockpit”, which, even if the driver is not the owner of the vehicle, can make the vehicle more personal, as the system allows users to download driver information from mobile devices and clouds.
Tonight, the 20th regular race of the CBA is about to begin, which also means the second half of the CBA tournament in the 2016-2017 season.
The fire has once again swallowed the Tower of Dubai's Torch.
On Friday, a fire broke out in one of the highest residential buildings in the world in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the super-high-rise building, which is 337 metres high, 79 floors tall.
It was the second fire in just two years that swept the high-rise building, and it happened in the sky tower, known as the torch.
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported and no cause of the fire has yet been identified.
“We're sleeping, and then we wake up with a fire alarm and people start screaming.
We run down the stairs, down from 50 floors, it takes about 10 minutes, "A resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Authority, the fire brigade extinguished the fire around 4 p.m. on local time (US$ 00000 Greenwich Standard Time) and is in the process of cooling down the building.
The Government indicated that efforts were being made to provide refuge for those affected.
The accident could rekindle worldwide concerns about the safety of the use of outer-wall materials in high-rise buildings.
A survey carried out by the management of the Ferris Tower following the fire in 2015 found that most of the damaged objects were coated walls for decoration and insulation.
The British police have indicated that they believe that the problems with the insulation and overpanding systems of the Glenfield Building in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire, which killed about 80 people.
The Williams convoy also suggested that Massa might return, although he had announced his retirement.
On 9 January, just one month from the opening of the Ping Chang Winter Olympics in Korea, the atmosphere in the country became stronger as the Olympic fire spreads from the south to the north and preparations intensified.
Korean public opinion expects this long-defeated inter-Korean talks to bring an “egg” to the Ping Chang Winter Olympics in a month's countdown.
On 1 November last year, the Pingchang Winter Olympics holy fire arrived in Korea.
The heat of the fire was reflected directly in the sale of tickets to the Pixen Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the Pixen Winter Olympics ticket sales rate was still at 32 per cent, the Winter Paralympics ticket sales rate was 4.3 per cent, and the low ticket sales rate was once a source of concern for the Pixen Winter Olympics.
But, as Lee Xifan, Chairman of the Panchang Winter Olympic Organizing Committee, recently predicted for journalists, “The Winter Olympics are becoming more and more hot, and it is believed that the sales of tickets will soon improve” with the passage of the Winter Olympic fire across Korea.
According to Korean media reports, as of 3 January, Pingchang Winter Olympics ticket sales had reached 64 per cent, and the Winter Paralympics ticket sales rate had exceeded 50 per cent.
In order to encourage foreigners to go to the Korean Olympics, the Korean Ministry of Justice also announced on 8 that it would extend the stay in Korea for up to 120 days for foreigners visiting Korea to watch the Ping Chang Winter Olympics.
The investigation found that more than one in five American travellers had boarded the plane with prohibited items.
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had boarded the aircraft with illegal items, intentionally or unintentionally, through a United States Transportation and Security Administration checkpoint, and that at least 6 per cent of those passengers had boarded the aircraft unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1 per cent of passengers claimed that they later discovered that they were travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The investigation of more than 1,000 individuals was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc., which also found that young travellers were more likely to be in flagrant disregard of the rules.
19.7 per cent of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately attempted to board TSA prohibited items were millennium generations, compared to less than 15 per cent of the X generation.
The most common items of deliberate pass-through of TSA security officers are food and drinks.
More than 3 per cent admitted to having intentionally carried the blades through security checks, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents indicated that they had intentionally boarded the plane with prohibited drugs.
The company stated that the purpose of the investigation was to find out the number of people who had boarded aircraft by accident and intentionally carrying embargoed goods.
It is not surprising that those most likely to carry embargoed goods through security checks — intentionally or unintentionally — are those who fly most frequently.
However, it noted that the TSA Guide was somewhat complicated and difficult to understand.
It is often uncertain what and how many liquids can be carried.
So it's not surprising that TSA caught the most contraband liquids.
It was once thought that TSA might have used books as an embargo.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry them.
US EPA Prutt changed his mind about Obama's era emissions reduction regulations.
One day after being prosecuted by 15 states, the Director of Environmental Protection, Scott Pruitt, changed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama's era air pollution emissions reduction.
Prute proposed this change, as the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state bodies that regulate the environment than the previous Government.
He did not mention the legal challenges brought by the Federal Court of Appeal against his predecessor.
The controversy focused on setting 1 October as the deadline for states to start meeting the 2015 terrestrial ozone standard.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance for one year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid “disrupting local decision-making or impeding economic growth”.
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Prutt, the State Attorney General of Oklahoma, had long opposed the tightening of environmental regulations.
Since their arrival in Washington, Prute has repeatedly turned to preventing or delaying regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden reverse on Wednesday was one of the most recent legal obstacles to the return of Prute to the agenda.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Director of Environmental Protection had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's requirement that oil and gas companies monitor and mitigate methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Prute proposed a major shift in his attitude towards the ozone standard, expressing the need to strengthen the commitment of the Environmental Protection Agency to work with the states to adopt complex procedures to achieve new standards.
Prute stated that “under the previous government administration, EPA usually did not meet the prescribed deadline and then waited for the radical groups and others to sue and agreed to set a specified timetable by agreement.” He had initiated dozens of prosecutions against EPA in his previous work.
“We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the rules and authorities seriously.”
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that Prutt may again use his “extension authorization and all other legally available authorizations” to ensure that the provisions are consistent with “good policy and best available information”.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for extensive rewriting of ozone layer regulations.
The House Bill approved last month was intended to delay the 2015 rule by at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
The State Attorney of New York, Eric Schneiderman, led the State Union this week to sue the United States Environmental Protection Agency for its intention to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said, "The reverse of the US EPA -- after we filed a lawsuit -- was a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with more than 115 million American communities directly affected by smoke emissions."
The States of California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C., all joined the State of New York in this case.
Ground-based ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants from vehicles, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources to sunlight exposure in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive populations, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Prute for his amazing transformation.
Lori Ann Bird, Biodiversity Center, stated: “It is disturbing that this common sense measure is under great pressure from the heads of the departments that protect the air we need to breathe”.
“We must end our struggle with the Trump Government's ideological movement to cater to polluters and special interest groups.”
In addition to external factors such as the heating of steel, enterprises are also struggling to move towards lower costs.
With the return of large areas of the enterprise, steel prices began to fall.
At present neither the China Steel Association nor the National Statistical Office have published any data on the profits of the iron and steel industry for the month of June.
According to the Beijing Railways Bureau, the spring of the 2017 railway runs from 13 January to 21 February, for a total of 40 days.
My goal is to understand the current state of artificial intelligence — progress we are making far beyond what people expect, but there is still a long way to go.
Yesterday, two parcels of land, located on the hill of Hampshire, entered into a live auction, with a total of 1,845.2 million yuan.
Recently, the Japanese animated " Your Name ", which in Japan was the first film to break 20 billion yen in 15 years after becoming Miyazaki's director, " Thousands and thousands ", took the second place in the ticket house.
Since the second half of 2009, Xiaoshanwood sales have remained high, especially this spring, when Xiaoshan Hsiao Hsiaogi's sales rose again to an all-time high, and prices rose sharply. According to statistics, from January to June of this year Xiaoshan mountains achieved a 48 per cent increase in their sales earnings compared to the same period last year, with the largest increase in nearly 20 years.
The Deputy Director of the Xiao Mountain Forestry Authority, Xi Hae Yong, said that, along with good sales, the production of Xiaoshan Hanaki had also developed more rapidly.
During the past two years, the area of Xiaoshan flowerwood cultivation has been expanded by 30,000 acres, with a total area of 180,000 acres, while at the same time there has been an active out-of-area development, with Xiaoshan seedling farmers establishing 80,000 acres of flowerwood bases throughout the country, an increase of 30,000 acres over 2008.
In parallel with the expansion of the area under cultivation, the quality of seedlings has been improving, the value of nurseries has been increasing, large-scale, high-quality seedlings have been retained and some of them have been sold.
He also warned that, in the face of the current boom, producers should face it with calm and objective analysis, recognizing that the demand for flowers in society will be long-term and increasing, while recognizing that there will be more competition in the market.
On the morning of 13 July Beijing time, the United States company Somaltus filed a suit in the Eastern Texas District Court against Apple for violating a battery technology patent that it had applied for in 2010.
The same patents were used by the company in the past to sue Huasumi, Associatives, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.
The suit alleged that both iPhone 6s and similar apple equipment violated US patent No. 7,657,386, entitled Integrated Battery Services.
The plaintiff sought compensation in cash or a patent fee for post-judgement tort equipment.
It appears from the indictment that the plaintiff argued that the iPhone's fast-filling function violated the company's patent.
iPhones with fast charge functions quickly charge up to 80 per cent of the charge, followed by trickle-up charge.
Somaltus is in fact a so-called “proprietary hooligan” because it does not provide obvious products and services and it is difficult to find relevant information online.
However, they have been successful in reaching an out-of-court settlement with car manufacturers such as Ford and Nissan on the patent.
The meeting recognized the importance of accelerating information development, promoting the integration and efficient use of resources, and raising the level of digitalization and intelligence in the industry, in promoting “China to create 2025” and popular entrepreneurship and innovation, in fostering new energy and in improving the quality of life of the population.
Taiwan's hot-blooded youth film, The Six-Do Café, by Dong Jianxian, is a big-time media competition for the current film festival, while another, his Chinese-language film, The Duran, is competing for the Golden Lord's Award.
He's 23 years old. He's wearing t-shirts, black sports pants, and he's young and sunny. Because there's not enough chairs in the interview room, he just sits on the floor, and he says, "Come on, it's nice to talk."
As a result, it has been revealed that the railway sector has expanded the 12306 website, introduced new services during the spring ticket purchase period, and that nearly 60 per cent of tickets no longer require certification codes.
According to leaked phone records, Trump had pressured Mexico to pay for the construction of the border.
The Washington Post leaked telephone records between United States President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On 27 January, in a call to the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
It was reported that the President of the United States had expressed dissatisfaction with his public criticism of the wall, as he had allegedly said to him, “Don't tell the media”.
During the presidential campaign, Trump pledged to build the separation wall on the southern border of the United States and solemnly announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
His telephone records with the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, were also made public, showing an intense exchange between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the United States deal with the repatriation of refugees to Australia was “preposterous”, “disgusting” and “breathless”, and that he had recommended that the United States ban the resettlement of refugees and was now insisting on the deal brokered by the Obama administration, which would make him look like a “dumb”.
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull that this was the most unpleasant call of the day.
In an award-winning speech read by the United States Ambassador in Sweden, Dylan stated that he was on his way to the tour when he received the award, “it took me a while to react”.

The high-level talks between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ended in Panmunjom on the evening of 9 January in Seoul, Xinhua, where the two sides issued a joint statement and agreed on the DPRK's participation in the Pingchang Winter Olympics and the military sector talks between the two sides.
In accordance with the joint statement issued by the two sides, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will send a high-level delegation and a delegation from the National Olympic Committee to participate in the Pingchang Olympic Games.
In addition, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will send groups such as athletes'groups, cheerleaders, art groups, journalists'groups to visit Korea, which will provide the necessary facilities.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea also agreed to reduce the current military tension and decided to hold talks between the Korean and Korean military components.
The report analyses the results of the questionnaire survey involving 1,045 foreign tourists who visited Seoul last December.
According to the report, the per capita value of purchases by foreign tourists was 1.06 million won.
Of these, China has the largest per capita purchases of 2,130,000 won, 6.5 times the number of Japanese tourists and 3.2 times the number of American and European tourists.
Asked about the purpose of travelling to Seoul, 62.2 per cent of Chinese tourists answered “shopping” and 94.9 per cent of Chinese tourists bought cosmetics.
96.3 per cent of Chinese tourists shop in municipal duty-free shops at a cost of 1.56 million won per capita.

The Moor Beach tragedy: Racist lynchings and justice for activists
A 1948 Ford Mercury car ran through a crowd of viewers in the town of Monroe, Georgia, towards the little Moor Beach Bridge.
The vehicle was carrying four black passengers and a white driver, and a group of white men with guns went in front of the bridge, blocking the way forward.
The mob leader, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, took a deep breath of cigars and looked into the windshield.
The passengers in the car were full of fear.
"We want-- Roger!" that man shouts.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged down from a former row of passenger seats and screamed in silence.
Fortunately, on July 22, this terrible scene was just a repeat.
But when the neck of “Roger” was lined up, almost all the viewers made a real sound of breathing.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moor Beach Bridge, reproducing the scene of two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm, and George and Mérè Dossi, who were hanged by three-K lynchings in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
“Although we know who they are, and although we have seen them in the community, none of them has been arrested over the years, which is incredible,” Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize this repetition, said.
“This is the stain of history, the burden of our souls.”
Brooks, 71 years old, was a former member of Georgia's Parliament and a lifelong defender of rights.
For him, the repetition was a remarkable call that reminded the people of the Monroe community every year that injustice had never been redressed.
“We want to prosecute, we want to close, we want to heal, we want to reconcile, but we must first get justice,” he said.
“Unless we get justice, we will not be cured and reconciled.”
On 27 July 1946, the coroner laid a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the lynching on Moor Beach.
According to the FBI file obtained by the National Broadcasting Corporation of the United States, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in lynchings.
None of them, however, had ever been prosecuted.
Although suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists have stated that the dual motives for lynchings are well known throughout the town: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the initial elections later in the summer of that year.
According to the FBI, at about the same time, the black tenant Roger Malcolm stabbed white landlord Barnett Hearst in a fight that looked like it was for a woman.
Brooks said that the town rumor was that Hearst had slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband's.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the prominent white landlord, Roy Harrison, spent $600 to release Malcolm on bail.
Dorothy and cousins Michael Murray and George Dorsey accompanied him to prison.
However, when they returned from prison to the Moor Beach Bridge, a mob of thugs surrounded the car.
“It turns out that Harrison organized and ordered the murder,” an FBI report concluded.
“It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement authorities, who not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witness.”
Brooks is very concise.
He said, “This is a tragic vote.”
“They were killed, and the murderer sent a message to the black people of this community: `If you register and vote, you will have the same end.'”
For almost a decade, Cassandra Green has been responsible for leading the annual recurrence of the lynchings at the Moor Beach Bridge.
Her modus operandi was impressive, well-known and had a profound racist background. Many hoped that that racism would cease to exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, not harder to see, but Green says that's the key.
“We don't want to talk about lynching, because lynching makes us face the ugly side of everyone”, she said.
“But if you don't listen to me or hear me tell my story, I can't have a relationship with you.”
This year's performance began in June, with nearly 30 actors on the first day - a dozen whites, the rest of them blacks - combing in a room and listening to Green's release of a rehearsald performance overview.
Wade Malbau was co-director of Green.
He's been playing the role of the three Ks for years, but he says it's never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Malbau said.
“But I think it is very important to keep this history alive, because we do not want to go back to that era.”
In the room, actors like Roger Malcolm and Barnetthurst, Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, are rehearsing their lines.
At the beginning of the scene, Malcolm shouted and pushed Hearst away, angry that he had slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, get out of my house!"
Rascona echo.
And then they fought.
And then everybody laughter.
Green had the greatest laugh.
"What's going on?
He was panicking and confused.
Did I go too far?
"No," Green laughed.
"I just don't think white people say "ah" when they strike back."
"Yes," another black actor plays fun.
"You have to be strong."
As a result, the energy in the room has changed; the feeling of fraternity has driven the feeling of discomfort away.
Everyone tried to do so not only to perform the scene, but also to honour the memory of the four victims.
The scene begins again.
And this time, when Rascona said the word "ah", it was sharp and strong.
No one's laughing.
The reoccurrence came to a strong and quick end.
The screams, the gunshots, then the silence.
A woman dressed in black in funeral clothes stood next to the body of the actor and sang Billy Harold's words of condolence, the strange fruit.
Her voice slammed over other words.
About 40 viewers, 100 yards away, are swirling their sweat and tears.
Blacks and whites make up almost half of the audience.
There was a couple who came to see the show from Isaka, New York, and a lot of people lived near the road.
Brooks took them to the cemetery of Malcolm and Dorothy for nearly eight hours, and everyone was enduring Georgia's uncomfortable wet fever.
Until then, the murderer remained obsessed. But now, on the same land where lynchings took place, there was anxiety in the air.
When the last note of the song disappeared, Green asked people to come closer and examine the body of the actor.
The children bowed down, watched fake blood and bodies and whispered among themselves.
"They're not really dead," a little boy whispers to himself as if he were reminding himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and then the show ended.
The actor threw away the lynching rope and wiped out the tears.
Bradshaw embraces a man in a suit who plays the three K's leader, Malbau.
Nick Rascona hugged two of his colleagues and wept in their arms; the emotions in the performance eventually infected him.
“It's okay,” one of the women whispered.
“We know that your heart is not that way.
There's a reason you're doing this."
After that, the audience sat down and had dinner with the actors.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted closely with a black couple they had just met and talked about reoccurrence.
Dennis Duplinski had difficulty finding words to describe how she felt after watching.
“It is hard to imagine those terrible words and acts... which are made out of people like you, because they look like you,” she said.
“This really makes me think that lynching is still going on,” she added, “Now this is just a police shooting.”
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sits at the table watching, tasted and reminiscent of civil rights.
He said he'd already started planning next year's performance.
“Recurrence is an encouraging way because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also very educational,” he said.
“If you do not learn from it, it may happen again.
Those who do not study and do not know their own history are doomed to repeat their mistakes.”
For gas market-based reforms, the importance of “net independence” reforms is self-evident, but resistance and controversy are also greater.
The journalist was informed by Kaiji Hebei Group that at 11.25 a.m. on 7 a.m., 13 workers were trapped in an explosion at the emulsification workshop of the Kaiser Chemical Company Ltd., located in the ancient smelting area of Tangshan City, Hebei Province.
To date, of the 13 people trapped, one has been rescued and rushed to hospital, while the remaining 12 are under intense search and rescue.
It is known that the scene has been closed and that the local public security, fire and medical services are in the process of being rescued.
According to witnesses, there was a loud noise and an instant mushroom cloud emptied.
According to members of the Open Group, which organized a search and rescue at the site, Tangshan Kaihai (Group of Chemical Industries) Ltd. is located north of Zhao Chao, a State-approved site production company for civilian blast equipment located in the ancient smelt district of Tangshan City, Hebei Province. It was established in 1958 and was formerly known as the 60-O-2 factory of the Open Mining Authority.
Since his release 15 years ago, this newspaper (journalist Choi Jian) must have produced a new album every year, but last year he lost a rare date.
The fans, however, did not express any displeasure, but instead came together to give their blessing, as the reason for the failure was that Jayn was happy to be a father.
After a full year and a half of waiting, last week Jayon finally arrived in Beijing to present this first piece of his father's promotion, as well as his 14th album of his musical career, " Jay's Pre-Sleep Story ".
US medium: China Air Force Engineering University scientist researching laser satellites for the removal of space debris
The American media reported on January 18 that Chinese scientists had made a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up chaotic Earth orbits and destroy old satellites and their sky trash.
According to a 15 January report on the United States Newsweek website, researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled " Study on small-scale space debris transformation models for space-based laser removal ", which describes how space debris can be irradiated by lasers into smaller, less hazardous fragments through the use of space-based platform lasers.
It was reported that space debris had been the concern of international space agencies for many years and that NASA had considered a variety of options for tracking, detecting and removing artificial debris.
Large-scale space debris is removed by means of meganets used to clean and collect waste, as well as magnets that can be used to exorcise them out of orbit. Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean up Earth orbits.
The summary of the paper states: “(Simulation studies) provide the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based platform laser removal technology.”
A 2014 study by Lockheed-Martin, the giant of the United States defence industry, found that there were approximately 200 threats per day for satellites in orbit.
High-speed debris moving along Earth orbit is considered a serious threat to future space missions and has been described by experts from the European Space Agency as a “lethal chain of threats”. High-speed debris has continued to grow over the past year.
It is also reported on January 17, of the United States monthly magazine Mass Machinery, that space is essentially empty, but space next to the Earth is becoming increasingly crowded. Each satellite that we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris around the Earth and, over time, it will accumulate.
The more debris there is, the more likely a satellite that is still operational will be hit by debris, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of dollars.
It was reported that all space agencies had plans to remove space debris in the future.
NASA was considering using jet gas to reduce the speed of debris and de-orbit it, Europe was considering launching a satellite with a large net to capture debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan was thinking of using an electric chain to capture debris.
At the moment, China is also proposing a solution to the problem of space debris, namely, the use of a large laser device to destroy floating space debris into less harmful small fragments.
According to a paper published by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University in the German monthly optical magazine, the installation of such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean space, at least on the basis of simulations.
It was reported that the only way to prove effectiveness was to conduct tests and that there were no arrangements for such missions, but perhaps sooner or later people would install lasers on satellites and send them into space.
Once that has been done, we can finally start ridding space debris once and for all.

Retrenchment of 3000 positions by PSC, substantial reduction of dividends to revive operations
On Friday, the British Education Group called for an additional 3000 jobs and a substantial reduction of 72 per cent of the medium-term dividends, as it had started another restructuring project to deal with operational pressures.
According to Chief Executive Officer John Fallon, most of the post reductions would take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, after 4000 posts had been reduced in the previous reorganization.
PSC announced in May that it plans to cut an additional Pound300 million ($394 million) in the third cost-cutting project in order to revive operations that have been hit by rapid developments in digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its shares in the Penguin Landon Bookhouse to partner Betasman, and published a report that its basic sales rose by 1 per cent in the first half of the year to Pound205 billion, but that this year's outlook remains unchanged.
A few days ago, the China Association issued a serious notice, severely shunned the phenomenon and was prepared to impose a heavy penalty on violators for life.
A suicide bombing attack on the convoy in Kabul killed NATO soldiers
According to official sources, a military convoy was hit by suicide bombers in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
The NATO statement stated that five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in this incident in the Karabagh area of the city.
This is the latest violent attack on Afghanistan - the bombing of the Herat mosque on Tuesday caused more than 30 deaths.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO statements, an explosion occurred on Thursday night and a joint Afghan-NATO coalition patrol was attacked by “individuals carrying improvised explosive devices”.
The statement stated that all the wounded were currently in a stable state and were being treated at the United States military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to journalists, the growing Taliban and so-called Islamic State (IS) organizations in the Karabakh region have raised serious concerns about NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, compared to approximately 20 per cent in the capital.
A suicide car bomb attack in late July in the Shia-dominated area of Kabul resulted in at least 30 deaths.
The Taliban claimed to have launched the attack.
On 31 May, a huge explosion took place in the centre of Kabul, killing more than 150 people, the deadliest attack by armed elements in the country since the overthrow of the Taliban by the United States-led multinational force in 2001.
The violence highlighted the precarious security situation in Afghanistan at a time when United States President Donald Trump weighed whether or not to increase Afghan troops in support of his army and police.
Journalists have reported that suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the Government and its policies, in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) action to overturn resolution and delay smoke regulations
When Obama came into office, he imposed a ban on all types of emissions that cause smoke, 15 states, because it sued the National Environmental Protection Agency of the United States. One day after the indictment, EPA overthrew the regulation.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision on Wednesday to continue the so-called “Ozone 2015” zone and pledged that it would work with the states.
In a statement, the United States Director of Environmental Protection, Scott Pruett, said, “We have confidence in dialogue with and are committed to responding to national partners”.
In June, Pruitt announced that EPA planned to postpone the implementation of the ozone compliance area standard until October 2018, with a one-year delay - according to which existing smoke pollution in some areas was measured to determine which areas should be reduced to meet air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the main states of the Democratic Party and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit alleging that the act had been unlawful.
As part of a broader agenda, President Donald Trump's authorities have been working to revive the environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama to stimulate economic growth.
But these efforts have provoked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups, who fear that more emissions will affect public health.
The US EPA website states that breathing ozone-containing air “reduces lung function and increases respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.

McKee Garcia and Vasili Lomachenko met for the first time to explore possible future battles.
The most notable boxing contest of up to 147 pounds will take place shortly, with Vasili Lomachenko and Macky García meeting for the first time on Thursday, now in a state of potential conflict.
In separate rooms in Los Angeles ESPN's office, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion García took the lead down the corridor, paying tribute to the World Boxing Organization's super-featile champion, Lomachenko.
At the Showtime fight on Saturday, the referee unanimously concluded that García had won the victory of Adrian Bronner, the world champion of the four subdistricts, and that both fighters had become the top five players on the same weight list.
Garcia reached out to her right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck with that."
In the ESPN competition on Saturday night at 7 p.m., Lomachenko won Miguel Mariaga and preserved his position.
When both of them took photographs, Egis Clemás, the agent of Lomachenko, pointed out that the potential confrontation between the two players depended on “the perfect size”.
"I was lightweight before," Garcia leads.
"I went up against Bronner, but I didn't weigh that much.
Compared to 140 pounds, I'm a little overweight.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he had to be lightweight (135 pounds) before we could fight.
That's what fans want.
Then we'll meet them."
This was agreed to by Lomachenko.
"The boxing world needs this battle."
Clemás asked him whether he should pay a fee, and part of his strategy was to get Lomachenko to run a premiere with a 135-pound player later this year, hoping to set a date with Garcia next summer. García was also interested in a match with Jorge Linarez-Luc Campbell’s victors after the Forum’s lightweight boxing contest on September 23.
“Since all the fans are asking the question, the fight may be on a charge-by-charge basis,” says Garcia. Then he expresses his openness to the competition on the network that offers the best financial options.
“We are the principals.
No one else could have generated such a great deal of attention.
As long as they're ready..."
García appreciates Lomachenko as an “excellent player” and may be watching his boxing match on Saturday.
But Lomachenko was hesitant about Garcia's praise, saying he thought that this tri-district champion from Riverside looked "so slow." Sorry, Mikey you're gonna be out."
García said that the focus was on showing the power of the fist and then boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing contests.
“This is the battle that has to be fought.
Attention and heat are beyond the reach of other boxing competitions.
I'd be happy to compete, "Jascia says.
He said, “I've been waiting for top fighters, and this time it's Mikey's turn.
This will be a great battle.”
Promotion of environmental protection yesterday, a major environmental volunteering event on the theme “Green Homes, Booby West City” was held in West Town.
Unlike traditional methods of garbage collection and distribution of promotional materials, the sponsors have set up six special game experience areas, including water-saving toilet displays, enzyme production experiences, traffic domino dominoes, etc.
At present, many young people in the country have dropped out of school because of the targeting of professional golfers and are on a smooth career path, let alone taking into account universities.
The early completion of the 11 per cent reduction target by officials of the China Development and Reform Commission (CDRC) has given a strong expectation of recovery to the steel industry, which is constrained by limited electricity production.
Although the steel plant has not yet received a clear notification from the local government that energy-saving emission reductions have been closed, it is estimated in industry that, on or about 15 December 2010, steel plants that were otherwise restricted will be reproducing and the price of steel will begin to be pressured.
No notification of the end of the restrictions has been received, but in practice the pressure from businesses has been considerably lower than in September and October, when a private steel company in Hebei province told journalists.
In the northern part of the river, restricted production documents have been issued repeatedly and, at one point, businesses have been restricted in the form of forced locks.
Journalists have learned from local businesses that steel plants in most of Hebei have now resumed work and production restrictions have been eased.
My steel network analyst, Zhang Tieshan, expects that the end demand for building steel will gradually shift from strong to weak due to the winter in the north.
The phase-out of energy-saving emission reductions will lead to the resumption of most steel plants by 15 December and the arrival of products in local markets by New Year's Day.
The increase in the availability of resources will put some pressure on the right price of steel.
On December 20, Chinese smart car-related sources told journalists at www.thepaper.cn that China-China had acquired 70% of the shares of the Joohai Guangbus, and that on that basis it had formed a smart car team for communications between China and China, which was “undisclosed, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. We are recruiting talent, and the future of smart cars will be a very important business for communications between China and China.

The 68th Emmy Awards ceremony was held yesterday in Los Angeles, United States, on the evening of September 18, local time.
This year's drama, “Before the Emperor”, was fiercely competitive, and two newcomers finally defeated an old actor: the best leading man prize was won by the first-nominated hero of the Hacker Corps, Rami Marek, and the best leading actress prize was won by Tatiana Masrani of Black Orphans.
The big winner of the Emmy Award is the Game of Power and the American Crime Story.
U.S. Crime Story covers major prizes in miniatur/television films, while the Game of Power takes 12 prizes (including technical ones), including the best drama series, the best director and the best writer three heavy prizes.
To this end, the Game of Power has won 38 Emmy prizes as the largest television drama in history.
Unfortunately, this year's Game of Power has lost its mark on the actor's awards.

International Online News (journalist Liu Xing): On 18th, the Economic and Commercial Affairs Branch of the Italian Embassy in China organized a China-Italy Environmental Relations Conference, which resulted in an extensive exchange of views and a positive consensus on cooperation between the two countries in the field of renewable resources in the light of the new situation.
It was reported that China was represented mainly by China Renewable Resources Development Ltd., China's International Technology Transfer Collaborative Network, and that it was composed of institutions such as the Global Energy Environment Exchange and the Bologna Regional Business Federation of Italy.
The representative of Italy said that Italy had diverse environmental technologies and solutions in the field of renewable resources and proposed pilot projects with China on industrial waste disposal, waste oil treatment and waste incineration equipment, while looking forward to extending China's environmental cooperation experience to other parts of the world.
Publication of the results of the latest age assessment test for asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest method used by Swedish asylum-seekers to medically assess their age shows that more than 80 per cent of those tested were sentenced to over 18 years of age, but not all were convinced of their accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (R?ttsmedicinalverket) started this test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees who claim to be minors, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) designed these tests with a view to conducting a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
To date, the Swedish Migration Board has brought 6880 testers, and the Centre for Forensic Medicine has now published the results of a total of 2481 testers for the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002 persons) were sentenced to 18 years of age or older, but in 25 other cases, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine determined that the subject “may have reached 18 years of age or more”.
In 432 tests, the result was that the person “may not have reached the age of 18”.
The test is only for persons whose age is in doubt.
According to John Grant of the Forensic Medicine Centre, these results are consistent with those of the previous months.
He told The Local: “The data are not very different from those of the previous months, and the figures are very consistent.”
The higher proportion of those over 18 years of age who have been convicted does not necessarily mean that the asylum-seekers falsely declare their age.
In May, the Centre published 581 test results and stated 442 cases “indicating that the subject had reached the age of 18 or over”.
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of the 581 tests released and found that 243 of them had publicly indicated that they would be 18 this year.
The method of medical assessment was also questioned in some areas by means of an X-ray examination of the smart teeth, an MRI scan of joints, and analysis of the results by dentists and radiologists.
One of the suspects is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to determine whether they undergo puberty earlier or later than normal age.
He told the newspaper Metro: “I have reason to think so, and I don't think that's the way to measure it.
The determination of the biological age in this way is inaccurate.
If we cannot guarantee accuracy, we should not pretend that we can do it.”
However, Grantson of the Forensic Science Centre defended the accuracy of these tests: “It is generally safe to say that there is a small risk of uncertainty in determining a child as an adult”.
The greatest risk is that the person happens to be under the age of 18, which is about 10 per cent.
The governor of West Virginia has announced a party change.
Thursday night, Jim Justice, Governor of the West Virginia Democratic Party, announced at a rally of President Trump that he would change the party.
"I like it, I don't like it, the Democrats have left me," said the governor's judge.
“Today, after a lot of prayers and a lot of thought, I would like to tell you that today I am going to tell you, in my capacity as West Virginian, that I can no longer help you as Governor of the Democratic Party.”
The rally broke out with cheers.
“So, tomorrow, I'll turn the Republican party into a Republican”, Justin added.
"As a coach, I'm gonna tell you it's time to start another game."
Trump promised a major announcement at an earlier rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42% of the vote in West Virginia, and Justin didn't support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justin was selected as the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
According to Forbes, he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in each of the five Länder.
At the moment, he's worth about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Council issued a statement on Thursday evening stating: “Governor Justinian's change is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, not to prevent our country from becoming once again great, but to make our country once again great”.
“Democrats currently have only 15 governors, and control the State Council is the lowest in history. The Governor's statement is the latest rejection of a party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unifying slogan.” Rona McDaniel, the woman president of the Republican National Council, stated in a statement to the CBS News.

Sebastian Ko applauds Russia's “probably” apology for the stimulant scandal.
On Thursday, the President of IAF, Sebastian Ko, expressed appreciation for Russia's apology for the stimulant scandal and stated that the apology was “offensive”, but reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to re-engage in the campaign.
At the International Congress held on the eve of the World Athletics Championship, the President of the Russian Association of Athletics and Athletics, Mitri Chirac, stated that his country was rightly prohibited from participating in the campaign and that he was determined to combat doping.
He expressed his regret that “all athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were deprived of medals”.
Despite his comments, the Congress voted to maintain the ban. Previously, the report of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) mentioned the discovery of evidence of Russian state-sponsored doping, which was implemented in November 2015.
“I think today's response was very frank and very frank,” the FIDA Chair told the press.
“The Council as a whole and the General Assembly of the Federation are pleased... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has gone through a very hot period and is doing everything in its power to ensure that Russia can retake the game.”
He said that he was also “joyed” that Russia had accepted the criteria for re-entry.
“I think that this is a very constructive day and that we have made some progress, but the United Nations General Assembly supports the Panel's recommendations, and this is not the time to reinstate Russia's candidacy.”
“We need to do everything in our power to normalize this situation in the coming months.
Our guiding principle has been the desire to separate innocent athletes from the contaminated system”, he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes meet the strict standards of the International Federation of Fields and will participate as neutral players in the World Athletics Championship to be held in London on Friday.
On Monday, the head of the IWF Task Force, Vern Anderson, stated that Russia had not yet met a number of criteria for resuming its participation.
After his speech in London to the International Council of Federations, he told journalists that drug testing was still inadequate and that banned trainers were still teaching.

The People's Dollar's median price is down by 66 points.
Macroeconomics Treasury 2018-01-18 09:50
On 18 January, the yuan was presented at the United States dollar median price of 6.4401 and the median price depreciated by 66 basis points at the date of the previous transaction, ending the previous five consecutive increases.
The overnight market, the United States dollar warmed up, and the dollar index moved out of the V-word form, reporting 90.89000 as of 07:30 Beijing Time.
According to the Federal Reserve's publication of the Economic Brown Book, almost all 12 Federal Reserve regions reported moderate to moderate growth in economic activity at the beginning of 2018, maintaining optimism about the prospects for the current year.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate in the United States remained at 4.1 per cent in December, the lowest since 2000, and businesses are expected to increase their wages in the coming months.
Tax conversion is widely perceived by Federal Reserve officials as a factor supporting this modestly strong economic outlook, with the Fed forecasting an economic growth rate of 2.5 per cent in 2018, with an interest increase of three times.
Marketers have pointed out that, in recent times, the ECB’s monetary policy has tightened its expectations to boost the euro’s exchange rate, that the dollar index has continued to fall, and that the renminbi’s exchange rate against the dollar has accordingly increased rapidly. However, at present, it is unlikely that the ECB will be able to adjust its policy stance quickly, that the short-term fluctuations in foreign exchange markets will eventually return to basics, and that it is likely that the renminbi’s exchange rate will continue to function smoothly.
It is worth noting that the attractiveness of renminbi assets to offshore investors has become increasingly apparent as markets are expected to stabilize more.
The Chinese People's Bank of China authorized the China Foreign Exchange Exchange Exchange Centre to publish that the median value of the exchange rate of the renminbi in the interbank foreign exchange market on 18 January 2018 would be: US$ 1 against the renminbi 6.4401; US$ 1 against the renminbi 7.8482; JPY 100 against the renminbi 5.7854; HK$ 1 against the renminbi 0.82399; US$ 1 against the renminbi 8.9017; US$ 1 against the renminbi 5.1302; US$ 1 against the renminbi 4.6779; US$ 1 against the renminbi 4.8546; US$ 1 against the renminbi 6.6731; US$ 1 against the renminbi 5.1747; US$ 0.61399 against the renminbi; RMB 1 against the yuan 8.8352; RMB 1 against the yuan; South African Ryat 1.9128; RMB 1 against the yuan; US$ 165.95; US$ 1 against the yuan; US$ 0.57030; US$ 1 against the yuan of the People's Democratic People's Republic of China; US$ 0.573 million; and SEK 1 KN 0.901 against the currency of the currency of the People's Democratic People's Republic of China's Democratic Republic of China.

Today, four groups that have contributed to a beautiful China, such as Zhejiang Province and Jiang County, have won the eighth China Environment Prize.
The China Environment Prize, established in 2000, is the highest award in our country in the field of environmental protection and consists of a selection committee composed of a number of central departments.
Li Wei, Secretary-General of the China Environment Foundation, the head of the Selection Committee, said that his country was facing ecological problems that had been left behind in previous decades by a model of development that focused on gross domestic product (GDP) and light environmental protection.
The purpose of the present China Environment Award is to recognize those who have contributed to the improvement of the environment, as well as individuals, as an expression of respect for public opinion.
In the opinion of the Selection Committee, the Zhejiang province and Zhejiang district, which are based on the ecology of the district, deserve such an honour.

4 telecommunications fraud syndicates have been transnationally executed by the Hubei police and more than 70 million yuan has been involved in more than 500 cases in 31 provinces and municipalities.
Reporter Choi Changchun, the daily rule of law reporter, learned today from the Ministry of Public Security that the transnational series of telecommunications network frauds uncovered by the police in Xiangyang, Hubei, under the command of the Ministry of Public Security, in cooperation with the Malaysian Police, is a more representative case of telecommunications network fraud in Taiwan.
What is the impact of football financial rules on Neymar's transition to Paris?
The rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending by the European Haomen Football Club do not prevent Nemal from moving from the Barcelona Club in Spain to the St. Germain Football Club in Paris (PSG) in France at record prices.
As a result, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has further downgraded the football club in St. Gilman’s, Paris. The Union of European Football Associations is the governing body of European football games and has the right to ban teams from participating in widely publicized Eurocap leagues.
The Financial Fair Contest Rules (FFP) launched by the Federation of European Football Federations in 2011 meant that the Paris Club of Football in St. Germain would eventually have to prove that Nemal’s transfer would be funded without significant losses.
The Barcelona Club has already disbursed €222 million ($262 million) simply to cover the cost of dissolving the Brazilian player, whose salary will be as high as tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are some of the financial implications of Nemal's transfer to France.
Considering that the team is funded by the rich Qatari ruling family, the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris can, of course, sign Namar in cash and include him in the ranks of other stars.
Clubs can spend a lot of money on their players, but they must use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge amount of money they spend in order to achieve a balance of gains and losses in football-related operations.
The Financial Fair Contest Rules were conceived by Michel Platini following his election as President of the Federation in 2007.
According to the former French player, if banks or owners withdraw support funds for clubs that are heavily indebted for success, they are actually deceiving and putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from club debt to club loss monitoring.
This change means that Rome? The business model used by Roman Abramovich when he acquired the Chelsea Club in 2003, namely, to buy a club with potential and then spend a lot of money to improve the team and create a global brand, is now in a much more demanding position.
During the three-year rule assessment period up to 2018, the club may lose Euro30 million.
Despite Abu being devalued by the current president in 2015, Aleksander Ceferin, a successor to the Federation, remains committed to stopping excessive spending.
“Of course, the Rules have not lapsed, and we will certainly strengthen future regulations.” Andrew Traverso, who is in charge of the Rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although the Némal buyout clause will be paid in one lump sum by the St. Germain Football Club in Paris, it may also be allocated for accounting purposes within the contractual period.
Nemal had signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer of contributions might be shown in the annual account for the next five years at a cost of Euro44.4 million.
The first wave of rule sanctions imposed in 2014 brought the most severe sanctions to the St. Germain Football Club in Paris and the Manchester City Club under the banner of Abu Dhabi.
The St. Gilman's Football Club in Paris was fined Euro60 million ($82 million at the time), which was reduced to Euro20 million, and demanded that the team be reduced to 21 instead of the normal 25 players during the 2014-15 season.
The Federation is looking at clubs that seek to increase income by linking to the owners of the clubs and to deceive financial regulators.
While Qatari companies can sponsor the St. Germain Football Club in Paris, if the amount of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market price, the Federation will not consider it to be a legitimate income.
This occurred in 2014, when the Federation ruled that the amount of the Qatar Tourist Board's sponsorship of the St. Germain's Football Club in Paris had been overstated.
It was reported that a portion of Nemar's income at the St. Germain Football Club in Paris might come from payments made by the Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee in 2022.
However, both the St. Germain Football Club in Paris and the Organizing Committee denied that Nemal would be an ambassador to the World Cup, and such an initiative would be easy for the regulatory bodies of the Federation.
The recent sanctions imposed on the St. Germain Football Club in Paris mean that the Federation will be more vigilant about any attempt to circumvent the rules.
According to informed sources on Thursday, the Federation did not engage in pre-discussions with the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris on the transfer of Nemal.
The above-mentioned individuals contacted the Associated Press in an anonymous capacity only because they were not authorized to discuss the situation at the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris.
According to the last published accounts, the operating income of the St. Gilman's Football Club in Paris was Euro542.4 million in 2015-16 and more than Euro10 million in profits.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not been disclosed.
The Club de Football St. Germain in Paris anticipates that the Congregation of Nemal will bring the evangelical benefits of sponsorship activities, franchising and the sale of jerseys.
The club is expected to increase revenue by at least 30 per cent after the signing of the Namar camp.
It is clear that the Spanish coalition, deeply angry at seeing one of the most famous players leave, tried to block Nemal's move and claimed that the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris violated the Rules.
USC President Javier Tebás told the Spanish newspaper AS that “this is a clear example of a `financial stimulant', with the same clubs and countries”, referring to Qatar, which has the ultimate ownership of the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris.
Arsene Wenger, coach of the Ascennar team (the club's owner is an American sports tycoon), has reservations about the attitude of the state-funded club and the West Armour tournament.
"This is the consequence of ownership, which has completely changed the whole ecology of football for the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the State has a club, everything happens.
This would make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, since there are many different ways or interests for a country to require large players to represent a country.”
Robid, an intelligent interactive robot developer, has a new investment.
In recent years, start-ups in the area of artificial intelligence have continued to benefit from capital.
Artificial intelligence Rukid has recently completed a new round of financing, led by Leamasi, with Swiss credit, CDIB (an investment agency under the Taiwan China Development Finance Corporation) and old shareholder IDG capital, among others.
The scale of the current round of financing is known to be approximately $100 million, with Swift and CDIB appearing for the first time in domestic financing transactions in the area of artificial intelligence.
Rokid is an intelligent interactive robotic researcher dedicated to robotic research. The product operates home-based smart devices with continuous autonomous learning and growth functions, as well as recognition, comprehension, feedback, etc.
This round of financing will be used primarily for R & D, talent acquisition, strategic push and investment mapping in the industrial chain.
In August 2014, Rokid received $8.3 million in Angel Round Investment for IDG, linear capital, Mfund, and Yuanji capital; in October 2015, the company received tens of millions of dollars in A Round Investment for Walden International and Angel Investors; and on 1 November 2016, Rokid completed the B Round for financing by institutions such as IDG, Mfund, Yuanji Capital, Walden International, and others.
At that time, Rakid stated that the post-financing B valuation had reached $450 million.
In May 2017, Rukid released the consumer-grade smart voice robot “Rocky Moon Stone”, combining artificial intelligence and family scenery at a price of $1399.
The robot uses speech synthesis, natural language understanding, speech recognition technology and microphone array technology, with chatting, music playing and smart home functions.
He was awarded two prizes at the International Consumer Electronics Fair Tech For A Better World and Home Audio/Vidio Components and Accessors, as well as the German IF Design Award, known as Oscar in the design community.
On the recently concluded 2018 CES, Rokid published a new product: the consumer-level enhancement reality ARGlass.
The glasses will be used as stand-alone head displays, i.e. without connection to smartphones or external computers, and are expected to be commercialized in 2018.
Previously, the company had released the first-generation family robot, Rokid Alien, and the second-generation smartphone, Rokid Pebble.

According to Apple, the iCloud service in the Mainland of China will be transferred from the Yunna Gui State Company as of 28 February this year.
Apple stated that “cooperation with Kuozhou will enable us to continue to improve the speed and reliability of iCloud services, in keeping with the new regulations in China that cloud services must be operated by local enterprises”.
During the period of deactivation, the data previously stored by the user in iCloud will also be stored in iCloud and will not be lost.
If the user wishes to use the iCloud service after 28 February, the new terms and conditions will need to be accepted to ensure that the account is reactivated and moved to Kuozhou.
At the same time, Apple emphasized in its statement that “Apple has strong data privacy and security protection mechanisms and does not create back doors in any of our systems”.
The primary data centre for the iCloud Queen's New Zone will also be the first data centre project established by Apple in China, which, when completed, will be used to store data from Chinese apple users.
When built and put into use, Chinese users are uploading and downloading data without having to transmit back and forth over long distances between China and the United States, increasing speed and reducing delays.

The Nostalgia Infective Market - Camp Harald and The Detectives.
This story was recapitulated in memory of actors in the 1980s, the 1980s, and the 1990s, the era of garbage (before and after David Wayne and Michael Seward produced a sketch of the MTV, The Nation); it was also a memory of old times and of 2001; before that, many stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poeler and Paul Luther, had not yet come to life.
As a cultural art, it is an imitation and a reflection of our permanent memory in the Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is running out.
The first day of the camp echoed strongly, but not only because of its absurd humor (theatrical story about a talking vegetable canned by H. Jon Benjamin).
The double use of cynics in dramas -- middle-aged actors playing kids at the age of trouble -- makes it impossible to go back to the past and become a funny part of it.

Many core stories are the same.
Mr. Sugar is now a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie.
Victor (Ken Mariño) remains a virgin.
There was also another treacherous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Seward), instigated by George H. W. Bush (Michael Ian Black, impressive).
As always, the best part of this series is interjection.
It was particularly interesting to see Mr. Luther, who was always young, showing off Matt Dillon's soul patch in the film Single Nobility, and Andy in the former School Giant now felt like a giant.
This is a time of random madness that could give impetus to this film, like the Recital Seven Years of Life series, until it comes to what I think is a logical conclusion: Camp Harald: Twenty Years Later, the last act of which was to get these guys to watch the premiere of Camp Harald.
At the same time, the Amazon's Detectives and Males spoke of different nostalgia: Cold War Renaissance, America's Enigma, the film The Coldest City, and even the East-West Wrestling-like GLOW: The Glory Woman's Wrestling League.
This comedy, written by Brian Gaitwood and Alexandro Tanaka, was pushed onto the television screen by director Reese Thomas: it was a comedy film with a brother-in-law background in Romania in the 1980s, telling the story of two Bucharest officials fighting for truth, atheism and Marx Leninianism.
The main players - Grigor of the hard school and Ethel of the idealist - were young Florin Pierszi and Cornelius Ulrich, respectively, and the dialogue was spelled out in English by Chanin Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levette.

But Detective Twos is so dedicated to creating a loud and genuine comedy where there's a killer with a Reagan mask, and it usually plays that role.
The television of the six episode was slightly delayed and the comedy effect was not released quickly or frequently.

Recent interviews by journalists have revealed a general decline and even a loss in the benefits of steel, orbital traffic, ships and machinery manufacturing in the north-east.
Some experts were of the view that, under the current circumstances, the new round of industrial revitalization in the north-east was not only related to the economic recovery of the country, but would also have an impact on the long-term development of our manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, and that it was therefore urgent to restructure the transformation.
The general decline in business performance in the traditional sector, which is more costly to the raw materials industry and the manufacturing industry of heavy machinery and equipment, has suffered a severe decline or even losses, which is the primary manifestation of the economic downturn in the current round of medium- and north-east industries.
In the past, the economic downturn was characterized mainly by low-end and high impact on primary products, but this economic volatility affected both high-end and low-end industrial products from traditional Northeast industries.
The Saddle Steel Group (Webbo) began with the restructuring of its products in previous years, focusing on the development of high-end panels such as container boards, steel tracks, shipboards and civil household panels, but sales of these varieties have declined considerably this year, especially the sales of board boards, which dropped by 50 per cent over the same period last year.
Saddle steel shares (Haw Kyung-soon, Director of the Metallurgical Department of the Liaoning Department, stated that metallurgy was the third pillar of Liaoning's industry, with 60 million tons of iron and steel capacity per year ranked third in the country.
The production of 2,154 million tons of rough steel in Liaoning Province between January and May of this year, the production and marketing of products needed for high-level local government projects encouraged by State policy, and the sharp decline in more competitive products in the market were another feature of the manufacturing industry in the north-east.

The film Trinity III and Ten Million Flowers, which is about to be launched on 4 August, was launched yesterday in Kyoto at a conference entitled “The Four Seas are For You”, in which the White Night couple, Yang Yang and Liu Yifei, appeared together.
Yang Yang, who had just had his right ear surgery the previous few days, appeared for the first time after his injuries, reading his role as “irritated”, always giving in silence and hiding all his feelings.
Yang said that there was a need to mobilize all the emotions in order to convey to the audience the tragic sadness of the role, “this is a new challenge for my performance, and I am really going to choke on my inner wound during the performance”.
Liu Yeefei, for his part, revealed that when he was acting in this film, he was crying like he was in a state of shock, and he was crying like he was in a state of collapse.
The Japanese Olympic Committee had recently indicated that the Japanese delegation had set 30 gold medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and had advanced to the top three gold medals.
Last October, the Chairman of the Japanese Olympic Committee's Sports Committee, Tae-su Yama, stated that the total number of gold medals expected from Japan's Kenja at the Tokyo Olympics was 2.5 times that of the Rio Games.
At the 2016 Rio Olympics, the Japanese delegation ranked sixth on the gold medal with 12 gold.
Delegates form their own teams, maintain an umbrella and move on to the floor.
The roads around the venue are normal and there are no balloon banners, no red carpets and no plants and flowers outside the venue.
Yesterday, the second meeting of the four People's Congresses of the city of Guangan was held in a brevity.
There were no banners, no tea cups or even a bottle of ordinary mineral water on the premises of the Chamber.
Instead, it was replaced by a simple banner, a meeting place, a simple environmentally friendly paper bag with conference materials, and a green paper cup filled with tea.
Conference materials were somewhat thinner than before, and several papers summarized the theme and agenda of the meeting.
“Save for the people, but also for the economy. We understand and welcome the fact that we have returned to a simple, real meeting environment.” The Grand Duke of the city of Guangan, speaking on behalf of Wang Sung, said that efficient, pragmatic and non-formal meetings are something that they would like to see and participate in.
Experts noted that the current slowdown in inflation and deflationary pressures was certainly good news for the financial transition.

10 February News: The journalist learned yesterday from the Changzhou City Council of Agriculture that this year, building on the successful creation of a national forest city in 2016, the Changzhou City will deepen the implementation of the National Forest City Building Master Plan (2014-2025) in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, consolidate the achievements of national forest city construction and build a green, harmonious and high-quality forest city for all.
The Bank of England will maintain a 0.25% interest rate.
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and relaxed inflation have dashed hopes for upward adjustment.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue to be “weak” because it controlled interest rates while increasing household income contraction.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers decided to maintain a 0.25 per cent interest rate with a 6-2 vote, while a few members this month called for higher interest rates, even if weak economic growth had weakened the upwards.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced growth projections to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, respectively, and issued warnings that household income contraction would continue, while inflation would soar to almost 3 per cent in the fall.
However, it indicated that interest rates would need to be raised in the coming years in order to contain the inflation associated with Europe, while borrowing costs might need to be increased substantially as expected in the financial markets.
A year ago, the European Union had been affected by a large-scale economic promotion policy, and members had voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will suspend its periodic financing scheme, providing low-cost funding to banks starting in February of next year, although it claims that under the scheme, the Bank will now need an additional £15 billion over £115 billion.
In the minutes of interest rate decision-making meetings, the Bank of England stated: “In the core projections of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) has remained weak in the near future, as real household income contraction will continue to stifle consumption.”
With regard to interest rates, the Bank had repeatedly reiterated the need for “a certain monetary policy tightening” to combat inflation and for a “greater degree” than market expectations.
The market is now expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year and for the second time in 2020.
The Bank stressed, however, that any upturn would be “slow” and “restrictive”.
The Bank's growth projections for this year and next year show a downward trend, compared with the projections for May of 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank maintained a forecast of 1.8 per cent growth in 2018.
The exchange rate of the pound has declined against the United States dollar and the euro has followed.
The exchange rate of the pound has fallen by 0.5 per cent against the United States dollar, to 1.31 and by 0.4 per cent against the euro, to 1.11 per cent.
Prior to this constant decision-making, rising expectations were dashed by recent unoptimistic growth data. GDP rose to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the Bank, growth in the third quarter was likely to remain at 0.3 per cent, although it would increase slightly by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report by the Bank of England did not provide any good news for ordinary households, which were hit by inflation surges and wage increases were negligible, as it claimed that austerity would get worse before it got better.
It was also stated that monetary policy “cannot prevent” the impact on income in the coming years, but that wages were expected to recover “on a large scale” at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, owing to the depreciation of the pound sterling and the significant growth in demand for British commodities, the economy will be strained to offset some of the effects of low consumption.
One year before the decision was taken, the alarming European Union referendum plunged the pound sterling to 0.25 per cent in August.
The Bank of England estimates that it may take four years to fully influence prices and the British economy.
Until the latest decision on interest rates is published in the bank, the call for higher interest rates will be heard, as inflation has exacerbated already stressful ordinary households, while three policymakers have called for interest rates to be raised to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9 per cent in June to 2.6 per cent last month, although the Bank of England claims it is expected and will rise again in the coming months.
The line is called the 2% target, and the excess is already the final bottom line of the weak pound.
The director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, Andrew Monterey, stated: “In view of the recent fall in interest rates, the mortgage market once again seems to be becoming more competitive, as lenders strongly call for more business and look forward to a positive end to the year.
For those who may be nearing the end of existing transactions, such markets appear to be particularly beneficial, as re-collateralization (many free of charge and low interest rates) is increasingly popular.
On 13 November, at 1902 hours, China's seismological network officially measured an earthquake of 8.0 magnitude with a depth of 10 km in New Zealand (42.53 degrees South and 173.05 degrees East) with a strong sense of wellington's impact.
The British National Health Service (NHS) has a big green light on controversial HIV drugs.
The patient will be able to receive “transformational” HIV preventive treatment from September, after the high court's decision to provide drug support for NHS has come to an end.
NHS England has announced that a pre-exposure prophylactic drug (PreEP), a pre-sexually available drug, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk populations by about 86%. Health services will now provide the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary trial.
It agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court decision last year, which stated that, although NHS claimed that local authorities should fund the drug, NHS was entitled to pay for the prEP.
The announcement announced on Thursday was described by the British Chief Executive Officer of NHS, Simon Stevens, as a “big new intervention”, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a “critical moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be the first registered sexual health clinics. More clinics will join in October, followed by full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylactic (PrEP) is an HIV drug that is administered prior to sexual activity to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission among populations at risk of infection.
PEP before sexual intercourse means there's enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include homosexuals, bisexual males, transgender persons and HIV-positive carriers who have not successfully received treatment.
The clinic will determine whether eligible and agreed participants, including men, women, transgender persons and their sexual partners, who are not known about their HIV status are receiving antiretroviral treatment.
Persons residing and registered as general practitioners in England may also register at their local sexual health clinics.
The scheme will cost Pound10 million and the NHS England branch has signed a contract to purchase these drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The experiment aims to assess the full potential of PEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is located, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr. Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and reinforce HIV prevention with a broad and increasingly successful approach.
This is yet another milestone in 30 years of action worthy of progress in addressing the major health challenges of humankind.”
The Chief Executive Officer of the United Kingdom AIDS Trust (NAT), Deborah King, said: “This is a critical moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target populations in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offer the possibility of changing the UK AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, the HIV-at-risk population will be given a new, licensed tool through the NHS-funded experiment in England, a truly stand-alone tool that does not require consultation with sexual partners, which will bring about improvements in the lives of many.
We agree with this announcement.”
“The first priority now is to ensure that the test is rolled out rapidly throughout the country and that none of the people infected with HIV are left behind.
Now we've bought PEP experimental drugs, and we're ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV."
The shadow Minister of Public Health, Sharon Hodgeson, stated: “After months of delay and government delays, the start of PrEP's first test was welcome and should have come earlier.
Evidence shows how this drug can bring about change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and halting the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This experiment will give us a better understanding of the advantages of PEP.
It is now very important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us further to end the spread of HIV in society.”

High-quality life: using attics and smart designs to make the small condo of the Countess Palace a spacious home
Joanne Ray, a former banker, was very keen on renovating her house, and in 2014 she moved from her big house on the Knight Bridge to a small condo at the Countial Palace.
This apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne balcony -- and Joanne did not pack her bags and sell it -- which is a strong proof of the new design.
“Before then, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a bigger house on Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for the right house with the offer.
I saw this apartment at the Count's Palace, and it's a very high ceiling.
I'd like to make an offer on the same day.”
Since the first visit, this 1,000 square feet apartment has now been completely overhauled.
This apartment was originally a complex one-room layout -- one that needed to pass through the kitchen to get to the bedroom -- and Joanne wanted to increase storage space and the attic in order to take full advantage of the full ceiling height.
“I want high ceilings, big windows, enough light.
That's what I asked," she said.
To that end, she hired Elvan Azadi from the Duck&Shed architectural and design studio (in Notting Hill) to use this 12.5-foot-high ceiling to build a home that was not just a development project, but a place where Joanne lived.
The height of the ceiling is not sufficient to increase two spaces up and down, so the construction challenge is to create a loft that is high enough to stand up.
Ervan has to think creatively in order to solve this problem.
“The steel structure is quite complex”, he explained.
“We must make room for it to be displayed up and down, without the need for shrugs.
It is not just as simple as building a simple platform, but also starting up the steel so that it can be placed at the appropriate level to achieve its function.”
Through this arrangement, Erfan was able to acquire two rooms of full height in the space, with many interesting elements added.
The loft uses a rectangular copper window of the Retrouvius brand to overlooking the fascinating areas of life.
The overall style of the mirrored gold furniture, the small silver furniture and the archaic light of Sergei Mouille was laid down.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Put mirrors on both ends of the short corridor and make them look longer.
In the kitchen, the splatter with the mirror is like a window to another room.
At the gate, small cells with mirrors provided Joanne with storage space for the storage of dishes and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an attractive sense of space to put the kitchen away when it is not used.
The folding kitchen is not fresh.
But the uniqueness of this folding kitchen lies in a garage-style lift door.
“In this case, there is some knowledge in the field of engineering,” Ervan explains the steel-strength-enhanced and close-to-the-ground MDF door.
"This is a balance principle, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide."
As a result of the skilful use of space and storage, Joanne was given an additional 16 square metres, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"In the end, you sell the size of the house -- or your property is valued on the basis of the size of the house," Ervan says.
“Basicly, real estate agents would walk into the room and calculate it according to the size of the floor.”
They will seek to increase the occupied space while using high-quality materials, thus creating a sense of luxury in the space.
According to Ervan, “the material was chosen by you personally and thus helped to create emotional bonds in the home”.
"You don't love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they don't hold your heart."
It has been shown that, through good design and the addition of additional space, standard apartments can be shaken to surprise you.
In fact, you might as well live with Joanne.

26 July News: On 22 July, journalists learned from the Red Bridge area that the largest river belt park in the city's urban area and the greening of the landscape on both sides of the South Canal in the Red Bridge area had been completed and made available to the public free of charge.
The entire landscape belt, thanks to the pre-existing natural ecological and historical and cultural resource advantages, has been reprogrammed and upgraded on both sides of the South Canal, resulting in the creation of five rivery green corridors along the west side corridor of the New Heavenly Street in Wellington Square Park.
Some 1,500 metres of plastic ducts have also been laid on the green side of the river between the Kanhua bridge and the three new stone bridges, marked by distance.
On both sides of the road, in addition to planting a variety of herbs and trees, a children's playground was constructed and several small sets of sculptures were set up.
On foot, it can be seen that seats, tunnels, bridges, water-friendly platforms and sand pools for children have also been built on the shore, which has resulted in the greening of landscapes and water systems on both sides, providing citizens with another place for leisure, fitness and recreation.

Two brothers in the 500-million-dollar Real Estate War.
Forty years after his family founded the dynasty, two brothers fought for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million.
The former director and developer of the Carlton Football Club, Colin De Lutis, lives in a mansion in the Tulkara district, and the three doors are at his brother's residence, Paul. The latter sued him in the Supreme Court for the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have had an intense debate on the division of assets in the Supreme Court.
The brothers and their mothers owned 38 real estates worth more than $500 million, which had accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in Colin Wood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually expanded it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold it for $85 million.
After that, the money was invested in real estate. At present, the De Luttis family's portfolio includes city office buildings, the Brunswick and Solento development projects, the Golden Coast and Blue Hill apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, known by his brother Paul as the “principal protagonist and dominant figure” of the De Lutis family, owned about two thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounted for about one third.
According to the documents submitted to the Tribunal, the value of property owned by Colin was converted to $316 million, while property owned by Paul was valued at $176 million.
According to Paul, the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the bargain.
“The proposal for the division of property put forward by Colin left him what I thought was the best property”, he wrote in a first court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several failed mediations.
Now, the brothers are still competing for control of the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has kicked him out of the game.
Colin denied this and accused Paul of poor management of certain real estate.
In the early affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed a desire to settle the dispute.
"My Italian tradition determines the family as the most important option. My Italian origin determines the family as the most important option," he wrote.
The cost of the case continues to rise, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails and company reports submitted by Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC and other top law firms, as well as senior lawyers engaged by both parties.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were both Italian immigrants. They started running public restaurants and deli shops in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brenrich in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy Colin Wood's property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said, "I was in third grade," where he founded Westco, "when Paul was very small (about 10 years old).
Anna de Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to be able to pass on the property to his son in peace.
“Luisgui used to say to me that he never wanted his brothers to end up in court”, she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of De Lutis Group, and Colin paid Mark $10 million to him when he said that he had left the company and $26 million to Luke.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were “unsatisfied with the terms of the division of their property”.
According to a biography published from TV star Eddie McGuire until his release in 2015, Colin kept a low profile despite being a member of the board of directors of the former AFL Club.
“Fairfax Media” contacted Colin and Paul, as well as their lawyers, on Friday.
But only Colin replied by text. He said that because the case had been referred to the court, "I really can't say much."
“My brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family business to court, which is very, very sad”, he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to satisfy his brother's demands.
He said, “Our father does not want to see Paul and I end up in a dispute like the one we currently have”, adding that he “is still hopeful about the settlement of the dispute”.
Friday, that hope seems to be dashed.
“Our problems will be resolved through the Court in the near future”, Colin wrote.

Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the President's media time.
Others have tried, but all have failed.
John F. Kelly might really be able to do that.
If that's true, then he's the first.
According to the United States political news website Politico, the new White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump — including media reports — in order to ensure greater stability for the big boss.
The following is a quote from the journalist Josh Dauth:
“When the new Chief of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, gathered for discussion with senior officials on his first day of work, he pointed out that he was addressing one of the main issues of President Trump's admission to the White House: bad information in the hands of the President”.
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the President to make better decisions, so that the information needed to be in his hands — whether in writing or in the form of a briefing.
Kelly's diagnosis looks similar, but others tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media time, but eventually failed.
President Trump's television addiction has a long history — and his habit of watching television is still deepening in the White House.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Naberg told Politico that “if the candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, it would be useful for him to know that he has received positive coverage through credible channels.
“According to the experience of the six former campaign officials, the habit of controlling Trump's tweets was to ensure that the media messages he personally received always contained some praise.”
That's totally okay.
But Trump’s Twitter habit of being “controlled” is ridiculous.
Perhaps those campaigning officials knew something that we did not know — that if they did not intervene, Trump's Twitter would have even become even more aggressive.
We may never know those tweets that Trump did not send.
If his staff were able to save him from the fire, even a few times, their efforts would be worth it.
But no one can keep Trump from being controversial.
Part of the problem was that in the White House, a group of competing groups, people promoted their world view by presenting information to Trump that might be reliable or unreliable.
Politico — both about this story — reported in May on advisers' preferences for strategically providing the President with suspicious information.
This is an example of what the journalist Shane Goodmancher described:
“The current and former Trump officials claim that Trump's response to negative news clips, such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with destructive information leaks, would be insanely desperate to find out where it came from.
At the end of February, the President received a malicious copy of an article on the Internet incitement Charles C. Johnson website, GotNews.com, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff, Katie Walsh, of being the “source of large amounts of information leaked” to the White House, as was the case with Trump.
Even if Johnson had been permanently blocked by Twitter for harassment, no concrete evidence had been provided, and he had bombed a large number of false allegations, all of which were later openly denied.
Trump read the article and then started asking officials about Walsh.”
Goodmancher also stated that the then Chief of Staff, Reines Pribas, and the White House Secretary, Robert Potter, “had tried to establish a system to manage and record documents received by Trump”.
And?
Kelly's going to do the same thing in three months.
Maybe he can prove himself to be a more efficient manager than Pribas, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his assistant is still competing for influence.
These permanent factors of influence will make the task of Kelly even more difficult.
Traveling town: how the wind gets drunk
[Summary] The potential of Zhejiang town is gradually awakened.
Today, these towns have become important destinations for tourists to see the water of the mountains, to read the culture and to feel the pain of the country, and will also provide an important contribution to our efforts to create the most beautiful tourist destination in China, the Poetry Zhejiang.
It's better than it's better than it's better than it's better than it's better than it's better than it's better than it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it
“Society plays go with the moon and weenie smells with the wind.
The traditional craftsmanship of walking around the town of Anchanggu, where traditional crafts such as buckets, bamboo-coats, iron-laying, shoe-picking, flower-picking and cotton-swipes are a full demonstration of the intangible cultural heritage of the town of Anchanggu.
During the three-day holiday this New Year, more than 65,000 visitors to Anchanggu Town were reported.
In Zhejiang, a small town as unique as the town of Anchanggu, Xu Xiaobang Xiaobang, which has a warm spirit in the town of Jiangnan, the White Wall Deva in the city of 28, which talks about the end of the millennia of the ancient town, and the fishermen in the town of Ishigang in Taiwan, who paint the lives of traditional and modern fishers... these towns are the “battle of hand” for the tourism of the river and the “heart of love” for the tourists of all directions.
In recent years, the potential of Zhejiang town has been gradually awakened as the development of tourism across our province has advanced.
In 2016, the Office of the Provincial Government officially published the Implementation Scheme for the Creation of Tourism Townships in Zhejiang Province, which proposes to designate, for a period of about five years, around 100 provincial tourist towns with a strong popular culture, an excellent ecological environment and a tourism style throughout the province.
Today, these towns have become important destinations for tourists to see the water of the mountains, to read the culture and to feel the pain of the country, and will also provide an important contribution to our efforts to create the most beautiful tourist destination in China, the Poetry Zhejiang.
The head of the Department of Tourism explained that, in the midst of the emergence of a tourist-friendly town, we now place greater emphasis on the creation of a personalized tourism industry in the towns and cities of our province. New tourism projects and trade patterns have provided visitors with a rich experience and a good reputation.
Focus on promotion
Recently, the Zhejiang Province Tourist Board and Zhejiang Daily News Group hosted a “Small Town x Future Artists” exchange hosted by the All Media Centre of Zhejiang Province and the “Possiful Zhejiang?” Town of Zhejiang Tourist Town, which featured the closing season of the Zhejiang Province Exhibition.
“Campy towns have the beauty of art and the temperature of life.
The style of a small town lies in original juice, original taste, native origin, a pure original ecology.
“The Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, Film and Animated Arts, a film department teacher at the Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, the front-line film advertising director Xie Changfeng, and the director of the Chinese University of Metrology Institute of Arts and Communications, Professor Xu Xiao Xiao Xiao, shared cross-border stories on small towns such as Small Village Renovations in the Camera.
Many tourist towns in Zhejiang have deep cultural resources, and a new town from the south of the city of Huzhou has been created to read the country.
The town of Jiangnan, which has been popular with painters since ancient times, is now in deep cooperation with such artistic institutions as the Chinese American Academy.
Tourism-friendly small towns require elements of the landscape, factors of tourism, service elements and environmental elements.
In this context, tourism services and environments are also important components.
A timely umbrella in a rainy day would also allow tourists to experience a small town better.
In this age of sharing, the hottest share umbrellas of the “Poetry Zhejiang” editions were custom-made by Zhejiang, the most popular umbrella of the All Media Centre for Tourist Tourist Tourist Group, hoping to promote the concept of “Share? Green” and to raise the awareness and common sense of civilized tourism among tourists and small town residents in order to share a good tourist environment.
This became one of the bright spots of the “Poetry Zhejiang? The town has the wind” of the 2017 Zhejiang tourist town during the season.
Looking forward to it.
To date, Zhejiang Province has published a list of the first 21 provincial tourist towns and 115 provincial tourist towns.
As a priority area for the development of rural tourism during the “13th Five-Year” period, windy towns will eventually be built up as tourist attractions above level 3A, which will become a new model of diversity of tourism products, high tourism efficiency, and a win-win industrial integration.
The key to the attraction of a tourist town is the taste of its original juice.
The beauty of tourist-friendly towns stems not only from smouldering little bridges, but also from long-standing cultural traditions; rural renewal stems from cultural self-confidence.
Throughout the international landscape, the small towns of Lisser, the Netherlands, Halstadt, Austria, and pumpkins, France, with tulips, “salts” and pumpkins as their core attractions, attract a large number of tourists from around the world each year, thereby enabling tourism to boost the economy of small towns.
The focus on “priming identity and keeping the town alive” has given the town a distinct personality and soul, more so as to provide cultural immersion, to carry the local art and to highlight the culture of the country.
The tourist town, which is bound by culture and gloom, with its human and landscape as its vehicle, connects the quartet of tourists and allows traditional ethos and culture to be inherited and innovative in the shared construction.
In essence, tourist-friendly small towns are complex open tourist attractions that should be built together by local residents and foreign tourists, as well as by tourists.
As the main battleground for future growth in tourism, tourist-friendly towns may not only change the ecological profile of villages, the way in which economic and social development takes place and the direction in which industrial elements flow, but also be an important force in bridging the urban-rural infrastructure divide and awakening rural cultural recovery.
The Zhejiang tourist town will provide a richer story in the context of the surge of accelerated rural revitalization.
Data show that 70 per cent of China's travel needs are concentrated within a 3-km radius, which means that the entire short-distance travel market is bound to share bicycles sooner or later.
The Financial News of Japan reported that inflationary pressures would increase as a result of the fiscal expansion policies of the next Trump regime and that the rate increase in 2017 would accelerate.
The annual International Consumer Electronic Exhibition (CES) was opened in Las Vegas, United States, from 9 January (10 January Beijing time) to 12 January.

In contrast to the huge annual production of over 13,000 television dramas on the watch, these “baskets” are nothing more than an apocalypse.
The tenant negotiates the ditch and returns to Monopoly Street.
Some of the richest owners of the western Midrands region have once again been in a dispute with determined tenants, who have consulted on a ditch dug by the Government to demand the return of land other than the mansion.
The tenants parked 20 of their trailers in an open area outside the plentiful Soliher Street, which was branded Rich.
The tenants, holding the horses, carrying the babies and leading the motorcade, returned in May, when they were expelled and did not prevent their entry from the “River of the City”, which was dug up by the municipal authorities.
This lean and seasoned team found a gap in the line of defence, through which their vehicles were squeezed, despite the fact that a roadblock had not been set up for passage.
The angry population criticised the Solihull Council Commission, stating that it “did a poor job dealing with the issue”.
“They arrived there on Monday night, before they came to Benliches Street and threw stones at passers-by.
The Committee should be ashamed of what they did, because they were doing absolutely nothing.
The tenants came here in May and were subsequently expelled, and now they are back.
It's been a lot last night. It's probably more today."
She added: “The Birmingham City Council knows how to handle it by enforcing a long-term ban to protect its park.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I'm not willing to continue paying municipal taxes if the council can't stop it.
A local resident who did not want to reveal his name said, “This is ridiculous. We just saw the last group of tenants leave, only to facilitate the destruction of the other group.
The number has increased this time, with some even seeing horses eating grass on the park lawn.”
“We are aware of unauthorized camping in an open area of Schultzbrook Road, and we are now cooperating with the Soliher police and taking the necessary legal action to remove them as soon as possible.
In order to support us in collecting evidence, it is important that as many local residents as possible call the police to report any anti-social or criminal acts.
This helps us to outline the situation for the Court's review when we refer the case to the Court.”
On 15 March, the fifth meeting of the Twelfth National People's Congress held its closing session in the Beijing People's Hall.

Prior to the closing of the meeting, the Director of the National Postal Administration, Ma, in an interview with the Minister's Passage, stated that this year, the State would strengthen its supervision and guide the strengthening of industry self-regulation in response to outstanding problems in the current express delivery industry, such as delay and loss of expressware.
This year, more efforts will be made to address the outstanding problems of the four major couriers, saying that China's express delivery industry has now entered the fast track.
The Chinese express volume in 2012 was 5.6 billion units, and the 10,000 Express three-wheeler roads, with uniform standards, uniform marking and uniform insurance, facilitated delivery and ensured safety.
This is not the first time that the United Nations has attempted to use a virtual role as Honorary Ambassador. “The Angry Bird”, “The Tinker Bell” and “The Bear Pooh” were previously honoured as Honorary Ambassadors of the United Nations.
As at that date, the price of light crude oil futures delivered by the New York Commodity Exchange in August 2016 had increased by $2.04 to $46.80 per barrel, or 4.56 per cent.
The London Brent crude oil futures, delivered in September 2016, rose by $2.22 to $48.47 per barrel, an increase of 4.80 per cent.
The United States dollar index, which measures the United States dollar against the six major currencies, fell by 0.10 per cent the same day and fell to 96.479 in the tail market.
The weakening of the United States dollar increased the attractiveness of investment in United States dollar-denominated oil and sustained oil prices on the same day.
The Plan proposes that by 2020, strategic and emerging industries will add 15 per cent to GDP, form a new generation of new pillars of 10 trillion yuan in terms of production, such as information technology, high-end manufacturing, biology, green low carbon, digital creativity, and, in a broader context, a large number of new growth points for cross-border integration, with an average of more than 1 million new jobs per year.
In the United States, Stanford University launched the One Hundred Year Studies on Artificial Intelligence to provide a long-term assessment of AI's future.
Researchers believe that AI will be everywhere in the future and will have an important influence.
When it comes to employment and the workplace, the study suggests that AI can replace tasks rather than jobs, while at the same time helping to create new jobs.
According to an actor in the group, Zhang Mau was a very thoughtful person at the scene, from mass actors to the servile channel, and was required to personally monitor all aspects.
Italy's strong attitude towards the non-governmental organization Migrant Rescue Ship
Italy warned non-governmental organizations operating migratory rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue carrying out relief unless new operational regulations were signed.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Turin, the Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, stated: “It is hard to see what they will do if non-governmental organizations do not sign a new code of conduct”.
The day before Minniti's warning, the Italian authorities detained the crew of a German aid organization, “Youth Relief”, on suspicion that they had actually colluded with human traffickers to assist illegal immigrants.
The aid organization operated for only one year and refused to comment on the specific subject of charges against the Italian prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartocio.
In a social media statement, the organization stated that “to us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing, and we therefore regret that we cannot operate in search and rescue zones at this time”.
“When all the information is collected, we can only assess all the allegations and situations at this time.”
The Italian government has been monitoring the Iuventa ship of “Youth Relief” since October.
Its crew is suspected of carrying migrants brought directly from small boats by traffickers and of allowing smugglers to flee in haste and re-use the ship.
According to the documents of the Prosecutor, at least one such meeting allegedly took place at sea 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast and was published by the Italian media.
Its crew was suspected of blatant disregard for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversaw relief operations in the area out of humanitarian enthusiasm and not for any other motive.
According to the code of conduct, ships such as Iuventa clearly require an Italian police officer to supervise their activities on board the vessel.
At present, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code of conduct: Save the Children, the migrant maritime aid station in Malhe, and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new provisions to be unnecessary but acceptable, as they did not bring about any “significant changes and impediments” to its relief operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign were the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins sans frontières (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti claims that there has been a sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guards and to unite local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
The Minister stated: “In recent days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel.”
He announced plans for in-depth talks this month: discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development activities and with Chad, the Niger and Mali on ways to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries for Europe.
According to the Chief Financialist of the Transport Bank, the growth in industrial value added is expected to accelerate to 6.6 per cent in December, owing to end-of-season highs in the first three quarters of 2017.
The cumulative increase in fixed asset investments in December is expected to be 7.2 per cent, the same as in the previous month, which is lower than last year.
Industrial production, although weak in October, remained almost the same as in November.
In December, while our manufacturing investment was running at a low level, capital investment has improved slightly, and therefore capital investment is expected to level off in November of that month.
More than 200,000 people have entered the United States, mostly as stowaways. Similar scenes continue to unfold in the diaspora, in the absence of their families and in the absence of their families.
A new initiative in Beijing for “secondary rehabilitation”: thousands of teachers and students from the North chemical industry will be admitted to the new campus in Changping
The opening ceremony of the new campus of the Beijing Chemical University was held in Changping District, Beijing, where 1,800 acres of green campuses are officially operational.
From the ceremony, journalists were informed that, in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and to combat “big urban disease”, in recent years, in the context of the concerted development and defusion of non-capital functions in Kyunjin, Beijing has accelerated the process of dissipation of central city high schools to suburban areas, and some students and teachers of higher education schools are moving to new suburban campuses such as Hyo, Da Hing and Hoyama.
The new northern chemical school complex, located in Changping south entrance town, occupies 1,800 acres, 40 kilometres from the city, and is one of the priority projects in the city of Beijing to dissipate non-capital functions.
The new school is divided into three phases, which are now fully completed, and the second phase, which is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year, is expected to meet the needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduates, graduate students and teaching staff for study and life.
Looking back at this year's film market, we found that the original text of the film and the two crowds of stars in the movie form an important part of the target audience.
Today, at 1710 hours, the command centre 119 of the city of Shunyang received a warning of a fire in the storage of tetrahydrofurans at an ambitious plant located in Ryushu Tong, in the city's double-clean area.
Five squadrons of 20 fire-fighting vehicles were immediately deployed to the scene with heavy chemical suits, chemistries and other equipment.
After preliminary detection, fires occurred in small storage tanks where chemical substances such as tetrahydrofurans were stored, resulting in high levels of smoke at the site.
As at the time of the press release, the firefighters were under stress and the city's health, security, environmental, security, traffic and other services were on their way to the scene, and no casualties were observed.
Michelle Carter was sentenced for texting to encourage Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A girl from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and telephone calls.
In the current year, 20-year-old Michelle Carter will be serving a 15-month sentence, which can then be converted to a suspended sentence.
Carter was convicted in June of unintentional premeditated murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: “My family is devastated.
My son is my best friend."
While awaiting appeal, Carter was granted liberty of person.
She faced a maximum of 20 years'imprisonment, but her team believed that she and Mr. Roy were both mentally ill.
At the time of sentencing, Carter stood standing, wearing red pants and a rice coat, holding his hands tight, with both tears and looking down.
“She did kill Conrad Roy”, the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended her life for a better life.
She didn't take responsibility”, the prosecutor said.
"She has no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer says it's “a terrible consequence, and she feels very sorry”.
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he had not found any significant impact on her “age or maturity, or even on her mental illness, on her behaviour”.
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said, “I haven't had a day to grieve for losing my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of what I've done and what I've done. I'm trying to stand with his sisters in all of my pain, and it's going to be with us forever.
Mr. Roy's sister, Cady Roy, testified that she was “spiriting” because she realized that she could never attend her brother's wedding or become the aunt of his children.
“The loss of a man who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and I will live with it for the rest of my life.” She said.
This case appears to have set a legal precedent, as the laws of Massachusetts do not provide for the criminalization of encouraging others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in vehicles; this year, Carter was 17 years old.
After Carter's text message revealed that she had encouraged him to commit suicide, the case was of national concern.
“There are many ways to hang, jump, stab herself.” She said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death; he was on vacation with his family.
During the period before his suicide, she wrote, “You need to do this, Conrad”, and, “All you have to do is start the generator and then be free and happy”.
Judge Monez stated that Carter had drawn attention through Mr. Roy's death and ordered that she not profit from the case through any media.
There are differences of law in this case.
One of the few defenders for Carter, Amanda Knox, who was charged with the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007, was acquitted two years later.
In a column published in The Los Angeles Times, 30-year-old Ms. Knox said: “Michel? Carter deserves compassion and help, not imprisonment”.
Zhang is destined to be a controversial film artist, and since he began making his first film, Red Sorghum, he has gained much dissension while leading the Chinese film scene.
On 2 February, journalists learned from the Lassa Netsa Basketball Club that the Lassa Netsat Youths had recently won the fourth in the finals of the National Youth Basketball League in Beijing.
The Lassard Nussard Basketball Youth Team consists of 11 indigenous players, and the principal coach is the Assistant Trainer of the Lassard Nussard Basket Adults Brigade.
The Tibetan Basketball Kid before going to Beijing for the finals.
The director-general of the Lassard Netsat Basketball Club, Liang Joon, said to reporters that the team had improved its performance compared to last year, and that the self-confidence of the players and their confidence in the playing field had improved significantly. Communication between the players and other teams had been more comprehensive, with more and easier on- and off-the-ground exchanges.
At the end of the competition, Captain Jiangtsang expressed his desire to gain experience by participating in the competition and to do his utmost for the cause of basketball in Tibet.
It is understood that during the Beijing competition, players demonstrated the image of Tibet by overcoming factors such as low-altitude intoxication.
Despite the fact that the track is a gold medalist at the Olympics and that those who have access to the track have access to the world, the track name will be the bottom of the line as compared to the suction of the gold.
Automotive manufacturers are hit, and Audi will convert up to 850,000 diesel vehicles.
Audi announced that the BMW would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 vehicles the day before the conversion.
The BMW Chairman stated that BMW believed that “driving with more intelligent choices than restrictions” meant that major European cities - including Munich, where BMW had its headquarters - were considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that 3 million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be converted to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed to have done so as recall.
European car manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emissions requirements.
However, nitrogen oxides emitted from diesel engines are considered to be carcinogens and may lead to asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset diesel vehicle tail gas emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of diesel vehicles.
As German car manufacturers faced scrutiny, the Government led by Prime Minister Angela Merkel was accused of over-exercise of these powerful car companies and ignored the signs of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid repeating the popular pattern of concealing their use of so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions during vehicle tests to comply with regulations and returning to normal driving conditions.
Several public executives have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated by countries on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zacero Giovani Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected by extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a public criminal investigation in Germany, where the German Government accused Audi of installing a system to avoid European emissions requirements, expanding the scope of the investigation previously limited to the United States.
Audi was surveyed for a potentially significant impact on the general public: luxury car manufacturers account for a disproportionate share of the profits of the public automobile.
A film, from its preparation to its presentation, takes one or two or even a few years, and is commonplace.
The animated film, the Big Fish Seagull, announced its launch on July 8, 12 years from the time of its preparation to the time of its launch!
The original author of Big Fish Seagull Liang, 21 years old, from the Heat Power Industry at Qinghua University, and a friend, Zhang Chun, founded the other side of the ship, received a million dollars in venture capital in 2008 to launch an animated film troupe called " Big Fish Seagull ".
The film has won numerous national and international prizes during the creative sample phase, and has been recorded and praised as “one of the most outstanding works of art” by the Pompidou Centre for Contemporary Art in France.
As a result of the six-year period from creativity to production, the film was referred to by millions of fans who looked forward to it.
Big Fish Seagull tells a fairy tale that belongs to the Chinese. With the release of this pre-scheduled film, it brings new expectations to all viewers.
Liang said, “This is the only thing I've done for 12 years, and now it's turning from a dream to a reality, and I'm both nervous and excited”.
According to Zhang Chun, “I'm driving the team crazy to think of using one-fifth of the other's budget to produce exactly the same image as the others”.
Dong-jung, a “world factory” that used to rely on raw materials processing and a large number of popularists, is looking at high-quality people who can lead the repositioning of the city.
During the week of the high-level talent event organized by the City of Dongjung in recent days, the first financial journalist saw the participation of a number of powerful local businesses in the talent fair.
Each of the distinctive billboards on the orange and red background wall displays a price tag.
As a result, the Chinese Association of Television Production Industries decided to join the national television production industry and sign a convention on self-regulation.
Provence lavender threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but there is now bad news that it is threatened by climate change.
As a result of the continuing drought and the emergence of viral insects, lavender is declining, causing headaches among scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute of Agriculture in Provence (CRIEPAM), said: “The lavender of Provence is under great threat because in recent years the plant has been affected by climate change, with a significant reduction in spring rains and a dark fall.
This affects the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a small individual twig, a leaf twig that can spread microbacterial bacteria, and in very dry weather they appear in large quantities.”
The point is that it is huge in number.
In addition to attracting vacationers, Qingya lavender has been promoted by the perfume and cosmetics industries.
Eric Chase says, "Contrary to the many big flowers that can be opened with long grains, we have small, stunted, missing or weak individual problems.
So we have less oil."
The solutions being studied include the adoption of better irrigation techniques and the mitigation of evaporation of soil moisture, the spraying of a protective mixture of clay and water on a plant, and the development of more drought-resistant varieties.
In comparison to the science fiction element in the film, it is the stories in the film that are more attractive to them.
On the afternoon of 5 September, the Washington City journalist, who continued to interview a number of prominent and vocal figures, as well as two vocal artists, was surprised to learn that they had virtually remained silent.
One was the Berlin Film Emperor, one was an up-and-up young actor, and Psychiatry was the first partner of Liaofan and Li Yi Feng.
Mexico is dangerous. Journalists are killed.
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the riots in Sinalo County, which were caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and the endless drug war.
But today, the shadow of tragedy looms over themselves, and they come together to discuss security issues.
It is important that they be told to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed which was more safe: whether their children should be brought to the office, which had been hit by a grenade in 2009, or whether they should be left at home.
The security expert wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: the enemy, the neutral and the ally.
They asked the journalists to name themselves under each column — without the need for evidence, observation and intuition would suffice.
The presence of suspected drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on government lists, or cartels, is dangerous for Mexican reporting.
The violence continued throughout the country, with a growing number of journalists among them: according to the Commission for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists have been under federal protection following attacks and threats; so far this year, at least 7 journalists have died in seven states.
The last person who died was their editor and inspiration, as well as Javier Valdiz Cárdenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
Valdiz has written many books on drug violence, and he wrote in one of them: “The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist”.
You can feel very much that he has left, although he is everywhere — a huge picture hanging on the front of the Riodoce office building, with a middle finger and the word “justice”; two journalists, Aaron Ivala and Miriam Ramirez, in their T-shirts, who also showed his smile, wearing glasses or his symbolic Panamanian straw hat.
Less than two months after his death, the seminar was held; journalists discussed their common wounds, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists'cases, it has only two prosecutions, according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
The majority of the thousands of criminal cases per year involved drug trafficking and organized crime, so the perpetrators of the killings of journalists were rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they insisted on reporting violent incidents in Sinalo County, even though they had been heartbroken, even though the land had been devastated.
Ivala said that it would be of little use to hold security seminars without information about the perpetrators and without justice.
He said, "It's stupid to waste time participating in a seminar like this.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone.”
On the morning of 15 May, Valdiz left the Riodoce office in the capital city of Culiacan.
His red Toyota Carola drove a few blocks away and was stopped by two men; they forced him out of the car and fired 12 shots, presumably because of the newspaper's name — translated into Twelve Rivers.
The assailants left in his car and crashed it in the vicinity.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two adult children behind.
There are rumors about Kuliakan.
But the subject of Valdiz actually has nothing but silence.
Since Guzmán was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, where hostile forces have been killed.
One or more people are shot every day in the streets of Sinaro State, and it is common for graves to be filled with two floors of mausoleums full of drug lords.
The “quiet” state was temporarily forgotten when only one cartel controlled the coastal state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdiz was well aware of the dangers of the job, the 60-year-old founder and director of Riodoce, Ismail Pohoqui, was guilty of failing to protect his friends.
He believed that two mistakes had led to this tragedy.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damasso Lopez, who led a cartel that fought against several sons of Guzmán.
The story may have provoked the sons; the newspapers were bought by suspected gang members as soon as they arrived at the newsstand.
The second mistake was that Valdiz had not been forced to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper covering the same story had been confiscated.
Valdiz was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death was of great significance to Mexico's violence against journalists.
His spirit is long, and his friends and colleagues believe that he has always been with us.
He was also a senior journalist in Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues in the creation of Riodoce and sold $50 in shares.
In the state of Sinaloa, Pohoqui said, “It is impossible for the press to walk away from the drug problem”.
With the passage of time, the newspaper has gained a good reputation for its bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertisements have increased.
Journalists prefer to be able to publish high-profile investigative reports without fear of censorship, and readers prefer newspapers to publish stories that others are afraid to report.
Five years after its creation, Riodoce won the Maria Moskapo Prize for Journalism in Latin American countries.
The same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdiz International Prize for Freedom of the Press in recognition of his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug story.
He says he's scared, too.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the prize, he said, “I want to live.”
Later in October, in an interview with the local television station Rompetiento TV, he said, "Drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinalo County.
You must assume the task that falls on you as a journalist — either that or being deaf and dumb.
I don't want to be asked, "Why don't you make a sound about what's happening in the face of so many deaths?"
All the staff of Riodoce miss Valdez, remembering him for cursing like a dock worker, for a friend who never hesitated to embrace and advise, and for a teacher who knew how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar across from the office often sits on the same table.
Now, they will ask: Is it his daily habits that caused his crash?
His death also forced them to think about how to do their job and live their lives.
“They don't like you causing trouble to their women and children, nor do they like you influencing their legitimate companies and secret airports used to transport drugs.
It's all over their bottom line."
The result is to maintain a high level of self-censorship and self-protection, even in the safest of times.
Trust your instincts.
If you smell dangerous, get away.
Andres Villariel, editor of Riodoce, said that the problem was that “the breath was a feeling of deception... and then what happened to Javier”.
He and others said that the previous rules no longer applied to the states of Sinalo — just as they no longer applied to the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where smuggling routes were lucrative and institutions were weak, government officials corrupted and smug.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the room where the staff of Riodoce participated in security training, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed; a few days earlier, spy software allegedly sold only to the Government had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two policemen took the cold under the shade and fled from the temperature of 104 degrees (40 degrees centigrade).
They were sent by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodoce, located in a four-storey building in the middle class neighbourhood of Culiacan.
Some journalists joked about whether the police officers would be 50% of what the governor himself said.
Journalists had gone to the mountains for several months, where drug cartels were under de facto control.
The week's Riodoce featured three major events.
Among them was the murder of the brother of Julio Cesar Chávez, a great former boxer in Sinalo County.
There is also a disclosure of government funds from the governor's hometown.
And the kidnapping in a expensive restaurant in Culiacan, which is only a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official publication of information on the targets and the kidnapping process, so it was necessary to write down what the city knew: the restaurant was a destination for drug traffickers and officials alike.
A journalist learned from the public record that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician of the ruling Revolutionary System Party (PRI), which dominated the political class almost throughout the past.
Recently, several Revolutionary System Party governors have been accused of corruption in several high-priority cases.
Verariel asked journalists to write about what had happened at the scene of the incident, including the escape of one of the sons of the Mexican drug lord Guzman from a military attack.
If only a few months ago, readers would look at the column of Valdiz and look for the most powerful information on the kidnapping.
46 Villaire, a young man called “Linty” because of his thin body, said, “We already knew what had happened before.
Now all sources of information are cut off.
Valdiz's office is now being used to store signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists, as employees become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The following morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took a sign and took it out of the room and went to the office of the local prosecutor to attend a march in connection with another journalist.
El Salvador Adamé disappeared in the western state of Michoacán three days after his murder in Valdez.
The official found a burnt body and claimed that according to DNA the test was his body.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more vocal, organizing protests and wearing the words “save the media” on sidewalks and buildings.
On that day, Director Pohoqué was not in Washington and he was trying to bring justice to the Valdiz case and to secure international support.
The day after the killing of Valdiz, in a meeting with the Governor of Sinalo County, Ramírez complained about the official spying on journalists and killed them because they had told the truth.
Since her anger had affected her objectivity, she had also asked to resign from reporting on Government affairs.
Valdiz has repeatedly reiterated that journalists in Mexico are “backed” by organized crime, complicity of government officials and indifference of society.
In his last book, Drug News, he wrote that journalists were not only mutilated by drug cartels, but were on the list of politicians and security forces who were associated with organized crime.
Media Watch Group Articulo 19 blames police and public officials for more than half of the attacks on journalists last year.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up."
Obviously, these murders are chilling.
No one forgets that six years ago, the Boss, Maria Elizabeth Macias, died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was accompanied by a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “I came for my report”.
Her head was cut off with a computer keyboard and headphone next to her.
After Miroslava Brech was killed in March, some newspapers, such as El Norte, on the northern border of Chihuahua State, chose to close down.
Others continue to be killed in 2014 by the directors of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used a front page of a public conversation about the drug cartel, entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists fled their homes or even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
It is difficult to find jobs in exile, and they still need to be careful and wary of dangers in the streets.
Sometimes they were arrested and in 2015 the photographer Ruben Espinosa was reportedly killed with four women in a Mexican city three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue to work behind the scenes, this is a routine step in high-risk decision-making.
Ivala had wanted to be a poet, and he admitted that reporting on the drug trade scared him.
He said, "Mexico is turning into hell, so I became a journalist."
Last Friday, in the middle of the night, the latest issue of the newspaper had been printed, and the editors of Riodoce sat outside the office drinking beer and suddenly their phone rang.
A series of gunfights between rival gang forces and security forces near the beach resort city of Massatland confirmed 19 deaths.
The fighting is escalating, as a series of cartel information found in the region portends.
They uploaded the news to the Riodoce website just by the side of the road via their cell phones.
The next day's headline had to be changed.
The sirens rang in the vicinity — another shoot-out in the area.
Pohoqué glanced at the police officers standing there guarding them to see if they were alert.
If they were scared, they didn't show up.
The founder of the newspaper had been killed, and in his large portrait, he pointed to the places where the entire Sinalo State needed to look, and the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
“How could you even want to shut down? The day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her on the street.”
China's own-car tourism market size or trillion yuan in 2020
[Summary] In the broader context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free travel, self-tourism is encouraged by national policies and is increasingly favoured by consumers.
At the same time, however, the promise of a trillion-scale spin-off market faces a double challenge.
In the broader context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free travel, self-tourism is encouraged by national policies and is increasingly favoured by consumers.
At the same time, however, there is a dual challenge to a trillion-dollar self-driving market, with the development of self-driving industries not commensurate with market demand, and self-driving organizations such as auto-driving clubs and travel agencies facing a low level of profitability; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services that self-driving faces are still at an early stage.
60 per cent of the total number of people in the country, and the market is expected to break by trillion.
Domestic tourism was 4.44 billion times throughout 2016, with self-travel accounting for about 60 per cent of the total number of domestic tourism trips, and the size of the self-carriage market is expected to break out of trillion by 2020.
According to the statistics on the number of people travelling in and out of their own car, the number of people travelling in and out of China has continued to grow over the past five years, and the proportion of people travelling in and out of the country has remained stable at over half.
At the same time, regional and national levels have shown greater interest in and support for the emerging area of self-driving, with policy and regulations relating to self-driving, residential and camping tourism increasingly in place between 2016 and 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourism Institute and the National Sports Directorate, jointly issued the Development Plan for Automobile Sports Camps; in the same month, self-travel was highlighted in the Programme of Action for the Improvement of the Development of Rural Tourism (2017), which was jointly issued by 14 departments, including the CSD, the Ministry of Finance and others.
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of the country's own mobility.
The self-drive club has little profit, and the whole industry chain is the key.
The self-driving industry is still at an early stage, despite the enormous potential of the domestic self-driving market and the positive orientation of national policies.
According to China's Annual Development Report for Self-Riding 2016-2017, there are thousands of home-based auto clubs, car clubs, car clubs, etc., but tourist self-help arrangements account for a large proportion of their own trips, with only about 15 per cent of visitors participating in various institutions, such as car clubs and self-driving clubs.
At the same time, the number of online tourism enterprises and traditional travel agencies that are autonomous in the development of self-carriage products is negligible, with many online tourism platforms selling only self-carriage products from suppliers and some self-carriage clubs as important suppliers.
In terms of organizing self-drives, many aspects of “eat, live, walk, swim, buy and have fun” are covered, with high fragmentation, heavy upstream supply chains and high random consumption by tourists.
The founder and CEO-Li Congjie of the Beijing Car Club considered that the self-drive club was essentially similar to the travel agency, and that the main early patterns of profit were based on offline activity, with the core being the self-drive line product and lead service.
However, now that there is a high degree of homogenization of line products and varying levels of leadership services in the self-carriage sector, the self-carriage clubs face the need for a renewed transformation.
It can be seen that self-driving is not an independent industry in itself, but rather that it is important to form a cross-geographical, industry-based cycling that is characterized by the shifting nature of its own mobility and that it is important to form a complete industrial chain.
Experts noted that, in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important element of consumption.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving industry, it is important to enhance the empirical identity and develop the theme “self-driving +” as well as the IP for self-driving products.
The landscape is not just a road. Car camps should not be just for room and board.
In the face of the rise of self-driving, the basic development of self-driving is also relatively low.
According to Li Congjie, tourist attractions are not just a road, but a combination of transport and tourism elements is needed, but road repair and tourism are the responsibility of both sectors themselves, the transport sector adds tourism elements, and the construction of such facilities as toilets, counselling centres, posters, etc., is not sufficiently integrated with tourism.
The construction experience of the well-known self-driving route, the United States 66 Highway, is worth drawing on.
Instead of being the most direct and rapid route between the point of departure and the destination, the landscape design follows the design concept of “Employing the pleasure of driving” and provides the best enjoyment for self-driving tourists of the beauty of the road. The landscape can link point and face tourism landscapes, preserving the historical and cultural value of ecotourism resources along the route, and organizing thematic events to enhance the participatory and travelling experience of tourists and create economic benefits for local tourism.
In addition to the landscape, the camp is also an important side-facilitating facility.
However, among the self-carried tourists known to the journalists of the New Kyoto newspaper, there are few consumers who choose to stay in the camp.
In their view, many camps were in favour of infrastructure and could only satisfy the need for many elements of self-travel by eating and living at a low level and with a single product.
According to industry sources who did not wish to reveal their names, many of the businesses that had been in the camps in previous years had been set up to take land, after which the later stages of infrastructure construction and services had not been kept up, and many of the operations had been run at a loss without later infusion of funds, making it difficult to produce some of the accompanying products.
Consumption group
According to data published in 2017 by the China Association of Tourism Boats, self-driving groups are concentrated in 21-40 years of age, mainly 31-40 years of age, with a certain economic base and a high demand for individualized tourism, mostly as parent-to-child travel clients.
According to the accommodation survey, the self-travelling population is relatively more inclined to prefer non-standard accommodation.
In terms of the type of self-driving, the most important type of self-driving is that of the perimeter, at 84.32 per cent.
Expatriate self-driving is an aspiration of many, but a smaller proportion.
At the same time, with rising consumer demand, visitors who used to like to drive their own “shows” have begun to change their mindsets, no longer “get out of the car and sleep in the car” in the course of their own trips, but focus more on the experiences and processes of travel.
Dinosaurs use disguises to hide from their enemies.
At first glance, it was scary, but it looked like a statue.
Researchers published the first research on the incredible biochemicals found by Canadian miners of the size of rhinoceros, pointing out that the fossils were well preserved and that they were therefore referred to by experts as “Mona Lisa of the dinosaur community”.
The fossil is very well preserved, and it can even be determined that the colour of its scaffolding skin is red brown. This suggests that it has had some "happy experience."
Relevant reports in Contemporary Biology magazine describe it as “the best preserved picature dinosaur ever discovered and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world”.
The fossil is a newly discovered type of pulmonary dragon that lives between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the white age.
Its preservation was so perfect that it shocked the researchers, who described it as “examining indeed”.
According to the National Geographic Journal, this herbal pavilion is the best preserved type of dinosaur that has ever been discovered.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered this fossil during mining at the Senkol Millennium Summit site near McMerriburg, northern Alberta, Canada.
At that time, he ran into something that seemed different from the surrounding rock, and he decided to look closely at it.
The fossils he discovered were then taken to the Royal Museum of Tyrell Biology in Canada.
It took the researchers six years to show the real face of this beast, hidden inside the 2500 pounds (1100 kg).
After such hard work, the final results are now being made public.
"If you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a scientist and first author of the Royal Terrill Museum. The creature was on display at the gallery.
"It will be one of the most beautiful and well-saved dinosaur specimens in the history of science -- the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world."
Researchers, by studying their skin, found that the herbivorous creature, although wearing armor, like a foot tank, could be exposed to a major threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
It uses red and white disguises to escape predators, as well as covert techniques known as “deshade”, which are also used by many modern animals.
In this way, the experts indicated that it could be better integrated with the surrounding environment, thus avoiding the enemy, indicating that it was preyed upon by larger dinosaurs.
This 110 million-year-old creature, a member of the Journey family, became the headline for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Terrill Biology Museum.
Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who is a member of the team, has spent over 7000 hours carefully unmasking the beast's veil, and the researchers are now studying it and naming it “Borealopelta marktelli”.
The samples were extremely well preserved, allowing Dr. Mitchell, as well as the international team of scientists, to record the patterns and shapes of the scales and armour on their bodies.
They discovered the “shade” technique, a common form of defence in the animal community, which meant that the animal had a darker back than its side.
Despite the fact that anti-shade techniques are common, the results found are surprising, as the dinosaurs are much larger in size than the existing animals that use anti-shade techniques.
The dinosaurs are under pressure to be hunted by meat-eating dinosaurs, which evolves in a favourable direction, allowing them to hide in the cross-base as a means of survival.
However, most existing animals using anti-shading techniques, such as deer, zebra or zebra, are as small and vulnerable as prey, indicating that the creature faces real survival pressures.
“The frenzied capture of large-scale alpha dinosaurs shows how dangerous the white-collar eating dinosaurs are”, Brown says.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin colour of the dinosaur is red brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the life clues of the creature, including the stomach content it retains to find food for its final feeding.
In their view, the dinosaurs fell into the river at the time of their death and were then washed into the sea and then sank in a back-down way into the sea floor.
At that time, Alberta's climate was as warm as it is today in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans may be deeper inland than they are today.
Brown said, “The Lumpy Dragon is truly amazing because it is completely covered by the staircase skin that it is preserved and, so far, is preserved in the dimension so that its original shape can be preserved.”
“Therefore, the shape of the creature is now almost identical to that of the white age.
You don't need too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping.”
The time of chalking is a time when large animal foot dinosaurs walk around the planet on two feet.
Although the Tyrannosaurus is the king of the dinosaurs, it only appeared a few million years after the Pilar dinosaurs, which could have been captured by some of the Tyrannosaurus' ancestors.
They include high-crested dragons, a giant beast weighing 6 tons long and 38 feet long (11.5 metres).
Recent studies have found that scientists in Contemporary Biology magazine believe that nodes were washed into the sea after their death and that mummies were formed in the soil.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink dug up the creature at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurley, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-saved cape dinosaur, with complete skin and armor in areas ranging from the nose to the hips.
The average length of this organism is about 18 feet (5 metres) and weighs 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
It's got two 20 inches of sharp angles from the shoulder.
According to researchers, this herb-painted dinosaur operates in the current western part of Canada and is then washed into the sea by flood-spilling rivers.
However, such dinosaurs are buried at the bottom of the sea and their coats are preserved in their entirety.
The fossil remains of this particular sample are very well preserved, so that the remaining skin still covers the punctuated pieces of the skull of the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geography magazine, this preservation is very rare, as it is in the middle colour.
The more I look, the more I find it incredible.
Residue skin fossils continue to be covered by refrigerated armor over the skulls of dinosaurs.
It's right in the front palm on its side, five toes up.
I can count it."
Journalists learned that adding natural or plant-based kelp acids, corrosion acids and amino acids to the urea production process allowed for the adaptation of traditional urea, resulting in an increase of 5 to 10 percentage points in urea, zinc corrosion urea and urea use compared to general urea.
Environmentally friendly, the potential for increased crop yields is evident, especially in the case of large granular value added urea, which is a good raw material for BB fertilizers.
This total number of security personnel is twice as high as the number of security personnel at the 2012 London Olympic Games.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest-ever security connectivity programme.
Previously, the Brazilian Government indicated that a total of 85,000 people from the army and the police, including 20,000 troops and 65,000 police officers, would work together.
The majority of the military will be responsible for the protection of Olympic stadiums, while the additional 3,000 will be responsible for the security of international airports, metro stations and streets.
The police patrol the rest of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
According to the information received, 6,000 military personnel have now arrived in Rio to provide security for the Olympic Games.
They are responsible for patrolling the airport and the main roads connecting the airport to the Olympic complex, in addition to the four major areas of the Rio Games.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service sector is no longer new, and for evaluation mechanisms to be effective, it is important to make regulation more effective and non-formal.
How radicals learn to answer this question: "Whose street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was disturbed.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis man sat on a rent-in bed in Episode, browsing Facebook on his cell phone.
She accidentally found a post by a high school student.
It says, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid who was lying on the street."
She was confused when she found out that no other person had published the message on the feed. She turned off Facebook and turned on Twitter.
A @TheePharaah user kept pushing her for the Dynamic Times.
Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's body lying on the street, where he lost his vital signs, and his body was lying on the street for four hours.
"Magic," Ferrer thought.
But death is nothing new for her and her community.
She dropped her cell phone and did not turn on Twitter until the same night to read the tweets about the crowd gathering on Canfield Avenue.
There's a police video and a photo of people screaming, and there's a photo of a man who claims to be Brown's father, and it says, "Policies Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed and a policeman standing in front of a crowd of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman raised his rifle and screamed: “I will kill all of you... animals”.
"It's not normal," Ferrer recalled.
“This is not what we used to call a typical murder.”
At that moment, I was chilling.
I'm angry, I'm crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's home and decided to go to Ferguson the following morning.
In the next three years, what happened to Ferrer and Ferguson was the theme of a new documentary, "Who's Street?" that was shown at the cinema on August 11.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of those who live in this community and are crowded with streets and alleys demanding answers.
When Ferrer drove to Ferguson with her daughter, wearing a flower dress and wearing a coronation, they revisited the numerous topics they had discussed before that morning: “About black experiences and the situation of blacks”.
"Do you remember when I taught you when black people had to fight for their faith?" She recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is wrong.
I had to take her with me, "Real said later.
“What happens today is the climax of everything in the past.
She needs to know, see and rise from this.
She needs not only to develop well in radicalism and organizational aspects, but also to understand the different dimensions of the black experience and the black situation and what we must do to be free and free.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with experiences of racism that she had not experienced personally, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I think I'm hurting her."
They arrived at the first stop in Ferguson at a site opposite the South Florence police station. The site became their camp when the militants waited for the final outcome of police officer Darren Wilson’s failure to prosecute.
Ferrer and her daughter contacted a local business owner who was packing lunch.
They have prepared bags and are responsible for handing them over to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new type of activism.
She said, “My radicalism changed completely after 9 August.” At St. Louis, Missouri State University, she was President of the Association of Nurses and Students of Ethnic Minorities, focusing on the gap between food justice and health in the black community.
“I have no organizational experience.
And that's all there is to it."
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with film co-director Sabah Fryyan during a night march.
Fleiyan said that she and her photographer, Lucas Alvarado Fall, “just wanted to record what happened”.
A question arises in Ferrer's mind: "Do you want to record or find a story you can use?"
This suspicion stems from many cases in which people, usually whites, enter a community to benefit from their pain and resilience.
As Fryyan explained in his most recent interview, “we have heard that native-born people in Ferguson do not concentrate their voices, and we want to do it differently”.
Fryyan has contacted co-director Damon Davis. Damon Davis is a regional artist known for his activism against death row prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrer to join with six other locals in the “Whose Street?” project team, which lasted several years after Brown was shot.
“This documentary is not a talk or talk to us, this is our statement.” Davis says.
"I'm concerned about how these people are presented, because that's the way I'm being presented."
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrer’s experience – but to show that the campaign “is not about the Savior’s leader, but about community cohesion”, Fryyan says – she has proved to be the most open of film participants.
As a result, “Whose street?” is a surprising record of Ferrer's personal life, such as falling in love and entering into marriage.
"I feel naked," Ferrer laughed when he first saw the finished product.
“But I understand that there must be a degree of vulnerability to do this and to humanize blacks.”
In addition, Ferrer's story reaffirms and repositions the role of black cool women in the wider black life event movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- the creation of #BlackLivesMutter on social media following the 2012 shooting of a black teenager, Trevor Martin -- were identified as cool.
“Black cool women in leadership generally support this movement,” said Ferrer, “That's because we fight on multiple fronts.
Black cool women have to live with this."
Fryyan agreed and said, “This movement really enjoys the support of black women and many black cool women.”
Because of her identity, Ferrer was chosen as the core of the film. However, she insisted that this was not “a positive action for the sake of the matter”.
"She's the one who inspires this energy," she said.
“Although she's on the front line, it's not a coincidence. Because in these crossroads, as a black cool woman, you have a lot to do.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras had long disappeared, but ethnic tensions between the community and the police persisted.
As a result of an attempt to block the highway during a demonstration, Ferrer was given a suspended sentence of more than two and a half years.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in what she called the area of the home: “a mess”.
Nevertheless, since she went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has been insisting on the Holy Song she tried to remember.
“It is our duty to fight for freedom.
It is our responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We can no longer afford to lose except the shackles of our bodies.”
In fact, online translation services had been available on the Internet 10 years earlier, and the argument that “machines were about to replace humans for translation” had been heard a long time ago.
Similarity: Artists use Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
There are multiple faces in the centre of the museum in Friedman, New York: white, black and brown, with almost undetectable similarities between each face, which is tied by the ropes drawn from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea Manning's cheek tampons and hair scraps.
Manning sent hair fragments from Livingworth Fort Prison, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years'imprisonment for leaking confidential diplomatic telegrams via WikiLeaks website.
The exhibit was opened on 2 August under the title “Similarities”.
This is the result of two years of communications between Dewey Haggburg and Manning, Dewey Haggerburg, who combines his discipline with his own skills, computer science and art, and Manning, a well-known dissident, has been imprisoned and has undergone transgenic surgery in prison. Former US President Barack Obama pardoned her remaining sentence three days before the end of her tenure.
Arithmetic analysis from Manning's DNA, which created 30 portraits of "exceedings very likely." Heather Duway Harborg made a sharp and somewhat merciless comment. His comment was both on the multi-meaning nature of DNA and on the concept of identity itself.
Manning was born under the name Bradley Edward, who publicly admitted that she was a woman at puberty. He was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including 6 espionage offences, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photograph, a photo taken in black and white with a pelvis, apparently uneasy, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum-colored wig.
In 2015, Heather Dudwig had a great success in her 2012 project, The Face of Strangers.
In that piece, she used DNA taken from cigarette butts and chewing gum in mid-court exhibits, from scraps, to create portraits of possibly similar 3D characters.
That's exactly an e-mail she received from PaperSmart magazine.
“They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison, and they need a portrait,” Heather Duwie Hubberg said to the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning couldn't visit or take pictures at the time, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
As a result, the artist and her imprisoned muse became impossible pen friends and exchanged many letters over a period of two years.
They even created a comic book, The Repressed Head, by Shoili Kanungu. The comic book envisaged that the president would grant Manning privileges in the future, and that she would be able to see an exhibition in prison.
And Obama asked for her release just a few days after the publication of the book. This may be a coincidence, when Manning spent his seventh year in Kansas Military Prison.
In addition, the exhibition has another meaning. Because of the current US, the Trump government has continuously declared war on government leakers and transgender soldiers, while seeking new ways to unmask the split, which it is trying to bridge.
When asked about all this particular occasion, Heather Duway Harborg said, “Anything happens for a reason”.
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's super-large signature is on the bottom, calling for an end to the “mixed images of parties based on gender, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, with pencils twisting Cs, Gs and As symbols.
With 200 letters (or nucleic acid, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heather Duway Harborg wants to express itself, at least in a physiological structure, by drawing these amazingly similar portraits.
“I hope that people get out of this dilemma, that our genome doesn't care who we are, how open genetic data are interpreted, how subjective it is.” Heather Duway Harborg says his 2007 video, "False Memory," is also on display.
"DNA data can tell many different stories, so this is 30 of them."
The last piece of work in the exhibition, in a room, came from a page in a novel in the illustrations preceding it.
The soldiers in the United States were shown to be exaggerating under a loudspeaker, makin' a manning model.
"When they stop your speech, they win," says the wall.
"So don't shut up."
"This came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm afraid again, and I'm still going to say it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition herself, as foreseen in the comic book, but when she does, she'll have her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters cheering in the center of the gallery.
It's also purposeful, just like all the items in the exhibition, to reach the height of the genetic monolithic information she wrote in pencils (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
“In the past, I put them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a group of people”, Dewey Hagburg said when he spoke of the portrait.
“But I want them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting against her release.”
Professor at Northwestern University and staff at Oxford University are wanted for murder.
According to the police, a man was found to have been fatally stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago and a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were subsequently wanted and are currently searching for suspects throughout the country.
The Cook County Court records show that on Monday, 42-year-old Windham Lesem and 56-year-old Andrew Wallen were arrested for the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranlo for murder without bail in the first instance.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell Duranlo died as a result of multiple stab wounds.
According to a community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July.
Upon receiving a telephone call, the police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment and found several fractures on the victim's body.
According to the police, Cornell Duranlo died on the spot, the detective is investigating the murder, and the police are actively looking for the two suspects.
Lessem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement, the Deputy Director of Campus Relations, Alan K. Cobbage, stated that Lessem had now been separated from his post and had been denied access to the University of the North West campus.
According to Kabechi, “it is now a criminal case and the relevant authorities are investigating it, and the University of Northwestern is actively cooperating with the investigation”.
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
“We have been in contact with the British police and stand ready to assist U.S. investigative agencies as required”, a spokesman for the Summerville College at Oxford University, in an e-mail statement.
The statement added that all of Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped that he would be able to turn himself in.
Anthony Gulermi, Chief Liaison Officer of the Chicago Police Department, expressed strong encouragement to suspects to surrender to the authorities.
Gulermi said that “the police have a general idea of their whereabouts, and we are trying to locate possible locations”.
Gulermi indicated that local, regional and national authorities were fully assisting in the search of suspects.
Gulermi stated that the police had received a telephone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment, and that he had just received a secret reminder that something had happened in apartment No. 1008.
The police claimed that the situation was terrible.
Gulermi stated that it was still unclear whether the incident had also occurred on 27 July.
He stated that, according to the security cameras, it was confirmed that Lesem and Warren were in the building at the time.
“We believe that Professor Lessem has something to do with the victims,” Goodhrmi said.
The management team of Grand Plaza issued a statement to the residents that “the police are currently studying the victim's timeline and circumstances and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident”.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Muteko stated that “we will complete the road map for the world anti-doping agency in the near future”.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Muteko stated that it would not take too long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for restoring the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“The implementation of the road map standards has reached a certain stage, and RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA Road Map has been updated in this regard.” Muteko indicated on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Muteko made this statement in his comments on the second part of the compliance section of the road map of the World Anti-Doping Agency, which sets out the criteria for the restoration of RUSADA rights and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Muteko, the criteria do not contain anything that could give rise to Russian concerns.
He added that “everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be submitted to IOC [IOC] and WADA in the near future.”
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency must publicly accept the findings of the investigation approved by Canadian lawyer Richard MacKaylen on WADA concerning Russian State support for the use of stimulants in national sports.
Turning to this, Muteco said: “We are investigating that our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind it, and we will not acknowledge what does not exist.”
The words of Muteko echoed the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian public anti-doping committee.
Smirnov acknowledged the past problems of the Russian anti-doping agency when he was interviewed by the media earlier that day, but added: “We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and provisions.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally.” Smirnov said.
Following the November 2015 stimulant scandal, WADA suspended the right of RUSADA to carry out stimulant screening in Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate tests this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
During his visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, the Director-General of WADA, Olivia Negri, stated that RUSADA was “going in the right direction” in an effort to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it be chess or national chess, defeating human beings was no longer a matter of decades ago.
In an interview, Croatian FIFA President Davo-Suk said that participation in the Chinese Cup was very interesting for Croatian football and that the number of prizes for the Chinese Cup was very high.
No more surrogates! There's zero duty on more than 8,000 products.
At a regular press conference organized by the Ministry of Commerce on 11 January, the Ministry of Commerce press spokesman indicated at the peak that, to date, there are 15 FTAs in force in our country, covering 23 countries and territories, covering more than 8,000 items of zero-tariff imports.
At the same time, imports of cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean wine, and tropical fruits from ASEAN... these products you want are no longer purchased at great cost.
At present, 16 free trade agreements have been signed with 24 countries and territories and 15 have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 products imported at zero tariffs.
In the case of agricultural products, with the implementation of the FTA, consumers are able to taste agricultural products of varying origin and of good quality and good value every quarter of the year.
For example, in ASEAN, tropical fruits such as durians, twigs and falcons, import tariffs are reduced from 15 to 30 per cent to zero.
Tariffs on Iceland's salmon imports were reduced from 10 to 12 per cent to zero;
(a) Red wine in Georgia and Chile, where import tariffs are reduced from 14 to 30 per cent to zero;
There are also significant tax cuts for special agricultural products such as beef and milk powder in New Zealand.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, part of the import of cosmetics in Switzerland has been reduced to zero;
(b) A 50 per cent reduction in duty duties on selected watch imports, which will be reduced to zero in a few years;
Korea's imports of products such as refrigerators, cooking pans, massage machines and beauty machines have been reduced by 40 per cent and will be reduced to zero in a few years'time;
There are also significant tax reductions for consumer-type electronics, among others.
At the same time, tariff-free products under the FTA include intermediate products and raw materials for the manufacture of many domestic final consumer goods, which have contributed to some structural upgrading of domestically produced consumer goods.
The Ministry of Commerce's press spokesman has indicated at a peak that our imports of nearly one third of all products are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Goods, most of which are final consumer goods, with tangible benefits for consumers.
Further reduction of tariffs on imports of consumer goods
Since 1 December 2017, we have adjusted our tariffs on the import of some consumer goods to further reduce those on consumer goods, covering all kinds of consumer goods such as food, health-care products, medicines, daily goods, footwear, household equipment, cultural entertainment and general goods, for a total of 187 tariff numbers.
The average tax rate for this consumer product will drop from 17.3 per cent to 7.7 per cent, almost “stopping” it!
We have also partially adjusted our customs duties on other imports and exports since 1 January 2018.
(b) Tariffs on imports of cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shadow and perfume were reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent;
Lowering tariffs means that consumers do not have to purchase or go all the way abroad to buy their favorite foreign products.
2018 U.S. Imported Merries Festival: Imports of wine, snacks, fruits are cheap!
Exterior: At the end of the year, U.S. malls are very different.
China-New Network December 29th.
According to the United States Daily News, just after Christmas, there was a retreat.
According to the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), about half of the goods sold last Christmas were re-sold.
In addition, readers have been defrauded on a number of occasions to buy content, and consumers need to be careful when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but when buying gifts or electricity from small shops, care must be taken.
Ms. Huo of Rolandon bought a coat on 1 December local time at an online shop specializing in stamp jackets, at a cost of over 60 (US$, under the same) and has not yet arrived.
She sent an e-mail to the customer's service, and she didn't reply.
There were also reports of visits to the United States last year to buy a mobile phone from a third-party seller, which was sent and found to be a box of rubber mud.
After knowing that he had been deceived, he applied to the website for a refund, which was good enough to be paid in full.
However, there are customers who believe that the website refund service is not 100 per cent perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident in Northern California, said that he had purchased an emergency distribution service for a website twice and an emergency service for $4 a time, but had failed to deliver it twice on time.
No response was received to a subsequent application for a refund.
Large malls or shopping malls have a better return policy.
Most of Macy's commodities are fully refunded within 180 days.
Goods must, however, remain “old” and must have purchase vouchers such as receipts or bank purchase records.
In the absence of a certificate, the customer may also obtain a market score that can be used for the purchase of other commodities.
Target usually had a 90-day return period for general commodities, and electronics usually had 15 days.
However, the period for the return of electronic and recreational goods purchased between 1 November and 25 December 2017 was extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day period for refunds began to run on 25 December, i.e. before 25 January 2018.
A great shopping experience, a new era of shopping in the business world.
More than a decade ago, we were in the overall seller market with limited options and limited demand.
After 10 years of development, however, markets have long been transformed from seller to buyer markets, and consumer tastes have become worse today, and they are no longer satisfied with simple shopping practices of “one-hand delivery”.
Thus, how to give consumers an extreme shopping experience becomes the next competition for real estate developers.
Among the many factors affecting consumer shopping experiences, the impact of shopping centres in the business community is most significant.
It's about how local city builders focus on shopping experiences.
There are no identical leaves in the world, no identical shopping malls, and a famous shopping mall necessarily has its own characteristics.
In Turkey, for example, the world-famous Kanyon shopping mall, whose unique wave-shaped architecture is inspired by Canyon, is named Kanyon, who walks in the 200-metre walk of Minister Kanyon as if it were inside the Grand Canyon.
In addition to canyon-style designs, there is a large elliptical performance site in the centre of shopping malls, which is unique in shape and often features.
The open platform was designed to allow tourists to walk on each floor to look down at the activities carried out in the “cany” and have the effect of a change of scenery.
At home, the Nanjing Forest Moor Commercial Street, known as China's first forest-style stroll-and-collage, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
The 7000 square metres Green Square, the 3,000 square metres roof water platform, is a project consisting of nine single-body buildings, air-column links between the buildings, the overall submersion courtyard design, the top of which is the surface of the building, the roof water roof, and the creation of a forest-like feeling.
Walking into the forest moor is like falling into a rabbit hole in Alice's vagabonds, climbing the trunks surrounding the building, the grasses, the springs, and bringing people into a forest full of life and vitality.
Also in Chongqing, Long Lake built the Salvain Water Community to plan 100 different businesses and plans to introduce in the future more than 50 international top-selling flagships, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 national and foreign brands to become centres of business with a focused focus on the services industry.
In addition, the Reginan Water Community integrates ecology into buildings, is guided by tod public transport, is integrated into fashion shopping, living services, catering, recreation, education and sports, and provides consumers with great shopping experience while at the same time leading them to enjoy the unique “waterfront culture” of Chongqing, which combines shopping with aquatic recreation and leisure.
On the whole, it can be seen that some housing enterprises are now familiar with this new urban business trajectories, and industry sources suggest that this consumer model, centred on the consumer experience, and how to combine shopping with experience, will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
The business world today is not just a repository of goods, but also a complex of artistic and creative themes, which also carries with it responsibility for urban settlements.
Thus, while meeting the one-stop material needs of consumers to eat and play, maximizing the multilayered spiritual need for the transmission of cultural arts and the need for habitable housing is necessarily a high point for the future development of the business community.
In Chongqing, the north bank of the nation is located north of the river, close to the bridge, close to the sound bridge, the world's commercial excellence, the international conglomerates around the world, and first-class brands are congregated to connect to international fashion.
There's a lot of pace here, and there's a lot of beauty in the world.
Toyohara, for its part, has a better shopping environment. Toshihara, which is close to the South Lawn Business Circle, has an exclusive access to the four-storey, and even the country's leading, four-storey traffic system, which enhances the comfort of shopping.
In addition, the greening of the gardens and landscape floors on the two walking streets of the Leisure Work Road and Wanda Square have been upgraded by planting approximately 300 logs, renovating 40,000 square metres of land and raising the profile of the business community on the South Lawn;
Lake Dragon Lake One, near Chongqing's first low-density waterfront business, surrounded by nine parks, low density and openness of commercial neighbourhoods, makes people more willing to stay, stay and enjoy the pleasure of shopping, rather than rushing ahead in a rush by people behind them.
Today's commercial competition will only grow stronger, and it will be worthwhile for all real estate developers to think seriously about how to kill a bloody path in a highly homogenous market and win the reputation of a “shopping shrine” in the hearts of future consumers.
Disparity strategies alone are far from sufficient, and only those developers who really put consumers in their minds, rush consumers, think consumers' minds, and offer consumers an excellent and easy shopping experience can laugh in the markets where storms come.
Of course, at the end of the day, I think it is the people of Chongqing who have such good shopping experience and business circles that no one could have imagined today's prosperity 10 years ago.
Festival: Consumerist carnivals to mask real environmental prices
16,82.2 billion dollars, which is the equivalent of 24 hours of the 11th Global Carnival of Skycats on 11 November 2017.
Specifically, three minutes after the launch of the “double 11” cat trades over $10 billion, over $20 billion in six minutes and five seconds, and 100 billion in nine hours.
On that day, the total number of payments made by consumers worldwide through the payment of treasures amounted to 1.48 billion, an increase of 41 per cent over the previous year.
Such consumption will result in 812 million logistics orders.
Whether Skycat buys platforms or pay-as-you-go platforms, they belong to the Ali Group in Maun.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that the monolithic subculture created by single youth on 11 November, out of self-scoffing, would be compiled by electric dealers as a “double 11” shopping carnival of today's phenomenon.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used the first marketing head of the "Long Stick Festival": no one was in love with you, so the "single dogs" came to buy it online.
Surprisingly, this day's trade in Treasure Stewardship (the front of Sky Cat) went up by $52 million, 10 times the amount of the day's day-to-day trade.
Since then, the “double 11” has become a shopping carnival built by Ali Baba, with domestic buyers enjoying themselves from the beginning to the current influx of global traders. Nine years later, the “double 1.1 billion” trade in Skycats has been more than 3,200 times the same year, making the “black Friday” impossible.
There are also a number of power suppliers, among them the most powerful.
“Kingdong” has its own shopping festival “6.18” but has no “double 11” impact, with a cumulative sales value of 12.7 billion yuan from 1 to 11 November this year.
After the “twilight 11”, it was followed by a similar “twilight 12” festivities and Christmas New Year shopping slots.
After the New Year, Chinese consumers were waiting for the pre-spring annual purchase slots, Valentine's Day shopping slots, and did not spend time off.
The environmental implications of instantaneous consumption have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua's daily telecommunications, at least 300,000 tons of garbage were generated this year during the “double 11” period, based on a conservative estimate of the normal standard of 0.2 kg per box in industry.
Liu Hua, Director of Pollution Prevention and Control Project, Greenpeace East Asia Division, told the Chinese-China dialogue that this year's “double 11” Skycat-only orders generated 160,000 tons of packaged garbage.
A report issued by the National Postal Service in 2016 indicated that, during the “double 11” period (11-16 November) in 2015, there were approximately 780 million pieces of fastware, using more than 3 billion woven bags, 9,922 million boxes and 16,985 million metres of tape, with tape lengths around the Earth's equator 425 laps.
This year, the National Post Office expects the “double 11” fastware volume to exceed 1.5 billion.
The manager of a waste-burning centre in Beijing City, Wang, told Xinhua Society that more than 2,000 tons of garbage had been brought into the yard every day after “two 11”, and that it exceeded the capacity of the burning station.
Express delivery companies have become aware of the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry.
A number of power suppliers, including Suning, introduced recycled and reused plastic delivery boxes before “double 11”, recycling bags that could be reused as shopping bags and garbage bags, etc., but did not have high acceptance among troubled consumers.
Maun also called on the logistics industry to support “green packaging” and “green logistics” in Twitter.
This microblogging has yielded more than 68,000 “goods”.
What kind of mobile payments do the Germans want?
JANG Dongfeng: The mobile payment battle in Germany is not looking forward to it.
We don't pay and pay but to move the battlefield to Europe. The rivals have not changed, the position has not changed — the Chinese — and so is globalization?
And wherefore there shall be a payment of treasure, and there shall be a payment of a Weife.
Pursuant to an agreement with Wirecard, the German electronic payment service provider, the payment was formally made in November this year in Germany and is gradually being laid out by businesses in the European context.
The two “home towns” met this time in Europe.
The payment of treasures and the payment of micro-mails have been singing all along the path of globalization.
With regard to China's approach to the globalization of mobile payments, Irene's consultation on the China Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Study 2017 concluded that there were two types of measures: strategic investment, export of experience, equity and support for foreign home-grown mobile pay enterprises.
The second is the promotion of mobile payment services to foreign businesses through the consumption behaviour of Chinese tourists abroad, thereby changing the perception and acceptance of China's mobile payments by foreign natives.
It's true, the Chinese get the world.
China's rapid economic development, coupled with its large population base, is an attractive figure for Chinese tourists in Europe.
But it is also doomed that the Chinese mobile payment battle in Germany this time will not be expected.
Is it also globalization when we pay and pay the treasure to move the battlefield to Europe, where the rivals have not changed, where the positions seized — or the Chinese — have not changed?
What is more pioneering is the question of whether China's mobile payments can spread across Europe's interior?
Take Germany, for example.
"New Retail" enchanted.
Chen, Yang Kaihe: The Amazon announces military bookstores and grocery stores, regardless of timing or motivation, as it crowds into the world’s 10 largest retailers.
In November 2015, Amazon opened the first entity bookshop in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and Santiago.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened a shop in New York and plans to have at least eight by the end of the year.
At almost the same time, Amazon announced that no-man's supermarket (Amazon Go) was running on a trial basis, that customers did not have to wait in line to the store, nor did they have to close the accounts, that they could just go through the door and take away the goods they wanted, and that the purchase money would automatically be deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
As far as the Amazon is concerned, it is quite surprising that, in recent years, there has been a sudden movement on the physical stores.
Because as early as 2007, in an open letter to shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that the Amazon would not open a real shop easily unless the following four conditions were met at the same time:
1. We must be sure that this new opportunity will yield returns on shareholders'investments;
2. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great importance to the company as a whole;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
We must be convinced that in this market we have sufficient resources to make customer-oriented differences.
Bookshops and grocery stores are the most shaky classification of retail sales in both entities and the first to fall in the wake of the rise of the Amazon.
The Amazon announced its entry into the markets of both entities, regardless of timing or motivation, as it crowds into the world's 10 largest retailers.
Was the Amazon practice contrary to the assurances contained in the shareholder's letter?
Similar voices were heard on the other side of the globe. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the Hangzhou Cloud Habitat Congress, President Ma Yun of the Board of Directors of Alibaba gave a keynote address.
He said, “From next year, Alibaba will no longer mention the term ‘electronic commerce’.
The era of pure power suppliers will soon come to an end and there will be no e-commerce in the next 10 or 20 years, to be replaced by “new retailing”.
New retailing takes place when there is a combination of on-line and logistics.”
At one point, the word “new retailing” appeared to have been enchanted and to have been spoken by the industry.
But what exactly does “new retail” mean?
If it's just a combination of fingers and lines, then the concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer, after tracking 180 of the largest electricity suppliers, estimated the total sales to be around $200 billion, of which the largest 25 accounted for more than $159 billion.
Of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers (e.g. Macy's Department, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.) that have only started operating on the line in the last five years.
The Alibaba Group is also well known for its $28.3 billion share in Sunning Clouds.
Globally, retailers and electricians are moving from a single channel to an all-channel retail system that covers real shops, power suppliers, mobile end-users and socialized media.
Is Maunti “new retailing” more a summing-up than a vision for the future?
If not, what is the difference between the whole channel concept and “new retailing”?
Perhaps the point is not whether or not to merge online with underline, but rather how to integrate.
Looking back at the past 20 years of retail trade, the rise of electricity suppliers, like the rise of early-year discounted retailers, focused on prices and convenience.
Depending on these two pains, the electrician moved the highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, from the bottom of the line to the line.
With the development of online consumption habits and the growing experience of clients, the electrician has extended its tentacles to other groups of goods and has begun to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO, “The use of Internet ideas and technologies to comprehensively reform and upgrade the existing stock of about 30 trillion social retailers makes it possible to effectively meet the rising consumer demand of Chinese consumers and makes the entire process of production, circulation and servicing of goods more efficient because of the extensive use of the Internet and big data”.
Thus, the road for the electrician is a path that is superficially light and actually heavy on assets.
“Light” means that the burden of fixed assets, staffing, management processes, etc. is not high in the traditional retail industry; “Light” means that significant inputs are required in logistics, warehousing, etc.
Changes in logistics modalities have ensured the efficiency of power suppliers.
According to the Chinese Government's online sources, Premier Li Keqiang of the State Council hosted the State Council's Standing Meeting on 28 April, which considered the expansion of domestic consumption demand to be an important step towards steady growth and structural adjustment.
It was determined that specific programmes would need to be developed by the relevant departments on the basis of scientific assessments as a matter of urgency.
(b) The introduction by the end of June this year of a pilot project to reduce import tariffs and gradually expand the range of tariff-reducing goods for a large portion of foreign consumer demand;
(b) To improve consumer tax policies on consumer goods, such as clothing and cosmetics, in the context of the reform of the tax system, and to harmonize tax coverage, rates and collection lines;
(b) The creation and rehabilitation of border entry duty-free shops, the rational expansion of the tax-free variety and the increase of a certain amount of duty-free shopping to facilitate the purchase of foreign products by domestic consumers in the country;

On 18 January, in Chongqing, Ali Baba held a high-level dialogue on de-poverty among electricians, announcing the promotion of poverty eradication and rural revitalization through the exploration of a new “Internet+ anti-poverty” model.
This is a new “plus” for the fight against poverty, following the introduction of village strategies, the launch of rural treasure-hunting projects, the launch of online agricultural platforms to combat poverty and the establishment of the Ali Baba poverty alleviation fund.
The fight against poverty is one of China's most important national strategies of the present time.
Overall poverty eradication has never been achieved in China in the last few thousand years.
“The alleviation of poverty by electric power suppliers is an innovation in the new round of pro-poor development and is an important enabler in achieving the goal of poverty reduction and poverty eradication.
The Centre attaches great importance to, and notes, the role that the Internet can play in contributing to the fight against poverty by promoting the eradication of poverty through precision, precision and the release of agricultural products from the countryside through the Internet.”
As a result, as early as 2014, Ali proposed a village strategy, along with big data cloud computing and globalization, as three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Treasure (Village) Project to recruit “Village II” in the village, leading farmers out of poverty through electricity dealers.
In 2017, Ali, in partnership with the business sector, created the Agriculture for Poverty Channel, which now brings together 13 provinces, 120 poor counties at the national level.
Ali's platform has already generated 2,118 treasure-hunting villages.
Of these, close to 400 are found in poor districts in provinces and 33 in poor districts in 13 countries.
In 2017, at the Alibaba China retail platform, the country's treasure-hunting village sales amounted to 120 billion yuan.
Zhang Yong stated that, in the face of a national strategy to fight poverty, Ali had been thinking about how to use the technological, big data, cloud computing and other innovative capabilities of the Ali's economy to make a new way out of poverty.
Among them, the village is the main platform for Ali's electricity suppliers to lift themselves out of poverty, and a new link to the Internet to lift them out of poverty, which is directly available for sale.
In the planting chain, village-run and ant gold garments jointly support farming tools and micro-credits.
In 2017, 795 ants served in 832 poor counties at the national level, providing easy payment, credit, etc.
Greenbirds address storage and logistics, Skycats are responsible for marketing, and Aryan's big data counterfeasible guides agricultural production and further improves the standards of supply, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of electricity suppliers out of poverty requires not only products, marketing channels, industrial planning, but also human resources.
Ali has achieved a combination of “poverty-plus mind-raising” and sustainable poverty eradication through the introduction of electricity-business courses at the University of Boeing, which teach farmers standardized, quality-based and scale-based farming methods.
These courses have covered some 92 per cent of the poor counties at the national level.
The “public good mentality, business instruments” approach to poverty eradication also guarantees Ali's “real poverty reduction” when it comes to poverty reduction.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Alibaba, Maun, had stated that poverty eradication should be divided into three phases: poverty alleviation, poverty eradication and enrichment.
Poverty alleviation is for fish, for fish, and for fish, for fish, and for wealth is for farmers to build a “fish pond” and for farmers to have fish to feed.
The power-driven industries that are pro-poor are fish ponds.
In the area of industrial poverty alleviation, the model for poverty alleviation in the Los Angeles Apple industry, developed by Ali in cooperation with Shaan Shirokawa, has been replicated throughout the country as an example.
Anti-poverty efforts by Ali's electricity suppliers have also been recognized at the decision-making level.
Electric companies, represented by Alibaba, have been sent to ensure that farmers increase their yields through online and offline channels.
A number of village Xiaoji and ants in gold uniforms have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experiences in lifting electricity suppliers out of poverty.
Currently, the China office of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has been working with the village to reduce poverty in the electricity industry, including in Anhui.
On January 16, the Third Congress of the New Economic think tank, co-organized by the Ali Institute and the China Vision think tank, was attended by and addressed by Zhang Li, Director of the Institute of Electric Business of the Ministry of Commerce.
She believes that our globalization has actually ignored the most important issues, namely, the nature and use of globalization and the stages of globalization.
Many thus believe that globalization has stagnated and that many developed and developing countries have different attitudes and models towards globalization in the new phase.
The second is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what are the constraints of the medium-term phase of globalization?
The economic environment is constrained precisely by the changes in the economic base that have taken place as a result of globalization.
According to Zhang Lei, the global economic restructuring was largely over by the end of 2017, and a new round of growth would enter after 2018, the next round of growth must be a raw product.
The 7FRESH, the first birth market in Kyoto, has opened in recent days and plans to open more than 1,000 shops throughout the country over the next three to five years.
Together with Ali's box of horse fresh life, immortal super species, Sunin's fresh life, and the fish and fish of the United States, the “new retail store” has begun to pile up and to “squeak” each other on innovative models and even prices.
The race for fresh supermarkets has escalated and has become a phenomenonal issue in the new retail sector, where is the new retailing?
“In 2018, we will enter the country quickly, opening a lot of shops in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival.”
On the occasion of the Second New Retail Summit, the 10-year-old CEO revealed the "new game" of 2018.
“As of 2018, the boxhorse is not just a raw electrician, but a consumer's immediate-service consumer.
Underneath the core mode is the flow, the experience, and on the line is the real sale.”
Unlike traditional malls, supermarkets, boxes of horses are in the eyes of many consumers a fun and delicious “red shop”, and even intermediaries have developed the concept of “boxrooms”.
Both on-line power platforms and off-line retailers have advantages and disadvantages, while consumers appear through multiple channels, so both parties are trying the full-channel model.
The industry believes that, in the larger context of rising consumption, there will be an increase in the number of “cattlehorse” shops in 2018.
In the new year, there will be more innovation in the retail market.
"For example, a business model that combines online and underlines attracts the eyes of consumers, and the local supermarkets are called and called."
“These relationships talk too much, they don't work, and it turns out that you've brought a good experience to the consumer before I'm willing to pay.”
In the view of CEO Yuan Bin, a co-chair of the Big Rush Flying Bull Network, consumer habits have changed in the new retail environment and demand for purchases has changed.
Turns out the line was cut off, the line was broken, the line was beaten, the line was counter-attacked, and now the consumer is holding hands together, as there is no longer any distinction between the line and the line.
The competition for capital has made the new retail gunpowder, currently represented by fresh supermarkets, feel perfect.
The analysis found that the current pattern of new retail competition in first-line cities is far from reaching the Red Sea and that there are large areas of second-line cities yet to be excavated, and markets remain open and open.
Different types of industries bring the development of new retailing into a diversified state of development for new retailing.
In conjunction with the Institute of Financial and Economic Strategy of the China Institute of Social and Economic Sciences, China's Finance and Economics channel provides you with a dry product, which is the annual development report of China's electricity merchants, which is dwindled in the country.
What kind of report card has the Chinese electrician produced in the past year?
What are the trends in global electricity suppliers?
Let's do this for everyone.
Total sales are back on track at record speed again.
Since 2006, our online retail sales can be said to have been growing at a very high rate, and it's probably so cool to think that online purchases are fresh and can't be bought without a door.
However, starting in 2013, the increase in online retail sales began to fall below 50 per cent, with the first increase below 40 per cent in 2015 and 26.2 per cent in 2016.
This year, however, the situation is different, with retail sales on the Internet accelerating again, rising to 34.2 per cent in January-September this year.
The growth rate was significantly higher than in 2015 and 2016.
It may be that you're going around in circles and find it more pleasant to buy and buy.
Of this amount, the value of online retail sales of goods in kind is close to $5.08 trillion and the value of online retail sales of services is close to $1.49 trillion.
The share of total retail sales of social goods amounted to 13.6 per cent, an increase of almost 3 percentage points over the same period.
Class, don't fall asleep, focus. It's a great deal of retail sales on the Internet.
Second, French Internet users who love chopsticks, who buy $1925 per person, buy the most products on the Internet, which are clothing, worthy of being a fashionable country.
It's my favorite Internet purchase. Must be a young man?
To help you avoid the company becoming the next best starter.
Amy Erett used to want to investigate employee well-being at her e-commerce start-up company, but it didn't work.
Responses are often vague, unhelpful and even worse, deceptive.
Even though she was committed to anonymity, some employees still did not trust the process.
Eret was responsible for managing 75 people's San Francisco e-commerce and development company Madison Reed, who stated that “the responses received lacked consistency and objectivity”.
So she called outside to ask for help.
A new pool of start-ups in human resources has emerged in the wake of the rains, helping companies to understand how employees feel.
They build and empower software specifically designed to measure staff participation, thus allowing companies to conduct rapid polls for specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees and, in some cases, allow whistleblowers to report directly to the board of directors.
"Now, you can track your health by using some tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where's the company Fitbit?" Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive officer of the Redwood Enterprise. Glint's software analysis tool is used by companies to measure employee professionalism.
Eret said that in three years, she had gained more insight into the thinking and feelings of her employees using Glint.
In addition to rapid surveys and opinion polls by specific teams, Glint also provides company heat maps, which units have the highest number of complaints, which managers have low approval scores, and it is clear that this allows her to gain insight into the reasons.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must be skilled in taking control of the company’s workplace culture so that they do not become the next advantage.
For start-ups such as Glint, this corporate desire for supervision is an invaluable business opportunity.
The value of the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry is likely to exceed $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Financial Technology Analysis website Let's Talk Regulations.
Convercent, a start-up firm in Denver, Colorado, was committed to helping companies to prevent and detect bad behaviour, and saw an increase in interest and activity during the loss of the reputation of the elite earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Episode, Microsoft and Tesla.
Yuzuki has recently signed into a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized “diagnosis” surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view hot maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides anonymous SMS hotlines for staff to report misconduct.
If the chairman of the board is implicated, the complaint will go directly to the board of directors.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Convercent, stated: “The Court of Opinion usurps the powers of the regulatory body.
If a company is found to have treated its employees badly or to have behaved unethically against them, it may face the high consequences of consumer resistance, staff loss and involvement in litigation, as Quinlan indicates, even if the regulator is not involved.
Ruby Tuesday, a catering chain that spans more than 500 places and has more than 25,000 employees, has been in use for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of work norms and work protocols and provide easy access to company headquarters.
Prior to that, if an employee wishes to report a problem, he or she must find the company's head office telephone number or e-mail and lodge a formal complaint, which he or she hopes will be taken seriously.
This has often been a frightening and disturbing experience, as documented by James Witrano, the chief legal adviser to Ruby Tuesday, who believes that there is no good way to track complaints from employees.
But now that the company uses Convercent, it can more quickly identify and resolve problems that were previously unknown to a remote office, city or state, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage behaviour.
"I can get a full picture of my work experience closer, 360 degrees." Vitrano, who is responsible for Ruby Tuesday's risk management team, says.
“We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation.”
According to Quinlan, since 2002, companies have placed greater emphasis on ethics, values and staff professionalism in the wake of the closure of the Andorran firm of accountants for violating ethics through the Enron scandal.
But it was only after “social media went into their own world” that companies realized that they could not stop their blasts from spreading the virus online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, hope is seen as a strategy”, he said.
Both Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service and charge companies recurrent fees for the use of their products.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture investors who have already supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising its total capital to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million in funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, with a total of $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness of corporate, cultural and venture investments, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing number of studies show that today's employees have higher expectations of the workplace than before.
In a highly competitive market such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting items are mere bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued and that their time is spent on a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company, feel their voices heard, and what they do is useful, they're more committed to making the company succeed," says Nina McCartney, Vice-President of the Global Welfare and Staff Experience. LinkedIn uses both Convercent and Glint software.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio is performing well; companies are performing well in terms of employee loyalty and professionalism.
If the third-party analysis tool commits to increasing staff loyalty and professionalism, it is not surprising that they will seek financial support.
Experts on workplace culture said that it was important to have data on staff professionalism.
However, these data are useless unless corporate managers take action.
In fact, if a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be expected that the company is undergoing change.
If change is not moving fast enough, or if little progress is made, it may create disappointment and lead to the separation of staff from the company.
“If you want to look for 4000 proposals, then you need to be ready for 4000 conversations.” He has seen some mistakes in companies that rely too heavily on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow it all, the staff will think, "Do you really hear me?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I?"
Eret said that Madison Reed was now conducting a monthly staff survey and had been able to take action on the day that Glint reported the problem.
After collecting feedback from staff on their frustrations due to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by reorganizing her intra-company team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees and, in the long run, hopes to be able to make a shift in this industry, which is known for its high brain drain rate, to better retain its staff.
“If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you'll lose your talent.” Vitrano says.
"If you lose talent, you lose clients.
And when you lose your client, you lose your company."

NCAAA cancels twice a day and extends the daytime training of the Bears.
At approximately 11 p.m., members of the football team of the University of California, Los Angeles, wandered and chatted next to the team's new campus practice.
Some of the players have taken off their sweatshirts and exposed their bodies after hard training on the first day of the camp.
For a large part of the team, the few minutes are a break.
After three hours of practice, the participants in the summer course will return to the dormitory to prepare for the final exam and then return to the Wasserman Football Centre at 6.30 a.m. the following morning.
"The next three days are a choreographer for these guys," the bear coach Jim Mora said on Monday coming into Tuesday.
NCAA cancelled its practice twice a day (in order to ease the burden on the players), but actually extended their training time during the day - at least by Friday.
That's why the first three training sessions at UCLA are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to adjust to the crowding schedule.
From the cancellation of training twice a day to more training once a day, the Bears started training almost a week before the last season, and Moira first trained at the summer school during the six seasons in Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions from August 20 and then start preparing for the official race for Texas farmers in September.
Mora said that he supported the adjustment of the NCAA rules, although that would allow the players to have a busy trip to add another project.
“In three or four days, we will give them a huge amount of training, which is very challenging.” Mora said.
"They've just passed. They're grinding. They're great kids.
I think we'll have more time on Saturday. It's really great."
This is not an easy task, considering the proximity of the parking lot and the clear view of Luskin Center. The Luskin Center High Hotel has been thrown across the fence behind the goalpost.
Starting this weekend, members of the Bears will be staying at the hotel. But Mora admits that if these rooms are vacant during the season, there may be problems.
"We'll take security measures," Mora said.
“This is a real concern. The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in a room and record the training scene is not too far-fetched.
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good.
But we'll take security measures there, and we'll take security measures in parking lot 8.
We will make the best use of existing resources.
I wouldn't worry too much about it.
We've made plans.”
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) show that, in the second quarter of this year, the value of houses in Australia rose by an average of 1.5 to 2 per cent, an annual increase of 3.5 per cent, the lowest annual increase since March 2013.
At a time when real estate intermediaries expect more properties to be sold during the holiday season, Australian housing prices have risen to their lowest level since 2013.
House IT reported this morning that the Wall Street Journal reported that AT&T had cancelled its plans to sell China's new flagship smartphones in the United States.
China planned to announce this partnership on CES this week, and AT&T cancelled it at the last minute.
In response, on 9 January, Chinese journalists responded that on 9 January, local United States time, China would release new products and specific listing information to the United States market.
China has demonstrated its strength over the past five years through the introduction of high-end products in the global and United States markets.
According to earlier reports from IT House, China will launch a “best cell phone you've never heard of” at the CES exhibition in Las Vegas on the afternoon of 9 January, and will be able to sustain two days of use.
The industry is generally of the view that the Chinese flagship phone, which is about to be released, is Mate 10 Pro, on board the Android Oreo system.
On September 30th, the film "I am not the Pankin Lian", featuring Guo Tao, Da Peng and Zhang Jia's translator, will be launched throughout the country.
Yesterday, the film held a seminar in Beijing on the theme “The sadness of comedy”, attended by three guests: Feng Xiaogang, Ning Ho and Da Peng.
The director is the speciality of the caption "I am not the Pankin Lianne ", the confluence of the map, and especially the newness of the picture taken from the masked lens.
Fong Xiaogang explained: "This topic is like the Qiu Ju case of art director Zhang, it's easy to think together, and I want to do it in a way that we don't use. There's nothing special about it, but to think it's funny, to do something special."
Von Xiaogang called himself a virgin, learned how to make a round picture with the photographer, and even spent millions of dollars on a 10-minute audition for the photographer.
Facebook will launch a fact-checking feature to counter false news.
Facebook announced on Thursday that it would send more potential prank articles to third-party testing agencies and show the results under the original post. Facebook, the world’s largest online social network, is trying to crack so-called false news.
In a statement on its website, Facebook stated that Facebook would begin to use an updated machine to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to the fact-checker, and might show the results of the fact-finding under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main outlets of the so-called false news, and many believe that Facebook has influenced the 2016 presidential election in the United States.
This issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, with voters experiencing a proliferation of false stories before the May presidential elections in France, Germany taking the lead in adopting a scheme of fines before the September elections, and a fine if social media networks fail to remove hate posters in a timely manner.
In a separate statement in Germany on Thursday, Facebook indicated that a new fact-finding functional test was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing stories that are questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to help them make informed decisions about reading and sharing.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its “relevant articles” function and make other changes to its press summaries to reduce false news.
Create a drawing novel: The story of the Castle of England
Recently, the tiny Castle of Scottney played a leading role in a compressed version of the music film and was once a refuge for Mrs. Margaret Thatcher in the '70s and '80s.
But Scotney, who witnessed 700 years of turmoil in the comfort of the Baylor Gorge in Kent, is now a source of inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire who has a special interest in historical documents and has a moped.
"I can see the ancient handwriting 300 years ago, and I find it so beautiful," he says.
“What kind of personality is this in order to leave this letter in my hands.”
Throughout the Middle Ages and through the Eduard era, the book “A Castle of England” recorded the families living in Scottney, each story being done by different future artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briany May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book by Rhodes that is based on archives: he also wrote " The Dead's Tooth and Other Story 2014 ", a book inspired by the British Library's literature, a work that he had done with uncontrollable creative passion.
He said, "I couldn't contain my writing impulse from the moment I saw the thumbprint left on the side of the letter, which was written by a double agent who worked for Jacobs in the 18th century."
"That's his fingerprints!
And the letter always smells like smoke, because then you need to light it up to light it up.
For us 300 years later, this smell makes us feel that they are also around us.
Oh, I love the archives!"
For those touched by the old paper, it seems wonderful to have been able to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust and Arts Council of England (“To be honest, I've been here a little too long”), and I can't believe it.
Rhodes spent several days visiting Victoria's “new” castle, looking at archives, studying many of the estate's treasures and ancient games, such as hyena heads hanging on walls and bottles that spent centuries in the moat.
He walks on the land and ruins of the old castles, chats with homeless people, gardeners and sometimes artistes who draw illustrations for his books.
And then at night, he'll "drink whiskey and write."
The hidden history of Scotney is not yet clear, because the British National Trust was fully entered only after the death of Elizabeth Hershey, the last heir in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff began processing the files, which he described as "the nobles of hundreds of years ago are leaving": "Oh, put them in the attic."
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps of national boundaries: “You'll think land disputes are boring” Rhodes says, “But two families will fight for a white birch tree.
Let go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the work began with castles, which led to a broader study of British history, including The Labor, which was traced to a man who left the new castle to participate in the peasant uprising of 1381.
The story of the book called Knights of Kent and Sussex recorded a riot in the castle in 1380, which Rhodes said.
“The peasants' uprising began in that area, and I think it was a good place to launch it.
Maybe there's a connection between these two?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of castles, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the reform of the British religion.
Or The Smuggler, whose name is Arthur Darrell, the smuggler of the 18th century, who is supposed to have his own funeral by filling his coffin with stones.
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Castle Scottney: “These gentlemen seem to be scoundrels, always borrowing money to buy things they can't afford.
Generations of Darrell men solve their debt by marrying rich old women, and I think they should be handsome young men who know how to pursue women.”
As his mission in the castle ended, Rhodes began to look for other peculiar writing experiences.
In the wilderness of Finland, he completed a drawing novel in two weeks, entitled “El?um?nm?ki”, which was a sanatorium in the early 20th century and which was slowly abandoned.
But Scotney has a special position for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"It's like, "Oh, I've got to go face-to-face in real life."
According to journalists, the Chinese intelligent car team is based in Pearlhai and the executive vice-president of communications in Central China, Tanjo.
Large energy companies are all “rich and enemy countries”, so who is the best of the many energy companies around the world?
Yesterday, the well-known PFC Energy Corporation announced its top 50 rankings of publicly listed energy companies in 2011, with the United States oil and gas producer Exxon Mobil championing at a market value of $406.3 billion, followed by Chinese oil and the Dutch Royal Shell.
In this list of PFCs, in 2007 and 2009, the top of the list was held by Exxon Mobil.
In 2011, out of the top 50 rankings, three companies from China and China entered, with Chinese petrochemicals number 9 and Chinese marine oil number 15, in addition to Chinese oil ranking 2.
According to the PFC, however, although the current price of oil is much higher than it was four years ago, PFC Energy Co. CEO notes that there are many reasons for the low overall market value, including mainly the decline in natural gas prices in North America and the low activity of the global stock market.
According to Xinhua, the heavy-polluted weather in and around Kyunjin has increased further since 16, with the emergence of a “blast watch” at the North Shojia, Sindang and AQI in the city of Xinjiang.
U.S. modification of green card regulations
The media quoted President Donald Trump's statement that the United States would launch a new immigration plan to amend the green card regulations.
The scheme is intended to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, and temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications are subject to stricter restrictions.
The new provisions were proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
The American media quoted Trump as saying that “this law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and achieve these benefits by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will replace the current programme and reduce chain migration.
This new application process is beneficial for applicants who speak English, have financial support and have skills that are beneficial to economic development.”
On 29 May, the first China Fireworks Safety and Environment Fair will be held in Xiaoyang.
The event will focus on the theme “Technology, safety, and environmental protection” for two days.
The Expo will invite a large number of experts, entrepreneurs and academic exchanges in the fireworks and fireworks industry to share the latest technology for the safe and environmentally sound use of fireworks and fireworks.
Among these, the demonstration of fireworks mechanized production equipment and safe and environmentally friendly products will take place in the town of Oyster, and the main exhibition projects will include technically mature, scientifically certified and safely validated fireworks for the production of drug-related machinery, low sensitivity, low explosive energy, safe and environmentally friendly personal combustion products such as sulphur-free, micro-smoke, etc.
At the same time, the demonstration of fireworks and fireworks safety and environmental products, which was organized by a group of 16 cedar companies, was divided into product selection and product demonstration phases, and the demonstration of excellent new products, which were selected in the previous period, will take place on the evening of 29 May at the ceremonial gallery and the gold beach burning site in ceremonial city.

In order to optimize the landscape environment and build a beautiful South Yue, the “636” volunteer corps of the South Yue Tobacco Specialized Agency (branch) recently launched an environmental campaign entitled “Ramping the forest, caring for the home”.
The campaign was supported not only by the entire staff of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also by the involvement of retired senior staff members and their families in environmental practices.
The purpose of the volunteer campaign is to preserve the south's landscape resources and promote the concept of volunteerism “to care for others, to care for society, to care for nature”, as well as to enable the next generation to receive the potion of volunteer virtues from a young age.
Since its establishment at the beginning of April of this year, the “636” volunteer corps has been known to have 16 development members, with a series of volunteer activities, such as watching disabled retail customers, helping smoke farmers to care for tobacco leaves, and the Yaan earthquake love donation, becoming a volunteer force with a heart to deliver positive energy.

In recent years, the giants of the Silicon Valley such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook have been engaged in an arms race in the area of artificial intelligence (AI).
Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful.
Just when you didn't think it would be weirder in 2017, a new technology development report was released in the field of sex robots.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) published a report that looks forward to the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Shaggy, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking seriously the rise of sex robots.
Customers can choose the eye color, nipple shape and nail type of robot.
In the release of the new report, Shaggy said: “People laugh behind their backs, but corporations do have many sex robots, and we will see more.”
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflated dolls to robots with silicone skins, which are warm to touch, and which specifically use artificial intelligence to create human-like sexual reactions.
Users can also “self-defined” their robots to satisfy their preferences, ranging from eye colours, nipple shapes to fingernails or colours.
But even more disturbing is the fact that many robots with “personality” make the “reproducing wife” look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicon skins.
For example, RealBotix robots can come from definitions, such as shyness, depending on what the user considers attractive.
There are also Roxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Company, which can predetermine character characteristics, including a slightly shy “cold Fara” and a “breathy Wendy” of “at risk”.
“Roxxy Gold robots have personality that is as appropriate as possible to you.” True Company website is happy about this.
That's why she loves you and hates you.
She was just like a normal person in those days!
She can be lazy, she can talk, she can be `sexually strong'!"
The rise of sex robots has given rise to many uneases — not only to replace real human relationships — but also to the grotesque female character and the most worrying hint of rape in cold (read as resistance) Farah.
True Company compares Roxxy to a man's truncheon on its website.
The website says, "If a woman has a truncheon, why can't a man have Roxxy?"
But these sex robots aren't just lovers, and they're not just sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing maturity point to the darker and deeper part of our culture: fleeing from perfect gender equality to sex with submission as an additional option.
Of course, most men do not leave sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the margins of the consumer culture.
But what has infiltrated us from the edges has made us see the course of the era in which we are living.
Many people were neither weird nor aggressive until the free market gave them the opportunity to become so.
It is no coincidence that these fine sex robots appear in an era where women's rights are threatened globally, and that a White House president boasts of sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the television drama The Tale of the Concubine is not about making the picture real, it is not about the body hanging, it is not about the eyes being dug out, it is about the imagination that is too real.
The Republic of Gillean is a leap, but it does not seem to be far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create, as technologically as possible, the body of the truest woman (although in proportion to the sex star).
The creators of these robots want them to have the human touch and imitate the real human movement.
But to put it bluntly, their “personality” does not represent a true woman.
They can't break up, they can't run away.
They have no recourse and no follow-up story, no independence at all, and no possibility of breaking complete slavery illusions.
In other words, they're fun slaves.
Or according to the general saying of 2017: make a girl.
The Great Wall tells the story of an ancient Chinese elite force that fought a deadly battle against monsters on the Great Wall, known as the Great Wall, in defence of humanity.
The final issue of the fourth season of Runaway Bros has been recorded, and on 30 May Deng, the leader of the Runaway Boys Group, received a micro-letter interview from Shenyang Evening, a reporter from Shenyang Network, from the Runaway Boys to the Stinky Badger of the Evil Angels, to the Deaf Men Chen Moo, who gave the viewers the impression of a “Mobile Star King” in a changing way.
Deng said, "I won't do the same thing in the show. I'll keep it up to date."
The great work of Trump?
Let Mitt Romney be the epiphany of common sense.
Political divisions have led to polarization among American voters, while, from a micro-view, they have undermined American family harmony. This is no surprise to the Trump era.
Before and after Christmas and Thanksgiving, major newspapers in the United States were rife with fears of how to respond to the election of Trump relatives.
It is generally believed that we are doing our best to pierce our “filtration bubble”.
It is Trump's power to bring his family together that makes less of a comment.
I mentioned this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, had a long history of discord with the Republicans in our family, and he was visiting me this week in New York.
She reminded me that united against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
As a result of working with Trump at the White House, all the people she knew, even relatives of Republicans who had been in political strife for decades, were suddenly and strangely on the same front.
It would certainly be a good thing if all of them were at the table. But I am shocked that, from a broader perspective, there are significant risks.
Although the leftist figure has always been encouraged by Trump, the heated effect of his presidency drives us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are talking about the possibility of fear that his odd behaviour might one day stop.
However, there is a more worrying and long-term scenario in which Trump would like to “normalize” his relationship with the right-wing Republicans, who had previously opposed Mr. President's standards and now suddenly appeared to be a symbol of reason.
I found myself recently missing a little bit about the madness of Mitt Romney: putting dogs on cars, 14% of the income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), and the crimes of these two moves do seem to be too minor compared to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate needed only rationally to qualify for incalculable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town, we took our kids to the carousel at New York Park, the biggest carousel managed by the central park administration in New York, and if you don't need coffee, these $3 tickets are the most valuable in the city.
The sounds of the wooden horses are as thunderous as they are, they are designed for fibreglass on the central cylinder, all the clowns and animals turn their heads, and look at their shoulders with horror and evil, while the jingle sounds strangely.
Too many mediocre cities are disappointing: the landscape overlooking high-rises has become old-fashioned, the skyline has become too familiar with the incentives that no longer provide, and the reality of cities does not sustain dreams.
35 years later, I haven't completely forgotten that day, when I found out that this “Swiss cabin” was not really a Swiss hut, but rather a Swiss cabin at the theme bar “Ye Old Swiss Cottage”, I can't remember, but near a crossroads in northern London.
However, the carousel in Central Park is still a magical experience, and everyone has fun for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four 40-year-old girls.
If I could evaluate the carousel, I'd give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before I applied my credit card, I was asked to score one to five stars for my business experience.
And in my coffee shop in the corner of the street, it's the same thing, and it's the 15 percent tip option, which is for shopping on the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down the supposed neutral transaction, but also to put pressure on the waiter to add the personal element to the situation that is not needed.
The poor woman in the department store laughed, and I was tired, and the credit card business experience gave her five stars.
Oscar Pistolis moved from prison to hospital for chest pain.
It's the second time Pistolis left prison and moved to hospital.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of a wrist cut, which the prison official claimed was the result of his fall in the cell.
Pistolis was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutor against the initial manslaughter decision.
During the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, he shot Stimkamp several times at his home in Pretoria through the toilet door until his death.
Pistolis claimed that her girlfriend was mistaken for a break-in in the booth at night.
The Prosecutor has announced their intention to appeal again, this time for a six-year prison sentence against Pistolis, which they consider to be too lenient.
The National Public Prosecutor's Office indicated that an appeal would be lodged with the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard this year.
If the prosecutor wins, Pistolis will face an increase of 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

Two Bulgarians detained in Greece for illegal camping
b TV quoted information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of 1 August, the Sisonia police detained a group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians.
The detainees were released on the same day and the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs disclosed to bTV that two Bulgarians were subsequently released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened their control over random camping and impose heavy fines on any group of people resting in non-designated camps.
The tour will last for a season.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the court may impose a fine on those who camp at will.
On 18 May, the Ministry of Finance published the Scheme for the Management of Rewarded Funds for the Restructuring of Industrial Enterprises, which will provide earmarked incentives for the elimination of excess capacity in the coal and steel sectors, amounting to 100 billion yuan.
Several local governments, such as Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang, have recently proposed reforms to address excess capacity.
Many of these provinces have even offered to actively seek the financial support of the Central Treasury for the productive capacity of their provinces.
In support of this, only eight provinces have published coal decapitulation targets that stand at 90 per cent of the national coal reduction plan.
In an interview with a journalist, Xiamen University's Director of the China Energy Policy Research Institute, Lim, argued that the iron and steel industry and coal industry's “degenerative capacity” on the basis of only $100 billion from the central government was far from sufficient, and that more funding needed to be addressed by local governments and businesses.
In Shanxi Province, the recently published regulations for the implementation of coal production capacity proposed the reorganization of the Shanxi Coal Group into a State-owned capital investment company, the reorganization of the assets and operations of the enterprise and the construction of a new business model.
The real funding gap may have been three times higher than before the subsidy, when the Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, Mr. Yoon Uymin, stated that the preliminary statistics for the “de-capacitation” of workers' coal systems were 1.3 million and the iron and steel system 500,000.
Reporters of the South Daily News (journalist / Xie Qingyu) were informed today by the Provincial Environmental Protection Agency that the results of the 2012 credit rating for environmental protection of key sources of pollution in Guangdong Province were being publicized.
It was assessed that 134 out of the 1,251 enterprises listed on the Environmentally Sound Credit Management List were not rated due to shutdowns, non-receipts, shutdowns, etc.

Does meat, dairy products and chocolate help to alleviate inflammational intestinal disease (IBD)?
The meat and chocolate may sound like your digestive system nightmare.
However, a new study shows the opposite: diets rich in meat protein and dairy products can help alleviate the associated symptoms of inflammated intestinal diseases.
The incurable disease affected the lives of some 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 British, causing stomach cramps and abdominal swelling, regular or haemorrhage, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington usually advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products in order to mitigate symptoms, but researchers find that key amino-colouric acids in proteins help to promote immune cell growth, which increases the intestine tolerance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, Chief Researcher, explained that immune cells patrol the intestinal tract to ensure that harmful microorganisms hidden in food do not sneak into the body.
A balance is maintained between the cells that cause inflammation and those that promote tolerance, protecting the body from all kinds of sensitive and fragile tissues.
Inflammation can occur when the equilibrium is too biased towards inflammation.
An immune-promoting cell was found in rats carrying specific bacteria.
Bacteria require cyanide (a component of protein) to form a cell's appearance.
Professor Colona said, “We have established a link between a bacterial population (which is a normal part of the intestinal microbes) and the development of cells that promote resilience.
The more cyanide is consumed in the diet, the more immune cells the mice have.
He suggested that if humans used the same method, i.e. a combination of Lactacetic Bacillus and a gluten-rich diet, a more resilient and less inflammatory intestinal environment could be created.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, a postdoctoral researcher, studied an immune cell that could increase resilience when she found out that a group of rats had such cells, but not when another group of the same strains were raised separately.
She suspected that the difference was related to the community of intestinal microorganisms in mice (beginning bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually living in the gastrointestinal tract).
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice revealed six bacterial species present in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
The mice were raised in a sterile environment and therefore lacked intestinal microorganisms and could not produce the immune cells, and the presence of Lactoccus produced immune cells.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers cultivate Lactium in liquids and then transfer small amounts of bacterium-free liquids to premature immune cells separated from young rats.
The immune cell developed into a resilient cell.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be demonstrated that the active ingredient is a by-product of glutenine amino acid, known as thallium-3-emulsifiable acid.
The number of cells increased by about 50 per cent when researchers doubled the number of chromosomes in mice' feed, but when the level of chromosomes was halved, the number of cells was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people, like rats, have the same resilient cells and that most of us have Lactus in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether humans can induce cell development from Lactus by-products in their bodies, as is the case with lab rats, but genetic defects associated with chlamydia have been detected among inflammated intestinal patients.
She said, “The growth of these cells is probably what we want because they control inflammation on the inside of the intestinal tract.
It may be inaccurate to say that the presence of high levels of cyanide in Lactium may lead to an increase in the number of species.
José Murinio thinks that Man United signed the Genius Nemania Matic.
On Wednesday night, following the first appearance of Nemania Matic in the Sampsolia contest, Muriño concluded that Mansion had signed a “genius” midfield player.
Martić came from Chelsea, with a contract of £40 million and won 2-1 in Dublin on Tuesday in the final pre-season match before the European Super Bowl in Royal Madrid, winning the favor of Paul Borgba and Andreas Perera.
However, during the pre-Brunesti Asian Tour, the Mattics were severely understated, with only 45 minutes to complete, and Muriño acknowledged that improvements were needed before the British super season began.
“He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and genius in the way he thinks — he thinks about football,” Murinio says.
"We will prepare him as soon as possible."
Muriño started setting up his headlines at the beginning of the season. Like Matic, the newly-contracted players Victor Linderlov and Romelu Lukacu also started playing at the Injehua Stadium.
This week, the independent newspaper reported that Muriño still wanted to bring in three more signed players, but he insisted that the club “worked well” and that he had four top-chosen players in his heart, three of whom had already been introduced to the club.
“The club brought in three of the contracted players, and I thank you very much.” He added.
“I would be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they have done a great deal for me.”
Will China be behind if it doesn't build a frigate?
With the recent announcement by the world's major naval powers of plans for the construction of new frigates, as if one night the frigates had become the focus of the attention of the naval forces of the great Powers, first of all, the decision by Japan to purchase two new frigates in its 2018 defence budget, which led to a substantial breakthrough in the Japanese frigate DEX plan, and then the recent announcement by the United States of an updated plan for the United States frigate FFG, where is China's new frigate?
With the discharge of one of the most recent 054A frigates at the end of 2017, marking the construction of up to 29 frigates in 054A, approaching the sum of the 053H series, the construction of 054A has been under way for 12 years since the first 054A in 2006, and even worldwide, the construction of such a large number of high-performance common frigates can be compared with the “Perry”-class frigates built by the United States in the 7th and 80th centuries.
And the simple reason why so many 054As have been built is that they are profitable, useful and complement the many years of naval arrears.
The frigate 054A, which has been favoured by the Chinese Navy for many years with a high value of value and good combat power, has been carrying about 4,000 tons of drainage, a 76-mm main gun, 32 units of a sea red flag-16 and a fish-8 anti-submarine missile co-launched hair-trigger system, eight eagles hitting 83 and a direct-9 helicopter, although it was built in 2006 and was designed earlier, its combat power is not too poor, even today, and it can reach the upper-to-medium level among the world's frigates.
But it is, after all, a ship designed at the beginning of the twenty-first century with a weapons configuration on one side, whose power systems and electronic radar equipment are already very different from those of the world's mainstream frigates, and it is time to develop a new type of vessel when the same type of frigates in Europe are equipped with full electric propulsion, small multi-purpose control radars, large-sized helicopter decks.
So how China's new frigate should develop is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic approach of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy is bound to be a blue-water navy, and the future is bound to be ocean-bound, with areas of vital interest to China that will rapidly deploy, demonstrate the presence of force and, if necessary, have the strength to ensure that China’s vital interests in the region are not compromised. It would therefore appear that the new Hu Wei Gang will be moving towards mega- and over-oceanization.
Looking at the location of the new frigate in the future Chinese naval sequence, the future Chinese navy should be similar to that of the United States Navy. In addition to the required offshore defence vessels, other major naval vessels will form carrier combat groups or amphibious attack ships as required.
The role of new frigates in future carrier battles should serve as anti-submarine mains and mid-to-near spaces, and in amphibious attack fleets as frigates, and the need for new frigates to have strong anti-subsperial capabilities and good mid-range areas.
Based on the above positioning, a bold vision of the future of the frigate is possible.
First, there would be a significant increase in discharges relative to the current 054A frigates, with an estimated discharge volume of 5,000-6,000 tons from the new frigates; the power system would use an integrated power propulsion system consisting of an improved QC280 gas turbine and two diesel engines, with a maximum speed of about 30 knots and a significant increase in continued capacity; a 76-mm main gun and 1130-class frigate should be retained, but a red flag 10 launch system would be added, with a 32-48 unit of a red flag 16 improvement and a fish-8 co-scavenger in the back of the frigate, and a large ding system with 8-16 units should be installed in the back of the hull for firing eagles 18 and new cruise missiles; hangars and hangar platforms would also be expanded to reach two 10-ton helicopters; and, with respect to an electronic radar system, a high-altitude should be equipped with a small four-face fixed-side control system based on 346-A, which could be matched by a multifunctional rotation control radar similar to that of a European frigates.
This would bring the overall level of the new frigates to the world's current best standards, even if compared to the FFG of the United States.
Of course, the above-mentioned concept is merely an assumption of the new frigate of national production, and in particular how we can only find out when the new frigate is in the water, so let us look forward to it.

In recent years, our city has encouraged the active participation of enterprises in the construction of national, industrial and regional standards, awarded 300,000 yuan to enterprises that are primarily or involved in the development of standards for Zhejiang manufacturing groups, and 500,000 yuan to enterprises that manufacture brand certification through Zhejiang, which is the highest level of the award in the province and stimulates business participation in the subject matter.
Formerly, the head of the Wangqiang group production workshop, along with his staff, Gao Jian, was packing a security door block against theft as a sample for participation in the Zhejiang manufacturing group standard against the standards, to be sent to the Shao Hing Quality Monitoring Centre.
Just the previous two days, Wang Li had passed an on-site audit by the Zhejiang Manufacturing Accreditation Panel.
Quality indicated that a professional team of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations commended the group for its performance in core areas of excellence and autonomous innovation, agreeing that there was a perfect match, and that Wangqiang would be one of the first to adopt the standard as long as the product was tested.
The Wangqing Group is only a microcosm of the standard-motivated industrial transformation.

What's worse is that China's household debt rate is closer to the United States than it's going to be able to afford a home?
In recent times, there has been debate about recent changes in real estate policy, whether real estate policy will be untying again. Will the diversification of land policy providers lead to a decline in housing prices?
However, at a time when we were worried about real estate prices, macroeconomic regulation, and the future of the real estate market, the People's Daily wrote again. The last time we devoted our comments to the regulation of real estate, the People's Daily is now writing about a more serious topic than the affordability of housing, which is whether you can afford the debt even if you can afford it.
Today, let us talk about a bigger problem than buying a house: repayment of loans.
I. The growing housing debt crisis in China
According to data from the People's Daily Overseas edition, which published a review article, Awards and Loans. Fighting Youth's Pleasures and Concerns, in November 2017, the Third Quarterly Report on China's Deleveraging Process, issued by the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Institute of Social Science and Technology and the National Balance Sheet Research Centre, noted that the population sector's leverage rate continued to increase, from 47.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6 per cent in the third quarter, an increase of 1.3 percentage points, and 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The share of debt of the resident sector in the overall real economy has increased, and the leverage rate has risen faster.
Studies indicate that China's households'liabilities in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, accounting for about two thirds of the population's liabilities, which is about twice as high as their operating loans.
Among them, medium- and long-term loans, dominated by housing loans, account for about 80 per cent of consumer loans, but in terms of growth, short-term consumer loans are growing faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition, China's household debt rate merely accounts for the total amount of credit received by the family sector from financial institutions, while Chinese households have large amounts of private borrowing, including from relatives and friends, and have large hidden debts.
In view of this data, it is surprising to note that, according to the statistics of the Suning Institute of Finance, the leverage rate for Chinese residents was only 3 per cent in 1996 and 18 per cent in 2008, but since 2008 it has begun to grow rapidly, doubling in just six years, reaching 36.4 per cent, and reaching 48.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2017.
By way of comparison, in May last year, HSBC released a survey report covering nine countries and close to tens of thousands of respondents.
The report was addressed to the “Millennium Generation” of young people (born between 1980 and 2000) in nine countries.
The report states that China's housing ownership rate for young people after 80 and 90 years is as high as 70 per cent, leading the second largest country in Mexico (46 per cent) and double the United States target of 35 per cent.
The data tell us that one of the most likely problems is that China's largest potential “red rhinoceros” at this stage may not be able to pay their debts as compared to their inability to afford a home.
II. Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have previously analysed, although we have always said that China has higher housing prices, the housing ownership rate in China is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world.
Throughout the world's real estate markets, China's real estate market, due to its late start, has not experienced a major real estate crisis, except for what we said earlier about Hainan, but just 10 years ago, the financial tsunami of 2008 in the world began with the real estate crisis in the United States.
The real-estate crisis in the United States was attributed to two houses: Renaissance and Renaissance.
In the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold their houses to low-income people in the United States at a very low down payment in order to expand their sales. At a time when the United States economy was better, the real estate market also flourished. However, the good news was not long and, with the stagnation of growth in the United States economy, the incomes of home buyers fell, and large household consumption expenditures began to fall.
The current situation in the United States, however, was one of financial assets and real estate assets that formed part of United States household assets, almost all of which were real estate in the United States low-income group, while most of the assets in the top 20 per cent of the high-income group were financial assets, and the higher the debt rate for real estate in the United States, the poorer.
A serious fact is that these people buy their houses at a better time, so the money to pay their mortgages is also calculated in terms of their better income, and that when income falls, the pressure on mortgages not only does not diminish, but even because some subprime lending schemes have become more volatile, so that the real estate problems of these American families have gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
Thus, because incomes are too low to pay for housing loans, banks begin to recover property, and when banks recover property from those who default on loans, they sell it at very low prices, leading to a gradual decline in housing prices in the region, which in turn triggers a vicious circle in which, when the prices fall to a certain level, more and more buyers find that the value of their houses is even lower than their own loans, so that more people stop paying their mortgages and create more bad debts.
As a result, a huge vicious circle emerged:
“The economic downturn — the decline in income — a segment of the population cannot afford to pay their mortgages — the low prices of banks selling unindebted houses — the price of houses falls — more people stop paying their mortgages — the banks sell them — and the prices fall ”
And the problem is more than that, because the price of the house continues to fall, and you don't have a debt after people stop paying the bank for the house. If the money you owe to the bank for the house to be auctioned by the bank is still outstanding, then you still have to pay it back, simply say, assuming that you bought a house worth $3 million with a down payment of $600,000 and a loan worth $2.4 million, and when the house fell to only $2 million, you stopped lending the house to the bank, and after the house to be auctioned by the bank, you not only lost the down payment of $600,000, you also owed the bank 400,000, you still have to pay back the money.
As a result, under such a vicious circle, the United States economy gradually collapsed, culminating in the United States financial crisis of 2008.
Thus, the high level of domestic debt in China at this stage, at 46.8 per cent, is a matter of great vigilance. The data are still below the level of developed countries, but the problem has begun to emerge, and the country has repeatedly emphasized deleveraging since last year. This is a very priori judgement that family debt ratios, if allowed to continue to rise, will entail significant risks, so that financial risks will be kept in check.
As a result, houses have been located for housing purposes rather than for fumigation, and the State has accelerated the establishment of multi-purpose supply, multi-channel security, rental and merger measures to further mitigate potential risks.
For our individual families, it is important to move away from real-estate speculation, to do everything in their power to buy a home, and to avoid the burden placed on their own families. Only a reasonable assessment of their income and level of indebtedness is a healthy path to family wealth development.

The British inventor implants a chip in his own body and waves into the house.
A British inventor who installed a chip for himself would just have to wave to open his front door, enter the office and even start the car as the first person in the country.
33-year-old Steven Northham implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and his finger, and is now providing this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, which is done by his company BioTeq through technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Jeff Watson, a senior consultant at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, to ensure that the implantation process meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to cat and dog chip implants, and it only takes 30 seconds.
Mr. Nordham's company will also replace the locks of the rooms and vehicles in order to be compatible with the chip, at a cost of £300 per lock.
The married father, who had a child, had now installed the technology for his home and his BMW Z4, and he could start the car by placing his hand on the steering wheel.

White House props cost thousands of dollars.
According to the military records published in Time magazine, last month the White House decided to transport a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of the United States manufacturing industry, at a cost of up to $24,000.
Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine I when the president was on board, was an important exhibit in the White House on July 17, highlighting the construction project in the United States.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Burns and senior White House officials visited manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibits included helicopters made in Connecticut, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the records of the first unit of the Force Marine Helicopter (HMX-1), which operated the helicopter, the White House Military Office required the helicopter to appear on the daily order (FRAGO), i.e., only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn to participate in the “special” event.
The day before the event, Commander HMX-1, in an e-mail sent to the superior Deputy Commander of the Marine Corps, stated, “I just want to make sure that you know that this event is highly valued”.
The information indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on 17 July for an event at 3 p.m. and leave only at 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on the same day.
The information also indicates that, in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, a second crew would be required to return due to the time limit for duty.
The original crew was on standby alongside the helicopter during the operation, while the security forces were on standby nearby while the aircraft was on the ground.
The record in Time magazine does not clearly indicate the eventual need for a second crew.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
It was noted that HMX-1 had asked whether the event was in violation of the Act.
The commander wrote that “one of the questions we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hutch Act and was told that there had been no violation”.
"It sounds like you're locked up." Deputy Commander replied.
The White House defined this “United States-manufactured” activity as an official activity and is therefore not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even official activities are political.
At the event, the President pursued the topic of the then Senate: the reform of the medical system and gave a great deal of credit to the control of the laws and regulations of the Government.
The use of Marine I or Air Force I aircraft for political propaganda purposes is no longer new.
Successive presidents have been asked to travel by these aircraft.
However, it is not common for them to be requisitioned for the sole purpose of taking photographs.
Trump received attention in February, when the Presidential jet slipped through Melbourne, Florida, and ended up in the background of his first election rally, while his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the use of the Presidential jet by the former President.
The White House deputy news spokesman Lindsay Walters said that “the White House was excited about this “American Manufacturing” exhibition, which showcased products from all 50 states, all of which were made by American workers using American materials”.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn to practice the accurate placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
HMX-1 performed 58 landings at the White House during Trump's G-20 Summit in Germany in early July.
One official stated that the U.S. manufacturing flight was included in this month's crew training requirements.
The helicopter unit also flew an additional 11 hours of “non-presidential support mission” on the same day.
The White House claimed that the taxpayers did not bear the cost of any other props for the event.
The spokesman for Sikorsky stated that the company was not involved in arranging a South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 did not maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and it was therefore very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence's hourly costs recorded for the 2017 financial year, the reimbursable costs of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D were USD 24,380 per flight hour.
The force recorded 30 minutes of each flight from the base at Quantico Marine Airport, Virginia.
The White House, for its part, claimed that the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower than that cost.
Walters claims that “the cost of the taxpayer is very misleading in estimating it on the basis of reimbursable fees.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs, including in the annual appropriation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the reimbursable costs of the Ministry of Defence did not include personnel costs, but did include oil, maintenance and contractual costs.
At that time, a former White House news spokesman, Sean Speicher, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to show what the U.S. made this week.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, and they both have contributed to our national security, and I guess there are hundreds of people who work on it without thousands of people.
And I feel that, like most Americans, we are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the fruit of countless American efforts.
So it's certainly not out of the question.”
It is not clear to us whether Trump interacted with the helicopter during an active tour of the South Lawn, but he did take the driving seat of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky and joked about the company's aircraft, which he owned, with the media.
He said, "I know the Sikorsky plane. I have three."

The “Maraba Chest” is a tropical plant of Mexican origin, warm and humid, and flowering is possible only when many conditions, such as sunlight, moisture and nutrients, are appropriate.
Even in the wild, where tropical conditions are appropriate, it is rare for rich trees to bloom, with the expression “only one in a thousand” being used.
Yesterday morning, journalists came to the residence of the Democratic Road Office in Nanning City and, under the guidance of Aunt Gao, they saw the rich tree.
The rich trees are grown in a small garden about 5 metres high, the thickest branches about 30 centimetres long, and the leaves are green and thick.
At the top of the higher branch, the flower blooms more than 10 centimetres wide, the thin yellow silk spreads, and the green flower glitters split and curls on both sides, and the flowers are as fine as silver and the filamentary dots.
Aunt Gao told journalists that the rich tree had been planted for eight years and that it was about 1 metre taller and now more than 5 metres long.
This is the picture that her son bought from the flowerbird market, which she planted in the garden, and which she did not manage very much, sometimes only to cultivate soil.

According to the Market Star, between 2005 and 2011, my provincial GDP rose from the central side to the bottom.
For this reason, the Departmental Economic Information Centre’s latest edition of the Economic Blue Page proposes to improve the quality and effectiveness of economic growth.
It is based on a number of representative indicators of our provincial economy in 2005 and 2011 and is compared with the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic efficiency, in 2011, the energy-intensive industries in my province, which account for a significant proportion of industrial energy, raw materials, etc., were heavily affected by market fluctuations and “double pressure” on excess capacity. At the same time, the dominant industries, such as domestic electricity and automobiles, were under-innovated, resulting in low profits.
The lack of commensurate economic benefits from large investments is an important reason for the poor quality and efficiency of economic growth in our province.
In this regard, the experts recommended that effective measures be taken to encourage innovation in enterprises and that the scientific and technological achievements of universities and research institutes be “transferred” to enterprises in a timely manner.
With regard to the low efficiency of the industrial economy, experts said that industrial merger restructuring, optimal industrial layout and extension of the industrial chain should also be actively promoted.

The UK General Union (GMB) is concerned with investments in the McVitie plant in Glasgow.
The union hopes that the management of McVitata, the manufacturer of biscuits, will ensure a long-term commitment to production at the Lasco factory.
According to the Scottish branch of the United Kingdom Confederation of Trade Unions, the company has remained silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross factory.
The factory has more than 500 employees and produces products such as oatmeal biscuits (Hobnobs), tea biscuits (Rich tea).
Pladis, the owner of McVitat, indicated that the company had invested more than £5 million in the factory over the past few years.
He added that in the event of changes in the operation of the plant, employees and trade union representatives “will take the lead in knowing”.
In a letter addressed to the director of the company, the Scottish branch of the British General Union called on McVitat “to resolve the problem of money not being transferred to the modernization of the production line”.
The Senior Founder of the General Union of Britain, Drew Duffy, said: “We are deeply concerned that we do not have a clear idea of the future business needs and investment plans of Tollcross from the general manager of the plant.
Generations of families work here, and the high concentration of labour in the local community and in Grand Glasgow is an important pillar of high unemployment and social deprivation of decent employment in the region.
Thus, from the perspective of employment, pay and economic prosperity, the east of Glasgow is in dire need of an expanding McVitat production network against the backdrop of the rise in the cost of living and the long-term decline in manufacturing in the United Kingdom.”
“The director of Tollcross just yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of the British Confederation of Trade Unions, and the company will respond immediately because of the importance we attach to maintaining continuous contact with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the General Union of England in Tollcross to discuss a number of issues in public.
We had discussions with our employees and then, like all other companies operating in an environment of intense competition and economic uncertainty, we reviewed the continuing business model that we applied to enterprises and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in terms of production lines and operational improvements.
We are fully aware of the historical status of Tollcross as a production base, and if there is any change in our operations at the plant, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to know.”
On 11 May, the Deputy Director of the Sports Department of the Tibet Autonomous Region of the China-China News Agency (journalist Chen Xingbin), Nimat zhin, stated at the main camp on the north slope of Everest that the future clean-up of living garbage on the north slopes of Everest would move from past actions of public benefit to regular behaviour led by the Chinese Government and involving the international community.
On 10 May, environmental volunteers loaded the collected garbage into the truck.
Over the past decade or so, the issue of environmental protection at the peak site has become more pronounced as the number of explorers and tourists on Everest has increased dramatically.
In the spring of 1997, the Tibetan Autonomous Region Mountain Climbing Association launched its first clean-up campaign on the north slopes of Everest, cleaning up a collection of living waste such as oxygen bottles left over from the 1960s and 1970s. The video was also shown at the Tokyo World Climate Conference, which attracted world attention.
According to Nima Tirin, after 1997, the public interest team has been cleaning the northern slopes of Everest, but most of the participants are non-professionals.
Three years ago in St. Germain, Paris, did you warn Barcelona to sign Nemal?
Nica may regret throwing an olive branch at Marco Valetti.
After an offer of £189 million to allow it to exercise its immunity clause, St. Germain, Paris, would not give up its entry into Nemal, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of launching an attack on the world record raider?
This sensational approach has opened the summer roundup window, and the Al-Facha Club is going to break the world round record at more than twice the last round. Paul Borgba returned to Mansion in the last quarter, amounting to £89 million.
Once the transition is completed, Nemal will jump to the highest-priced player in the world and will also be the world's highest-paid professional player — St. Germain, Paris, who provides after-tax payments of over £500,000 a week.
Barcelona was outraged by the manner in which Nemal was attacking and the way out, and sources of information on the Board of Directors of the Catalan team insisted that the club had been doing everything possible to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did President St. Germain of Paris make such predictions about the football world three years ago?
When Man City expressed interest in signing Bryce Matedi in 2014, Nasser Al-Hlaif gave a strong warning to any club that wanted to sign the best player in St. Germain in Paris.
“I'm not worried, because they know that if they touch any of our players, we'll be against them, and we'll contact their players,” Al-Hulafi says.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign on to our players, they will also suffer the consequences.”
Earlier this summer, the Spanish club seemed to have crossed the line and Barcelona threw an olive branch at Marco Valetti, the middle player of St. Germain in Paris.
St. Germain of Paris made it clear that they would not in any way allow the Italian foot to leave, and Barcelona would most likely be affected by the loss of Nemar, the genius of the battle.
Reporter Wang Qing: The International Seminar on New Energy Development and Technologies, co-sponsored by the National Electric Network Corporation and the International Electrotechnical Commission, was held in Frankfurt, Germany.

Deterioration of fiscal subsidies for Sichuan-based new-energy vehicles, low coverage of charging facilities, suspension of three-dollar lithium batteries in new-energy passenger vehicles, and current upward pressure on the domestic market for new-energy vehicles
From 3 to 6 November, during the first phase of the 16th International Expo for Western China (hereinafter “Sibo”), the six municipal states of Chengdu, Nanchang and Jaan demonstrated their development gains in advanced manufacturing, with new energy vehicles emerging and new products of interest to the industry.
Currently, there is temporary upward pressure on the domestic market for new energy vehicles as fiscal subsidies for new energy vehicles are reduced, recharge facilities are less widely available and lithium batteries are suspended for use in new energy buses.
However, the Sichuan-made new-energy vehicle is on the rise, and the market is broken down by large-scale vehicles and commercial vehicles.
The current situation of the newspaper journalist Zhao Zewoo: The recent news of the Sichuan New Energy Automobile Industry has continued, focusing on the development of “Spin Sons”.

Most of this money comes from national lottery tickets and the rest from national finances.
Britain's hope for gold is primarily placed on two people: Alice Christy, last year's world short-track fast-sliding championship winner, and Liz Janod, the last female steel-coated snow-car champion.
In the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, the British delegation had achieved the best performance since the first Winter Olympics in 1924.
