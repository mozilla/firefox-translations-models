The 28-year-old chef was found dead at a San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead this week in the stairwell of a local mall.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to harm him, and said, "Everything is finally getting better." ”
The body found Wednesday morning at Westfield Mall was identified as Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, the San Francisco coroner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled homicide and an investigation is underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's San Francisco-based radio station KGO that Frank, who previously worked as a line chef in Boston, got his dream job as a line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "very shocked" by Frank's death.
"We are a small team that gets along like a close-knit family, and we will miss him dearly," the spokesperson said. ”
We extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this time of grief.
Louis Galicia says Frank initially lived in a guest house, but recently "things are finally getting better." ”
Louis Galicia told KGO: "Frank found an apartment and was dating a girl at the same time. ”
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to harm his brother.
Frank has a kind heart and a big heart.
According to Louis Galicia, "Frank often cooks dinner for his family. ”
He never wanted to argue with his family.
He is a man who follows everyone's opinions.
Louis Galicia says, "Everything in the world can go wrong, but Frank is a man who shines every day." ”

Junior Doctors Strike: A Call for New Labor Action
Junior Physician Representatives called on the Coalition to approve new labor action in response to new contract disputes.
The British Medical Association's Junior Doctors Committee will ask all its members to support more labour action from early September.
The Junior Doctors' Committee said the ministers had not addressed their concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to boycott a contract deal with the British Medical Association.
Of the members who participated in the voting, 58% opposed the contract transaction.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, Ellen McCourt, chair of the junior doctors' committee, said the government had been "consistently silent" about the issues that led to the boycott of the contract.
"In light of this, the Executive Committee of the Junior Physicians Council has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and called for a reopening of formal negotiations on all concerns," she said. ”
In response to the government's reluctance, the Executive Committee of the Junior Doctors' Council today formally asked the British Medical Association Council to convene a special meeting to approve a long-term plan to scale up labour action from early September.
The dispute has led to a total of six strikes by junior doctors this year, including the first all-out strike in the history of the NHS.
Dr Johann Malawana, Junior Physician Leader of the British Medical Association, resigned after a vote boycotted the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the British Medical Association.
In a meeting ahead of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students, he told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be mandatory among healthcare workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "out of place"?
A gesture to end a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday, shaking hands and announcing an official end to an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish president in the glittering halls of a St. Petersburg palace, I had a strong feeling that this rapprochement was what Ankara wanted most.
Yes, the two sides did shake hands.
However, even by Mr. Putin's usual reserved standards, Putin smiled only lightly and showed little enthusiasm.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan reportedly mentioned his "good friend" Putin five times.
I don't remember exactly.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to the level before the crisis, and even higher.
The next day, a newspaper here wrote that Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
However, I think his enthusiasm suggests something the opposite.
However, Mr. Putin's continued cold attitude shows that he has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentions in his opening remarks is the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that time was fierce.
Mr. Putin lashed out at the incident, accusing Ankara of plotting against Moscow behind his back.
Attacks from so-called friends are even more difficult to accept.
It is difficult, if not impossible, for both sides to re-establish genuine trust.
Since November, public opinion in Russia has also reversed.
For months, the government-controlled media has launched an alarming all-out offensive against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
Among them, the most serious are the accusations from high-ranking officials: Mr. Erdogan's family profited from illegal oil transactions in the so-called Islamic State-controlled areas of Syria.
He has categorically denied that claim.
However, news from St. Petersburg suggests that it's time to look forward.
After all, the meeting was premised on Putin receiving an apology from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are obvious.
First, Erdogan was almost ousted after a failed coup last month, so he needs the support of all his friends.
It is clear that the constant terrorist attacks have taken a heavy toll on him.
At the same time, there are also economic incentives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, particularly by banning charter flights that transport millions of Russian tourists to Turkish shores every year.
That number has fallen by nearly 90 percent.
With flights resumed, Russian travel agencies and charter companies will be relieved.
They will be on the eve of the end of the season with a wave of Mediterranean tourism.
State television even predicted this week that the price of fruits and vegetables will fall once Turkey's agricultural imports reopen.
A report from the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti said: "Tourists went, tomatoes returned. ”
For Moscow, the visit also has additional political value.
Ankara is outraged by the weak reaction of the Western world to the takeover intentions.
In addition, Ankara has long resented the slow pace of EU accession talks and the meddling of Putin, who is keen to exploit the political chill and weaken Turkey's ties with the West.
Having embraced the elected authorities after the failed coup d'état, the Russian leader is bound to receive a plus point for Ankara.
Note that this is a gift to Moscow, which has always harbored a deep-seated fear of regime change.
Thus, the meeting in this glittering seaside palace has brought Russia into an alliance with Turkey, two countries rejected and abused by the Western world, which one analyst described as "out of place."
However, despite the public settlement, the two sides still have significant differences.
Syria is one of the key factors. Moscow has recently played the role of peacemaker in Syria, while Russia and Turkey have supported opposing factions.
Predictably, after nearly three hours of initial conversation, the two presidents said at the press conference that the topic had not yet been addressed.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided the issue of differences between the two sides, while Putin emphasized it.
The two sides did not reach a clear consensus on how to seek common ground while reserving differences on the Syrian issue.
With months of open hostility and the potential for a major catastrophe from the downing of a Russian fighter by Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it would certainly be good that the two leaders will resume dialogue again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside of Scotland
According to the CEO of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank will be streamlined into a back-office department.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scottish division that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand had been committed to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago, when he was on the verge of bankruptcy and had to accept a bailout, he gave up that pursuit.
During that time, brand strategists used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
The Group has spent millions of pounds to sponsor international sporting events such as the Six Nations Rugby Championship and Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right thing to do is to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not be reverted to the original situation.
In England and Wales, all references outside the headquarters and stock exchange will be changed to NatWestminster Bank.
The Ulster Bank brand has been used by customers in the Republic of Ireland and the Autonomous Region of Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that are more prominent, such as Gutsi Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan has been interviewed on Inverness County customer and employee tours.
He told the BBC Scottish division: "The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and one of the brands our employees are employed for, as we are now a bank with so many brands in a larger sense." ”
As the bank became an international brand in its own right, RBS also became a global brand.
For now, I would say that we're no longer focusing on the global focus, we've turned our attention locally.
Each brand represents a different industry in which it operates, and our employees serve our customers through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championship and has worked to raise the profile of different brands in sponsoring sporting events.
"Now is the time to become a multi-brand bank, because privately we are always looking at how we can be a bank that better serves our customers," said the CEO. ”
If three years ago we had aspired to be a big bank with many brands, we would have been ridiculed.
Right now we're focused on customer needs, and I'm sure you've noticed these changes.
I think we can relaunch these brands, and the time is right.
Detuli won 3,000 career wins with Predilection's success in Newmarket
Newmakit's two victories helped Daytuli to 3,000 career wins, and he celebrated with champagne
On Friday, professional jockey Frankie Dettori scored his 3,000th win in Newmarket.
He rode the Predilection of trainer John Gosden on the track, scoring two victories on the night and achieving a career 3,000 victory.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional jockey to achieve this milestone in the flats.
The top five were: Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dai Tuli, who won at Ghayyar earlier, said: "It's special. ”
I was thrilled because my family was there as well
I'm happy with what I've achieved at Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big horse race, it's not Royal Ascot, it's just an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I am relieved and humble.
After his victory, Dieturi brought in Predilection, which drew cheers from the audience
In the show jumping field, two jockeys have achieved this feat, champion jockey Richard Johnson and now retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, with Sir McCoy claiming more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Berger is a nine-time Derby champion with a total of 4,493 victories in his career
Detuli is one of the best jockeys of his generation, so it's no surprise that he has achieved this milestone achievement, which not many have achieved before him.
He's sleek and muscular, but what really makes him stand out in the weighing room is his tactical rationality.
He is an amazing equestrian ambassador and over the years, his passion and charisma have attracted a large number of fans to the sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Dai Tuli at Epsom that if he hadn't just had a weekend with a major jockey, he would have 6,000 wins!
Seriously, it's all too important to be called the best equestrian winner in Britain for three decades.
He has a lively personality, which is good for British racing, but beyond that, he is an incredible jockey.
Dieturi celebrates this milestone with his signature jumping dismount
From jumping to jumping off the horse, for two decades, Dieturi has been the quintessential figure of the British flat race.
His career has been a rollercoaster ride.
He won a number of major races, including the famous "seven wins in a row" at the Royal Ascot in 1996, but he also suffered a plane crash and was banned for taking banned drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned to the ring after a six-month ban, he struggled. However, he showed amazing character strengths and finally returned to the top, giving the skeptics a blow in the face.
He may not be able to do it for long – Detuli has said before that he hopes to compete until he is at least 50 years old.
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Sergei Ivanov from his post as chief of staff
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly relieved Sergei Ivanov of his post as chief of presidential staff.
For many years, Mr. Ivanov has been part of a core group that has the confidence of Mr. Putin.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
A Kremlin statement said Mr. Putin had "announced the dismissal of Ivanov from his post as chief of staff of the Russian president," but did not give a reason.
Anton Vaino, who has been Mr. Ivanov's deputy since 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia, in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he managed the presidential draft and government employees, says the Kremlin website (in Russian).
After his appointment, he said to Mr. Putin: "Thank you for your trust. ”
I believe that the most important task of this Government is to support the Head of State in drafting laws and controlling the implementation of directives.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself had asked for his resignation and had recommended Mr. Vaino to take his place.
Is such a smile convincing?
Moscow was puzzled by the move.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest aides and, like Putin, worked in the Soviet Security Service (KGB).
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on state television, both men said that the chief of staff had asked for his resignation.
Despite the smiles on camera, almost no one was convinced – especially in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of losing in some kind of power struggle?
There is no way to know.
But the official narrative that a former presidential candidate had suddenly chosen to take charge of Russia's environmental policy has raised a lot of skepticism.
Mr. Ivanov's conversation with Mr. Putin was quoted on the Kremlin website, in which he said: "Yes, in early 2012, I asked you to grant me this difficult, if not troublesome, position, a four-year term. "
"As a result, I have been Chief of Staff to the President for four years and eight months. "
Mr. Ivanov assumed this position in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of Russia's Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, a former member of the National Security Service.
At the end of the 90s of the 20th century, when Mr. Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the NSA), Mr. Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
After Mr. Putin came to power, he designated Mr. Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
At one time, it was thought that Mr. Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr. Putin's second term ended, because it would be unconstitutional to be re-elected for three consecutive terms.
But the position ultimately belonged to another of Putin's close aides, Dmitry Medvedev.
Before returning to the presidency after three and a half years, Mr. Putin held the post of Prime Minister of Russia.
Mysterious fish surprise a garden in Banff
A resident of Banff called for help when he spotted a fish in his garden.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish may have been sand eels blown in by a tornado at sea.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of this strange scene on Periscope, hoping that someone would explain to him why these two-inch fish appeared.
The Queensferry Bridge is now open to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled for completion in May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct, which means the bridge now leads to Fife.
The project is the first of its kind to be completed with four "deck wind turbines" located near the three bridgeheads of each bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 metric tons.
It used 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete, and 46 cable-stayed cables.
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled for completion in May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to board the bridge.
"This is a historic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge," he said. "
We have all witnessed the engineering work on such an ambitious project, with more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel used to build this section of the bridge alone.
Despite the sheer size and weight of the bridge, completing the closure between the viaduct and the deck required delicate work and very precise assembly.
Overall, almost 79 percent of the total deck has now been installed, with the last section of the concrete deck being poured in Rosyth today, meaning that all decks are ready for use.
Michael Martin, Project Director at Queensferry Bridge Construction, said: "Regardless of the bridge project, the first closure is a major milestone. "
As far as this remarkable project is concerned, Helong is a showcase of cutting-edge civil engineering technology.
Once the final section of the slab has been installed and connected to the enlarged Fort North slab, the remaining gap closure on the north side or near the land side needs to be completed.
To complete the operation, the northern viaduct needed to be moved 700 mm south.
It's a huge operation, and it's a very delicate one.
It is said to be huge because the viaduct is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 metric tons, and needs to be pulled up a slope of about 3%.
It's precise because the engineering team needs to make sure that the deviation is very small, only a few millimeters on each side.
Thankfully, everything is going well.
Simon Biles won the women's gymnastics all-around title
Forget about stress.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is unaffected by all this.
Energetic when vaulting.
The balance beam is easy to swim with.
The floor exercise is stunning.
The overall performance was fantastic.
Now, finally, he has become an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old U.S. gymnast won the all-around title on Thursday, showcasing her world-leading talent in gymnastics at the Olympics.
With a total score of 62.198, she far surpassed silver medallist and Final Five player Aly Raisman and bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina of Russia.
Simon Biles of the United States performed on the balance beam at the women's individual all-around final of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles helped Team USA win four consecutive Olympic women's gymnastics individual all-around titles, and her five medals at the Games further confirmed that she is the best gymnast of her generation, and possibly the best gymnast of all time.
The moment he saw his total score, Biles couldn't help but shed tears. She finally ended this long journey.
As a result, Biles is on the ranks of "once-in-a-decade athletes" like Michael Phelps, who are taking sports in their fields to new heights:
Biles has dominated the competition for the last three years, winning 15 World Championship medals, including 10 gold. Driven by her ambition, she trains hard every day to achieve greater precision. Mary Lou Retton, the 1984 Olympic champion, said, "Biles is the best gymnast I've ever met. ”
There's one final bout in Brazil, but it's not so much a rivalry between Biles and other gymnasts as it is a contest between herself and the pressure of great expectations.
If Biles hadn't returned home in Spring, Texas with a full gold medal, everyone would have been disappointed.
Simon Biles (left) of the United States hugs Lesman as they won gold and silver medals respectively in the women's individual all-around final of rhythmic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, August.
Biles won his first gold medal on Tuesday, a surprise gift for retiring national team coach Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insists he didn't plan for the future in his perennial quest for the title, that's not entirely the case.
A passage from Biles's floor exercise, including her trademark somersault string, is accompanied by Latin music that she often hears in her home, just across the street from the Rio Olympic venues.
This is no coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a baby and discovered by her mother on a field trip to the gymnasium, by coach Aimee Boorman, has grown into a stalwort.
Biles hasn't missed an all-around game since the summer of 2013, and if she wants to win, she'll win.
Mustafina's slight lead after two spins was just an illusion.
Biles, the reigning world champion in balance beam and floor exercise, is in ambush.
She scored 15.433 on the balance beam and 15.933 on floor exercise.
While waiting for the final score to come out, Lesman gently hugged Biles. When Biles learned that he had achieved the results he had always dreamed of, he burst into tears.
Lesman's performance was a bit like revenge four years ago, when she tied for third but lost to Mustafina in the tiebreaker.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, nicknamed "Grandma" by Americans, was far ahead.
She announced her return by kissing the crowd after the floor exercise, but such a return had sometimes seemed questionable before.
Biles was only 19 years old. Since earlier this week, the news has gone viral on Twitter. In his case, Biles' life has been given a whole new meaning.
6-year-old Mahaj Brown, who was "shot several times," survived the Philadelphia shooting
A six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old in the city this week, police said.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child who was shot was Mahaj Brown.
They said Brown had multiple gunshot wounds to his groin, legs, arms and abdomen, but the child was conscious on the way to the hospital.
"He's suffered a lot of crimes, his little body was scarred by bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told television.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has already undergone multiple surgeries.
His family told television that the child was expected to recover.
He was going to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Of the other three people who were shot, two were 29 years old and one was 32 years old.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the victims, 29, is in critical condition;
The television station said the child and the 29-year-old victim in critical condition were found in the front seat of the car.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether the gunman was among the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia what looked like multiple gunmen exchanged gunfire.
A number of shell casings of offensive weapons were found at the scene, from which it can be inferred that they were using different offensive weapons.
Judging from this, this is undoubtedly a continuous war.
There were bullet casings on the sidewalks on both sides of the street.
"So, there were a lot of armed men at the scene at the time," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
Many houses and vehicles were damaged in the area.
No arrest has yet been carried out and the police are said to be reviewing surveillance footage.
On Tuesday, a six-year-old child (girl) was shot in the arm by a stray bullet while playing in front of his home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is currently recovering and police are still pursuing the suspect.
Why we need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie
That's how I evaluate this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, but the United States has never been so dominant.
Second, this gymnastics team has three outstanding gymnasts — Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren Laurie Hernandez — who have been an inspiration to so many girls of color.
The composition of the team was a source of pride for all, as it included Aly Raisman of Judaism and Madison Kocian of Catholicism.
The team finally looks like the American team.
It also cemented the pinnacle of Black and Latino women in the sport.
For the past four years, the premier female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabrielle came in first and second place, respectively.
That's amazing.
At the last Olympics, Gabrielle Douglas "unexpectedly" became an Olympic champion, much to the cheers of the United States.
Today, the world can witness the incredible performances of three-time world champions Simon Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez. They bring the usual gymnastics techniques to life.
On Thursday, Simon helped the U.S. team win four straight titles in the women's individual all-around event.
Her teammate Ali Lesman won the silver medal.
We're at the pinnacle of the sport, but not in gymnastics classrooms across the United States.
Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie entered the Olympic team by the same path as Ali and Madison.
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will consist of four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karolyi's final year of coaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastics clubs, and their parents have to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotel expenses (including those associated with coaches, gymnasts and families), and the list of expenses is constantly growing.
Most gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs that support the industry.
All of the gymnasts' training is done in these clubs, which is a long-term expensive expense for the gymnast's family.
Aimee Boorman, the coach at Biles, and Maggie Haney, the coach at Hernandez, have coached the two gymnasts since they started doing gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to countless young girls who have been influenced by Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie.
Twenty years ago, I started my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we provide free, inexpensive gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youth, mostly Black and Hispanic, in black neighborhoods and produce national and even world champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and will benefit from this amazing Olympic sport.
Gymnastics helps to develop strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as hard-working spirit, self-discipline and determination.
These can lead to lifelong benefits for a person's health, school and work success.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participating in sports means a lot, especially for girls.
It's an exciting time.
Thank you to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for their incredible "girl power" in winning the Olympic team gold medal, and for inspiring so many young girls from all backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, junior doctors planned to launch a further strike
Ministers initially hoped to end the change-sparkled dispute by accepting a revised contract from British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who voted opposed the contract.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract, saying that the NHS was currently in a "vacuum" and that the slightest delay would hurt staff and patients.
The new contract first mentions changes to the overnight and weekend working practices of junior doctors in order to improve care during non-normal working hours.
Yesterday evening, Dr. Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's Junior Physicians Committee, said in a statement: "Junior physicians remain serious about the proposed contract, particularly that it will exacerbate the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all physicians fairly. ”
With only eight weeks left until the first doctors sign their new contracts, we need to make progress and time is running out.
The BMA has tried to negotiate a resolution of disputes, but people have been reluctant to participate, and sometimes the government has responded with silence.
Still, just last month we got a promise from Jeremy Hunt that his doors are always open.
Jeremy Hunt now needs to take action to remove enforcement and address the concerns of junior doctors.
If he doesn't, the junior doctors make it clear that they are ready for further labor action.
The last strike, which took place at the end of April, resulted in the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consulting doctors covered for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers initially hoped to end the change-sparkled dispute by accepting the BMA's revised contract.
The BMA wants to get better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract.
NHS Employers chief executive Daniel Mortimer has called on junior doctors not to stage any more strikes.
"Labour action has little effect, but instead puts a strain on the already dedicated team and service, causing worry, worry and confusion for patients, caregivers and their families," said Mr. Mortimer. ”
Over the past two months, we have been in ongoing negotiations with the Junior Doctors Committee and have been working with the Ministry of Health and other authorities to actively respond to their concerns about the role of guardians and whistleblowing.
Employers want to continue to actively discuss other important topics – such as deployment, flexibility in training, alternative training for those returning to work after a career break, training costs, a common understanding of the syllabus, study leave and gender pay differentials in the healthcare sector – illustrate the importance that employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health attach to the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
A £2 daily dose of medication reduces the risk of a heart attack
Officials have suggested that thousands of heart patients would benefit from a £2-a-day drug that would be rolled out to more patients and taken for longer periods of time.
The anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of heart recurrence in people with heart disease.
This medication, taken for 12 months after a heart attack, reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the UK's national health service (NHS) regulator, recommends that patients continue to take the medication for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now, the NHS regulator NICE recommends that patients continue to take the drug for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Around 140,000 people in England suffer from heart disease each year, and a quarter of them go on to experience heart recurrences or strokes.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty substances deposited in the walls of arteries to form plaques.
If the plaque breaks, it can cause a blood clot, which in turn blocks blood flow to the heart and leads to a heart attack.
If the blood clot moves, it enters the bloodstream and blocks blood flow to the brain, leading to a stroke.
People who have already experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of having another heart attack.
Manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the brand name Brilique, ticagrelor reduces the risk of developing blood clots by reducing the formation of blood clots.
The draft NICE guidance, released today, recommends that patients take ticagrelor 90 mg daily for 12 months, followed by 60mg of ticagrelor and aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Centre for Health Technology Assessment, said: "Despite effective secondary prevention treatments, up to a quarter of patients who have had a history of heart attack will have a recurrence or stroke, often with serious consequences. ”
The fear of relapse can have a big negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that ticagrelor when taken with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of heart recurrence and stroke in those who have experienced a heart attack.
We are pleased that the interim referral of ticagrelor will provide more treatment options for thousands of people who have benefited."
Due to limited information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor after three years, particularly the risk of bleeding, the draft guidance does not recommend continued treatment beyond this period.
Computer culture has allowed "election fraud" to flourish in Muslim areas
Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was brutally dismissed last year for corruption, prompting a government report.
The culture of "political correctness" has blinded the election fraud that is prevalent in Muslim communities, as the damaging government report reveals today.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles accused the police, election regulators and City Hall of turning a blind eye to evidence of election abuse due to "excessive sensitivity to racial divisions and religious issues".
The former minister of community affairs and current anti-corruption chief said that the practice of intimidating voters with religious positions had a bad impact and that the police should be allowed to set up a cordon outside polling stations to protect panicked voters.
He advised voters to bring their identity documents to the polls to confirm their identity.
For now, voters only need to state their names and addresses.
The report even recommends putting indelible ink on voters' fingers to prevent people from casting a second vote.
Sir Eric said there should be more protection for whistleblowers.
He called for increased access to the media to the documents of the meeting and the decisions taken by the unofficial committees or working groups.
"It's not just about preventing election fraud, it's about protecting local governments from a widespread culture of corruption and the financial scams that are closely tied to it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral tribunal ruled that the incumbent mayor, Rahman, should be dismissed for a litany of corruption and lawlessness.
The court found that Rahman had "ridiculously abused" the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and had kept silent on accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "campaigned for him as a religious obligation to vote for a loyal Muslim." ”
As many as 300 ballots were suspicious, possibly because voters had pretended to be someone else to vote.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of electoral fraud across the country.
In particular, he warned of mail-in election fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have put pressure on voters to vote for their chosen candidates.
Sir Eric (pictured) has a number of suggestions for cleaning up the voting mechanism, including bringing identity documents to prove his identity
"Evidence suggests that senior members, particularly from Pakistani and Bangladeshi background communities, put pressure on vulnerable groups in some minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote on their own terms," he said in the report. ”
"Overly sensitive to racial divisions and religious 'political correctness,' they fear that state institutions will turn a blind eye to such behavior. ”
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the electoral system, including a strict ban on political activists from handling mail-in voting papers to stop the "vote harvest".
The report also calls for scrutiny of registration information to prevent voter rolls from being used for immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa May is also considering the report.
The recommendations include requiring voters to show ID before casting their ballots.
After voting, the fingers of voters are smeared with indelible ink to prevent people from voting twice.
Systematic verification of voters' ethnicity to ensure eligibility to vote.
Limit the validity of automated mail-in voting requests to three years.
Political activists and activists are prohibited from disposing of completed mail-in voting and mail-in voting envelopes.
Authorize the police to set up a cordon around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier to prosecute intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
It is illegal to take photos at polling stations.
English is only allowed at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff strictly enforce the rule that "voters go to the polling room alone".
Sir Eric slammed the Metropolitan Police and said it was "surprising" that they had not brought any criminal charges after the Tower Hamlets incident.
"Rahman and his election officers have been disqualified by the Electoral Court for their corruption and violations," he said.
According to the standard of criminal proof, he is undoubtedly guilty in many respects.
He also criticized the "checkbox check" of the town hall's electoral registration department.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court verdict on Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call. ”
Our country has a proud tradition of being the "mother of parliaments", but the covert electoral fraud and subsequent denial by certain institutions is a cause for concern and threatens that reputation.

CBC Olympic commentators apologized for comments that Chinese swimmers were "slow as pigs".
On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald's comments about 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay angered viewers watching the CBC Olympics live
A CBC commentator for the Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after saying that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "swam faster than the smell at the start" and ended up "as slow as a pig."
Commentator Byron MacDonald gave some of his thoughts at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final, when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
Spectators heard Byron, who wore "tinted glasses" on the CBC commentator team, say, "That 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake. ”
I was so excited that I swam faster than the smell at the beginning, but then I was as slow as a pig.
It's really thanks to her.
China's 14-year-old swimmer Ai Yanhan swam second with a time of 1:57.79 – 1.61 seconds behind Canada's Taylor Ruck – closing the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada were taken aback by the narrator's tone and wording, and they quickly reacted online
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "The CBC commentator said the Chinese 14-year-old swimmer was 'slow as a pig'???"
The idiot didn't realize it was going live.
Ai Yanhan, a Chinese teenager who competed in the final of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay, was described as follows: "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake. ”
Criticism of Byron Macdonald quickly spread on Twitter, with many demanding that he quit the commentary.
When Twitter users heard that Byron MacDonald was slow to react to this, they didn't stop there.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and your words and actions make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #真令人讨厌.
Soon after, CBC radio host Scott Russel apologized during the live broadcast for Byron's remarks, saying, "We apologize for the comments on the performance of the live swimmers. ”
"We are sorry for this anachronistic language. ”
The CBC apologized more than 90 times to Twitter users who responded to the remarks
Another commentator, Scott Russel, also apologized on behalf of Byron
The CBC later copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who protested Byron's commentary
The channel was also quick to apologize and issue a statement.
We couldn't be more sorry for saying such things and streaming them live.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to viewers who tuned in to our livestream and those who followed us on social media.
It should be noted that Byron's commentary is aimed at the swimmer's performance, but not at her personally.
That said, the wording was really inappropriate, and Byron was deeply sorry for that.
On Thursday afternoon, Mr. McDonald apologized on a live broadcast, saying that his words did not mean the slightest personal attack and tried to excuse his remarks.
"I wanted to take a moment to apologize for the remarks I made last night after the women's relay," he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I'm just commenting on the swimmer's performance, not on the individual. ”
"Of course, I don't mean to be disrespectful, and I'm sorry. ”
Primark customers expressed their anger at a woman who brazenly tried on her panties in the center of the store
A woman strips and tries on panties on the spot in the middle of a Primark store, and customers don't know where to look.
To make matters worse, she also looked at how she looked when she put them on, then took off her panties and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves and eventually tried on four pairs of panties at this store in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The woman kept trying on her panties at the Primark store in Folkestone's Bouverie Place shopping mall before putting them back on the shelves
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, who was also in the store at the time, said that after trying on her underwear, the mysterious woman "got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything." ”
"People can't believe what they're seeing," she said. ”
She stood in the middle of the store, took a pair of panties from the shelf, took off her leggings and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a hidden place to try it on – she just stood there, and it was brazen. ”
When she took off her panties again, everyone was stunned. Apparently, she was still not satisfied, as she put her panties back on the shelves. ”
After that, she tried three more like this, and finally found that none of them were what she liked, and then got dressed again and walked out of the store.
She didn't seem to care that anyone was watching her — or that anyone would end up buying the panties she tried on. ”
Ms. Davidson (33), who lives in the town of Kent, said: "The thought of someone buying underwear that someone else has worn and hasn't been washed makes me sick. ”
It happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "When she left, it was obvious that the clerk was going to take the panties off the shelves, and thankfully. ”
"I hate buying a new pair of panties only to find out that another woman tried them on and they weren't washed. ”
A spokesperson for Primark said: "Primark is already aware of what happened at our Folkestone store on Tuesday, Aug. 9. ”
All problematic items have been removed from shelves.
How to use Krav Maga to defend yourself in gun attacks
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com might give you a sense of security.
We asked Rhon Mizrachi, a Krav Maga Federation guru in New York, about how to deal with gunmen up close.
Whether he's approaching you from the front or behind, this video will teach you how to turn defeat into victory.
If a gunman approaches you from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and "clear the line of fire," Mizrachi said.
Next, hold the gun between your forearms and shoulders and hit the attacker in the face with your elbow.
He then pressed his knee against his groin, and when the assailant bent down in pain, twisted the gun in his hand and punched him in the face with the barrel and reserve gun, keeping the weapon aimed at him.
If the gunner approaches from the front, a similar technique is used - keep your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist the muzzle so that the gunner cannot fire.
At the same time, pressing the weight on the gun and striking the attacker in the chest, twisting the muzzle from his clenched hand, and then aiming the muzzle at him.
Sounds complicated?
Check out the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga master, the safest way to get out of a robbery is to hand over the cash.
A rogue family destroys a low-cost rental house in Soltash, Cornwall, before being evicted
A rogue family who had been evicted for intimidating their neighbours vandalised their low-cost rental house before leaving, causing £50,000 in damage.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their low-cost rental house in Soldash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from the residence, housing association officials were surprised to find that the place had been severely damaged.
The walls were full of holes, the floors were torn, garbage was thrown all over the floor, and the walls were painted in a mess.
After the eviction, the family has been moving and is said to be currently living in a private residence
Housing manager Donna McEvoy of the Cornwall Housing Association said she was concerned the house was out of reach.
"It's a nightmare for the people who live here, and I don't think people can live like that," she said. ”
There are a lot of things to weigh now as this home is likely to be a not-so-good element in Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and their names are equally notorious.
The couple has three sons, and they will live here from time to time. Police said the family's terrorist acts included using baseball bats to fight in the streets, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug trafficking, yelling, arguing and swearing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant, Skeldon, received an antisocial behaviour resolution.
In this house, which is likely to be demolished, many of the rooms are rubbish that has been sitting for a long time
In this room where drugs were once traded, the floor was lifted
Neighbors said they were often seen fighting in the streets, and they often called the police because of this
After giving them an 11-week extension to move out voluntarily, the Cornwall Housing Association forcibly evicted her and her husband from the residence this week.
Finally relieved, the neighbors cheered, saying that their previous life was a hell on earth.
One neighbor said, "They don't care about anyone. ”
We've lived next door to them for 20 years and it's been so bad.
We've seen the police come to our door countless times.
"This morning, we couldn't sleep. ”
We woke up early because it was so quiet – we weren't used to it yet!
It's great that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive community manager for the Cornwall Housing Society, said the family had not been able to cooperate well with the local government.
The family lived in the house for 20 years and was visited frequently by the police
Garbage and old toys were thrown on the overgrown side of the low-rent housing
He added: "It is regrettable that the tenant has not been held accountable for her actions with her family, and eviction is a last resort for Cornwall Housing to consider." ”
This is a very difficult case to deal with, because their actions are very extreme, and what they have done must have terrified the neighbors.
I am grateful for the work my team has done, as well as Devon and Cornwall Police and the community members who have been brave enough to provide us with information.
I hope this will bring some comfort to my neighbors and send a message that we will not tolerate anti-social behavior.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said that their three sons had lived in the house at various times, but also said that they were all in their 20s.
After they were evicted, a dirty mattress was thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms
Housing association workers will soon be cleaning up piles of trash around the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, as well as scales, drug paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of Class B drugs and intent to sell drugs.
She claimed that the money was used to buy a tombstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is understood that after becoming homeless, Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
Graffiti was painted on the walls of several rooms of the house.
Police said they would evict tenants who defy tenant rules.
Angela Crow of Devon & Cornwall Police said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to defy tenant rules.
"This warning is aimed at those who believe their actions are not to be blamed and those who are devastated by them," she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police do not tolerate crime and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work together to protect our communities.
Reed: Hillary Clinton will nominate Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he was confident that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton were elected president, she would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated Garland in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would choose this person to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call on Thursday that he predicted Mrs. Clinton would choose Garland, who has "some credibility."
A spokeswoman for Reed then said that Reed did not speak directly to Mrs. Clinton about whether Mr. Garland would be nominated, and said he was just speculating.
He lavished praise on Garland and said Clinton's team didn't want to "mess up" with new candidates.
Garland is the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
The Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination were "favorites" and "achievers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Reed said.
He said Trump was not fit to be president.
Treats: Nude Calendar "Loved by Both Men and Women"
Treats magazine is teaming up with photographer David Bellemere to create a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the '70s.
This time, they plan to find a new generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar, rather than famous nudes.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, said earlier this year that their nude-focused magazine was different from the old-school Playboy because "the latter is geared towards men." ”
And we're for women.
Apparently, he thinks the same is true of this set of calendars.
"We needed to show timeless and classic nudity that made women and men feel comfortable alike, and this time was inspired by that," Shaw said at a calendar launch.
Women will be happy to participate in this shoot because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their photos online or in person at open recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.
Video reports show that the small-headed sleeping shark is the longest-lived vertebrate
Scientists say the Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate on Earth.
Julius Nielsen, who has been studying sharks, said that a female small-headed sleeping shark was estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
A French court rejected a petition to demolish shops in jungle refugee camps
A French court rejected a petition by the Calais government to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the "jungle" camp. The camp is currently home to thousands of refugees.
At a hearing before the court this week, the Calais government argued that the French government should have the right to demolish a total of 72 makeshift shops in the camp. Shops in the camps sell everything from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, and sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Governor's Office of Calais believes that these places should be demolished because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, as well as fire and health hazards.
Humanitarian groups, however, told the court that the shops and restaurants were extremely important because the free food provided by State-sponsored associations and other groups simply did not meet the needs of the growing number of refugees in the camp.
They say the makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to evict the operators of the 72 temporary shops, but said the prefect of Calais was "entirely understandable".
Jean· Judge François Molla said the role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants goes far beyond simply providing food to refugees who are "living in extremely dangerous conditions".
These places, he said, are calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition is the camp's Jungle Book Kids, a non-profit shop that provides 200 daily food, English and French lessons, and shelter advice for hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the café.
A letter to the Guardian wrote that the closure of the café "would be a catastrophe for these children, many as eight years old." ”
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle camps had exceeded 9,000, the highest level since the summer surge.
"This 5,000 yuan subsidy has solved my urgent need. ”
Zhou Fen, a girl from Miqi Village, Changle Township, Huayuan County, received an admission notice from the University of South China.
Just when she was worried about the cost of admission, on August 9, the Youth League and County Committee promptly implemented a subsidy of 5,000 yuan for her.
In the past few days, the relevant departments of the county have also implemented 2.838 million yuan of education subsidies for more than 690 poor college students.
At the same time, for those whose family economic situation is particularly difficult, they are also helped to complete their studies by organizing social donations to support their studies.
This year, Huayuan has integrated more than 18.5 million yuan of student funds, and the financial department has raised more than 2.5 million yuan by itself, which will be transferred to the real-name bank cards of poor students by the financial department within the prescribed time limit.
She said gratefully: "I thought that my father had passed away and my brother and I would not be able to go to college, but I didn't expect the county to solve the difficulties for us in time." ”
As of August 8, Huayuan has implemented more than 21 million yuan of various relief funds for 13,140 poor students in the first half of this year.
All poor students from the county have achieved all the help they deserve, and the supplement will be supplemented.
The reporter saw at the scene that the front of a large container truck moved to the fast lane under the command of the traffic police, and the container box fell on the green road, and a 2-centimeter-deep pit was smashed on the side of the road.
According to Xinhua News Agency, the government of New South Wales, Australia, announced on the 11th that it would spend 200 million Australian dollars (about 154 million US dollars) on the largest renovation of the famous Sydney Opera House since its completion.
The NSW government said the renovation would not alter the shell-like shape of the opera house.
One of Sydney's landmarks, the Sydney Opera House was designed by Danish architect Jörn Utsson and completed in 1973 and welcomes around 8 million visitors a year.
Rory Jeffs, general manager of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes that the Sydney Opera House will use the renovation to make a "comeback" and become "one of the best acoustic-sound concert halls in the world".
Non-Beijing citizens who have lived in Beijing for more than 6 months and meet one of the conditions for legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence, and continuous study in Beijing can apply for a residence permit.
Recently, the implementation rules of Beijing's "Interim Regulations on Residence Permits" were promulgated, which means that "temporary residence permits" will be upgraded to "residence permits".
The person in charge of the relevant department said that the change from "temporary residence permit" to "residence permit" means that Beijing's non-Beijing permanent resident population will be changed from "management" to multi-faceted services.
This reporter learned from the State Administration of Taxation today that as of the end of June this year, tax authorities at all levels have announced 2,470 "blacklist" cases of tax violations.
It is understood that in July 2014, the State Administration of Taxation took the lead among the functional departments of the central government and jointly issued the "Measures for the Publication of Information on Major Tax Violation Cases" with the "Measures for the Administration of Tax Credit".
Not only will the facts, legal basis, and punishment of these cases be announced, but also the basic information of the parties to the law and the responsible persons of the relevant intermediaries will also be included in the "blacklist" and exposed.
Government departments such as quality inspection, finance, and customs have also taken relevant punitive measures against the "blacklist" parties.
"The credit restoration mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and even the credit system of the whole society, marking the continuous development and improvement of the construction of China's social credit system and becoming more and more mature. ”
"Environmental problems are manifested in air, water, and soil pollution, but the root cause is still in production and lifestyle."
For example, in 2015, the land development rate in Jiangsu Province was as high as 21%, ranking the highest among all provinces and autonomous regions in the country.
Therefore, the problems of high pollution, large energy, and excessive land occupation have not been fundamentally addressed from the transformation of production and lifestyle.
On the one hand, from the perspective of the effectiveness of the creation of various ecological environments at all levels in Jiangsu Province, it ranks first in the country with an absolute advantage, but on the other hand, the pressure on resources and environment is great.
To solidly promote the protection and governance of the ecological environment, it is necessary to fundamentally promote the transformation of production and lifestyle, and promote the transformation and benefit the people's livelihood with the construction of ecological civilization.
On the 11th, at the Lianyungang Port Wharf, 42 wind turbine blades produced by Guodian Group were loaded into the ship and prepared for export to South Africa.
Since last year, a total of 163 wind power projects have been exported to South Africa from Lianyungang Port.
The third-party company (non-Chinese company) commissioned by the Olympic Organizing Committee to make the national flag is located in the Brazilian state of São Paulo, about 75 kilometers from the city of São Paulo.
In order to urge the manufacturer to complete the project as soon as possible, the Chinese Consulate General in Sao Paulo organized special personnel to rush to the factory to do in-depth work.
After 30 hours of overtime, the manufacturer finally completed the production of the Chinese flag and loaded it for shipment, completing the task that would have taken 4-5 working days ahead of schedule.
It is reported that the national flag is expected to arrive in Rio on the 11th, and the Olympic Organizing Committee will send it to various Olympic venues after receiving the national flag, and the whole process will be completed under the supervision of the Chinese embassy and consulates in Brazil.
On the 10th, the Nantong Municipal Government held a Shanghai-Tong industrial cooperation meeting at the Shanghai International Convention Center, and more than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate, and more than 20 billion yuan of Shanghai-Tong industrial docking projects were signed on the spot.
The 20 projects signed with a total investment of 8.063 billion yuan involve new energy, new materials, modern service industries and other industries.
Qingdao is the 12th city in China and the first pilot city in Shandong Province for the paid use and trading of emission rights.
On the 11th, a number of enterprises came to the Qingdao Emission Rights Trading Center to submit the application for emission rights, and they will pay paid use fees after the application is accepted.
The first transaction to be completed this time also indicates the official start of Qingdao's pilot emission rights trading work, which will also be the first emission rights trading in the province and the first city-level emission rights trading in the country.
On the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Fine Chemical (Group) Co., Ltd., came to Qingdao Emission Rights Trading Center to submit an application for emission rights.
The company's factory in the old city of Qingdao was completely shut down at the end of last year, and the environmental protection moved to a new factory in Pingdu.
After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, the environmental impact report of the construction project and other materials, the Qingdao Emission Rights Reserve and Trading Service Center began to conduct a preliminary review of the application materials.
According to the collection standards determined by the Qingdao Municipal Commodity Prices, Finance and other departments, the initial estimated fee for the use of pollutant discharge rights is about 641,200 yuan, and the staff will complete the verification within 7 working days.
The first transaction that is about to be completed also indicates that the pilot work of Qingdao emission rights trading has officially kicked off, and it will also be the first emission rights trading in the province and the first city-level emission rights trading in the country.
Zhao Xiuping said that at present, the enterprise has invested 400 million yuan in environmental protection, which is a huge amount on the surface, but it has a great impact on the company's management concept and social benefits, and has also opened up space for enterprise innovation management.
On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xinchengzhizhuo Bus Parts Co., Ltd. also came to purchase emission rights for the high-speed rail and EMU interior accessories project with an annual output of 4,200 pieces.
The project belongs to a mechanical processing enterprise, and the initial emission rights applied for are chemical oxygen demand (COD) 0.514 tons/year and ammonia nitrogen (NOX) 0.052 tons/year.
The paid use and trading of air pollutant emission rights are key industrial enterprises that produce and supply electricity and heat for the city.
Existing pollutant dischargers that have obtained an EIA before January 1, 2016 will not be subject to paid user fees for the time being.
"Obtaining the right to discharge pollutants for a fee does not mean that you have the right to discharge pollutants illegally, and you cannot discharge pollutants at will. ”
Han Hongyan, deputy director of the Qingdao Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, said that if illegal and excessive pollution discharge is still punished in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises to avoid punishment by purchasing pollutant discharge rights.
In other words, through legal means, we will crack down on environmental violations and severely punish enterprises for exceeding the standard of pollutant discharge, so as to protect the environment and protect public health.
Now, for the sake of their own interests, enterprises have increased their enthusiasm for pollution control, cherished the limited right to discharge pollutants, and reduced pollutant emissions.
Driven by economic interests, reducing pollutant emissions has changed from a compulsory behavior of the government to a conscious market behavior of enterprises, so as to truly achieve the purpose of protecting the environment, protecting nature and protecting public health.
The right to discharge pollutants, also known as the "right to discharge", is the right to discharge pollutants, which refers to the right of dischargers to discharge pollutants into the environment within the quota allocated by the government.
This right is essentially the right of the polluter to possess, use and benefit from the environmental capacity resources.
In the next step, under the premise that the total amount of pollutant discharge does not exceed the allowable discharge, the internal pollution sources will adjust the amount of pollutant discharge to each other through currency exchange.
Since 1968, the American economist Dyers proposed emission rights trading, and the United States began to apply it to the management of air and river pollution sources in the 70s of the 20th century.
China began to carry out pilot projects in 2007, and 14 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) such as Zhejiang and Jiangsu have been fully implemented.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, in order to assist the six strategic bombers in carrying out air strikes on "Islamic State" targets in Syria, a number of Russian warplanes rose from the Syrian Khmeimim airbase to provide support.
On February 22 this year, the United States and Russia reached an agreement on a ceasefire between the parties to the conflict in Syria, and the ceasefire agreement began on the 27th of that month.
According to the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes against terrorist groups designated by the UN Security Council, such as the Islamic State and the Al-Nusra al-Nusra.
Russia will continue to build relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of Russian soldiers will be guaranteed accordingly.
He also said that if extremist forces are not cracked down, they will expand to Russia.
Although Russia and the West have not reached an agreement on jointly combating extremist forces in Syria, Russia will strengthen cooperation with Syria, Iran, Iraq and other countries in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia began a military strike against extremist forces in Syria at the invitation of the Syrian government.
On March 15 this year, Russia's main military forces in Syria began to withdraw, but the Russian side promised to continue to maintain the Khmeimim airbase and the Tartus naval base.
In the case of the rebirth of the old house and the success of the township, He Peijun made a good demonstration: inheriting a century-old house, and also telling the story of the inheritance of a piece of land.
Today, an average of 100,000 people flock to Zhushan every year to bring all kinds of ideas or seek inner peace.
In fact, the relationship between the countryside and the city should be accompanied by each other, just like a mother and a child, there is no difference between strong and weak, there is no need for anyone to rule whom, it should be very warm.
There is no fixed model for rural development, but it is difficult to rely on the spontaneous change of the countryside, and the most important point should be to let the right people go to the countryside.
The traffic management department of Songjiang District, Shanghai, recently used electronic police to rectify drivers driving and playing with mobile phones, and more than 30 cases were seized in a week.
With the popularity of smart phones, mobile phones are becoming more and more fun, and it has become the norm to brush WeChat, post Weibo, and even play games and visit Taobao.
The Road Traffic Safety Law explicitly prohibits driving with a mobile phone and defines it as "an act that impedes safe driving".
Unfortunately, due to the large number of violators and the difficulty of obtaining evidence, this phenomenon has not been punished as it should be, and the law has almost become an ornament.
If the traffic management department can make up its mind to "declare war" on the behavior of driving and playing with mobile phones, and normalize this measure, this illegal behavior will definitely be curbed.
It is necessary to strictly manage household registration files, and establish electronic and paper files for the household registration materials of people without household registration one by one to ensure that the file materials are complete and effective.
The public security organs shall promptly report to the relevant departments the circumstances of handling the household registration of persons without household registration.
Policies and measures that are inconsistent with the spirit of these Implementation Opinions will be cleaned up in a centralized manner, and those that should be revised will be seriously revised and those that should be repealed will be resolutely abolished.
In a collective greenhouse in Donglin Village, Taicang City, 48-year-old Wang Xuefen is leading workers to spray pesticides on pear trees.
The village has 150 acres of orchards and more than 10 tree species, and only needs 12 workers and 1 technical engineer.
Last year, it was a total of 50,000 yuan, and at my age, if I worked in a factory, I would definitely not get this money.
Last year, Donglin Village's village-level income reached 22 million yuan, of which nearly half was agricultural income.
Su Qifang, village secretary: The per capita land planting area is increasing every year, from 50 mu at the beginning, to more than 100 mu now; the per mu benefit is increasing every year, and the income of professional farmers also has room to increase every year.
The biggest highlight of the rural collective economic reform in southern Jiangsu is to clarify the property rights of rural collective operating assets and explore the separation of politics and economy.
In July 2015, 14 rural economic cooperative organizations in Anzhen Sub-district, Xishan District, Wuxi City, and the village committees of their villages "shared account management", with the village committees performing rural public affairs management and the cooperative organizations mainly engaged in business.
The two institutions have two accounts, and they do not "build boundaries" with each other, so as to prevent corruption in the participation of village cadres in the operation of collective assets.
Zhu Baoping, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Commission, said that in the next step, Jiangsu will continue to promote the reform of the community shareholding cooperative system, encourage the joint development of farmers, and establish a village-level democratic power operation mechanism.
Zhu Baoping: We should further push forward the reform, engage in community shareholding cooperation, quantify assets to members, fix them to rural households, and form clear property rights.
Through the Internet +, the implementation of his right to know, the right to participate in decision-making and the right to supervise democratic management, the three rights are implemented to farmers, and indeed make it a standardized operating mechanism of shareholding cooperation.
At present, the new collective economy in rural areas of southern Jiangsu has mainly formed four development models: asset leasing, enterprise shares, agricultural development, and joint development.
It is understood that overseas exhibitions have become an important platform to promote the construction of the "Belt and Road" in Zhejiang Province.
The successful holding of these overseas exhibitions has accumulated valuable experience and a good foundation for continuing to explore emerging markets along the "Belt and Road" and building a comprehensive platform for overseas exhibitions.
Peak will always be guided by improving consumers' sports needs, build a sports industry ecosystem, and accelerate the strategic upgrade from a single sporting goods manufacturing enterprise to a professional sports service enterprise.
Hamill added that another 34 people were taken to hospital with injuries, including three firefighters with minor injuries, who had been discharged.
As the whereabouts of some of the residents are still unknown, he also called on the residents of the apartment where the fire broke out to contact the authorities.
It is reported that Ms. Mariana Turay, who has lived in the apartment for 30 years, said: "It looks like a bomb has fallen. ”
It is reported that it took 1 hour and 45 minutes for the local fire brigade to extinguish the fire, and residents of nearby buildings were allowed to return to their homes after a few hours.
American Red Cross personnel estimate that about 100 people are homeless, 60 to 70 of them, mostly Hispanic residents, who are staying in shelters in nearby community centers.
On August 11, the first Jinzhou Wetland Tourism and Culture Festival opened on the bank of "Hequan Lake" in Jinzhou Oriental Huadi City.
Since 2014, the tourism industry has generated 10% of Jinzhou's GDP, and in 2015 it reached 11.3%.
Oriental Huadi City Wetland Hot Spring Tourist Area is located at No. 1, Linghai Section, Coastal Highway, Linghai Dayou Economic Zone, Jinzhou City, 70 kilometers away from Jinzhou City, 50 kilometers away from Linghai City, and 70 kilometers away from Panjin City.
There are indoor hot springs in the scenic area covering an area of 3,000 square meters and outdoor hot springs covering an area of 4,600 square meters.
Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: "beautiful hands" started the road to shooting, and her career has been "reversed" several times
Zhang Donghong of Dongyuan Village, Xiang'an District, Xiamen, just replaced the 29-inch old TV at home with a 65-inch large TV a few days ago.
The daughter of this ordinary farmer is Zhang Binbin, who won the silver medal in the women's 50-meter rifle three-position final at the Rio Olympics for China on the evening of the 11th.
On the night of the 11th, in front of this new TV, Zhang Donghong and his wife and dozens of relatives and friends witnessed the magical process of their daughter catching up all the way, from being eliminated in the almost preliminary round to almost reversing.
In the competition of the day, Zhang Binbin once ranked in the middle and lower reaches, and it seemed that he was very far away from the final.
But his parents, relatives and friends did not give up, and kept scrolling through the text live broadcast, seeing that as the other players finished the race, Zhang Binbin's ranking improved all the way, and finally locked the final seat, and his family suddenly erupted in cheers.
In the final, Zhang Binbin was once ranked low, and the last few shots became more and more stable, and he only won the silver medal by 0.2 rings behind the champion.
Zhang Binbin, who is 27 years old this year, has almost missed this hard-won silver medal several times in his 16-year shooting career.
His mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told reporters that when they hesitated, Zhang Binbin found several "novelists" from the same village.
These "novelists" were children from the same village who were recommended to participate in the training camp at the same time, including Zhang Binbin's cousin.
Not long after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again took the initiative to return to Xiang'an's school because of family difficulties and other reasons.
But after his enlightenment coach Zhang Yajie repeatedly did his work, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once returned home again because he couldn't enter the national team because he couldn't get into the national team.
This time, not only Coach Zhang Yajie, but also the leaders and coaches of the Xiamen Shooting and Archery Sports Center and the Fujian Provincial Team came to the house and finally persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team.
Just like yesterday's game, this Xiamen girl's persistence achieved one reversal after another on the road of shooting.
"Each coach has a different way of selecting players, and when I saw that Binbin's hands were beautiful, I immediately fell in love. ”
Zhang Donghong also recalled that in the training test, although her daughter's results were not the best, the number of rings played was very stable, which was also an important reason why Zhang Binbin attracted coaches.
In the process of training Zhang Binbin, what impressed Zhang Yajie the most was the input of this peasant girl.
He recalled that more than a year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen shooting team, the team conducted a long-term training in vertical shooting, and required the team members to not move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that his daughter has always been a quiet and well-behaved child, and she likes to draw and make handmade toys since she was a child.
"Originally, I would make clothes and sew and mend at home, and Binbin would pick up some leftovers and make dolls by himself. ”
She said that her daughter often sews handmade toys by herself, and she is good at drawing, from the facial features of the dolls to the clothing, she can always make them lifelike.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and his family get together less and leave more, and can only go home on holidays, and usually rely on phone calls.
Parents said that whether it was meeting or calling, Zhang Binbin rarely talked about his hard work, and more talked about happy things with his parents.
I usually don't see my daughter, and my parents carefully store their daughter's paintings when she was a child and the honors of the past years at home.
Zhang Xiaolong showed his daughter's cartoons to reporters, "If she hadn't been a shooter, she would have continued to draw."
In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's house, there is a cabinet full of medals, medals and certificates she has received.
Zhang Donghong placed the medals and medals neatly, and the certificates were put into a folder for preservation, "These are the honors that Binbin has worked hard for more than ten years, and we all cherish them." ”
Recently, the Hebei Provincial Charity and Filial Piety Fund sent 16,000 yuan of condolences to 6 families who lost their relatives in Xiaozuo, Taitou, Guiquan and other villages in Jingcheng County.
This is another condolence and care action after the fund issued a message to the society to find "children and lonely elderly people who lost their relatives in the 7.19 flood".
7.19 Heavy rainfall caused disasters in many places in Hebei Province, causing floods in some areas of the province, and people died and went missing.
The good man "Lao Tie" died unfortunately for helping the community to drain the water, leaving behind a 2-year-old child and a wife who was pregnant with Liujia, and the touching deeds of the good man "Lao Tie" touched the entire provincial capital.
On August 4th, the staff of Hebei Provincial Cixiao Fund and volunteers of Hebei Brand Association came to the home of the good man "Lao Tie" and handed over 3,200 yuan of love money to the family of "Lao Tie".
When Ye Li, vice president of the brand association, learned about the current situation of the "Lao Tie" family, she immediately decided to carry out the "love charity sale" activity among the corporate members of the brand club to help the "Lao Tie" family tide over the difficulties.
Hebei Provincial Cixiao Fund, the full name of Hebei Volunteer Service Foundation and Cixiao Fund, was initiated by the Preparatory Committee of Hebei Brand Association and established in August 2015.
According to a report by Hong Kong's Oriental Daily on August 12, there are currently three major problems in the sale of diamonds in the mainland, including the clarity of false diamonds pushing up the price, the weight of false diamonds, and the lack of after-sales guarantee.
Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers, and the diamonds sold by local artisans are renowned for their diamond-cutting skills, which are highly sought after by mainland ladies.
"A small cloth bag, held in the palm of your hand, is worth nearly a million yuan," said an aunt surnamed Liu, who participated in the purchase of diamonds, describing her experience in Antwerp in June this year to mainland media.
She said that she hid the diamond in her underwear, took it to the toilet and shower for several days, and was very nervous when she walked and slept.
She said that the purchase price of the diamonds she bought in Antwerp was about 55,000 yuan per carat, and that the retail price of diamonds of the same quality in Xiamen was about 111,000 yuan.
A few days ago, she added 20% of the purchase price to sell all the diamonds she purchased, making a big profit of 200,000 yuan at one time.
According to the regulations of the Mainland Customs, diamonds are not articles or necessities for passengers during their journey, so they belong to the category of goods, and they need to be declared when entering and exiting the country, otherwise they may be classified as smuggling, and in serious cases, they may be sentenced to imprisonment.
According to foreign media reports, on the 10th local time, the British Prime Minister's Office Downing Street announced: British Prime Minister Theresa May will go to Switzerland for the summer vacation, but did not disclose the specific place of vacation.
Some media said that after the British referendum to leave the European Union, the new British prime minister chose to go on vacation to Switzerland, a "neutral country" on the European continent, with a certain policy symbolism.
The British newspaper The Guardian commented that the symbolism represented by Switzerland, a neutral country, played a role in the choice of the location of the British Prime Minister's first vacation.
The British "Daily Telegraph" commented that Theresa May chose to go to Switzerland for a vacation, which is the first time that a British prime minister has gone to Switzerland for a vacation since Margaret Thatcher.
The choice of the two female prime ministers contrasts with the preference of the two male prime ministers, Tony Blair and Cameron, who prefer to go on holiday in hotter places.
It is reported that the new British Prime Minister Theresa May will return to London on August 24, after which a series of important work and activities await her.
The UK parliament will resume on September 5 and will debate a second Brexit referendum called for online.
On June 23, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, but the new British prime minister was unwilling to initiate Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on Brexit by the end of the year.
There are 1,325 intangible cultural heritage items in Huangshan City, ranking first in the province in terms of variety and quantity.
Since the intangible cultural heritage of Hui culture mainly relies on oral transmission and face-to-face teaching, many intangible cultural heritage are on the verge of being lost, and it is imperative to use digital technology to preserve and protect them.
According to the key points of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress this year, the Standing Committee plans to hear and deliberate special work reports, and carry out special inquiries on the implementation of the Banking Supervision and Administration Law and the service of local economic development.
In mid-August, the Standing Committee will organize two research groups to go to some cities to conduct investigations and make preparations for special inquiries.
Hua Jianhui pointed out that the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress listened to and deliberated on the special work report of the vertical management department and carried out special inquiries for the first time in our province, which is an active exploration to strengthen and expand the supervision work of the people's congress.
At the exercise command headquarters in Kashgar, Xinjiang, following the order of the chief director, the armed police units stationed in Kashgar, Hotan, and Aksu quickly carried out a mobile assembly in accordance with the instructions and dispatched to the exercise site.
China's Mars program is coming
China's Mars exploration mission must orbit, land, and patrol at one time, which has never been done in foreign countries.
China's Mars exploration and launch goal is to orbit, land, and patrol in one step, and this task is quite difficult.
Because it takes 26 months for Mars exploration to encounter a time window, experts are working engineering plans to launch China's first Mars rover in 2020.
According to Xu Dazhe, although China's aircraft have entered deep space, it is still indispensable to complete the Mars exploration mission, which means that China has entered the era of deep space exploration in a real sense.
"Every two or three years, there is only one chance that Mars is closest to Earth, and launching a Mars rover at this point in time is the most energy-saving for the launch vehicle. ”
"Considering the mass of the Mars probe, the launch mission will be completed by China's Long March 5 carrier rocket. ”
China's Mars exploration mission has to achieve orbiting, landing, and patrol at one time, which has never been done in foreign countries, and foreign countries have planned to achieve orbiting and landing at one time, but the landing has failed.
Mars exploration involves many technical fields, and the special thing is that although the rover is a space probe, it has distinctive characteristics compared with ordinary space probes.
In other words, the Mars rover must have the ability to determine the route and detect the danger of obstacles.
Pang Zhihao, a researcher at the Fifth Academy of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, said that the reason why mankind is so interested in Mars exploration is because Mars exploration has important scientific, technological and other significance, and is even related to the future of mankind.
At present, Mars has become the planet with the highest degree of human research except the Earth, and the history of human exploration of Mars using space probes runs through almost the entire history of human spaceflight.
Therefore, humanity hopes to one day establish a living base on Mars, and eventually migrate to Mars, turning it into a second home for humans.
There are also plenty of indications that Mars may well have been like the Earth today, with a thin atmosphere, cooler temperatures, and depleted water sources after billions of years of evolution.
Therefore, the exploration or manned landing on Mars for research can put forward a plan to prevent the Earth from becoming a second Mars that is difficult for humans to live on.
As of June 2016, there have been 114 lunar explorations and 43 Mars explorations around the world.
However, from the 90s of the 20th century to the present, humans have carried out a total of 18 Mars explorations, while the Moon has only carried out 14 explorations.
There are currently 5 Mars orbiters and 2 Mars rovers in operation, but only 1 lunar orbiter and 1 lunar lander are working.
The world's space powers have formulated exploration plans aimed at the Mars system, which shows that today's Mars exploration is hotter than the lunar exploration.
On November 5, 2013, India launched its first Mars rover, Mangarien, becoming the first country in Asia to successfully explore Mars.
Mangarion is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars, and to find out if there is methane and signs of life on Mars.
The most difficult part of this mission is that after the probe enters the Martian atmosphere, the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration only have one chance
According to Sun Zezhou, chief designer of the Mars rover of the Fifth Academy of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Mars exploration mission faces many technical challenges.
The Martian atmosphere pressure is very low, only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on the Earth's surface, and has a high degree of uncertainty.
Scientists do not yet have a thorough understanding of its changes and its storm-time behavior.
Mars often forms dust storms similar to Earth's dust weather in the summer, which can cause a sharp drop in the amount of sunlight energy received by the rover, and the rover must be designed to "sleep" and let it patiently wait for the dust storm to pass.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere also has a reducing effect on solar light, which brings problems to the energy supply of Mars exploration.
This requires the probe to have a larger solar wing and to constantly adjust and try to align with the sun.
Also, the gravity on the surface of Mars is only 38% of that of Earth, but much more than the gravity of the surface of the Moon, so the probe needs more power.
"The core and most difficult part of this Mars exploration mission is the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration process of the probe after entering the Martian atmosphere. ”
Sun Zezhou said that due to the distance between the Earth and Mars, the whole process cannot be controlled by the ground in real time, so it must be completed independently by the probe.
Since there is not as much propellant to counteract such high speeds, the deceleration of landing on Mars depends on the action of the Martian atmosphere, which is difficult to simulate on the ground.
Pang Zhihao said that in general, the way of exploring Mars is similar to the way of exploring the moon, which is also "orbiting, landing, patrolling, and returning", and finally achieving the goal of manned landing on Mars.
Because Mars is much farther away from Earth than the Moon is from Earth, exploring Mars requires a more complex set of technical hurdles to overcome.
According to Taiwan media reports, Taiwan's "Premier" Lin Quan announced yesterday morning that the "Regulations on the Handling of Improper Acquisition of Property by Political Parties and Their Affiliated Organizations" will come into effect today.
Zhan Qixian, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, said: "A Kuomintang with a history of more than 100 years has social commitments and responsibilities, and it will not go bankrupt like this."
Lin Quan stressed that if political parties, affiliated organizations or trustees violate the provisions of the regulations prohibiting sanctions, the committee will investigate ex officio and impose sanctions and penalties "in accordance with the law".
Lin Quan also announced that he would not be the vice chairman of the party property committee, and that he would be appointed by Hong Peigen, Taiwan's "deputy director of the Anti-Corruption Administration."
He said that Gu Lixiong was the best candidate to serve as the chairman of the committee on improper party property, and that drawing on Hong Peigen's experience in inspecting relevant major cases in the past would be used as the basis for the committee to investigate relevant cases of improper party property.
Zhan Qixian believes that as long as there is still party property today, no one will give you social donations, and if all party property is confiscated and confiscated, the Kuomintang can just ask for social support and sponsorship, "There is really no chance to ask for it today."
Zhan Qixian also stressed that even if the KMT's party property is not completely confiscated and confiscated after the party property regulations are not put on the road, the rest will still be donated as promised, so that the party property will be returned to zero, and the party will start from scratch.
Original title: "Corridor Doctor" Lan Yuefeng sued CCTV host Wang Zhian for defamation infringement and lost the first instance
Legal Evening News Because CCTV host Wang Zhi'an made remarks on Sina Weibo about the "corridor doctor" incident, Lan Yuefeng sued Wang Zhian and Beijing Weimeng Chuangke Network Technology Co., Ltd. to the court.
Yesterday afternoon, the Haidian Court pronounced a judgment on the case, and the judgment found that Wang Zhian and Weimeng Company did not constitute infringement, and rejected all of Lan Yuefeng's claims.
In early 2014, CCTV reporter Wang Zhi'an found that although Lan Yuefeng, who had been sitting in the hospital corridor for more than 600 days, was portrayed by the media as a tragic hero who was suppressed by the system, there was a lot of false information in these reports.
On March 29, 2014, the "Corridor Doctor" program produced by CCTV News was broadcast.
Lan Yuefeng's various so-called excessive medical information reported to the media is not supported by evidence.
Wang Zhian also described in his real-name verified Weibo that "the reason why Lan Yuefeng has come to this point is because of his personality and his obvious paranoid personality."
Lan Yuefeng asked Wang Zhian to delete Weibo, apologize to him, and compensate him for mental damage of 100,000 yuan.
At the trial at that time, the two sides debated whether Wang Zhian had violated Lan Yuefeng's right to reputation.
Highlights on the 12th: The Chinese team is very busy with the start of track and field, and the women's football team is looking forward to a breakthrough in the fourth bicycle
Cycling is expected to achieve a "zero breakthrough" in Olympic gold medals, while the women's soccer team will take on two-time world champion Germany in hopes of an upset to reach the semi-finals.
Wang Zhen has been in outstanding form in the past two seasons, winning a silver medal at the World Athletics Championships in Beijing last year, and upgrading to the individual championship at the World Team Race Walking Championships in May this year.
According to foreign media reports, 27-year-old South Korean archery female player Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in the women's archery individual competition, and won the Olympic gold medal after the team competition, becoming a double champion.
Zhang Huizhen is considered a late bloomer, who unfortunately did not qualify for the last London Olympics, but now stands proudly on the top podium of the Rio Olympics.
Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in the final of the women's individual archery competition held at the Samba Avenue Stadium in Rio, Brazil, with an aggregate score of 6-2 against Germany's Lisa Ongru.
She didn't shoot her first archery until she was in the fourth grade of primary school, and it wasn't until 2014, at the age of 27, that she won her first individual gold medal at the World Cup.
Zhang Huizhen recalled, "Before I went to middle school, I didn't have a level of proficiency, so I couldn't participate in national competitions.
Four years ago, Zhang Huizhen finished fourth at the London Olympic Trials, missing out on her Olympic ticket and having to sit back and watch her colleague and friend Qi Fu double her two gold medals.
Zhang Huizhen talked about her gold-winning speech after the award ceremony of the women's archery individual competition, "Until the end, I tried to shoot arrows as much as possible, maybe this brought good results and was satisfied."
The 28-year-old South Korean archery "first sister" and London Olympics archery individual gold medalist Ki Fu Bei won the bronze medal.
Chivbei lost to Zhang Huizhen in the semi-finals and faced Mexico's Alejandra Valencia for bronze medal.
Qifubei shed tears on the field after securing the bronze medal, and the burden of gold rushing that he silently endured during this period can be imagined.
The first is that the coaching staff has accumulated rich experience in continuous research, and the second is the scientific training method, which needs to be accumulated for a long time.
The archery team used military training and night walks through cemeteries to help members concentrate and maintain a calm mind.
Although it has not yet been confirmed, many sources say that Apple's 2016 autumn conference will be held in September, and the iPhone 7 is really coming.
Although Apple did not respond, news about the functions and configurations of the new iPhone has been released one after another, and even pictures of the iPhone7 "real machine model" are available on the Internet.
The new generation of iPhone can be described as "all eyes on it", hot, in demand, rich but not in stock...... If you want to buy an authentic product for the first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suning.
This has exacerbated frustration with the new phone, "It's lengthened, but it doesn't project holograms at all!" ”
The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, comes with countless secrets before it was born.
In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhones will do away with the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of Bluetooth connectivity and charging ports, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker.
Another piece of evidence that can support this news is that as early as 2014, Apple allowed earphone manufacturers to produce earphone products that connect through the charging port.
These messages are true or false, and the answer will not be revealed until Apple's 2016 fall conference.
But that doesn't stop industry insiders from being bullish on the prospects of the iPhone 7, which many believe will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone lineup.
Although judging from the data released by the market research institute IDC not long ago, the market share of the iPhone has declined.
Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained a "buy" rating on Apple's stock, while BMO analysts believe that the iPhone 7 will reap a historic sales result.
At the same time, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple's future revenue growth will likely exceed 20%, and this is entirely due to the launch of the iPhone 7.
Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to buy an iPhone 7, compared to just 4 percent two years ago.
It is understood that 20% of the current user group holding iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to buy iPhone 7, which is a fairly high percentage.
Secondly, according to expert analysis, most fruit fans like to replace their iPhones from generation to generation.
According to statistics, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years, that is, almost 120 million users have used their iPhones for 2 years.
Some media said that during the production of the iPhone7, Taiwan was hit by several earthquakes, "the extent of damage to TSMC's production facilities is beyond imagination, and it may have an impact on the initial supply of iPhone7." ”
The contradiction between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, and it is time to choose a good channel and buy a genuine iPhone7 at a low price for the first time.
According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning's senior management and Apple have met frequently, the purpose is to prepare sufficient supplies.
The operator has negotiated with Suning, and it is foreseeable that with the in-depth cooperation between the two sides, it will inevitably bring lower prices and more intimate services to users.
"With the lowest price, consumers may be able to buy an iPhone 7 for only 7 yuan a day. ”
Sufficient supply and a variety of discounts make buying iPhone7 no longer "stressful", and Suning's logistics will turn this beauty into a more intuitive experience.
Perhaps, you will receive a call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Suning.com, your iPhone7 has arrived." ”
The organizers hope that through the exhibition of cultural relics, the local people can learn more about the time-honored Chinese culture, so as to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
The "Ming Dynasty Antiquities Exhibition" in Barcelona is part of a European tour that will run until the beginning of October.
Huaxia Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank released their 2016 semi-annual reports yesterday, and in the second quarter, China Securities Gold once again increased its shareholdings.
Among them, China Securities Gold increased its holdings of Huaxia Bank by 29.2931 million shares, and by the end of June, the number of shares held by China Securities Gold in Huaxia Bank increased to 387 million shares, accounting for 3.35% of its shares.
In addition, according to the calculation of China Merchants Securities, after deducting the increase, China Securities Gold also increased its holdings of 38 million shares of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank in the second quarter, and the number of shares held by it increased to nearly 600 million shares, accounting for 2.77% of the shares of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank.
Recently, the Hebo Garden in Shizibang, Zhengfu Village, Tongxiang City, Zhejiang Province, was officially opened to villagers and tourists.
The garden consists of more than 100 small circular ponds and about 300 varieties of ornamental lotuses, water lilies, etc.
The rural lotus industry has both ornamental, leisure and economic benefits, and has become the highlight of the local new rural development.
According to foreign media reports, the "green pool" incident of the Rio Olympics has attracted much attention from the outside world in recent days due to the change of water in the diving pool from blue to green.
However, on the morning of the 10th, the water in the water polo competition pool adjacent to the diving pool also turned green.
The Australian water polo player said after the game that his eyes felt stinging and he wanted to shed tears.
Earlier, officials of the Rio Olympics confirmed the greening of the pool water and said that the discoloration of the pool water was due to the weakening of alkalinity and would not affect the health of athletes.
But the Australian athlete said his eyes stinged after his victory against the Japanese team in the water polo pool.
As early as the diving pool, after the water in the diving pool turned green, the competition organizers worked overtime to deal with the problem of the diving pool on the evening of the 9th, but found that the color of the water polo pool also changed rapidly on the morning of the 10th.
During the match between Australia and Japan, the environmental conditions of the water polo pools gradually deteriorated, but officials stressed that they would restore the water quality of both pools to their original colors on the 11th.
Mario Andrada, spokesman for the Rio Olympics, said: "Yesterday afternoon, the water in the diving pool first became less alkaline. ”
"We learned about a range of possible causes of discoloration in the pool water and the alkalinity of the water quality. ”
The water quality was tested at the water sports centre, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the pool to make sure the water quality conditions were up to standard. ”
"We've been going through normal procedures these days, but we may have overlooked the impact that more athletes can have on water quality. ”
"But the change in the color of the water certainly has no effect on physical health, especially for athletes. ”
"This independent team confirmed our assessment and the steps we took to restore the pool to its normal colour and normal chemistry. ”
"We were expecting the pool to be back to its normal colour in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected due to the rain. ”
According to Taiwan's "Central News Agency," an explosion occurred in a prison in the suburbs of Metro Manila last night, injuring the warden and killing 10 prisoners, reportedly including two Chinese.
ABS-CBN TV reported that the incident occurred at around 9 p.m. last night in the Paranaque City prison, but the police did not make a preliminary statement until 2 a.m. today.
The police said that the 10 prisoners asked to see the warden and complain about the transfer, but the two sides did not talk speculatively, and some prisoners threw grenades, causing an explosion.
The prison authorities have not released the names of the deceased inmates, but GMA TV reported that two Chinese were among them.
As of 8 a.m., the prison authorities had not provided detailed instructions, including how the prisoners obtained the grenades.
Yesterday, police in the central Philippines entered the Leyte Provincial District Jail and shot and killed one inmate who "attempted to attack a police officer."
Urumqi regulates the operation order of the tourist market, and travel agencies must sign contracts with tourists
At present, Xinjiang has entered the peak tourist season, in order to standardize the operation order of the individual tourist market, the Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment and the Law Enforcement Detachment of the Municipal Transportation Management Bureau yesterday investigated and dealt with the problems of irregular tourist vehicles in the individual tourist market and the low rate of contracts signed between travel agencies and tourists.
At 8 a.m. yesterday, about 10 buses full of tourists were parked around the Kempinski Hotel, most of them individual groups heading to Tianchi for a day trip.
"Hello, I'm from the Urumqi Tourism Bureau, have you signed a contract with this travel agency?"
Yu Bin, a staff member of the law enforcement detachment of the Urumqi Municipal Transportation Management Bureau, introduced: "There are non-local tourist buses and shuttle buses operating tourist passenger transport projects in the Urumqi market, and they are not qualified. ”
"The fine for exceeding the scope of operation is three to 100,000 yuan, and the driver does not have a qualification certificate is a fine of 2,000 yuan. ”
It is understood that the Urumqi Municipal Tourism Law Enforcement Department has previously inspected West Park, Hongshan and other places where individual tourists are concentrated.
Ma Qi, deputy head of the Urumqi Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment, said: "The first is safety, the second is standardization, there is no trivial matter in tourist vehicles, and once there is a problem, it is a group of injuries and deaths." ”
"We and the transportation management jointly continue to inspect the market, standardize the behavior of travel agencies, and ensure the safety of tourists. ”
On the morning of August 12, the Information Office of the State Council held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016.
Sheng Laiyun, spokesman of the National Bureau of Statistics and director of the Department of Comprehensive Statistics of the National Economy, said that in July, the growth rate of some indicators of the national economy slowed down, but it still operated within a reasonable range.
According to the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, the growth rate of fixed asset investment and total imports fell in July.
Sheng Laiyun said: With regard to the operation of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow a phrase once said by the premier: "There are fluctuations, but the trend is still improving," which can better summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July.
He explained that "there are fluctuations" means that the growth rate of some economic indicators did fall in July.
Because the domestic and foreign economies are still in deep adjustment in July, the international situation is complex and changeable, and the recovery of the world economy is less than expected, so the export pressure is still relatively large.
Judging from the domestic situation, the entire economy is still in the critical stage of adjustment, the pain of adjustment is being released, and the economy is facing considerable downward pressure, so some indicators are somewhat fluctuating.
Sheng Laiyun pointed out that there is a special situation in July, the flood disaster is more serious, and the high temperature and hot weather have brought some impact on the production and operation of some areas.
According to the latest information released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people across the country have been affected by the disaster, and the direct economic loss has exceeded 200 billion yuan.
From the perspective of industry, investment, and transportation-related indicators, these areas are affected to varying degrees.
The growth rate of weekly cargo transshipment volume in July fell by 3.6 percentage points from the previous month, and the flood disaster had a certain impact on traffic in these areas.
Judging from these factors, it is normal for some indicators to fluctuate in July, and it is also expected.
He said that "the trend is still improving" refers to the fact that although the economic growth rate has declined, the overall economic operation is stable, and the general trend of steady progress and steady improvement has not changed.
CPI rose 1.8% in July, up 0.2% month-on-month; The CPI rose by 2.1% from January to July, so the price situation is generally stable.
According to the statistics of the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau's portal on the high temperature weather in various districts and counties, except for Youyang, the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowances.
At present, at least 28 provinces in the country have clarified the standards for the payment of allowances, but the standards for the issuance of subsidies are not the same in each province and city, while Chongqing receives the high temperature allowance in the form of a high temperature working day allowance.
Those above 35°C and below 37°C will be issued at the standard of not less than 10 yuan per person per day, and those above 37°C will be issued at the standard of not less than 15 yuan per person per day.
Employees with high temperature above 40 °C can receive a monthly allowance of up to 20 yuan/day (except for those who have already enjoyed the allowance for high-temperature work in accordance with the law).
According to this standard, Kaizhou, which had the most days of hot weather last month, could receive 330 yuan, and Chengkou, which had the fewest days, received 80 yuan, while Youyang's highest temperature did not meet the high temperature standard, so there was no high temperature allowance.
In the past, many units would use soft drinks to offset the high temperature allowance, but the Municipal Work Safety Supervision Bureau said that this practice was not in line with the current measures.
If the employee stops working or shortens the working hours due to hot weather, the employer shall not deduct or reduce the employee's wages.
According to the Municipal Bureau of Human Resources and Social Security, employees who encounter high temperature work but do not receive high temperature allowance can fight for their legitimate rights and interests through the labor dispute mediation agency where the enterprise is located, or call 12333 to complain.
If an employer refuses to pay the high temperature allowance, the worker may file a complaint with the competent department of human resources and social security at or above the county level where the employer is employed.
At the same time, since the high temperature allowance is a part of the salary, not a welfare, it should be included in the total salary and the individual income tax should be deducted.
Therefore, the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage and must be paid in cash and cannot be replaced by in-kind beverages or other goods.
The newly built Urumqi station is located in the high-speed rail area of Urumqi, with a construction area of about 100,000 square meters.
The first and second floors above ground are the entrance and waiting halls, office and commercial buildings, and the first basement floor is the exit floor.
At present, Urumqi Station is the largest comprehensive transportation hub in Xinjiang, integrating high-speed rail, rail transit, public transportation, taxi, etc., which can realize the seamless connection of various transfer modes.
There are 3 ticket halls on the north and south sides of the platform level and the north side of the outbound level, equipped with 39 manual ticket windows and 34 automatic ticket vending machines.
In terms of ticket inspection, there are a total of 30 passages on the east and west sides of the waiting hall, and passengers can quickly check and wait according to the ticket gate number on the ticket.
If you need help, you can press the 41 call buttons set up in the nearest station to choose and get timely service.
Since July 1st, the passenger train of the old passenger station, that is, Urumqi South Railway Station, has been running to Urumqi Station step by step.
That is to say, all bullet trains and 30 pairs of trains out of Xinjiang can stop at Urumqi Station.
Now you can buy tickets to take the train at both stations, and the train travel time between them is about 10 minutes, and passengers need to pay attention to the specific station names of the departure and destination stations on the ticket.
The official operation of the new passenger station in Urumqi will become an important platform for Xinjiang to build a national comprehensive transportation city, and promote the construction of the "Silk Road Economic Belt" and the new area.
Grecia is a cute female toucan that reeks of the rainforest.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Grecia and its story have long been a household name.
At a press conference on August 10, the recovering Grecia finally made an appearance to show off her brand new 3D-printed plastic beak.
The toucan, whose beak was broken off a year and a half ago, is finally reborn.
This day is not only a declaration that it is 100% healthy, but also a day when it moves into a luxury aviary and meets its caring human friends.
Grecia was a little shy when she first entered her new home, but after a while she became lively, rolling and frolicking in the basin and eating grapes with her new beak.
To remind people of the injuries it had suffered, technicians did not color its new beak, but instead kept the original white color of the 3D printed material.
The beak is a thin sheath with a hollow inside, with only a few thin bony support rods staggered.
Despite this internal reinforcement, toucans' beaks are fragile and shatter when damaged.
Animal rescue centers, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company worked together to create several "test beaks" for Grecia, and finally created the "perfect beak" that suited her.
Today, Grecia is adept at using her new beak to drink, eat, and even peck at tiny grains.
"The final design took about two months, and it only took four or five hours to print. ”
"3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has really entered your life. Thomas Lange, chairman of SG3D printing company in the United States, said in an interview with Xinhua International reporters.
In January 2015, Grecia, a bloodied toucan, was found on a farm in Grecia, in the department of Alajuela in central Costa Rica.
At that time, its upper beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, and it was completely unable to eat and was dying.
When the media reported on the tragic situation of Grecia, it caused a wave of voices against animal cruelty in Costa Rica and beyond.
There are calls for stricter animal protection laws and greater penalties for abusers.
People came spontaneously and did their best to help Grecia recover as much as possible from her pre-injury life.
Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing, was involved in the design of Grecia's upper beak.
"Grecia was in a special situation, with less than 1 centimeter of the upper beak remaining, so it made it difficult to install a new beak. ”
"We scanned Grecia, then designed and fabricated an extension prosthesis that was slightly longer than the rest of its upper beak and attached it to its upper beak with adhesive. ”
"This would reduce the amount of further invasive harm to Gracia. Lange & Söhne told Xinhua International reporters.
Before the implant was fitted, the staff had to clean Grecia's severed beak every day to prevent infection.
Thousands of miles away, the story of Grecia the toucan touched famed documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and Discovery News Channel producer John Hoffman.
They documented the installation of Grecia's new beak and recorded a documentary, Toucan Country, which aired on Animal Planet this month.
The documentary "Toucan Country" shows how a small toucan can make a difference in a country and how it can get its citizens involved in the fight against animal cruelty.
Key takeaway: Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of China's small, independent refineries, known as "teapots".
Reference News Network reported on August 12 that Japanese media said that JX Energy, Japan's largest oil company, believes that "the expansion of China's exports is one of the reasons for the downturn."
Japanese oil companies, in particular, are wary of the rise of small, independent refineries in China, known as "teapots."
The quality of China's petroleum products is gradually approaching that of Japanese oil products due to the Chinese government's tightening of environmental regulations.
Before obtaining a crude oil import license, "teapot refineries" generally imported heavy oil with a higher sulfur content from Russia and other places for refining.
The sulfur content of the petroleum products produced is high, and the oil products are not good, which has become one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining a crude oil import permit, the "teapot refinery" was able to import Omani crude oil with a lower sulfur content and Russian crude oil, and the quality of its petroleum products also improved.
"With the continuous improvement of China's domestic petroleum product quality standards, the capacity of oil refining equipment has also improved.
As a result, the quality of China's petroleum products exported to the outside world has gradually reached the same level as Japan's, which is of the highest quality in the world."
"After the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia," JX Energy said, competing with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Although "Japan Premium Oil" is facing a crisis, the strategy adopted by Japanese oil companies is only to "pay attention to market conditions while exporting to profitable regions".
Due to the huge impact of China's petroleum exports on the Asian market, there is a growing interest in teapot refineries.
The 2016 Yangtze Evening News Liqun Sunshine Student Aid Action was launched on May 26, and after two months of registration, the total number of poor students who applied for the bursary reached more than 800.
In the process of student assistance, more than 1.2 million yuan of social donations have been received (which have been publicized in five batches), which can help at least 240 poor students realize their dreams of university.
At present, the donation is still continuing, and this newspaper calls on the society to continue to lend a helping hand, so that more children from difficult families can be funded and cared for by the society.
In order to ensure the fairness, openness and transparency of the student assistance action, this newspaper will publicize the basic information of students in batches from today, and the 1st-100th places will be publicized today, and they will be supervised by readers.
Since 2003, the Yangtze Evening News has been launched in Jiangsu Province, and has funded more than 4,000 poor students.
The scope of funding for this activity is to admit new students in the college entrance examination, excluding tuition-free majors, with excellent character and learning, and poor families.
According to the Bureau of Statistics, New Zealand's population growth had previously only exceeded 2 per cent during the peak of the "baby boom" population in 1974 and the early '50s and '60s.
As of June this year, New Zealand's net inflow of migrants in the 12-month period was 69,100, becoming the main driver of New Zealand's population growth in recent years.
In addition, the natural increase in New Zealand's population during the same time period was 28,200.
The data shows that in the last 10 years, New Zealand has an average annual net inflow of 21,800 immigrants, and the average annual natural increase in population is 32,300.
In terms of demographics, the influx of migrants means that the proportion of the "working-age population" between the ages of 15 and 39 is gradually expanding.
In the 12 months to June 2016, New Zealand's working-age population grew by 3.6 per cent to 1.58 million.
At the same time, the number of people over the age of 65 also increased by 3.6% to 700,000.
At about 10 o'clock yesterday morning, the X9003 international freight train departed from Xi'an Xinzhu Station and headed for Almaty, Kazakhstan.
The opening of this train marks that the number of trains operated by Xi'an Railway Bureau has successfully exceeded 10,000 since the opening of the Central Asia international freight train in 2013.
It is understood that the categories of goods transported by this freight train cover six categories: industrial raw materials, machinery and equipment, industrial spare parts, building materials, food, and light industrial products, with a total of 206 varieties.
As of August 11 this year, the newly built station has opened a total of 221 Central Asian trains and 10,009 cars, with a total of 338,000 tons of export goods, of which 84 were opened in 2016, a year-on-year increase of 47%.
It is understood that the goods carried by the first train of Central Asia are "made in Shaanxi", and now, it has attracted a large number of foreign sources of goods to actively list.
As of the end of July, the container arrival and departure volume of the Central Asia Express exceeded 64,000 TEUs, an increase of 8% over the same period in 2015.
With the encrypted operation of the Central Asia train, the freight volume of the newly built station of Xi'an Railway Bureau has increased year by year.
In 2015, the annual freight throughput of the newly built station was 2.477 million tons, and as of August 10, 2016, the freight dispatch volume has reached 1.531 million tons, an increase of 6.7% over the same period last year.
In order to meet the needs of future development, the Xi'an Railway Bureau has issued a construction plan for the Xi'an Xinzhu Railway Integrated Logistics Center centered on the newly built station, and will make every effort to build a modern Xinzhu Railway Integrated Logistics Park.
An Indian uncle who just experienced a belly landing at Dubai International Airport last week won a $1 million jackpot at the same airport this week.
Muhammad al-Bashir Abdul Hedar, an Indian who has lived in Dubai, United Arab Emirates for a long time, has the habit of buying lottery tickets every time he returns home.
His 21-year-old son, who was paralyzed by an accidental fall when he was 13 days old, has been working hard to pay off his medical bills.
"It was God who gave me a second life and gave me this money to do good," Hedar said.
Although autumn has now begun, the power of the "autumn tiger" seems to be no worse than summer.
Ultraviolet rays not only darken the skin of students, but also sunburn their skin, how to make the skin survive the military training smoothly and not be sunburned?
Sunscreen packaging is generally marked with SPF and PA, SPF refers to the sun protection index, which is against UVB ultraviolet rays, and our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50, etc.
Products marked with PA are for UVA, so that the sunscreen will play a more effective role, usually, the strength of PA is expressed by +, and one more + means that the effective protection time is extended.
For oily skin, you should choose a water-based sunscreen with strong penetration, and sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
For dry skin, choose a cream-like sunscreen; Normal skin generally has no strict rules, and it is a burden for sensitive skin to wear any skin care products, so it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products.
Remember to apply sunscreen half an hour in advance, as it takes time for sunscreen products to fully penetrate into the skin.
Military training has a long time of sun exposure, and sunscreen can be wiped every two hours to have a lasting effect, so don't be lazy.
Because the skin has just been irritated by the sun, do not use whitening products immediately after returning from military training.
After military training and exposure, if possible, you can use a towel wrapped in ice cubes to cool the burned skin to relieve local heat.
Farmers who purchase agricultural machinery during the exhibition will continue to implement the cumulative subsidy policy, and farmers can get up to 40% subsidy for purchasing agricultural machinery.
This exhibition is open to global investment and exhibition, especially to increase the invitation to countries along the "Belt and Road" and target market countries.
This exhibition strives to complete 60 investment signing projects, introduce 22 billion yuan of capital, and sign more than 160 trade contracts with a contract amount of 3.2 billion yuan.
It is reported that the reason why the "Hunan Expo" has settled in Loudi for 7 consecutive years is due to the strong manufacturing industry foundation and long history of industrial development in Loudi City, Hunan Province.
As the host of the "Hunan Expo", Loudi has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
The "Hunan Expo" has become an important platform for cultivating the development of local characteristic industries and promoting characteristic industries to go abroad.
On some nights, the ionosphere is filled with free electrons, which means that radio signals can travel farther.
According to a report on the website of the monthly magazine Popular Science on August 11, the US Air Force is interested in replicating this effect.
While the ionosphere, with its stable abundance of free electrons, could help people listen to a university radio station at the edge of its range, it may not be of interest to the U.S. Air Force.
The electron-laden ionosphere means that the radio used by the military has a greater range and may provide some protection for Global Positioning System (GPS) signals from solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of CubeSats on demand that can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first, the teams contracted by the Air Force must prove that the science works.
Industry data show that in 2015, the total scale of coal production capacity was close to 6 billion tons, and the national coal overcapacity was 1.8 billion tons.
In the past ten years, the State Council has issued a total of five notices to eliminate excess and backward production capacity.
Although the first four were not targeted at the coal industry, the target industry was directly related to the coal industry.
From November last year to January this year, the price of 5,500 kcal thermal coal in Qinhuangdao hovered at a low level of 370 yuan/ton for a long time, and 90% of coal companies fell into losses.
Since February, coal prices have gradually rebounded, and recently the price of thermal coal in Qinhuangdao has risen for four consecutive weeks, rising to a 16-month high, once climbing to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan from the beginning of the year.
As prices rise, worries arise: Will a number of small coal mines resume work and production?
In this regard, Kuang Xianming, director of the Economic Institute of China (Hainan) Reform and Development Research Institute, analyzed and interpreted.
Kuang Xianming: The reduction of production capacity has attracted great attention from all parties, and the report card of the coal industry's capacity reduction announced today does make everyone feel more worried.
These three superficial factors still reflect the reason why the transformation of our growth mode has lagged behind in the past, that is, the government-led growth mode has not yet been fundamentally changed.
Second, this is also directly related to the promotion of local governments, in the process of capacity reduction, funds and corresponding supporting measures must be in place, from this point of view, the difference between different regions is indeed relatively large.
Third, if some provinces that are currently making slower progress want to catch up in the second half of the year, they may face greater risks.
In this case, relying on central incentives and subsidies to promote the process of capacity reduction may have a certain negative impact.
First of all, de-capacity is not simply a matter of total control.
Our aim is to eliminate outdated production capacity, promote structural optimization, and reconstruct the new business format of the entire coal industry.
In the process of deploying capacity reduction, local governments must combine capacity reduction with the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry, and vigorously develop related service industries.
Second, if we want to complete this year's task of reducing production capacity within this year, we still have to give full play to the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision.
Finally, we need to strengthen the role of social security as a backstop.
Because the market is directly related to the issue of employment, we must strengthen the employment skills training for employees and workers.
"The reason for the decline in the ranking is the deterioration of foreign investors' expectations for Brazil's GDP development in the medium term. ”
Brazil's participation in global direct investment was 3.7 percent in 2015, down from 5.7 percent in 2014.
The Credit Suisse International Investment Attractiveness Index consists of four sub-indices: Infrastructure, Economic Outlook, Business Climate and Direct Investment Volume.
In 2015, Brazil's international direct investment was US$64.6 billion, down from US$73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year, "greenfield investment" in Brazil was US$17.9 billion, down 2.1 percent year-on-year.
"There are 288 'greenfield investments' in Brazil, compared to an annual average of 314 between 2003 and 2014".
However, in the first half of 2016, international direct investment in Brazil reached US$33.8 billion, an increase of almost 10% compared to the same period last year.
Original title: Canadian police kill IS supporter: Homemade bomb attacks are nearing completion
The taxi company said the taxi was dispatched to Driver's home before police arrived.
Canadian police said at a news conference on Wednesday that the information received by police included a "martyrdom video" provided by the FBI that the youth was about to carry out the attack.
According to Deutsche Welle, a man wearing a black balaclava is seen reading the Quran, referring to crimes against Muslims and vowing to launch an attack on a Canadian city soon, Deutsche Welle reported.
In the video, he said that the attack would take place within 72 hours and that it was during peak hours.
The incident was the first time police had killed a terror suspect before the incident since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office last year.
After the upgrade, the old Wanfu River and the Beida slip channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal branch channel will be charged tolls from September 1.
The two tributary waterways have been renovated and constructed in the form of social financing, and the fees have been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.
The Laowanfu River channel flows through Jinxiang and Yutai, and enters the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal through Nanyang Lake, with a total length of 32.5 kilometers.
According to the needs of navigation, the Laowanfu River channel has adopted the method of maintenance and transformation, dredging the local water depth, cutting and straightening the local sharp bends, etc., and the navigation conditions have been improved.
The waterway flows through Jinxiang County and Rencheng District, and enters the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal through Nanyang Lake, with a total length of 19 kilometers.
The reconstruction project of the two waterways started construction in February 2011 and completed the delivery and acceptance in January 2015.
In accordance with the principle of "loan construction, fee repayment", Jining Anping Canal Logistics Service Center collects waterway tolls according to the charging standards approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau.
Among them, the basic toll is charged at 1.75 yuan/deadweight ton, and the mileage toll is charged at 0.05 yuan/kilometer deadweight ton.
Tolls are collected from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019.
The reporter learned from the Jining Port and Shipping Bureau that there are currently four toll waterways in Jining, namely the Zhushui River Channel, the Baima River Channel, the Beida Slip Channel, and the Laowanfu River Channel.
The four waterways are tributaries of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, all of which have been upgraded through social financing.
The Zhushui River Waterway Upgrading Project is the first project to adopt the "government + market" model for the construction of inland port and shipping infrastructure in Shandong Province, with the government accounting for the main investment and social funds to supplement the funding gap.
The Baima River, the Laowanfu River, the Beidatao River and other feeder waterways adopt a purely market-oriented operation mode.
The funds allocated by the state treasury cannot meet the needs of the construction of the project, which restricts the progress of the upgrading of the waterway.
The use of social funds for the construction of public infrastructure meets the requirements of national policies and has also become a way to break the bottleneck of funds.
Ning Zetao's performance in the semifinals of the 100-meter freestyle has left many Chinese viewers speechless.
But in the 50-meter freestyle preliminaries, Ning Zetao once again refreshed people's "bottom line".
In fact, the 50-meter freestyle is not Ning Zetao's main event, and his performance and best result at the World Championships in Kazan also determine that he is unlikely to make a breakthrough in this event.
Sure enough, Hong Kong's authoritative media "Ta Kung Pao" revealed that the biggest reason for Ning Zetao's defeat was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many factors off the court may have had a big impact on his thoughts on the future, and he may be more interested in entering the entertainment industry now.
After the World Championships in Kazan, Ning Zetao instantly became an Internet celebrity with his super good looks and good results.
As a result, titles such as "national husband", "little fresh meat", and "beautiful man" have also become labels on his body.
All kinds of business activities come to the door, and the beautiful money road has become a golden avenue.
In this case, even if Ning Zetao chooses to retire and join the entertainment industry at this time, it is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly feasible path.
After all, he is only 23 years old, and after a certain amount of study, he can star in one or two TV series with his popularity.
But Ning Zetao needs to see if he has enough qualifications compared to these predecessors?
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, 21-year-old Liu Xuan had come to the end of his career as an athlete.
Liu Xuan's beautiful appearance made her quickly remembered, and also laid the foundation for her future entry into the entertainment industry.
After retiring, Liu Xuan starred in many TV series and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang participated in the singles and doubles 10-meter platform competition at the Olympic Games twice and won 2 golds and 2 silvers.
However, after losing to teammate Hu Jia in the 2004 Olympic Games single 10-meter platform competition, Tian Liang's competitive form declined, and it was revealed that he was expelled from the diving team.
And he and his daughter participated in variety shows such as "Where Are You Going, Dad", which made him earn enough eyeballs.
Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing, the former golden generation of gymnastics, all participated in various variety shows in a high-profile manner.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng led China to win the 2008 Olympic men's team championship at that time, and Yang Wei won the individual all-around gold medal twice and was known as the all-around king.
While Chen Yibing led China to win the 2012 Olympic team championship, he also became the king of rings.
After suffering a misjudgment and losing the gold medal at the London Olympics, Chen Yibing's generous behavior also made him countless fans.
But the main energy of these athletes is still in the arena, and they are just like dragonflies in water for variety shows - touch and go.
But whether it is a retired or active athlete, to be able to be favored by the entertainment industry needs to have good results as a guarantee.
After all, when an athlete steps into a new field, whether it is ability or network, it is a blank state.
Even "old people" like Tian Liang and Liu Xuan who have been in the entertainment industry for many years, ordinary audiences still think more of their performance in the Olympics when they mention them.
And newcomers such as Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng introduced themselves when they appeared on variety shows, without exception, they were all "Olympic champions".
Compared with the above people, Ning Zetao's title as a world swimming champion is still a little thin.
What's more, compared with the successful retirement of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan, Yang Wei and others, if Ning Zetao retreats bravely at the age of 23 and encounters a slight setback in his sports career, the negative impact on his image is probably immeasurable.
After all, when it comes to athletes, people's requirements are "not to win a hundred battles, but to be fearless of hardships and dangers", and Ning Zetao is still a lot away from this.
Take 10,000 steps back and say, Ning Zetao is handsome, and he can rely on his appearance to get the support of thousands of brainless fans.
has no skills, only relies on appearance, and wants to mix well in the entertainment industry, which is not more difficult than training well to find a response to the state.
The choice of the road of life is all based on personal wishes, but how to choose, Ning Zetao should know in his heart.
On the surface, online social platforms expand social circles and reduce people's loneliness.
The sphere of influence of online social networking is becoming more and more extensive, not only gradually replacing traditional telephone contact, but even infiltrating into the real life circle offline, quietly changing the social life of the current people.
The benefits of online socialising are obvious, such as convenience and speed, so it is especially popular with younger people.
According to a survey on the social habits of college students, 57% of college students use their mobile phones for more than 5 hours a day, and their daily lives are basically "always in hand".
"Social networks have the characteristics of low cost, fast transmission speed, and simultaneous communication between multiple people, which meets the needs of contemporary college students. ”
Expanding our social circle, having more equal conversations, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love online chatting more and more.
Newcomers who have just joined the company love to communicate with their colleagues online, "because they are not familiar with each other when they have just joined the unit, and through the likes and comments on social platforms, the relationship is much closer than before."
People who love to make friends also often communicate online, "I haven't been in touch with my friends for a while because of some misunderstandings, and then I have a few conversations in a large group before I get warm up again." ”
IT engineer Wu Yan is a deep network social enthusiast, most of his social life takes place online, and the number of online contacts is several times that of offline circle of friends.
Wu Yan himself admitted that he is more "like a fish in water" on the Internet.
"You can reply to your friends when it's convenient for you, because there is a lot of time to think about the words and the words can be expressed more clearly. ”
"The comings and goings hidden under the ID avoid face-to-face interpersonal collisions, not only have room for maneuver, but even give each other more time and space to think about words and deeds. ”
"People of different identities have the same right and efficiency to speak, and all kinds of social concerns in real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace. ”
However, Wu Yan's friend Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan in life was a "rather boring otaku".
Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a large group, because both of them were active speakers, and they quickly became acquainted.

At 8 o'clock in the morning of August 11, a reporter from Qilu Evening News followed the "Healthy China Tour" free clinic service team to Hegou Village, Xihu Town, Donggang District.
The village is located in a remote area, about 24 kilometers away from the city, with more than 200 residents in the village.
The program of this free clinic is relatively comprehensive, including internal medicine, surgery, respiratory, psychiatry, dermatology, and pediatrics.
Many villagers heard that the experts from the free clinic were coming, and they were already waiting in the small square of the village.
67-year-old Mrs. Xue suffers from congenital scoliosis, and in recent years, she has been deeply troubled by "asthma", so that she will be out of breath and out of breath even when walking uphill.
The doctor told Mrs. Xue that it was unlikely that chronic bronchitis would be cured at all, and that it could be relieved by insisting on medication.
At the dermatologist's consultation, an elderly man in her 60s came with her little grandson for a consultation.
The old man's youngest grandson is 11 years old this year, and since the child was 3 years old, his left foot has been suffering from "athlete's foot".
After checking it, the doctor told the old man that this was not "beriberi" but seasonal eczema, and he should not delay the treatment with random medication.
"In this village, we provided medical and ultrasound services, while another team of free medical services in Qiujiadianzi Village, Hubu Township, Wulian County, also provided free medical check-up services.
This free clinic in the countryside is just one part of the 'Healthy China Tour', and other activities will be carried out in the coming days. ”

Francisco Reyes, a professor at the Department of Natural Resources and Environment at the National Agricultural University of Nicaragua, led the entire reforestation education project.
We have reason to believe that the Transoceanic Grand Canal project, also led by HKND Group, will bring more benefits to the people of Nicaragua and create more jobs for the local people. ”

Tajikistan's "Avesta" news agency quoted Tajikistan's central bank on the 11th as saying that the inflation rate in Tajikistan was 3.7% in the first seven months of this year.
The report pointed out that the inflation rate in Tajikistan was 3.7% in the first seven months of this year, of which the inflation rate in July was 0.6%, and the inflation rate in the past year was 6%.
According to the report, the Tajikistan government aims to control the annual inflation rate at 7.5% in 2016, compared with 5.1% in 2015.
In addition, the report also pointed out that there are certain discrepancies between the forecasts of the Tajikistan government and some major international financial institutions on the issue of economic development and inflation in Tajikistan in 2016.
According to the forecast of the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development, Tajikistan's economic growth will reach 7% in 2016, and the country's inflation is basically above this level.
The Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have given different forecasts for Tajikistan's economic development and inflation in 2016.
For these two indicators, the Asian Development Bank forecasts are 4.2 per cent and 7 per cent, the World Bank forecasts are 4.8 per cent and 7.5 per cent, and the International Monetary Fund forecasts are 3.4 per cent and 8.2 per cent.
It is reported that despite a series of unfavorable external factors such as the international economic recession, the depreciation of the Russian ruble and the decrease in remittances, Tajikistan's economy still achieved 6% growth in 2015.
On August 11, when the reporter interviewed Huang Yilin, who had returned to her home in Mianyang, Sichuan, by telephone, she said: "The situation was too urgent at that time, and I had only one thought in my heart was to save people!"
Huang Yilin is a 2015 student at the School of Landscape Architecture of Central South University of Forestry and Technology.
Huang Yilin, who majored in urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Langzhong in Sichuan Province to study local architectural design, so the family went on a trip.
At around 10 a.m. on August 8, Huang Yilin's father was resting in the hotel, and the mother and daughter came out to visit the ancient city of Langzhong.
He had just walked a short distance when he suddenly saw a group of people shouting, and he stepped forward out of curiosity.
Seeing that "the little boy has disappeared, the little girl is desperately splashing in the water, and only her little head is exposed on the surface of the river, sinking from time to time", Huang Yilin, who learned to swim as a child, hurriedly jumped down to save people.
After entering the water, Huang Yilin, who is 165 cm tall, found that she couldn't step on it!
The water used to look calm, but there is a torrent below!
But she still swam to the little girl desperately.
Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and turbulent, and the distance of less than 5 meters took almost all her strength.
She tried her best to push the little girl to the riverbank, "The slope is very slippery, and I am afraid that I will sink without strength." ”
So, Huang Yilin asked her mother for help, and when she heard her daughter's call for help, Ms. Yin, who was not good at water, was about to go into the water to rescue, but was stopped by a tourist next to her.
On August 10, after the news of Huang Yilin jumping into the river to save people spread, Ms. Yin received condolences and praise from many relatives and friends, and was also "held accountable" by many relatives and friends.
To be honest, when the child was on the embankment and asked me for help, my heart was broken. ”
Ms. Yin said with trepidation that although it was dangerous, if she were in such a scene again, she would still support her daughter's choice, and she was proud of her!
Because she was forced, Huang Yilin rarely took the initiative to enter the water again after learning to swim, "I didn't expect this skill to really come in handy."
According to Chen Yixuan, the class leader of Huang Yilin's class, Huang Yilin is recognized as a "top student" in the class and is helpful.

From 1 September, seniors between the ages of 60 and 64 can travel at half price on city buses.
On the morning of the 11th, in the IC card sales center of Jining City Bus Company, several elderly people were queuing up to apply for cards in front of the card window, and 62-year-old Uncle Yao got a half-price card for the elderly.
Previously, the Jining Municipal Committee on Aging, the Municipal Finance Bureau, and the Municipal Transportation Bureau issued the "Notice on Half-price Urban Buses for the Elderly 60-64 Years Old", which was officially implemented on September 1 this year.
"Eligible seniors can go to the IC sales center with a second-generation ID card, and the elderly who meet this age with foreign household registration can also enjoy this discount. ”
Liu Xia, deputy director of the computer center of the Jining City Public Transport Company, said that since the processing began on August 1, more than 200 half-price cards for the elderly have been handled.

If the number of fraudulent text messages sent in a group reaches a certain amount, even if the fraud is not successful, the crime of fraud can be punished.
The Wolong District People's Court of Nanyang City, Henan Province investigated and found that from September 30 to October 4, 2015, the defendant Li Huiwang successively used fake base station equipment to send fraudulent information in Tongbai County and Nanyang Urban District.
In the same year, at about 10 o'clock on October 5, when the defendant came to a hotel room in Wolong District, Nanyang City, again to use a fake base station to send fraudulent text messages, he was arrested by the public security police.
After evaluation, the pseudo base station equipment sent 62,228 text messages on October 4, 2015, causing an average communication interruption of more than 8 seconds to less than 10 minutes for 62,228 mobile phone users.
After trial, the court held that the defendant Li Huiwang used fake base stations to send a total of 62,228 fraudulent text messages to an unspecified number of people, and his behavior constituted the crime of fraud.
With regard to the defender's suggestion that the defendant was an attempted offender when he was arrested and did not cause consequences, and that he had a good attitude of admitting guilt, it is recommended that his opinion on a lighter punishment be adopted.
Based on the nature of the defendant's crime, his attitude in admitting guilt, and other circumstances, he was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months imprisonment and fined 10,000 yuan for the crime of fraud.
The Siberian tiger is currently listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
According to the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department, in 1998 data from joint monitoring by China, the United States, Russia and other countries showed that there were only 4 to 6 Siberian tigers and 3 to 5 Siberian leopards in the wild.
According to Yu Changchun, director of the conservation department of the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department, in recent years, Jilin Province has continuously increased the protection of wild animals, and the population of Siberian tigers and Amur leopards in China is growing significantly, and the distribution area is expanding.
According to the latest monitoring data in 2015, 27 Siberian tigers and 42 Siberian leopards were detected in the wild in Jilin Province alone.
As the world's flagship species for wildlife conservation in the border region between China and Russia, the cooperation between China and Russia is of great significance for the recovery and reproduction of wild Siberian tigers and leopards.
According to the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department, Jilin Province has previously established a long-term and stable cooperation and exchange mechanism with Russia.
At the 2016 Hunchun International Forum on Tiger and Leopard Conservation in China, which ended on the 11th, the forestry departments and animal protection organizations of China and Russia once again reached a number of consensuses.
According to the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department, strengthening cooperation between China and Russia in tiger and leopard conservation is not only a very urgent task facing China's Siberian tiger and leopard conservation, but also an urgent task to maintain the health of Russian tiger and leopard populations.
Sun Fujian, as a leading cadre of party members, lost his ideals and beliefs, seriously violated party discipline, and after the 18th National Congress of the party, he still did not rein in, did not stop, and violated discipline against the wind, which was vile in nature and serious.
After the occurrence of this case, it became a focus case after being reported by many media, and the social impact was extremely bad.
After the case occurred, the leaders of the criminal police detachment of the Haikou City Public Security Bureau attached great importance to it and immediately organized a large group of capable police forces of the detachment to take the initiative to carry out an investigation.
The police immediately pursued the suspect online, took a variety of measures to control him, and contacted the police in other places to assist in investigating Wang's whereabouts.
Because the suspect is a habitual thief who has been repeatedly cracked down on by the public security organs, has a strong anti-reconnaissance capability, and because he has been a drug addict for a long time, he often has a drug addiction during interrogation, so the interrogation work is very difficult.
The Greenland shark, also known as the small-headed sleeping shark, is widely distributed in the North Atlantic waters around Greenland and Iceland, reaching a length of 4 to 5 meters when it reaches adulthood.
However, their growth rate is extremely slow, sometimes only about 1 centimeter per year, suggesting that Greenland sharks may have an exceptionally long lifespan.
Traditional dating methods usually use calcified tissue from animals, and in some sharks fins, but this calcified tissue is scarce in Greenland sharks.
New research, led by Julius Nelson of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, switched to radiocarbon dating using the eye lens of Greenland sharks.
This method has been used to determine the age of whales before, but this is the first time it has been used to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis showed that the largest shark had an estimated lifespan of 392 years, with an error of 120 years.
This means that the shark is at least 272 years old, and the maximum is likely to be 512 years old.
In addition, female Greenland sharks are said to be not sexually mature until they are about 4 metres long, which translates to at least 156 years of age.
The Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate known on Earth, surpassing the previous longevity champion right whale (211 years old), the researchers wrote in the paper.
Over the past year, the exchange rate reform has achieved remarkable results, and the RMB exchange rate has remained basically stable, which has also laid the foundation for promoting the internationalization of the RMB.
From the perspective of market performance, in the past year, the two-way floating characteristics of the RMB exchange rate have been obvious, the exchange rate flexibility has been enhanced, and the exchange rate is expected to be generally stable.
Since the exchange rate reform, the central parity of the RMB against the US dollar has fluctuated up and down by more than 100 points, but the process has risen and fallen alternately.
The last exchange rate reform measure before last year's "8.11" exchange rate reform was implemented in 2005, and the renminbi appreciated significantly against the US dollar in the past decade.
Since the implementation of the new exchange rate reform, the RMB has changed its previous appreciation state, and the central parity of the RMB exchange rate has depreciated by about 8% in one year.
On October 1 this year, the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the renminbi as an SDR (Special Drawing Rights) weighted currency.
This week, statistics released by China's General Administration of Customs showed that in the first seven months of this year, the total value of China's imports and exports was 13.21 trillion yuan, down 3% from the same period last year.
In July, China's total imports and exports fell by only 0.9% year-on-year, especially exports increased by 2.9% year-on-year.
Relevant experts believe that although there are signs of stabilization in imports and exports in July, expectations should not be too high.
In July, the total value of China's imports and exports was 2.09 trillion yuan, down 0.9% year-on-year.
Among them, exports were 1.22 trillion yuan, up by 2.9 percent, imports were 873 billion yuan, down by 5.7 percent, and trade surplus was 342.8 billion yuan, up by 34 percent.
Although the total value of imports and exports is still down year-on-year, the export data has increased, which is also the fifth consecutive month of export growth since March this year.
Shanghai police arrested more than 3,400 thieves in four months, and cracked down on 157 "robbery and fraud" gangs
While cracking the case, the police also recovered a total of more than 3,300 yuan in stolen money and goods.
According to the confessions of the members of the theft gang, they entered Shanghai from other places by chartering a black car, then got out of the car to commit the crime, and after a few hours, they each joined the car and left Shanghai together.
In the process of committing the crime, the suspect often uses a building as a unit, climbs the exterior wall, and pries off the anti-theft window fence to "sweep the building" from top to bottom.
A few days ago, the suspect involved in the case has been transferred by the Xuhui Public Security Bureau to the Xuhui District Procuratorate for review and prosecution.
The police reminded the general public that they must lock the doors and windows of their homes when they go out, and for the selection of anti-theft windows, it is recommended that the public should choose hard steel.
According to the Voice of China's "News Evening Peak", in late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will go to Kenya to attend the sixth African Development Conference.
The Conference on African Development (ADA) will be the first time that the previous five meetings have been held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, and will be held in Africa for the first time.
In this regard, an official of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that holding a meeting on the ground in Africa will help arouse the attention of African and European countries to Japan.
In order to cooperate with Shinzo Abe's visit, according to Kyodo News, Japan's Liberal Democratic Party will send parliamentary delegations to relevant countries.
It is no coincidence that Japan's path to "normalcy" began in the early 90s of the last century, and the Conference on African Development initiated by Japan also began in 1993!
With 53 seats in the United Nations, Africa is an important vote base in the United Nations.
They will also exchange views with relevant people from various countries on the extremist organization "Islamic State" and countermeasures against terrorist activities.
The "Western Group" will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida also recently made clear his intentions at the UN Security Council on the African Development Conference.
Abe has announced here that for the stability of sub-Saharan African countries, he will provide 100 billion yen (about 6.1 billion yuan) in aid over five years.
Observers generally believe that Japan's generosity to Africa has always been aimed at two main purposes: one is to increase Japan's presence in Africa, and the other is to win the support of African countries on the issue of permanent membership.
Yang Bojiang, an expert on Japan, analyzed, "From the political aspect, although Africa is relatively lagging behind in development, it has a relatively large number of countries, so Japan has always regarded it as the so-called 'big ticket field'." ”
Japan will not give up in the future, and its work in Africa will not stop there, but will continue to intensify.
In terms of the economy, Japan's production capacity is relatively strong, but the domestic market is relatively limited, especially in the context of a declining birthrate and aging population, domestic demand is relatively sluggish.
However, from Junichiro Koizumi 10 years ago to Abe 10 years later, during this period, Japan has launched many "sprints" to normalcy, but they have all returned.
Yang Bojiang, an expert on Japanese issues, believes that Japan's intention to become a normal state is clear at a glance, but the road to becoming a normal state is bound to be full of difficulties.
In order to achieve its goals, Japan must first have good relations with its neighboring countries, and Japan needs to adopt a correct attitude toward geopolitical contention, ethnic disputes, and historical issues.

A couple from France stayed at the event for nearly 3 hours and had a taste of the mini flower mobile classroom.
"I found out about this special festival on the Internet, so I decided to check it out and it felt very fresh. ”
They said that although there are similar festivals in France to commemorate their ancestors, the atmosphere is very heavy, unlike here, where there is music, food and traditional crafts to learn.
She said, "In a financial metropolis like Hong Kong, you can still see such a large-scale and organized ancestor worship ceremony. ”
"This not only reflects the diversity of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to understand these traditional crafts and pass them on. ”
Hu Yansong, the general coordinator of the event, said, "We don't want to make the Yulan Cultural Festival so scary that people dare not approach, especially children. ”
"We hope that through the activities and decorations of the young people on site, young people will know that the culture behind the festival is filial piety and gratitude. “
He also said that this time, a total of 24 teams participated in the "orphan competition", which not only included community organizations, but also cooperated with some schools to let students participate.
It is understood that the Hong Kong Teochew Yu Lan Festival has been included in the "National Intangible Cultural Heritage List" in 2011.

Marisa Jimenez Cacho, who watched a Peking Opera performance 15 years ago, accompanied her daughter to watch the performance.
"It was a fantastic performance, the music, the lighting, the stage performances,...... I think it's important for my daughter to learn about Chinese culture and the art of Peking Opera. ”
The enthusiasm of the Mexican audience left a deep impression on the white lady actor and young actor Fu Jia.
"I didn't expect the Mexican audience to be so enthusiastic, and I was a little worried about whether they would understand the story, but today I was surprised to see that they were able to capture the storyline and the many laughs. ”
Chinese Ambassador to Mexico Qiu Xiaoqi said that the various cultural exchange activities of this year's "China-Latin America Cultural Exchange Year" have played a positive role in promoting deeper understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Mexican peoples.
Next year will mark the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mexico, and more cultural exchange activities will be held between China and Mexico.

There is also a group of star coaches in the Chinese sports world: they have enjoyed great glory for the country when they were athletes, and after retiring, they have passed on what they have learned over the years to those who come after them to train them to win championships.
As the first world champion in Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yubin chose to pick up the whip after retiring.
From the coach of the women's team to the coach of the men's team, and then to the head coach, Huang Yubin created an "Olympic gold team", and led the team to achieve a mythical record of 9 golds, 1 silver and 4 bronzes in the Beijing Olympics.
Since then, Tian Liang has been advertising endorsements, and has played important roles such as "Cowherd" and "Lei Feng" in recent years.
A lot of NBA players have proven their quality. But some people progress, some people decline.
Whether it's due to age or limited playing time, there are some players who regress every season.
Of course, some of the "regressions" may just be a shrinkage of the data, and the strength of these players may not have decreased.
Even though Wade is still one of the best shooting guards in the league, he shouldn't be as good as the Heat for the Bulls.
He and Rondo have limited range in the backcourt, and Butler is shooting just 32.8 percent from three-point range, which makes them a crowded offense next season.
Coming to the Windy City, the Flash is bound to give more of the ball to Butler and Rondo, and he is likely to choose a healthy style of play in the regular season.
Okafor's situation is more awkward, as he was the first choice for the 76ers last season, and he has to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball possession in the new season.
The competition may not come anytime soon, Simmons will need to adapt to the NBA arena, and Embiid will need to fully recover from injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafor can make a place in the 76ers' long-term roster is still questionable.
Last season, 32 percent of Okafor's scoring came from the low post, which is higher than Cousins, Vucevic and Brook Lopez, and he is also in the top 40 in the league.
With Simmons already showing excellent potential as a point forward, and Embiid having a more suitable frame for the NBA, Okafor's position may not be so secure.
Over the past two seasons, Thompson has been in the top 20 in the league, and these are the best two seasons of his career.
But the problem is that with the arrival of Durant, Thompson's usage rate will definitely decline, which is bound to affect his performance.
This impact will not only affect the number of shots, but also the fact that Tom's ball-handling offense will certainly be greatly reduced next season, which will also make it easier for opponents to defend against him in some ways.
The arrival of Durant will definitely shrink the statistics of the Warriors' players, but the most serious of them is probably Thompson.
But this does not mean that Tang Shen's level has regressed, it is more like he has made sacrifices for the team as a whole.
Parker performed better than the stats suggest last season, not only because of his career-high efficiency under the basket, but also because his chemistry with Aldridge has benefited the Spurs.
Duncan retired, Ginobili announced another year of fighting, and the combination of GDP eventually came to an end, and as the youngest of the three, there was not much gas left in the tank of the French sports car.
After getting their third championship ring, only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular-season MVPs than James, and Jordan was the only one with more FMVPs than James.
Oh, and by the way, James just brought Cleveland its first professional sports championship trophy in the last 52 years.
Coming into his 14th season, James needs to be better equipped to prepare for the playoffs.
As a result, James' stats are likely to slip further during the regular season, and he will share more of the burden on Irving, but he will still easily be in the top three players in the league.
"We must carry forward the talents we have learned in Russia in Russia."
On the 12th local time, Huang Jing, chairman of the Moscow Federation of Overseas Chinese, said excitedly when she saw a reporter from Chinanews.com.
Not long ago, she participated in the "Chinese Talent (Calligraphy and Painting) Training Course of Overseas Chinese Cultural Societies" sponsored by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council of China and undertaken by Jinan University.
When I first participated in the training course, I didn't know where to start with calligraphy and painting, but by the end of the training course, I was able to draw and write my own works.
After returning to Moscow, I must use the knowledge and skills I have learned to make my own contribution to the dissemination and promotion of Chinese culture.
At the same time, Na Yanwei, secretary general of the Russian Association for the Promotion of Chinese Culture, who also participated in the training course, also felt the same way.
She said that she has made great progress with the help of the teachers in the training class, and at the same time, she also feels the heavy responsibility of being an "overseas disseminator of Chinese culture".
Na Yanwei said that after returning to Russia, he will definitely spread and carry forward the traditional Chinese culture among the Chinese and Russians who love Chinese culture.
At 19:35 today, in the first game of the 22nd round of the Chinese Super League, Chongqing Lifan challenged Beijing Guoan away.

This is also Kaldek's goal in the first game of the Chinese Super League, and Lifan leads 2:0.
At the beginning of the second half, Fernando won a free kick on the right side with a forced break, but unfortunately the goal was high from a tight angle.
After Deng Xiaofei was judged to delay time and received a yellow card, substitute Peng Xinli also received a yellow card for a foul in front of the penalty area.
In the 56th minute, Zhang Chiming cut inside on the left side and cooperated with Zhang Xizhe's pass, and his arc ball was blocked by Deng Xiaofei.
Liu Yu viciously tackled and violated Klimetz in front of the penalty area, and he and the emotional Wang Dong received yellow cards one after another.
In the 63rd minute, Fernando was directly knocked over by Klimetz when he was running on the right, and Fernando was very dissatisfied with Klimetz's action, and Klimets received a yellow card.
One minute later, Fernando once again showed his running ability on the right side, and Yu Dabao also received a yellow card for a foul.
Yilmaz forced a breakthrough in the penalty area, fell to the ground under Zheng Yourong's outstretched leg interception, the referee awarded a penalty, Yilmaz scored a goal, and Lifan 2:1 Guoan.

After four minutes of stoppage time, Lifan kept the score 2-1 until the end and won away against Guoan.
After scoring this precious three points, Lifan now has 27 points and is temporarily in 10th place in the standings.

Great Britain won the silver medal in rugby sevens and Fiji won the gold medal
In the rugby sevens final on Thursday night, England were unable to continue their excellent run against Fiji, who were beaten 43-7 at the Rio Tiodoro Stadium by Fiji.
Fiji won the gold medal for their impeccable performance in ball control, tackles, avoidance, coordination, movement and power, the country's first-ever Olympic medal.
The silver medal was also a consolation for the defeated British team, and it was the third silver medal of the day for the British delegation. This is a proud result for the British rugby team: they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa in rugby sevens, which reached the Olympics for the first time.
Earlier in the day, Great Britain narrowly beat South Africa 7-5, which may have affected their form in the final.
But in any case, the current Fiji team is enough to beat a spirited 15-man team.
Tomorrow, at least one Briton will wear a gold medal, which may be a consolation to the British team, but it may not be. That Englishman is Ben Ryan, the Fiji head coach from Wimbledon, who was the head coach of the English team.
It was not easy for the British team to achieve where they are today.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's coaching, they failed to win the Adelaide International Rugby Sevens.
And now, they are just one step away from the championship.
Although they have been dealt a huge blow, they have also made very impressive progress.
Fiji dominated the opening period, leaving the British team defenseless.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like crashing into a string of moving buses. By the time Osi Coriniso stormed into the corner flag, the World Series champions were already 5-0 ahead.
Just four minutes into the game, Jerry Tuwai scored again on the right flank.
12-0, England barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's powerful interception kept the giant-like Leon Nacarava out of the scoring for the third time, but it only slowed Fiji's scoring process.
At the 7-minute mark, Yasa Weremaru touched the ground in the right corner. 17-0, the British team even worse.
That Carava scored another point, and the game was ...... There is 1 minute left in the first half.
Then, Vatmo Lavovo broke through the British defence and went straight to the scoring line.
At halftime, the score was already 29-0.
Fijians seem to have been born to play rugby sevens, while the English are still in their infancy.
That's the case.
England made a huge change in the second half and stormed the Fijian defence for a full four minutes, which was already good for the first half. But then Fiji played a brilliant game and it was Joshua Tuesova who scored again.
Dan Norton created scoring opportunities for Great Britain when he touched the ground in the left corner to make it 36-7, but the game was already in the hands of the South Sea island nations, with their fans singing, waving flags and dancing on the platform.
The Fiji team's spectacular performance had to be applauded.
Mata Willian stopped a nonchalant attack from Fiji in the final moments.
At the final whistle, the Fijians hugged each other, while the defeated British team had to leave the field regretfully.
Earlier in the day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, while the British side narrowly beat South Africa in a tight semi-final matchup.
Kyle Brown gave South Africa the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton scored with excellent footwork in the second half.
After that, England's Antony's brother Marcus Watson secured the victory with a brilliant interception, and in the end, England won the silver medal.
Helen Graff and Heather Steining were inspired by their coach who was suffering from cancer to win the gold medal in rowing
It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most touching gold medal.
Helen Graff and Heather Stanning have trained for 220 punishing lifts since their first stroke, and their gold medal at Estacio da Lagoa is even more significant.
Although the two of them were the only ones paddling, the voice of coach Robin Williams was with them on their quest for their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the women's double oars, the first British pair to reach this height.
They are now on a 39-match unbeaten streak and have an absolute advantage.
What we've seen is these two talented athletes navigating gracefully across the water, but that's not all there is to this victory.
Behind every gold medal in rowing are many people who have volunteered to make a difference, and none of them has helped more than a coach who learned 30 months ago that he had cancer and didn't know if he would live to see this day.
As he said, death can come at any time.
I had bladder cancer and they operated on me.
If surgery is not done, the cancer cells will spread throughout the body.
This way, the situation will be much worse.
This will change your perception slightly.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Luckily, he started treatment in early 2014 to minimize the impact, although it may not be appropriate to say so in this case.
I need to get paid, so I have to get better quickly.
It's an incentive for me.
I lived in the hospital, and even though they said a few steps would be enough, I walked 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet around the room at a time.
That's where it all started.
Rowing itself is a journey, and that makes it a little longer.
At the moment of winning gold, the first thing that came to their mind was Williams. Williams was a little more talkative than usual this morning, and this was to overcome his anxiety.
Steining, a former captain of the Royal Artillery Corps, who will travel to Afghanistan later, said: "I've been in a bad mood this week, maybe a little extreme, but this gold medal is really significant. ”
It told me over and over how important it was to me, how hard I, Helen and Robin had put in.
It was the reward of three years of hard work by Helen, Robin and me.
If it weren't for Robin, we'd be nobodies, and thank you very much to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have found a better trainer and coach than him.
Helen Graff and Heather Stanning are undefeated in five years.
The punishment imposed by the duo is unmatched by their opponents.
Even in the final 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Graf still had plenty of fitness.
It was thrilling.
Helen shouted, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm".
It's really important not to be influenced by your opponents.
We had a great start, and at the same time we weren't expecting anything earth-shattering.
We didn't think about today's glory, we just thought about paddling every oar and winning this race, and we did it.
It took the duo a year to decide on their future.
Graf will marry TV explorer Steve Bakshar next month.
But for now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say it's my last race.
It's going to put too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience, and I was nervous.
About 4 minutes have passed.
"I feel so much better," she said. ”

Snapchat's "anime" effect has been accused of satirizing Asians
Snapchat says the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers believe it has racial overtones.
Snapchat's 150 million everyday users can change reality and make portraits ridiculous with its filter tool.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
These lenses have the effect of blunting, curved features, producing more than 30 million retouched selfies per day.
Any missteps are immediately noticed by the public.
Snapchat Lens has been criticized for encouraging people to play black or white-skinned beauty.
So when the app this week offered some users a filter that could create squint eyes, weird fangs, and pink face effects, some critics called it a racial satire of Asia's "yellow race."
They even wonder if these recurring issues mean that the company has a bigger problem with diversity.
After Snapchat said it had removed the feature, Wednesday's report of The Verge and Motherboard sparked outrage.
The company's explanation is that the filter is a tribute to anime characters, not a satire of Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of real-life hurtful stereotypes.
Others are also adamantly against these anime images.
A Korean-American art student who tweeted and shared the photos was widely shared said the filters were "uncomfortable and uncomfortable, at the very least."
She added: "It's hard to tell the difference between an extremely disgusting image of Asian satire and the effect of a filter. ”
While it's not just the yellow race in the filter, the yellow race is extremely devalued.
Snapchat isn't the only company that touches these cultural boundaries.
From corporate boards to Hollywood and the devices we carry, American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusion.
Snapchat's large younger demographic can be sensitive due to its greater emphasis on racial diversity than older generations.
When one of Snapchat's filters created an image of an insulting user, 25-year-old Katie Chu said in an interview on Thursday: "It's harder than ever to get this kind of thing out of the spot." ”
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes the racial controversy reflects Snapchat's lack of racial diversity in the hiring process.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's employees, who are mostly white, and whose leadership is all men, and added a label at the end of the article: #DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese-American, Ms. Chu said, "Either they don't have a diverse group of people on their staff who can make that decision, or they have people of color on their staff, but they don't have a position that allows them to speak freely." ”
Other observers shared complaints that she had not been responded to by Snapchat.
The company does not release data on the diversity of its workforce and says it is a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of its employees, but a spokesperson said the company had recently hired a recruiter to focus on the underrepresented population and drive inclusion.
Ms. Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account: "I wonder if they need more users like us who oppose this behavior." ”
The congressional panel said military officials distorted ISIS intelligence
Officials at U.S. Central Command changed intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it actually was, a congressional panel noted in a report released Thursday.
The interim report comes from a task force formed by Republican chairs of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee. The report said there was "widespread discontent" among CENTCOM intelligence analysts who said their superiors were tampering with their assessments of the U.S. war against the Islamic State.
Central Command (Centcom) in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news release on the report, "Intelligence reviewed by senior CENTCOM leaders portrays more optimistic about U.S. counterterrorism operations than they actually do, and consistently more optimistic than analyses by other intelligence agencies." ”
The California Republican representative said: "The behavior of CENTCOM is unacceptable. On one side, our fighters are suffering from war, and on the other side are high-level policymakers receiving misanalysis. ”
The question of the leadership of CENTCOM has extended to the highest levels of the agency.
The report details long-standing problems with CENTCOM in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analyzing U.S. training of Iraqi troops.
While there is no conclusive evidence that senior officials in the Obama administration ordered changes to the reports, according to the report's description, the analysts felt pressured by CENTCOM leaders to voice a more optimistic opinion about the threat posed by the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
"In the first half of 2015, many CENTCOM press releases, statements and congressional testimony were much more optimistic than they actually did," the report said. ”
For example, a Central Command official has publicly stated that a major military operation could be taken to retake Mosul as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of ISIS.
Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement: "After months of investigation, this result is clear. ”
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most senior intelligence officers at U.S. Central Command manipulated the command's intelligence products to conceal the threat of the Islamic State in Iraq.
After Republicans learned from analysts that intelligence about the Islamic State had been manipulated, they set up a task force.
As the investigation continues, more discoveries will follow the report released on Thursday.
The Prosecutor General of the Ministry of Defense has also conducted a long-term investigation into CENTCOM.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their findings on Thursday, consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
In a statement, the Democratic leader of the committee, Mr. Shea, said that between 2014 and 2015, CENTCOM developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessments of Islamic State and Iraqi peacekeepers. ”
Mr. Cheada said the process "hampered the release of intelligence," lowered analysts' morale and "made it "unacceptable to dissenting opinions." ”
But Mr. Cheah and the Democrats also said they had found no evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on CENTCOM analysts when their conclusions fit "presuppositions or political narratives." ”
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary findings of the congressional investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon's attorney general began an investigation after receiving complaints from CENTCOM analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Navy Rear Adm. Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Defense Department would not make any comments on the congressional report until the attorney general's investigation was concluded.
But "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense encourage healthy conversations on these important national security topics," he said. ”
The impact of the investigation has outweighed the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing campaigns in Iraq and Syria have succeeded, as a growing number of Defense Department officials claim.
But last year, those claims raised questions about the extent to which President Ma could trust CENTCOM's assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of the controversy more than a decade ago, when CENTCOM intelligence analyst Gregory Hook wrote a research article in which George W. Bush's administration insisted on sending small forces to Iraq despite the opposition of many analysts and gave little thought to what happened after the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hook played a key role in the campaign against ISIS intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr. Hook's team had concluded that the airstrikes against the Islamic State refinery had not significantly reduced the terrorist group's economic revenues, as the group had built makeshift refineries to continue selling oil on the black market, contrary to the statements made.
According to a September report by Time Magazine, CENTCOM did not make the findings public.
Central Command Commander Lloyd Austin III was criticized last year after lawyers reviewed Senate testimony about overly optimistic assessments of the war.
General Austin retired in April and is currently replaced by Joseph Wattle in his position at CENTCOM.
The United States has won four in a row in women's hockey and will face Great Britain
Katie Bam, who scored the third in the 6-1 win over Japan, scored a brace for the U.S. women's hockey team on Thursday to help the U.S. win 3-0 over India.
Five goals in two games was a staggering fetish, but the 27-year-old said she didn't know she had such a good performance.
"I don't know anything about it," she said. ”
I'm not the type of person who remembers how many goals I've scored.
What she does know is that the U.S. team has won four in a row at the Olympics and will be battling Great Britain for top of the group after a 2-0 win over Japan on Thursday.
Great Britain and the United States met in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams will advance to the quarter-finals, a match that will determine who wins the group.
The team that wins the group will avoid meeting a strong Dutch team and will be able to go further. The Netherlands qualified as top of their other group.
In Saturday's game, the U.S. team performed wonders with an amazing performance. You know, at the London Olympics four years ago, the U.S. team was at the bottom of 12 teams.
Bam was on that team at the time.
Growing up in Bruebell, Pennsylvania, Bam first picked up a hockey bat at the age of 3 (her twin sister played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest national team member to date.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she failed to make the final list.
In 2012, neither she nor her teammates were favored.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnum took over as head coach and everything started to change.
"It's a change in culture, mentality and substance," Bam said. ”
We weren't at where we are today in London.
We've had a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam took the lead in the first half with a close-range backhand shot.
India's team were yet to win the tournament, but the team showed incredible tenacity and held the score 1-0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam exploded.
She dribbled the ball down the left side of the court, then cut inside to the middle and volleyed into the net to give the USA a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal midway through the fourth quarter.
The United States have kept a clean sheet for the first time in this tournament with goalkeeper Jackie Bridges, scoring one goal in each of their first three wins.
This time she was extraordinary.
So is Bam.
"We're in great shape right now," Panham said. But how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
The shabby food of the Great Depression in "The Hearty Meal".
In March 1933, Franklin J. Brown, who had just been elected president, was elected president of the People's Republic of China. Delano Roosevelt sat in the president's office for lunch.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt loved Fifth Avenue food, like foie gras and Maryland fish stew.
On that day, his menu was simple: devil eggs with tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and preserved pudding as a snack.
Jen Ziegman said: "It's about sharing the joys and sorrows of people who are suffering when it comes to food. ”
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It's also a reflection of the American way of eating. ”
The husband and wife, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are both food historians.
Mr. Ko's last book, "Stir-fried Chowder," was about Chinese food in the United States, and Ms. Ziegman's book, "97 Orchards," tells the story of the lives of slum tenants through food.
Their new book, "The Feast," will be published Tuesday by Harper, which is about food history in the United States during the Great Depression.
After presenting some common insights on food, they met a reporter at Eisenberg's sandwich shop. This simple lunch counter in the Flatiron District has been open since 1929, when the economy was in a downturn.
Ms. Ziegman, 54, ordered a sandwich with cream cheese and crushed olives, while Mr. Ko, 57, ordered a platter of turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The reporter ordered a baked meat wrap, which the couple thought was appropriate to discuss the diet of the Great Depression.
"Bread was very popular at the time," says Ms. Ziegman. ”
At that time, there were peanut bread, liver bread, and soy bread.
They are all made with one ingredient and a cheap topping that can be poured over the ingredient.
Imagine that your dinner is all peanuts.
Mr. Coe put on a strange look.
"They must be like lead in your stomach," he said. ”
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, Americans had a buffet, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cook for the male farm workers, and there are freshly punched pies for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
In World War I, it was the Americans who gave food to hungry Europeans. "The Feast" chronicles how the country suddenly ceased to be a land of abundance.
Mr. Coe explains why he and his wife wrote the book: "At that time, food had become a major topic of displeasure for Americans. ”
Another unpleasant topic was shabby new foods: "mystery foods" such as bread and stews became the main course, and stews were "the best way to cook leftovers," Ms. Ziegman said, because chefs could use cream in sauces to mask unpalatable ingredients.
Fresh fruits are replaced by cheap dried fruits.
Meat, which has been the protagonist of the American table for many years, has become a rare luxury.
A strange hodgepodge of calories, nutrition is the first thing people think about over taste or even basic cooking knowledge.
While researching the book, including various recipes, Ms. Ziegman made a roasted onion stuffed with peanut oil.
"It's not very common at dinner tables," Mr. Coe said. ”
"It's also weird," Ms. Ziegman said.
Peanut oil doesn't go well with roasted onions at all.
This is characteristic of many family budget meals.
Household economists such as Louis Stanley, who served as chef of the Federal Directorate for the Family Economy from 1923 to 1943, influenced the country's eating habits for the first time in history.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines that encourage women to be "budget-conscious" and brave enough to turn bad foods like creamy pasta with carrots into gourmets.
"A Sumptuous Meal" is a sumptuous "historical treasure".
Of particular interest are the government's response to hungry people, such as President Herbert Hoover's "I can't take care of other people's business."
While he publicly praised his simple Iowa farmhouse as a child, his diet was as refined as a millionaire.
"He likes to eat European-style Western food, such as fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Koh said.
He wore an evening gown and dined in a gilded dining room.
He is clearly detached from the people.
If it weren't for his wife, Eleanor, who encouraged him to set an example in his diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As the book puts it, the butlers hired by Ms. Roosevelt had no interest in taste, so that "the food in the White House was not only the worst food in Washington, but also the worst cooked." ”
As soon as the United States returned to normalcy, many of the cooking methods of the Great Depression were abandoned.
What is left behind, Ms. Ziegman says, is our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they learned more about Ms. Ziegman's mother's eating habits, such as how she doesn't throw away food.
"She was very afraid of wasting food. ”
"She actually made a lot of people sick," Ms. Ziegman recalled. ”
For example, there was once a "cream puff" incident.
After removing the plate, she and Mr. Coe brought out a dessert they had prepared at home: the preserved pudding that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called creamy preserved fruit," Ms. Ziegman said, adding that a trendy name for an ordinary dish is "the usual trick."
There is no whipped cream in this dessert, just preserved fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone struggled to push the spoon deep into the sticky brown paste.
Surprisingly, this dessert tastes pretty good.
Mr. Ko ate a second spoonful and a third spoonful.
He thought it was an acceptable dessert and told his wife, "It would be better with some chopped walnuts." ”
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, and Saudi Arabia's production hit a new high.
The report raises doubts about OPEC's credibility, and the road to oil price recovery may still be fraught with thorns.
On Monday, OPEC chairman-in-office and Qatar's energy minister, Samada, said that OPEC would hold an informal meeting on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
OPEC's monthly report released on Wednesday showed that the entire OPEC group, including Gabon, rose 46,000 b/d to 33.11 million b/d in July.
OPEC also said in its monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined products, thus exacerbating the level of oversupply in the market.
Affected by this news, coupled with the increase in crude oil production expectations in the United States and the unexpected increase in crude oil inventories, international oil prices closed down for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday's close, light crude oil futures for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2.48%, and London Brent crude futures for October delivery fell 2.07%.
Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of oil producers is unlikely to lead to a significant tightening of supply, and the data released by the US Energy Information Administration also weighed on market sentiment.
Iran's crude oil production peaked at 3.85 million barrels per day, the highest level since 2008, Iran's official news agency Fars quoted Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh as saying on Wednesday.
As soon as the news of the meeting came out, Russian Energy Minister Novak said that there was no need for a new round of negotiations on frozen production under the current oil prices.
The last time the oil producers met was in April, and OPEC members failed to agree on any measures.
Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMIResearch, said the market and the media may have overreacted to the upcoming OPEC meeting.
Royal Bank of Canada's head of commodity strategy, Helima Croft, said OPEC was changing the mood of the market by signaling that they would broker a deal.
This is like smoke and mirrors that distract people from the eye (deliberately giving the wrong impression).
Eugen Weinberg, head of commodity research at Commerzbank, said the chances of OPEC trying to stabilize the market through the September meeting were considered low.
This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, which has staged a "wolf coming" after all.
All localities should focus on spot checks on medical establishments that publish medical advertisements in violation of regulations, have concentrated complaints and reports, and have been punished multiple times in the past.
The National Health and Family Planning Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine will organize supervision and inspection of the special supervision and inspection work in some provinces in a timely manner.
According to media disclosures, due to the previous large-scale influx of capital into Internet medicine, the current problem of product homogenization is serious, the investment boom is gradually receding, and capital has entered a wait-and-see period.
In addition, according to the data of the Management Research Center of Hong Kong Alibi Hospital, a large number of Internet medical companies have died within one year of their establishment, and about 20% of the start-up Internet medical companies have ceased to exist.
However, while most Internet medical companies are struggling on the road to Series A or Series B financing, there are several leading companies in the subdivision that can still obtain capital popularity.
It seems that Internet medical entrepreneurship must not be "swarmed", but must look at the market demand, sink down to be specialized, and do deep.
Yuyue invested 12 million yuan, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, and Jointown Equipment Co., Ltd. invested 18 million yuan, accounting for 60% of the registered capital.
In recent years, with the national policy support in medical informatization, electronic and integrated supply chain management systems have gradually entered hospitals at all levels.
The cooperation between Yuyue and Jointown is aimed at the needs of the market, helping the hospital to build an advanced supply chain management system, and taking this opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet medical companies, iBaby has focused on the vertical field of Internet obstetrics from the beginning, deeply cultivating both pregnant mothers and doctors.
Pregnant mothers can not only have free 24-hour and one-on-one consultation with a doctor in charge, but also pay for a targeted medical consultation.
On the doctor side, iBaby breaks geographical restrictions by organizing experts to carry out online lectures, peer exchanges, case discussions and other micro-lectures for grassroots doctors.
At present, there are three sections on the doctor side, namely doctor continuing education, doctor socialization and doctor help.
It provides services including online learning, case discussions, academic exchanges, social platforms between doctors in the same hospital and department, legal assistance and entrepreneurial support for doctor-patient relationships or personal life.
According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently said that Ali Health is "willing to settle down" to win health big data.
Internet companies and data companies lack professionalism, and there is no uniformity in the way they write on the same entry.
Alibaba's current layout in the medical and health field is divided into three parts, namely Ali Health, Tmall Pharmacy and Alipay Future Hospital.
Wang Lei said frankly that medical and health entrepreneurship will be more difficult than other industries, "It's not just a matter of how much money you have, but also to be calm and endure loneliness to do it slowly." ”
Staying up late to watch the Olympics is easy to damage the heart
The Brazilian Olympics are in full swing, and even if the event is broadcast in the middle of the night in China, many citizens will stay up late to watch it.
In this regard, the doctor specially reminded that staying up late to watch the event has health risks and may cause cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up late for a long time, the hormone will still be secreted in large quantities, and the human body will continue to be in a state of tension and excitement, unable to recover normally, which is easy to cause vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure, thereby causing cardiovascular diseases.
Han Zhiyuan especially reminded that groups with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, high blood sugar, high blood lipids, smoking habits, and family history will be more likely to cause cardiovascular disease if they stay up late.
If you stay up late for a long time, not only cardiovascular function will be affected, but also gastrointestinal function, immune system, neuroendocrine system will be affected, and even the risk of cancer will increase.
For elderly friends, Han Zhiyuan suggested that try not to stay up late to watch the Olympic games, especially those with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last "World Cup" football match, Han Zhiyuan once treated a patient in his 60s, whose myocardial infarction may be related to staying up late to watch the game.
Han Zhiyuan introduced that since the beginning of this year, his department has received some patients with myocardial infarction or stroke around the age of 25, which is largely caused by the patient's long-term stay up late lifestyle.
1. Don't stay up late every day, occasionally stay up late to watch your favorite sports, and wait for the next day to watch the replay of other sports.
2. Replenish water in a timely manner when staying up late and eat more fruits can prevent blood vessel blockage and enhance the body's immunity.
On August 12, Beijing time, it was reported that at the end of the women's 50-meter rifle three-position final at the 2016 Rio Olympics, Chinese veteran Du Li won the bronze medal.
Du Li became a veteran of the four Olympic dynasties, winning a total of 2 gold, 1 silver and 1 bronze medal in four Olympic Games.
In 1998, he joined the Shandong Provincial Shooting Team and followed Coach Wang Dewen for professional shooting training.
In June 2003, she won the gold medal in the women's 10-meter air rifle at the Shooting World Cup in Croatia and broke the world record with 504.9 rings.
In August 2004, she won the gold medal in the women's 10m air rifle and won the first gold medal for the Chinese team in the Athens Olympic Games.
In August 2008, he won the gold medal in the 50-meter sport rifle 3 positions competition with a total score of 690.3 rings.
In August 2012, after the London Olympics, Du Li applied to the International Shooting Federation for temporary retirement.
In January 2015, Du Li announced that she would return to the national team to start training in preparation for the Rio Olympics.
In March 2016, the Rio Olympic Trials ended, and the women's 10m air rifle Olympic qualification was repeated after eight years.
On August 6, 2016, in the women's 10-meter air rifle event of the Rio Olympics, Du Li won the silver medal with a score of 207 rings.
On August 12, 2016, she won the bronze medal in the women's 50m rifle three-position competition at the Rio Olympics.
The film is expected to premiere on CCTV and LeTV early next year, and will also launch a VR panoramic documentary version for the first time.
The documentary "Polar" is a large-scale work focusing on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the third pole of the earth, telling the story of the fusion of Tibetan tradition and modernity, as well as the interaction between Tibet and the world from a new perspective.
The biggest advantage of VR works is that the audience has a unique sense of "immersion" in watching the movie, which also puts forward higher requirements for the shooting process.
The film crew behind the Polar Polar VR Special Edition said they wanted to make sure that every aspect of the footage was impeccable and immersive for the audience.
On August 11, the Yantai Detachment of the Shandong Armed Police Corps organized special operations snipers to brave the high temperature of 34 degrees Celsius to come to Kunyu Mountain to carry out jungle training.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union brought missiles into Cuba, almost leading to a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.
This event is regarded as the pinnacle of the Cold War, and history is known as the "Cuban Missile Crisis".
But what is less well known is that a powerful solar storm during the Cold War also threatened to cause a nuclear war in the United States against the Soviet Union, an event that was not first made public by researchers until August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a severe solar storm caused intense interference to the U.S. military's radar and radio communications in the North Pole.
These radars were part of the American ballistic missile warning system and were used to monitor Soviet missiles.
The paper, completed by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed U.S. military personnel involved in forecasting and analyzing solar activity at the time, as well as reviewing unclassified literature.
The paper writes that in the 60s of the last century, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly launching a nuclear war, the US Air Force always had some fighters with nuclear warheads flying in the sky.
Unaware that the main culprit of the interference was a solar storm and not the Soviet Union, the U.S. military commander ordered the fighter jets to be put into combat readiness.
Fortunately, the US military's solar activity, which began in the late 50s of the last century and its study of electromagnetic interference from the Earth, finally prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the Aviation Meteorological Service of the US Air Force and submitted a detailed report.
As a direct consequence of the solar storm, the U.S. military has since viewed space weather as an operational concern and has established a more robust space weather forecasting system.
In their daily travel, citizens find that their cars are hindered by unfamiliar vehicles, and when they cannot contact the drivers of unfamiliar vehicles, they can use the "WeChat car moving" function to solve this problem.
Since August 11, the Xi'an Traffic Police WeChat service account "Xi'an Traffic Police" has launched the "WeChat Car Moving" service.
After the launch of this service, members of the public can use the "WeChat Car Moving" function to solve such problems when an unfamiliar vehicle obstructs the movement of their vehicle in the absence of the driver in their daily life.
The new service functions are fast and save administrative costs, respect and protect citizens' personal privacy, and provide all-weather and full-time services.
As long as the public has WeChat, it can be very convenient to operate by themselves, which can relatively make both sides of the car move more friendly and easy to "meet", alleviate the problem of parking difficulties, and can reduce the occurrence of public security cases involving cars.
On the other hand, for car owners who refuse to move, park illegally or obstruct traffic, the Xi'an traffic management department said that the traffic police will take different disposal measures according to the actual situation and deal with them according to the situation.
On August 9th, more than 10 young workers of Shangluo Power Supply Company came here to carry out the theme activity of "Meeting in the Ancient Town and Full of Power" and our festival Qixi Festival in the cultural tourism scenic spot of Dihua Ancient Town in Danfeng County.
Shangluo Power Supply Company Danfeng County Company combined with the construction of spiritual civilization and actively organized and carried out the theme activity of "Meeting in the Ancient Town and Full of Power" and our festival and Tanabata Festival.
The employees of the company who participated in the event said: "I usually spend my main energy on work and study, and lack the time and platform to communicate with colleagues and friends. ”
"This time the company has provided us with such a relaxed, happy and harmonious platform, which I like very much, meaningful and interesting. ”
The Qixi Festival event has been widely praised by the young workers on the spot, and they hope that the company will hold more such activities in the future to strengthen communication and exchanges with more other young people.
The closely watched Beijing Olympics men's singles champion and Spanish superstar Rafael Nadal defeated his opponent in straight sets in the men's singles match on the same day to advance to the quarterfinals, and the men's doubles match also advanced to the final.
As the winner of the Golden Slam, Nadal has a soft spot for the Olympic Games, and he has not recovered from his injury, and he has made a lot of achievements in this three-line attack.
He and teammate Lopez will face Romania's Tekau and Megya for gold in the men's doubles final.
The women's singles event of the Rio Olympics suffered the withdrawal of a number of seeded players, and after several days of fierce competition, the women's singles semifinals were all produced on the 11th.
Kvitova will battle Puig for a spot in the final, while the other final spot will be between Keith and Kerber.
The Women's Doubles semi-finals were all in place, with Hingis/Baczynski vs. Hradka/Hlavakova and Makarova/Vesnina vs. Strycova/Safarova in the semi-finals.
The Mixed Doubles match was also held on this day to determine the quarter-finals, but the loss of top seeds Mahu/Garcia and the withdrawal of natto made the mixed doubles match a little more lulling.
On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly issued a new version of the U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines in New York, allowing Japan's armed forces to play a more offensive role around the world.
On the same day, US Secretary of Defense Carter, US Secretary of State John Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, and Japanese Defense Minister Mototo Nakatani attended a news conference in New York.
This is the fifth time that a Chinese non-governmental think tank has published an assessment report on Japan's military strength, and it is also the fourth time that an English version has been published.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including overall policy adjustment, military strength, national defense budget, military deployment, weaponry, institutional reform, military training and exercises, foreign military security cooperation, and military security relations with China.
According to the report, 2015 was the final year of the Abe administration's major policy adjustments in the security sector for several consecutive years.
Since then, Japan's measures in the field of security will mainly focus on the operational aspects of the application of the legal system, the implementation of strategies, and the implementation of policies, rather than the drastic adjustment and change of frameworks, mechanisms, and policies.
The report stresses that the Abe cabinet is trying to achieve the multiple goals of promoting Japan's "normal nationalization", the Self-Defense Forces going out to intervene in international security affairs, strengthening the Japan-US alliance, and preventing and containing China through the above three breakthroughs.
Previously, the China Association for the Promotion of Strategic Culture released Japan's military strength assessment reports on June 5, 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014, and June 30, 2015.
On August 12, the Financial Times published a set of images of the residence of the U.S. ambassador to China.
In contrast, the U.S. ambassador's residence, from its appearance, could well serve as a safe house in the next film adaptation of John le Carré's Cold War spy novel, the article said.
The residence is grey and heavily defended with perimeter fences, a second interior wall, barbed wire, and barricades for vehicles.
Make up for the shortcomings of public sports facilities
The blackened coal yard warehouse has been transformed into a "green grassy" football field, and the red-brick spire factory has been transformed into a modern sports hall.
On the National Fitness Day, the Nanlomaying Sports and Culture Park outside Wangjiangmen in Hangzhou unveiled the veil of mystery.
It was once a coal yard and has been idle since it closed more than a decade ago, leaving behind a large amount of illegal construction and household waste.
After the renovation, it has become a sports and cultural park, and will be officially opened to the public in November, providing free sports venues to the public, and undoubtedly opening up a new fertile ground for national sports.
This can't help but remind people of Hangzhou Chen Jinglun Sports School, the "Whampoa Military Academy" of Chinese swimming, which has swam many world champions.
The continuous production of famous swimmers vividly illustrates the relationship between competitive sports and national sports - the rich mass base provides good conditions for the selection of professional athletes.
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of national sports, which in a certain sense depends on national sports, which in turn depends on the conditions of the venue.
According to reports, as of 2015, although China's per capita sports area has been 150 times that of the People's Republic of China, it is still far behind the sports power.
In June this year, the State Council issued the "National Fitness Plan (2016-2020)", which focuses on the development of mass sports.
In order to make up for this shortcoming, on the one hand, the relevant departments should fully consider the layout of stadiums when carrying out urban planning.
On the other hand, the public sports venues that have been built, including those in schools and other units, should be opened as wide as possible to improve the efficiency of use.
The Rio Olympics, which are currently in full swing, have stimulated people's enthusiasm for sports and awakened everyone's sense of participation.
Gilead gets attorneys' fees in a patent battle with Merck for hepatitis C
According to the U.S. District Judge's decision, Gilled Scientific is entitled to attorneys' fees arising in the hepatitis C patent litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co.
In June, after a U.S. judge found that Merck had violated the law, including perjury and other unethical practices, Gilead was exempted from paying $200 million in damages for infringing two of Merck's patents with Gilead's best-selling drugs Sofexbuvir and Havani.
In Thursday's lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Beth Lamboson Freeman said Gilead would not be liable for the costs of defending it.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilled, who dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs. Gilled's drug can cure more than 90% of people with hepatitis.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, with both claiming to be the owners of the lab work on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drug.
U.S.-backed forces announced that they had recaptured Manbij from ISIS
A spokesman for the force said on Friday that all remaining Islamic State soldiers in the city had left and that U.S.-backed forces had taken full control of the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border.
After the departure of the militants who had taken refuge in the city, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now conducting a sweep across the city.
Sharan Darwishh of the Manbij Military Council, an alliance of Syrian democratic forces, told Reuters that they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians who had been abducted by militants.
He told Reuters: "Manbij is all under our control now, but we are still doing the sweep. ”
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2105 tax return on Friday, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent in federal taxes.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in philanthropic contributions, most of which went to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton's speaking fees reached nearly $5.3 million, and the former secretary of state received $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for a book about her time at the State Department.
Clinton's running mates, Senator Tim Caine of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holden, released their 10-year tax returns.
The two paid 20.3 percent of federal taxes in 2015.
Mrs. Clinton's campaign aide, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane would continue to be the benchmark for financial transparency. ”
In stark contrast, Donald Trump covered up and retracted his earlier promise to publish his tax returns on false grounds.
While not required by law, it is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyers cited the IRS audit as a reason for refusing to release tax returns.
Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams tweeted that it's up to you, along with a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Mr. Trump to release his tax returns until the audit was complete.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republicans, say Trump's refusal to release tax returns raises questions about his net worth, charitable contributions, business dealings and various other relationships, including ties to Russia.
Mrs. Clinton seized on the issue and released an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Mr. Trump to release his tax returns.
She raised the issue Thursday in an economic policy speech in Michigan.
"For decades, he refused to publish his tax returns like other presidential candidates," she told the crowd. ”
According to Politico News, Mr. Trump barely paid a penny in taxes for two years of the '90s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who said that may still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a major issue in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named after Warren Buffett, a billionaire investor, who guarantees that people earning more than $1 million a year pay at least 30 percent in taxes.
President Ma also supported the proposal.
Last week, Mrs. Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire Hathaway is home to, at which Mr. Buffett asked Mr. Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he is also being audited by the IRS and that Trump is "afraid" not of the tax authorities, but of the voters.
The earliest tax return released by the Clinton campaign was in 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chabak, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, with a combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, they earned only $100 in wages.
Their primary investment is in low-cost index mutual funds, and the Clintons earn $109,000 in dividends and interest.

Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli phone codes at 'demands' of Arab customers – Reuters News
A French filmmaker with Jewish roots revealed to the media that the Kempinski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli phone codes, and that hotel employees said it was in accordance with the "request" of Arab customers, which caused an uproar.
Claude Lownzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary The Holocaust, expressed his disappointment with the Kempinski Hotel and published an open letter in the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
During a recent stay, Lownzman wanted to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can talk directly from their rooms.
Israel actually disappeared in 2016, Germany's capital, Berlin?
Lownzman wrote.
Instead, guests can make Israeli calls through the Kempinski Hotel's call center.
In search of an explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel's front desk.
In the letter, Mr. Lanzman said he was "shocked" by the answers he received at the front desk.
According to the hotel staff, this was a "deliberate decision made by Kempinski management".
And the reason for doing so made the filmmaker even more angry.
Lanzman quotes the employee's exact words: Most of our guests are Arabs who demanded that the Israeli code be removed. ”
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas Handelsmann, called the incident a "great disgrace."
We were shocked to learn of this incident.
The incident itself is a great shame.
And what happened in Germany and the hotel chain is even more embarrassing.
There is no need for any explanation for this.
"We hope that the hotel will come to the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident sparked heated discussions online, and everyone thought it was a scandal.
Some people think that Kempinski hotels are simply "groveling" in order to meet the requirements of Arab customers.
Another post called the hotel "shameless" and pointed out that the hotel on the famous Kudam Avenue is located near a synagogue.
According to Der Spiegel, the hotel was quick to clarify all the allegations, claiming that everything was "negligent" and offering an "apology" to Lanzmann.
The Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted the representative of Kempinski as saying: "There has never been a direct order to remove Israel from the speed-dial list".
The newspaper also said that the Israel code had been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to evict protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, in São Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with police during a protest against the government's reform of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to dislodge protesters.
The incident was caused by an attempt by law enforcement officials to disperse the students, so police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the march to express their dissatisfaction with the programmes.
To save money, São Paulo State Governor Okmin plans to close 100 public schools and transfer 300,000 students.
Some of the students who participated in the protest expressed their displeasure with interim President Michel Temer through graffiti on the wall.
Just days before the latest protest, protesters took to the streets en masse in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the national Senate.
Scottish cyclist Kalm Skinner came home with gold medals in cycling
Scottish cyclist Kalm Skinner helped the British trio defend their Olympic gold medal after London 2012 in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velogue last night.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist replaced his fellow Scottish man, Sir Chris Hoy, as the backbone of the team. When the young Skinner defeated the favourites New Zealand and came home with a bang, even the legendary cyclist was proud of him.
Four years ago, Team Great Britain was a blockbuster, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
Great Britain finished sixth at the World Cycling Championships in London in March, after Hoy has since retired. Then, the British team made another brilliant achievement.
Between Beijing and London, Great Britain's problem was the substitution of "First Lap Specialist" Jamie Staff.
The team did exactly that when Sinders came along.
Hoy's retirement also leaves a void that both Kien Imadi and Matt Crampton want to fill.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's coaching staff insisted that he be selected for the national team, and Skinner eventually lived up to expectations.
Skinner's partners are Hinders and Kenny, who won gold with Hoy four years ago. The trio set Olympic records in the qualifying round, but that result was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
The trio eventually defeated their rivals and won the gold medal.
Although Hinds was slightly behind, Kenny took the lead for the team, and Skinner held that lead until the end.
A change of strategy was key to this reversal, as Hinds opted for a larger flywheel and therefore slower, which allowed Kenny, and especially Skinner, to maintain the speed.
Hoy watched the game as a BBC commentator. Skinner, Kenny and Hinders saw him on the podium.
Glasgow cyclist Skinner, 23, said: "I'm flattered. ”
I'm just doing what I can to make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record and beat the world champion in the final.
It's unbelievable.
There's nothing quite like this victory.
After winning gold at London 2012 with Kenny and Hoy, Hinders admitted to deliberately falling off the track with a poor start.
He later retracted the comment and the British rivals were unable to appeal.
And this victory did not have any such problems.
"It's like being in London with the British flag on the platform," Hinders said. ”
We just got together three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world titles, so it's amazing to be able to defend our Olympic title.
That's just one race, one gold medal for the British team, who won seven of the 10 track cycling gold medals at the Beijing and London Olympics.
If this is symbolic of the progress we have made over the past five months, then we will continue to be successful at the Velodrome over the next five days.
Based on Kenny's form, it's not impossible for him to replicate Hoy's feat of winning three gold medals at one Olympics.
If that's the case, Kenny, who is 12 years younger than Hoy and who was also born on March 23 (a day that seems to be sacred in British sport, with Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister also born on this day) will have six gold medals and one silver medal.
This result is the same as that of Hoy.
Kenny will next compete in the three-day sprint race, which begins today.
The 28-year-old Bolton native said: "I'm going to focus on this game for the time being.
Team competitions are always the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
Frankly, it's a bit of a lonely thing to win alone.
"If he can win the other two gold medals, then he should be knighted," Hinders said. ”
It was the only medal game of the day, but Great Britain received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doerr qualified for the four-man 4km team pursuit with the fastest times.
Their grade is 351.943.
The world record for gold medallists at London 2012 is 351.659.
With the first round and final (10:42pm) taking place on Matchday 2 today, Wiggins will undoubtedly be in the spotlight.
Yesterday he got into an argument with the tournament officials before the qualifying round, when the tournament officials asked him to measure his height.
In the women's competition, which will end tomorrow, Laura Trotter, Joanna Rossel Shand, Eleanor Barker and Kate Archibald from Milgey advanced with a new world record of 413.260.
Team Great Britain relied on a strong track cycling team to take the initiative in the middle of the Olympics and won a number of medals.
After demonstrating their absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British cycling team was a bit disappointed on their way to Rio.
There have been many twists and turns, including the resignation of technical director Sean Sutton in April due to allegations of sexism and bullying, and the retirement of legends such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the velodrome's first race night was proof enough that the British team would once again put on a legend of reaching peak form at crucial moments.
After the little life comes into this world, parents have to be responsible for this life, which is not only responsible for the child's physical health, but also for the spiritual development, that is, education.
If you fail in your children's education, then no matter how successful your career is, you will not be able to make up for the shortcomings of your life and the failure of your family.
When a new life comes, new parents need to spend time and energy to take care of and educate their children, and be responsible for him.
And responsibility, in addition to the care of the body and keeping them healthy, also lies in spiritual education, that is, let children learn how to behave, how to become adults, and how to succeed.
Good family education means that parents need to accompany their children often, give them love, take care of them patiently, and also need to teach their children to develop civilized words and deeds, so that children can better learn knowledge and improve intelligence.
Every word and deed of parents will affect the growth of their children, and they will imitate their parents, that is, people often say that dragons give birth to dragons, phoenixes give birth to phoenixes, and the sons of mice will make holes, and their parents will be what their children are.
Therefore, parents need to be a good example in front of their children, standardize their words and deeds, and cultivate their excellent character, which can indirectly help their children shape a good heart and make him more excellent.
Amy is a smart and beautiful girl.
She is outgoing and lively, gets along well with her friends, and adapts well to her environment.
But Amy has a little secret in her heart: she can't focus on her studies and work tasks for a long time.
This secret has been with Amy for a long time. Usually the problem is not serious》
Even with decentralized, modular time to study and work, she can basically complete tasks and achieve good results.
However, when the task is heavy and the time is tight, Amy feels very painful and tormented.
The individual's resistance to self-exposure and emotional experience is aimed at not threatening the individual's self-knowledge and self-esteem.
There are also behaviorist psychologists who understand impedance as an individual's disobedience to their behavior modification.
I tried to get Amy to do an exercise to calm herself down and feel the pain by breathing.
And once she left that trapped situation, she felt relaxed and free again.
Han, a 63-year-old homeless man, got into an argument with another homeless man, Xiao, after drinking, and stabbed him to death with a knife.
Han said that before the incident, he and the homeless man Xiao lived on the ground in an alley in Dongcheng District, and the two were more than 20 meters apart.
Han said that on the day of the incident, they were called by a friend to drink together, and the two had two arguments during and after the meal.
Han said that he was afraid that Xiao would beat him, so he picked up a fruit knife from the garbage heap and stabbed him to death.
In court, the victim's family demanded that Han pay more than 530,000 yuan in compensation for funeral expenses and death compensation.
Uber has been in the Taiwan market for 4 years, which has had a big impact on the local traditional taxi industry.
Taiwan's "United Daily News" reported on 12 August that on the morning of 12 August, more than 100 taxis bypassed Taiwan's "Executive Yuan" in protest, resulting in serious traffic paralysis in the surrounding area.
Zheng Lijia, chairman of the Taipei City Drivers' Union, said that Uber has been in Taiwan for four years, and the Taiwan authorities only held a meeting at the end of this month, and the drivers can no longer wait.
However, the government did not keep its word and procrastinated.
Law-abiding taxi drivers, who are low-class laborers, feel cheated by the authorities when they have to compete with the illegal but unrestricted Uber.
Original title: 2,000 chickens in a farm in Jiangsu were seized by the court and the owner was sentenced for selling them without authorization
After the judgment took effect, because Li did not automatically perform the obligations determined by the judgment, Wang applied to the Shuyang Court for compulsory enforcement.
On October 16, 2014, the Shuyang Court made a civil ruling, ruling that 2,000 laying hens in all Li farms should be seized and not transferred or sold without permission.
After receiving the seizure ruling, Li sold some of the laying hens that were seized in the farm without the permission of the Shuyang Court.
By March 8, 2015, when the Shuyang County Public Security Bureau investigated, there were only 142 laying hens left in the farm.
The reporter learned on August 12 that the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics Organizing Committee issued an announcement indicating that the Beijing Winter Olympics Organizing Committee inherited the intellectual property rights such as the emblem and logo of the Beijing Winter Olympics Bidding Committee.
Without the permission of the Beijing Winter Olympics Organizing Committee, no one is allowed to use the emblem and logo of the Beijing Winter Olympics Bidding Committee for commercial purposes.
The head of the Industrial Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out here today that steel overcapacity is a global problem.
In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate has been higher than the global average, and also higher than that of the United States, Europe and other countries and regions.
China has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess capacity, and the results are gradually emerging.
The person in charge pointed out that the Party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to the global problem of steel overcapacity.
All departments and regions will actively implement the deployment of the State Council, carry out work conscientiously, and reduce crude steel production capacity by about 45 million tons this year.
Starting from China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports, on the contrary, it has also taken a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The person in charge stressed that the international trade of steel products is essentially a market behavior, which is derived from the demand of importing countries, consumers after comprehensive consideration of product cost performance and other factors.
The implementation of trade protection measures will not help fundamentally solve the development problem of the global steel industry, on the contrary, it will only cause further impact on the international trade order.
When talking about debt, the person in charge stressed that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly handled in the process of resolving excess capacity.
Due to the large scale and wide range of assets of iron and steel enterprises, the debt relationship of some enterprises is complex, and if it is not properly disposed of, it may cause regional risks.
According to the person in charge, in recent years, with the increasing downward pressure on the economy, the total social demand has gradually weakened, the capacity utilization rate of some industries has declined, and the production and operation difficulties of enterprises have increased.
Some enterprises do not adapt to the changes in the market environment, and their production and operation are difficult to continue or even on the verge of bankruptcy, but they are restricted by some institutional and institutional factors, and there are many obstacles to exit in a market-oriented way, becoming "zombie enterprises".
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of factor resource utilization, increases social management costs, and hinders the establishment of a fair competition market environment.
The main reasons for the loss are the same as the difficulties faced by the global steel industry – sluggish market demand and low capacity utilization.
China mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic means, and rule of law methods, and the government mainly does a good job in ensuring the work of ensuring a fair and just market order.
The person in charge stressed that in the next step, we must unswervingly continue to do a good job in reducing production capacity and ensure the completion of the target task of resolving crude steel production capacity of 100 million ~ 150 million tons in five years.
On the afternoon of the 10th, as soon as the Chinese tourist police appeared on Moscow's Red Square, it immediately attracted people's attention, and the Chinese tourists waved with surprise, and the locals and foreign tourists could not help but stop and look back.
On the same day, members of the Tourist Police Detachment of the Public Security Bureau of Sanya City, Hainan Province, China's first professional tourist police force, came to Moscow's Red Square to exchange and learn from the local tourist police on duty.
The Moscow tourist police were divided into three groups to patrol Red Square, Nikolsky Pedestrian Street, and the Gum Department Store, and the Chinese tourist police studied with them, and the whole process lasted more than an hour.
Lyusinje, a female police officer in her 20s who speaks English and Spanish, joined the Tourist Police last year.
Along the way, he carefully observed the words and deeds of his Russian counterpart and from time to time communicated with her.
When Spanish tourists came to consult, the Moscow tourist police patiently explained to the other party in fluent Spanish, which left a deep impression on Wang Bing.
"We were very touched by the fact that everyone in the Moscow Tourist Police knew two or more foreign languages. ”
"As an international tourism island, Hainan is gradually focusing on attracting international tourists, and we hope to improve our ability to match the status of an international tourism island. ”
On the same day, before the on-the-job study, the Chinese tourist police also went to the station of the tourist police brigade in Moscow to communicate with their Russian counterparts.
"I often interact with Chinese tourists and am very happy to see them coming to Russia. ”
"They usually ask for help: how to get there, where is a monument, how to get a taxi, how to get back to the hotel. ”
Rysakov, head of the Moscow City Tourist Police Brigade, said that in recent years, Moscow's urban environment and tourist atmosphere have become better and better, and its attractiveness to foreign tourists is increasing.
In order to meet the needs of tourism development, a tourist police force was established in July 2014 to patrol and protect major scenic spots, help and guide tourists.
Currently, all Moscow tourist police officers are fluent in English, and some also in Spanish and German.
The police brigade divides them into nine groups according to their foreign language proficiency and attends classes twice a week to learn self-defense moves, laws and regulations, and foreign languages.
"At present, there are two tourist police officers who have started to learn Chinese and are already speaking well, and we will continue to improve their Chinese skills," Rysakov said.
Rysakov told reporters that since its formation, the Moscow tourist police have accumulated a certain amount of experience, and hopes to inspire their counterparts in Sanya.
He believes that the cooperation between the police departments of Russia and China will increase the sense of security of their citizens when traveling to each other's countries.
"We have been inspired by the recruitment of the Moscow Tourist Police, the policing model, the equipment, and the good interaction with tourists," Chen said.
Chinanews reporters combed and found that at least 9 provinces and cities, including Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian, and Beijing, have issued detailed rules for the implementation of residence permits.
As for the conditions for applying for a residence permit, the above-mentioned areas generally put forward that they need to live for more than half a year, and meet one of the conditions for having legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence, and continuous study.
Chinanews reporter noticed that in terms of the treatment provided by the residence permit, the "gold content" varies from place to place, and compared with the national version of the regulations, the scope of public services and conveniences provided in some areas has expanded.
These areas have increased the convenience for children to take the local high school entrance examination if they meet the relevant conditions.
In addition, Beijing and many other places have also made it clear that the scope of public services and facilities provided will be gradually expanded, and that they will be announced to the public on a regular basis.
For example, Fujian proposes to announce to the public at least once every three years the scope of public services and facilities enjoyed by residence permit holders.
The Interim Regulations on Residence Permits stipulate that the public security organs shall issue residence permits within 15 days from the date of acceptance of residence permits for those who meet the requirements for applying for residence permits.
As for the time limit for issuance, most regions agree with the national version, that is, it will be issued within 15 days.
Hebei clarified that for those who meet the application conditions and have complete materials, the public security police station at the place of residence shall issue a residence permit within 3 working days from the date of acceptance.
Jiangxi stipulates that if the requirements for applying for a residence permit are met and the supporting materials are complete, the public security organ shall make and issue a residence permit within 5 working days from the date of acceptance.
In accordance with the provisions of the Interim Regulations on Residence Permits, the above-mentioned areas have made it clear that the cost of applying for a residence permit for the first time will be exempted.
For example, Sichuan requires that local public security police stations or entrusted community service organizations strictly enforce the approved fee items and fee standards, and resolutely prohibit exceeding the scope, exceeding the standard fee or charging for rides.
After investigation, on July 27, 2016, Chen Yangxia, former secretary of the Dingnan County Party Committee of Ganzhou City, reported to work to the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and served as the director of the Party Style and Government Supervision Office (deputy director level, probation period of one year).
The red wine drunk that night was provided by Li Youcai personally, and other expenses were borne by Liu Moumou.
The Jiangxi Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection reported that Chen Yangxia, Cheng Ziliang, and others violated the spirit of the eight central regulations and violated party discipline by organizing and accepting invitations to eat in private clubs.
Pogba received two yellow cards in the Coppa Italia last season and will be automatically suspended for one match under the rules.
Although he has moved back to the Premier League, the FA still extends his cumulative suspension to the Premier League.
As a result, Pogba will be on the sidelines for the trip to Bournemouth on 14 August, with his debut back to Manchester United set to be extended to a home game against Southampton on 20 August.
As the No. 12 pick in the first round in 2014, Saric will officially land in the NBA next season and join the Philadelphia 76ers.
As a young European player, many fans don't know him very well, but through this Olympic Games, I believe that Saric's performance has left a deep impression on people.
In Croatia's narrow win over Spain in the last game, Saric managed to block Pau Gasol in the final minute as he tried to drag the game into overtime.
Recently, 76ers coach Brett Brown gave Saric a high rating, and the Spurs coach believes he saw the shadow of Manu Ginobili in his youth.
It's clear that Saric has shown his talent and has the 76ers looking forward to him.
In Croatia's first two games at the Olympics, Saric had 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Saric showed his ability to open up space on the court, and after blocking with his teammates, he was able to shoot from beyond the three-point line.
Although the 76ers currently have a lot of talented young players on the inside, they don't have Saric's outside ability.
From blocks to long passes and assists, there are only a handful of interior players in the NBA today who can do that.
Since the start of the Games, Saric has averaged 13 points, eight rebounds and five assists per game in three games.
Since deciding to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014, James has signed two consecutive 1+1 contracts.
As the NBA's collective bargaining agreement enters its final year, James will be at the forefront of collective bargaining negotiations as vice president of the NBA's players' union.
Given the massive rise in league revenues, thanks to new television deals and a battle between owners and players over what to do with the money, there are fears that the NBA will come to a halt next summer.
But for James, he doesn't have to worry about becoming a free agent next summer because he has signed a three-year contract extension with the Cavaliers.
Regardless of when the 2017-18 season officially began, James was under contract.
Since the stunning debut of iPhoneSE, the mobile phone market has also ushered in a boom in small screen phones.
Not long ago, Nubia also launched the first part of its Z11 series: nubiaZ11mini.
The nubiaZ11mini continues its consistent excellent photo genes, and is equipped with a 5.0-inch screen that is easier to hold with one hand, and a convenient and easy-to-use rear fingerprint recognition, which makes it an outstanding user experience.
nubia's just-launched small-screen camera phone Z11mini has been reduced by 200 yuan, that is, from the original 1499 yuan to 1299 yuan.
In terms of appearance, nubiaZ11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen, and the lower front is still the classic "small red circle" design.
The middle frame is made of metal, and the bottom is symmetrical and equipped with a Type-C data interface.
The future of the Portland smelter is fraught with uncertainty due to the cancellation of the power supply contract
The Portland Aluminium Smelter in Victoria, along with hundreds of workers at the plant, is currently facing an uncertain future after the power company that powers the plant revealed that a plant owner would terminate a supply contract, invalidating all supply contracts.
This move comes after the Victorian government decided not to continue with subsidies to guarantee the operation of the plant.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will expire in November.
Alcoa's Portland plant of 2,000 workers could face losing their jobs.
Once the factory is closed, up to 2,000 people could lose their jobs, either directly or indirectly.
And since the plant accounts for about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity output, there could be a ripple effect.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down the Hanrui Point smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesey Island power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is currently losing money and is at risk of closure.
The move follows forecasts for the next few years at the plant, initially due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar and more recently because of the price of the plant's products.
AGL is powering the large aluminium smelter through the Laoe Eyan Power Plant in the Latrobe Valley. The company predicts that three other plant owners will also terminate their agreements.
The plant's largest shareholder is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, while China's CITIC Group and Japan's Marubeni Corp. also hold minority shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, meaning the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand," the joint venture said. ”
AGL said the contracts were "hedging contracts" that were supposed to be in effect from November 2016.
The termination period of the contracts is 12 months, so they will be terminated in 2017.
"As a result, AGL still expects these contracts to continue to generate revenue in FY2017," the utility said. ”
Any potential revenue impact on AGL from FY2018 onwards is currently driven by the futures market's optimistic outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had written down $187 million of the contract value in "end-of-life expectations".
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "will not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the smelter or guarantee the smelter's power supply."
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with Mr. Eyan in 2010 that was supposed to take effect in November, but it did not explain why it was withdrawing from the contract.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle will close due to the industry's dire economic situation.
In response to analysts' comments earlier this week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mickelson, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and the Tomago plant reaches about 900 megawatts.
If two plants are closed, the demand in the electricity market will be greatly reduced.
"As an electric company, this is not good news for us," he said.
Community legal centres turn 160,000 people out each year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people are turned away from community legal centres each year. Funding for this service, which was already stretched thin, is now facing further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of every five people are denied access to free legal advice and representation, most of whom are the elderly, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and people who do not have the resources to fight unjust evictions.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limit and is now facing further funding cuts.
Starting next June, federal funding for these legal centres will be reduced by another 30 per cent.
James Farrell, head of the Community Law Centre in Queensland, said thousands of people are being turned away each year, according to the latest National Community Association Law Centre survey.
Mr. Farrell said the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change its existing decision.
"Queensland's Community Law Centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people will not be able to access the vital services they need," he said. ”
People who need to stay away from violence, people who are burdened with huge debts that cannot be repaid, families facing disintegration, and workers who are being oppressed all face legal problems, and the report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by a further 30% from June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable people in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Minister for Justice and Queensland MP George Brandeis to immediately reverse these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when they face legal issues.
Last year, the state government pledged to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
Attention must now be paid to the needs of the community legal centres and their corresponding communities, and the government must be committed to this important work.
The Donald Trump campaign has been indicted over staff pulling guns
NEW YORK: Trump's campaign has been indicted for inaction after the head of Northern California pulled out a gun while driving a jeep in February.
Vincent Bodini, a former software trainer for the state's campaign team, described the incident in a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bodini said he had hoped the matter would be resolved internally, but after months of waiting he realized "it couldn't happen".
According to Bodini's account, the chief, Earl Philip, "drew a pistol, placed his right index finger on the plate, and aimed the muzzle at Vincent's kneecap." ”
After complaining to the leadership of the local and regional campaign teams, Bodini learned from the file that at least four other people had experienced the same thing.
In his complaint, Bodini said: "Just because you didn't shoot doesn't mean you won't be hurt. ”
The case came just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked outrage in North Carolina by telling the crowd that if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was elected and her favorite judge was selected and her favorite judge was chosen, "Second Amendment supporters" — gun owners and gun enthusiasts — might take action.
Mr. Trump's campaign said the media took his words out of context and that he was not advocating violence.
In his complaint, Bodini demanded compensation from the campaign for his negligence, while also seeking compensation from Philip for his assaults, beatings and mental injuries.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to this information.
Unable to reach Philip.
According to WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte, Philip recently left the campaign.
His consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, did not respond immediately to the call.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been fraught with controversy.
The parties to this case are Bodini v. Trump Presidential Campaign Inc., 16-CS-14300, Ordinary Court of the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County (Charlotte).
Britain must pass on the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring vibrancy and prosperity to our communities, London and the country as a whole.
For me, that's the beauty of Heathrow, as at London 2012, when we did everything we could to make sure our country and region benefited from these events.
The Olympics have benefited Stratford and the East End.
And we will once again benefit the region by creating opportunities for local people and businesses around Heathrow.
In our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and lift young people out of unemployment around the airport.
As in the run-up to the London 2012 Olympics, some felt Heathrow's expansion was too big.
I was told that Britain would not be ready for the Olympics and that we would be disgraced in front of the whole world.
Skeptics were wrong about the 2012 Olympics and their doubts about Heathrow will prove wrong.
While there will always be obstacles that need to be overcome, Heathrow is tackling every problem faced.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not the few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs and generate £211 billion in economic growth, leaving a legacy of technology and jobs around the airport and across the UK.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team. The team has completed £11 billion in infrastructure investment projects on time and within budget, including Terminal 5, voted the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years, and Terminal 2, located between two of the world's busiest runways.
Now, they are ready to build a third runway with £16 billion of private investment.
The UK successfully hosted the London 2012 Olympics and I am confident that the Heathrow expansion project will be a great success.
Now is the time for us to deliver on the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow so we can secure our future and create a wealth of technology and jobs that the UK can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton is Chairman of the Board of Directors of Heathrow Airport and a former Commercial Counsellor at HM Treasury
A woman committed suicide on a Swiss highway and was run over to her death
The victim lay on the highway at midnight.
The woman, who attempted suicide, was run over by multiple cars on the highway early Thursday morning. Police are currently looking for witnesses.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud in the early hours of Thursday.
Vaud police said a woman was lying on the road "in despair" in the middle of the night and was run over by multiple vehicles.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who acted with clear suicidal intent. She was run over by multiple vehicles, including a van.
The woman died instantly.
Police revealed that a number of drivers involved have been investigated, but some of the drivers have not yet been identified. At present, the police are calling for them, as well as witnesses of the accident, to come and be investigated.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstedtle told the Geneva Tribune that a criminal investigation has now been opened and is part of the regular process in such cases.
However, it is not known whether any drivers will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid a collision?
"It will be up to the prosecutor to determine," Hofstedtl said.
Based on the results of two other similar cases in the past five years, the driver will not be held liable.
According to the newspaper, both cases were caused by someone taking onto the highway in the middle of the night. The final verdict was that the driver could not have expected a pedestrian crossing the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with negligence causing death in August 2014 when she hit and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Payanne.
The court was informed that the 22-year-old victim had crossed the road after drinking alcohol.
After an investigation, the judge said that the policewoman's driving behavior at the time was completely legal, and that the man's appearance on the road was "completely accidental and unforeseen" and that the policewoman had called the emergency number afterwards.
Anyone who can provide information about the accident near Morges on Thursday should contact the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model that explores Venus's past, using tools and algorithms very similar to those used by climate scientists.
This model is used to determine whether Venus, which has a hot surface, no water, and an atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, has ever had an environment similar to Earth.
Previously, scientists thought that Venus's slower rotation was due to its thicker atmosphere.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus may have had a thinner, Earth-like atmosphere at one time, and that its rotation was similarly slower at the time.
The model also shows the early topography of Venus.
Venus may have more dry regions than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographic change to nurture life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the sunlight shining on Venus was 30% dimmer than on Earth.
Anthony del Genio, a scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, explained at a press conference: "In the model simulations of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the slow rotation of Venus makes one side of the day last for almost two months. ”
This warms the surface and produces rain that forms thick clouds that act like an umbrella to block most of the sun's heat from the ground.
The results of the simulations showed that the average climate temperature of Venus was actually a few degrees lower than that of the Earth today.
The model simulates the evolution of Venus similar to what previous planetary scientists had speculated.
Although life may have existed on Venus, it has been exposed to excessive temperatures and ultraviolet rays over the course of billions of years.
The planet's oceans evaporate, and water vapor is burned out by ultraviolet rays.
As hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thicker atmosphere of carbon dioxide and deadly greenhouse gas effects, thus forming the planet we know today.
The researchers published the simulation results of a new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy has resigned as head coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy, who stepped down as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey team on Thursday, said he had no say in the team's decision-making level.
Colorado Executive Vice President Joe Sachis confirmed the news and said the club will immediately begin the search for a new head coach.
"Over the past three years, I have performed my duties as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement. ”
I've spent the summer thinking about how I can improve this team and make it ready to take it to the next level.
To do this, the goals of the head coach and vice president must be aligned with those of the club.
He must also have a say in the decisions that affect the team's performance.
But at present, these conditions have not been met.
Sachis hired Roy on May 23, 2013, and he thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sachis said. ”
We would like to thank him for his contribution to the club and wish him all the best in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach in the league in his debut season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He helped the club to 112 points, which placed first in the Central Division. However, Colorado was eliminated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the playoffs in the last two years.
In the 2015-16 season, the Avalanche had a record of 39 wins, 39 draws and 4 losses, and finally lost their second wild card in the Western Conference Division by 5 points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy has won four Stanley Cups, two each for the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oilfield workers stopped striking and continued negotiations
The chief negotiator said that workers in the North Sea oil fields stopped their strike over pay, and the parties to the dispute began a new round of negotiations.
There have been a number of strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group on the North Sea oil platform operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement, "The Wood Group, along with the Unite and RMT unions, can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process for the current dispute." ”
We will be revisiting these issues with a number of full-day sessions starting early next week and coming weeks.
The union said its recent action was to protest the possibility of a pay cut of up to 30 per cent, the first time in 25 years.
Wood Group has reduced the compensation of North Sea contractors by about 9% this year due to market pressures.
The cut follows a 10% reduction in the pay of offshore contractors in 2014.
The company said another pay cut would help it weather the market downturn.
Shell has laid off thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries as it needs to streamline its operations following a merger with British energy company British Gas Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices and the UK's Brexit decision in June.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute of our generation in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that serves the many, not the few," Dave said in a statement. ”
In 2016, spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to be no more than US$1.4 billion, compared to an average of about US$7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of the stars of the Pleiades star cluster
The Kepler Space Telescope's latest mission has helped astronomers capture the most complete sequence of star rotation velocities in the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the cluster's stars have different rotation speeds and how the rotation period correlates with the composition of the planets.
Lusa Rabre, a research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said at a press conference: "We hope to better understand the relationship between star mass, age, and even the history of the solar system by comparing our results with other star clusters. ”
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are still in their adult stages.
They reach the highest rotation speed in their lifetime.
At their maximum rotation speed, these mature stars emit a large number of stellar winds.
When these stellar winds pass through the star's magnetic field, they act as a brake on the star.
As the age of the star increases, its rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measured the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time of the appearance of recognizable star sunspots, such as sunspots.
The latest dataset of rotational velocity indicates that the rotation speed of the more massive stars is slower than that of the less massive stars.
Rabul likens the stars to dancers, with larger dancers spinning slower than smaller dancers.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades star cluster, we found that stars with slower rotation tend to be more massive, while those with the fastest rotation tend to be the lightest," Rabul said. ”
Due to the close proximity of the Pleiades star cluster, it can be used as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the mass of stars with their rotation speed.
"The Pleiades star cluster lays the foundation for a theoretical model of bidirectional rotation of young and old stars," Rabul said. ”
There's still a lot to know about how, when, and why stars slow down their rotation and "put away their dancing shoes."
In three new papers, Rabre and her colleagues elaborate on their latest analysis of the rotation speed of the Pleiades. The three papers will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
Zheng Jianjun, head of the water management section of Nanhu Park, said that the deepest depth of the water in Nanhu Lake is more than 10 meters, and those who do not understand the water are likely to be in danger.
"Although the South Lake Rescue Team is very professional, we still hope that the majority of boating tourists can wear life jackets, do not do illegal actions on the lake, and play safely. Zheng Jianjun said.
Weitou Village is blessed with a unique marine environment and has two major leisure tourism resources: natural ecology and humanistic ecology.
"However, individual owners who have purchased parking spaces in the community are afraid that this will affect the rental price of their parking spaces, and they also suspect that others have selfish intentions, so they have been sabotaging behind their backs, resulting in the renovation of parking spaces being shelved. ”
There are still many opinions on the question of when and by whom sweet potatoes were introduced.
In the current mainstream view, there are three main routes for the introduction of sweet potatoes.
Among the three routes introduced by sweet potatoes, the most influential and widespread is Chen Zhenlong's introduction from the Philippines to Fuzhou.
From now on, the Beijing Municipal Office for the Administration of Social Organizations will carry out special inspections on the use of uniform receipts for social organizations' membership dues.
The inspection is divided into two types: unit self-inspection and key spot check.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Municipal Community Office, the scope of this inspection includes social groups that received unified receipts for social group dues in the Municipal Community Office from 2013 to 2015.
In its 2012 Olympic communication strategy, the Rio Organising Committee said: "The success of the Olympic Games is defined by the people who share their stories on social media." ”
Judging from the coverage of this Olympic Games, the media have made great changes in many aspects such as communication methods, product forms, language styles, and news perspectives.
The IOC and media professionals around the world seem to be ready for this round of challenges.
On August 11, the public offering of H shares of Everbright Securities entered its final day. It was reported that the market reaction was flat two days before the IPO. According to the plan, it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18.
An analyst at a domestic brokerage firm said that Orient Securities' foundation in Hong Kong is not good, and its asset management business is the director of the Orient Securities Exchange. Compared with Bank of China International, CITIC Securities and other banking brokerages, it is congenitally insufficient.
Experts pointed out that since the beginning of this year, with the return of the securities market to flat, the performance of many brokerages has declined, but the situation after the company is listed depends more on the development of the company's own business, and cannot be generalized.
After the introduction of this new policy, Suzhou will become the first second-tier city in the country to restart purchase restrictions.
The second-tier cities that have introduced or are about to introduce property market control policies are not only Suzhou, but also include Hefei, Nanjing and other cities.
Previously, Hefei has taken the lead in issuing a loan restriction policy, for buyers who have two houses in Hefei and have a housing loan outstanding, the bank will refuse to provide housing loan services.
