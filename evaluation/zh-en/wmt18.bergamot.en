Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
Because of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the American Association for the Advancement of Color of Color is issuing a travel warning to people of color who are preparing to travel to Missouri.
"The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which took effect on August 28, 2017, called for a series of suspected racial incidents in Missouri, where all African-American travelers, tourists, and Missourians should pay special attention and take an extremely cautious attitude when traveling in Missouri, and hereby inform the Araldom group's statement of the statement.
NAACP points out that a recent Missouri law that has passed makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, and the state's enforcement has also targeted minorities to some extent, a phenomenon that prompted the group to issue travel warnings.
Violations of civil rights are happening to people.
They were parked cross-exposed for their skin, and were beaten or killed by the ACP president of the ACP, of Missouri, told The Kansas City Star.
"We have received a lot of complaints, the number is unprecedented."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization in the United States against a state.
The group cited the racial smear of the University of Missouri against black students and the death of Tolie Sanders, a 28-year-old black Tennessee-based man.
Earlier this year, Sanders died in suspicious circumstances. He ran out of fuel while traveling in Missouri and was detained by Missouri police without charge for a crime.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showed that "the likelihood of black drivers in the state being parked for a carteer is 75% higher than that of whites."
“The consultation was to raise awareness and warn their family, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri, ” Zabbee said.
"People need to be prepared, whether it's carrying bail to travel to Missouri or for relatives to know that they are traveling within the state."
According to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; the state ranks 16th in the nation under the number of crimes.
The travel warning is also a response to the new law in Missouri that would make it harder to sue housing or jobs to discriminate against businesses.
Previously, U.S. states passed immigration enforcement laws that require local law enforcement to detain immigration violators, a move that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said would increase the number of race lawsuits and issued travel counseling for Texas and Arizona.
The travel warning is usually issued by the U.S. government against other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have taken this approach in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
After the "golden age" of the box office surge in 2015, the overall film market entered a cooling-off period in 2016, and whether it can break the total box office performance of last year's 440.69 billion yuan has become a suspense.
According to the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, in October, the prices of new and second-hand houses in Beijing both cooled, rising only 0.6% and 1.1% year-on-year.

BBC says Beijing is the most exciting city: to make foreign guests feel 'living in a new era'
Beijing may have a long history of three thousand years, but it is also rapidly changing into today's modern charm city.
The Chinese capital, which has an amazingly high-speed Internet, has cutting-edge technologies such as face recognition software, has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has unrivalled international energy, which is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners who explore the spirit of exploration.
According to the BBC's website on January 16th, the German expat Clemens Sehi said: "If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere else." He quoted singer Frank Sinatra as singing the lyrics of New York City.
Sehi, who works as creative director of Traveler Archives, said: "If Sinatra lived to this day, he would probably be able to sing about cities like Beijing," he said, adding that living in the city will make you feel "life in the new era and always keep up with the trend."
Simon Norton, who is based in England but recently lives in Beijing, published an article on the personal blog website 4Corners7Seas, saying: "People generally have a feeling of being at the center of something big, which is hard to say, but it makes it possible for many foreigners to stay there for a long time.
The city ’ s high-quality, high-speed internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever.
Andy Penha Fuert, who is currently serving as a deputy editor-in-chief of the Beijing Children's website in Manila, said: "Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society, and the Internet is integrating the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions."
But smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing ’ s tech ambitions, facial recognition software has become popular, and many mobile phone apps use it to bank transfers and payments, get people into apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of ride-hailing drivers.
Beijing also recently announced plans to spend RMB138 billion to build an artificial intelligence technology park, where more than 400 companies will be settled, and they will focus on developing various artificial intelligence technologies from bioassay to self-driving cars.
Food is also at the heart of many major festivals in China's calendar years. Participation in these celebrations is respected by foreigners, the Spring Festival is the most important social and economic festival, and it is also one of the easiest festivals for foreigners to participate.
"I suggest that I help Chinese friends prepare for the New Year, clean the apartment and put a red Spring Union with New Year's greetings at the home. On New Year's Eve, all family members will have to gather for a hearty meal together, and then watch the New Year's birthday until midnight and greet the New Year with a loud fireworks. For foreigners, it is indeed an opportunity to integrate with friends and family."
Beijing ’ s large number of foreigners is growing, but language barriers in China and the ease of communication between expats can easily be an excuse for them not to fully integrate into local culture.
"Some foreigners have been living in China for many years, but have little experience for their host country. If your initial attempt at Chinese people is not successful, then it's easy to have or how easy it feels to be with other foreigners."
In these so-called "foreign bubbles" ("Old foreign bubble" refers to foreigners only mixing among foreigners, without contact with locals and local cultural translators, foreigners in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only foreigners in friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin as much easier than people might think.
"A private Chinese lesson or an entry-level radio drama in the first two hours of the first two hours a week should be a busy schedule for everyone," Sechy said.
Even a few classic phrases can help with shopping, order meals in a restaurant, or small talk in a taxi.
Instrinsic air pollution is also a fact of everyday life, but in recent years, the government has made efforts to curb some problems.
Residents stressed the importance of outdoor activities in warmer months with less pollution, as a chance to roam the historic alleys or explore popular Japanese parks.
"Beijing is a Chinese city that can find the most things on the surface, and you can find very good art and music activities, indulgence nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business areas and ancient hutongs."
According to the report, the impact of aging on human capital growth is becoming more and more obvious, especially in the northeast, where the annual contribution of aging to human capital growth is -1.28%.
Pan Gongsheng pointed out that at present, the risk of cross-border capital flows is controllable, and the fundamental factors supporting the balance of payments balance still exist for a long time.
BEIJING, Dec 17th (Reporter Gao Kai) The World's Bright Plan for the Remarking and Restoration of Ancient Chinese Paintings and the International Summit Forum opened on December 17th at Renmin University of China on December 17th.
In April, the European Commission accused Google of forcing mobile phone makers to pre-install software such as Google Search and Chrome, otherwise it would not allow it to use other Google apps.
The European Commission believes the move is detrimental to the interests of consumers and hinders competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
If convicted of antitrust charges, Google faces a fine of about $74 billion in its global revenue of 10 percent.
Google has not immediately commented on this.
Google is also facing EU surveys for biasing itself in search results.
Zhang Yuning's stay in the ocean is solid, it can be said that he achieved the "jump level" from the national youth to the national Olympic is not accidental, and the magnitude of his leap to grow is still surprising.
A chart to understand: Bitcoin's legal status around the world
Abstract: In addition to the price correction triggered by the natural properties of speculative properties, the tragic decline of this round of digital currency is also not unrelated to the risk of supervision of the enemy of the enemy.
From the visual map, the attitude of the Eastern countries towards Bitcoin is more conservative than the West, and the countries that occupy the world's main body are still waiting for the legitimacy of digital currency, which means that the "black swan risk" is still very large.

With the regulatory storm in major bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union, the global digital currency led by bitcoin has been bloody washed this week, and the price of bitcoin fell below the psychological level of $1m on Tuesday, and its biggest one-day decline in three years.
In addition to the price correction triggered by the natural properties of speculative properties, the tragic decline of this round of digital currency has also not been unrelated to the regulatory risk of the long-standing "Over the Sea enemy".
At this important juncture, visual big data site HowMuch.net has produced a map that demonstrates Bitcoin's legitimacy and regulation in countries around the world.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legal market of Bitcoin; orange represents the neutral market, although it has not yet been publicly legalized Bitcoin status, but there is no major use restriction; light pink represents a restricted market, that is, the local government tries to use the digital currency through red-red line policy or regulation; the dark-pink color is defined as illegal countries on behalf of Bitcoin; and gray is a country that has not yet commented.
(Photo from HowMuch.Net visualization team on November 15th)
The article pointed out that it can be seen from the distribution of green color blocks in the middle of the picture, and the attitude of the Eastern countries in the traditional sense towards Bitcoin is more conservative than the West.
Russia is currently the largest country that defines Bitcoin as the largest illegal country, and China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin, and India has no comment on Bitcoin and has not yet issued relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are more concentrated in the regions with the highest acceptance of Bitcoin, the distribution of green blocks.
The views of Bitcoin in the Middle East and Latin America are clearly differentiated, and the distribution of color blocks in these regions is more mixed.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are legal bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and other countries have a certain degree of restrictions on their transactions and use, and more Latin American countries have not spoken out on Bitcoin.
In the light of the above data, in a total of 99 countries (or 40%) of the 246 countries in the world, there are no restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin, that is, the green and orange-yellow areas.
Seven countries (or 3%) are constrained markets (light pink), 10 countries (or 4%) define Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or more than 53%) have not yet more treatment of digital currency information (grey).
This shows that countries that account for global entities (53%, more than half) are still waiting for the legitimacy of the digital currency led by Bitcoin, and also represents the "black swan risk" of Bitcoin.
The article believes that global regulators do not fully understand the emerging category of digital currencies, and may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made statements.
Although Bitcoin's "popland" has grown exponentially since last year does not represent interest in all countries, and some countries may be concerned that local fiat currencies are under threat as a result, or more worried about digital currencies being exploited by criminal organizations.
Wall Street has written a detailed summary of the international regulatory news against Bitcoin since last week, including China's start to crack down on the OTC exchanges' centralized online platforms and mobile apps, South Korea is still considering closing digital currency exchanges, the EU believes that bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warned investors to "lost the risk of losing blood."
Wall Street News Editor-in-Chief's Selected "Reading News | 2018: The Global Central Mother Opens the Year of Digital Currency?" has mentioned that from the perspective of regulation, acceptance / criticism, and adoption, 2018 will become the first year of digital currency for global central banks.
Russia and other major powers have criticized Bitcoin's legitimacy, which is actually to give way to the official issuance of digital currency.
Xinhua News Agency MADRID, November 8th (Reporter Xie Yuzhi) Barcelona's new aid Coutinho debuted on the 8th in the Nou Camp Barca jersey.
Coutinho passed a medical examination from Barca that morning and signed with Barca's president, Bartomeu, on a contract that would expire in the summer of 2023.

Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The most certain sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statue.
The Americans agree with this, just as anyone else. So, in 2003, Saddam Hussein of Baghdad's Paradise Square? was orchestrated toppled.
Stephen Miller, one of the key think tanks in the Trump administration, was in a heated debate with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposal to severely limit legal immigration, and he certainly knew what would happen to him about a symbolic axe for the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, then a group of cruise owners and liberal followers would surely have swallowed him alive.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was engraved on the pedestal in 1903 (the monument was built in the following 17 years).
As Miller rebuked Acosta for saying: "I don't want to talk about the whole fact of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is like a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world...
The poem you were referring to, which was added later, was not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
In fact, Miller is right, but as he said, it's not really about history.
This involves a modern echo of the Lazarusest, the only one that seems to invite not only any old immigrant, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your weary, your poverty, or your crowding people are eager to breathe freely, / The people who are suffering refuse to be crowded on your crowded beaches."
There is no "suffering people refusing" in our screens to become a glaring moment.
Miller did not work on literary criticism, and he made it clear that these people would not be welcomed in the Trump-era America.
This conflict about the significance of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it's actually a clash with American spirit.
Lazarus, as well as her friends who, at an event she and at the event after her death, engraved her verses on the pedestal, well aware that the behaviour they were involved in was highly political.
The purpose of the sculpture is to express the connection between French and American republicanism through the ancient classics of the Statue of the Lady of Liberty as the female incarnation of the Statue of
Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem, the female image is no longer abstract, she wants to speak out.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of exile.
The combination of this poem with the painting was a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to American nativism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers have always wanted to change it back to their original meaning.
The great speaker Rush Limbaugh, a mowasher of Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, and that he was now an early neoconservative who brought America's intellectual flame to the world of ignorance: "The Statue of Liberty is brave."
She intended to bring the torch of freedom from America to the rest of the world.
The torch is not the way to illuminate America. ”
Unusually, Limbeau was actually moved by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive perspective.
Lazarus's extremely imaginative approach is to be able to see it. When the weary, poor but hopeful people will be able to see it on the deck after a long, often terrifying journey.
On the face of it, it involves people who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives see the world from the perspective of people.
Her statues convey to them and need the hope and welcome they hear.
Of course, that's not the point Miller and Trump had wanted to admit.
Their torches are not meant to illuminate the road, but to light the hatred of their only source of strength.

2017 World Championships: Neil Black highly praises Scotland players in the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle recalled that the British national team had only two Scots at the time.
Neil Black, executive director of the British Athletics Association, said the squad of 16 strong Scots in the world championships group would make a huge contribution to the national team.
The number of Scottish field athletes selected to take part in the 2017 London Athletics World Championships, which opened on Friday, was the most in history.
Black believes that "Scotland is making extraordinary developments and that British track and field athletes must learn from."
"We accept and manage to understand that, and we'll stick with it until we're going to be successful," Black said.
"I'm looking for people at the Scottish Sports Academy to talk. They think it's about theirs as it does.
Scottish track and field athletes think it's related to theirs.
The British Athletics Association believes it is related to their actions.
Even the street people think so.
Whatever the situation, it's extremely brilliant. "
Multiple Scottish track and field athletes are medalists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be at 5,000m with Mo Farah, while Eilidh Joydoyle has been picked up as captains in the group.
“Arid is a bit humble.
Her captain's speech was unbelievable, Blake said.
"Many track and field athletes, whether they are Scottish or wherever they live or train, are proud to walk out of the door and energetically out of the door.
The passion and true feelings of Reed naturally put in is very good. ”
The Commonwealth silver medalist who will take part in the 400m hurdles competition at his fifth World Championships said there were 16 Scots in the UK national team, which was "an incredible drasmy draped in."
Previously, the number of Scottish track and field athletes taking part in the World Series was the maximum of seven, which was the number of participants in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-running runner Muir is a leading figure, setting her five British records and two European records in the past year.
She will compete in the 1500m and 5000m project competitions.
Chris O'Hare, who took part in the 1500m event, was another Scottish player who deserved attention, before she had a good result in the season, winning the British national pair of qualifiers and the Olympic anniversaries, respectively.
Doyle recalled her for the first world championship, when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was proud that so many of her compatriots not only joined the team, but in some cases, they would also challenge medals to compete for the final.
"What's special about being captain of the national team is that it was voted for by the rest of the national team. So knowing that your team-mates voted for you to go to a very unusual achievement, anyway, it's a great honour for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scottish players.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are all veteran track and field athletes here, and the track and field athletes who are about to enter the purpose of the podium.
How was my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's great.
I just refer to the fact that in this case we are very lucky because we are holding the World Championships at home.
That's why it's really important that we're growing with home support and our return to the Olympic Stadium.
I'm going to get a second chance to play, and the atmosphere there will be a wonderful one. "

Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for office if you can't stand voter blame
Our founding fathers understand the style of bad media.
The Americans loved Washington, but it wasn't long before the major newspapers began to slam lash out at everything he did, from domestic policy to political principles.
He was annoyed with these criticisms, no doubt.
But he did not silence those critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech is deprived of the Ramadan, we will be slaughtered in silence and ignorance like the Lamb."
It made me think of Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needed to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people as they posted their views on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff found the lawsuit so sloping, and online reporting was full of their strong revolts: "Who cares .
A lot of people say, "It's just Facebook."
But, it's important.
This is especially important because in the face of people like Hogan.
It's a Republican who is governor in a democraticallymajority-majority state, and he's also surprisingly popular.
Of the country's 50 governors, he was given second.
Hogan is not a reactionary impetuous.
He was in a smooth run of Maryland and strictly followed the rules.
He's also very good at using Facebook as the primary way to connect with voters, jokingly showing his baldness after chemotherapy for the first time on the homepage.
So it's completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people who come to the governor's home page to comment. This homepage is a public forum, the official management platform advertised by the public's tax-paying staff.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman Amelia Shas defended the governor's actions, saying she thought blocking their comments were nothing more than wanting them to be restrained.
But they overslope it as a flood beast or cynic who swept the web.
The Washington Post has spoken face-to-face with people blocked by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their chosen leaders: their identity as teachers, small business owners, and priests, and not a flood beast.
They have expressed their comments that they have deep, respect, and do not fall.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakhimi Salma Ramani, a barrister in Bowie, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked questions about hate crimes.
She wrote in the News Story Review section of The Washington Post, "I'm polite commenting that I'm very polite commenting that I'm expressing disappointment that he hasn't responded to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also don ’ t like a bunch of people comment on the same topic, because these people are directly ignored by some people, thinking that they ’ re so-called introscise, rather than treating them as citizens who are worried about the country. ”
What the governor's clerk called "intensive spam bombing" may seem to others to "insert the claim to be..."
The Facebook era has made it easy to change a piece of information, and it only requires a critic to block or delete a negative comment.
And it's been much cleaner than it used to be, and the same effect in the past era requires sending staff to go out and burn out newspapers with critical speech or arrest or silence protesters.
But that's really what's happening right now, it's just on the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for silencing others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users because he blocked them on Twitter.
A landmark ruling emerged last week in Virginia about such issues.
According to U.S.-based district judge James C. C.C., the lawsuit of the Lauden County Oversight Committee to block voters from her Facebook page violates the First Amendment.
Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) was also patronized by the American Civil Liberties Union for its use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the internet have similar influence.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and there were also anonymous letters lauding to criticize his leadership.
And even at that time, Washington had anonymous flood beasts against him.
People used pseudonyms such as Yuricra, Valeryus, Bailey Sarai, and Podius to write to newspapers to criticize Washington's decision-making.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper online project, his office was inundated with petitions, all criticising his attitude on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Maritime Affairs with the United States of America by His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of dissent and freedom of speech are the foundation of this country.
And true leaders need to accept that.
A glimmer of wind in the property market has touched people's sensitive nerves.
Restriction is a hard bar for real estate regulation and control policies in many cities.
In May 2017, Jinan introduced regulations that undergraduates can enjoy the same purchase policy for local permanent residents for half a year;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that requires college students to settle down with a graduation certificate and employment certificate within three years of graduation.
Then the policy is increased, the official said, "College students can buy a house less than 20% of the market price";
In July, Chengdu introduced regulations that young talents with bachelor's degrees and above in foreign universities can apply for settlement in Chengdu with a graduation certificate.
In addition, cities or regions such as Kunshan and Shanghai Lingang have also introduced policies related to the introduction of "talent in talent", which has lowered the threshold for talent to buy a house.
Zhang Hongwei believes that this is actually the competition of major cities for the population, especially talents, and the retention of the population, especially talents, and the city is competitive, which is the most important significance of these real estate policies.
Some people even believe that this means that the time has come for the "restriction" of the property market to be cancelled.

It's the best stage to show off this stadium. "
The Englishman Ils is looking forward to defending for the first time, although in his 32-year career he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
The Southport athlete said: "It's really special.
I didn't defend the Estre Madura Open because the second year I won, the game was cancelled.
It's amazing to come to this place,
It's wonderful to play golf here.
The memories of last year came one by one, for me and my wife Sharon, and last year's win had a special meaning for us.
That's a special memory, and we'll remember it forever. "
Returning to the home country was Gary Or, who had just turned 50 years old earlier this year and then also on the European Evergreen Tour.
This is his first time playing in Scotland since the 2013 Scottish Golf Open.
Helensberger Ol said: "There will always be more meaning in the homecoming game,
You want to do it well; but you can feel the extra pressure.
To be able to play again I really enjoyed, I've been playing golf.
I am very satisfied with the current situation. ”
Joining the in-field trio is ex- Masters winners Ian Wosnan and Evergreen winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McIntiti.

Zou Shoumin, director of the Environmental Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, introduced in Beijing on the 22nd that in August, a total of 57 cases of continuous daily punishment were implemented throughout the country, and the newly revised Environmental Protection Law implemented at the beginning of this year significantly increased China's environmental law enforcement.

Poverty and Death in Jinzhou, Indonesia
Badtingna Dai Jie doesn't use the stove when he cooks.
She rarely uses pots.
Her cabins are located in Enarotali, the capital of Panai County, Papua, Indonesia, and the housewife usually just calls a sweet potato as a "nota" directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the charred sweet potato was taken out by a pair of unwashed hands and gorged up to eat.
Dai Jie sat on the mud on the land as she had no furniture, and it was also the place where she did daily household chores, such as washing clothes, and the water that was washed was very cloudy, and it was brought from the nearby marshes.
A bucket in a room without a roof, and that's the outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she wasn't given the place to be taken care of.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it would be dangerous to work late: most of the men in the village don't have jobs, and many are drunk, plus there are a lot of soldiers here.
She said, "No one dares to walk around the village after 5pm."
It was a rare glimpse of everyday life in the Papua Highlands, which was once a colony of the Netherlands, incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, but that referendum was also controversial, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote by holding hands in front of the army that occupied the area.
The current campaign, which is a strong demand for independence and Dutch rule, will soon point the finger at the Jakarta government, which has imposed repressive rule on the region and isolating foreign journalists and activists.
In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea took independent control of the island's east.
Enarotali is remote and deserted; to come here you need to take a 90-minute plane from the provincial council of Chayala to Nabire, and then rent a car for five hours and rummage across the stomach.
There is no public transport here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the wooden house is surrounded by bamboo fences, and the folded iron roof is a tawny cover made of rust.
Very few Indonesians have come, let alone journalists, and there are almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian Evangelist, the Mee Pago Papuas believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here too.
Dai Jie said, "We don't wear these clothes." She was referring to her brightly colored hand-knit turban, dark shirt and brightly dressed half-skid.
"We used to cover our bodies with only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and are also the region with the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But it is also the capital of Indonesia.
Parni Ai County is located in the Highlands, about the same size as New Jersey and has 153,000 people. The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Glasberg, is just 60 miles from here, and the gold mine is owned by the Phoenix-based Philip Mac Morlan Copperboarding Company.
In 2015 alone, Feipur mined about $31 billion worth of gold and copper mines here.
In addition, Papua's timber resources are abundant, estimated to be worth $7.8 billion.
Yet these abundant resources are also a source of tragedy for the Papuan people, and Indonesia's powerful military power has been able to suppress them.
A New York Times investigation report in 2005 showed that Lepo paid nearly $2 million to local military personnel and forces between 1998 and 2004, with a single official as high as $150,000.
The Papuan demands for independence have become more and more strong, which threatens the King, who have been subjected to cruel treatment.
More than half a million Papuans have been killed since 1969, according to rights activists, and thousands have been raped, tortured and held in custody by Indonesian forces.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killings in the Babuya tribal highlands in the 1970s have escalated into genocide.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year alone.
A 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, "We Will Los Everything" encapsulates proof of the evils of the previous year, such as extrajudicial killings, torture of another report that rape and electric escry are particularly prevalent and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
Andreas Halsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch, said, “Violence is happening every day, so it ’ s hard to count the number of victims. ”
Papua's resources have attracted a large number of immigrants outside of Indonesia, and the oppression begins.
83% of the province's 3.5 million people are Christians, but the demographic structure of Muslim economic migrants has changed since coming here from densely populated Java, Kalimantan, Sumatran, and Sulawisi.
The Javanese snack stalls are sold to the fried chicken and the vegetable blend of plus more, with peanut butter.
Locals struggle.
Twenty-four-year-old Panai local Apo Yu moved to the provincial capital Jayapura to find work, explaining that "those immigrants began selling chicken and vegetables at a lower price than the local Papuans in traditional markets.
This caused the local Papuan People's Jama-mama to lose their market. "
Indonesian President Joko Widodo (who often calls it Joko Widwig) has vowed to address the inequality and abuse of power in Papua at his 2014 campaign.
The former carpenter's road to the presidential palace in Jakarta has been supported by the sections of the 27 parts of the 29 regions, including Panai.
But nothing changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
“We ’ ve broken my heart, we voted for Jokowi in 2014, and he hopes he can fulfill our wishes and restore fairness. ”
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Panai suffered the worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotali sang Christmas acrysle in front of a bonfire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly rushed over on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to the local pastor Yavete Teby, one of the soldiers was unhappy with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said the drunken soldiers followed the children with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot the children.
Sixteen-year-old Yulenuns Yemmo was in a coma for being beaten badly.
Hours later, a burning fire at a nearby government commission building, the incident escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football stadium in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried the ceremonially used the gobling bow, dancing the Pabya Mee Pago tribe's waita dances to run around the circle and mimicking the birdsong.
Some protesters began throwing stones at military posts.
According to an official document seen by Time magazine, when emotions continued to inflame, soldiers received orders via internal radios: "If the crowd resists more than three times, it is immediately fired." But the document was not released to local media.
The 56-year-old Yeremies Kayamu, the chief of the Enarotali Kego Koto neighbourhood, felt the impending danger, so he called for the crowd to calm down and implored them to go home.
But no one was in the mood to hear him say it.
He stood on his brightly colored wooden porch and told Time magazine "When I turned back, my left wrist suddenly shot."
Kayamu still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he says the bullets come from among the soldiers gathered.
He added, "It was crowded, they fired a lot of guns."
According to the cousins of locals Orfweus Jule, he witnessed the shooting and saw Orfweus Jule three shots in his body.
Juhanes sadly told Time magazine, "I ran over to check his body to see if it was him,
I found he was dead... I kissed him. ”
Papua Police Chief Inspector Jujed Mendeh told reporters that his subordinates were only "protecting" the police station because the police station was attacked.
In 2015, the police spokesman for Papua Police, Commissioner Prigio Sulistio, said "when there are people who threaten to kill us, we must defend ourselves."
It's a matter of life and death. "
Five young protesters were killed and many more were injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
The next day news of the killing was slowly spread in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a speech in Chayala Pra who spoke deeply sympathizes with the families of the victims and vows to address the legacy of abuse of power in Papua's history.
He said, "I hope this case can be resolved as soon as possible, so that this will not happen again in the future."
In October 2016, Security Minister Vilanto said he was going to set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuse for pushing back was almost immediately blaring.
He said, "Most of the violations happened long ago."
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have worked to address these violations, but it still needs a process. ”
Then in Jakarta on June 5, when Vilando spoke in a conversation with Time magazine, he said he had no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be resolved in accordance with the law. ”
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Vilando over more than a thousand deaths in the 1999 bloody independence vote in East Timor, but said 11 human rights violations in the Papua region have been resolved, including the Panai incident.
The families of the victims of the Panai incident scorned these statements.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed at all."
Years later he said, "I'm tired."
He is still in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I was afraid of being arrested by the army, afraid of being shot. ”
His brother, E.com, also thought Panai's people were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
He said, "After the body was buried, the military came to me."
The shooting did not stop.
Indonesian police shot villagers in Deyy County, Panai, a Panai-side Prefecture, on Tuesday.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a coma man to the hospital. There was a clash between the two sides, with one death and 17 others injured, among them children.
The 24-year-old man, Lavianus Dow, drowned while fishing in a nearby river and died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's field office.
Police said villagers threw stones at police officers, so police fired warning shots.
But the riot-resistant mobile unit (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one person.
Twenty-nine-year-old Domingu Buddy told Time magazine that "we were all in a panic at the time and are now afraid they would retaliate." He lived near the hospital and witnessed the injured being rushed to the hospital.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Dea-i parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and the riot movement forces have been evacuated from the area.
Panai has always been a place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has grown the grievances of the people of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, which are scattered in the lush central highlands of Panixian.
Many people have joined the Free Papua (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by decentralization and raids to kidnap Indonesian soldiers.
Part of the liberal Papuan movement senior leaders were born in Panai, including Tadius Juji and Daniel Yodas Kogacia.
As a result, in recent years, thousands of Panais have been arrested and deliberately detained under the guise of "maintaining national sovereignty" by the military.
Some have never been seen again.
In the eyes of the Papuans, Panai is a "forgotten place of tragedy."
Poverty grows discontent.
Enarotali is selling for the poor rice that the locals simply can't afford.
The bread is not far away.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of women, and every woman can take care of four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually use most of the harvests as writers, and the rest is placed on the local market for sale.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has been pulled away in local Papuans and new immigrants, and the number of these migrants has increased significantly since the new route to Nabray airport has opened.
A small number of existing jobs usually fall into the hands of better-educated and wealthier immigrants.
The Papuans rarely have the funds or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
John Gobai, chairman of the Parne Ai Tribal Council, said: “Young people don ’ t want to stay in the village... because there ’ s no job here and no money. ”
Papua is isolated from the world.
In addition, the restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Askudi and Basel were expelled from Papua because they were "not cooperating with the relevant agencies, even though they had been rarely licensed for filming."
According to Eslain Kane, deputy chief of Asia at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's vow to rescind the reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not materialized.
In a statement, he said, “If foreign journalists try to cover the unhappy provinces of Papua and West Papua in Indonesia ’ s easternmost regions, they are at new risk: refusing visas and blacklisting. ”
The absence of media oversight means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's neighbors.
In March, the Six Pacific nations of Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands sent the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "all kinds of universal human rights violations" including the Panai shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alman Natata Nassir did not care about the group ’ s allegations, telling reporters in Jakarta that “Indonesia is still practicing democratic institutions and the freedom of the media, so the evidence of human rights violations is difficult to cover up. ”
Locals want more foreign governments to take care of.
According to a person familiar with the matter, on May 4, when Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights Keswan Bal led an official delegation to visit Jayapura, the local people broke their silence and begged that "we want to be free." He also attended that meeting, but requested anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council, said "Zhokovi's intentions are good, but he is surrounded by people who were involved in the Panai shooting."
He wanted Jokowi to know that the people of Panai lived not only under the threat of a greedy army, but had nothing, with little education in the region and a lack of public health care services.
Gobai said the Parnei people, like other Papuans, thought they had to vote for Jokowi's vote as a debt he had to pay for.
He said "they don't need the money, they need justice."
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Panai shooting made their last symbolic revolt: burying the bodies of a victim in the opposite side of the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let those to blame forget their crimes.
Eyccoms said with his head down and said, "My family was killed,
What can we do?

According to Reuters, Samsung Electronics on Tuesday released the first set of components for self-driving cars developed jointly with Harman International, as well as an infotainment solution, which is an important move for the company to enter the automotive electronics market.
Samsung Electronics acquired Harman International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week, Samsung issued an automotive camera with collision warning, lane offset warning, and cruise control, which was developed in collaboration with Harman.
Samsung plans to start shipping the camera system this year, which is built on technologies such as automatic machine learning and augmented reality.
Samsung also showed the "digital cockpit", even if the driver is not the owner, can make the vehicle more personalized, because the system allows users to download the driver's data from mobile devices and the cloud.

Fire engulfs Dubai' torch 'stable' skyscraper
On Friday, a fire broke out at a world-highest residential building in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the supertall building, which is 337 meters high-storey, 79-storey.
It's the second blaze that sweeps through a high-rise building in just two years, and it happens to happen to be a skyscraper known as the "Torch."
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported, and no cause of the blaze has been found.
"We were sleeping and then we were woken up by fire alarms and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and run down from the 50th floor for about 10 minutes, "a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said the fire was extinguished by the fire at around 4pm local time (Greenwich Mean Time) and was being cooled for the building.
The government has said it is working to provide shelter for those affected.
The accident could once again raise concerns around the world about the safety of the use of facade materials in high-rise buildings.
An investigation carried out by the "Torch" skyscraper management after its 2015 fire found that most of the objects damaged were cladding exterior panels for decorative and insulated.
British police have said they believe the issue of an insulating and overlay panel system at the Grenfell building in London could be responsible for the rapid spread of fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
Williams also hinted that Massa might return, though he has announced his retirement.
January 9th is only one month away from the opening of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea, and with the warm-up of the Olympic flame from south to north and the preparations, the atmosphere of the Winter Olympic Games in South Korea is becoming more and more intense.
South Korean public opinion expects this long-lost inter-Korean talks to bring a "colored egg" for the countdown to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
On November 1st last year, the Holy Fire of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics arrived in South Korea.
The boom set off by the flame is directly reflected in the ticket sales of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the ticket sales rate of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics only hovered around 32%, and the ticket sales rate of the Winter Paralympics was only 4.3%, and the low ticket sales rate once worried about the popularity of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
But as Li Xifan, chairman of the Organizing Committee of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, predicted to reporters not long ago, "With the passing of the flame of the Winter Olympics in all parts of South Korea, the heat of the Winter Olympics is rising, and it is believed that the ticket sales situation will soon improve."
According to South Korean media reports, as of November 3rd, the ticket sales of the Pyechant Olympics have reached 64%, and the ticket sales rate of the Winter Paralympic Games has also exceeded 50%.
In order to encourage foreigners to visit the ROK, the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea also announced on the 8th that it will extend the stay in the ROK for foreigners who visit Han to watch the Winter Olympics, which can be used for up to 120 days.
Survey found more than one in five U.S. travelers carrying banned items on board
An investigation into aircraft passengers found that more than 20 percent of passengers had deliberately or unintentionally encreating illegal items boarded through the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoint, with at least 6 percent of them not intentionally carrying prohibited knives or other wear-side objects on board.
Less than 1 percent of passengers declared that they had only found out they had to travel with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey, for more than 1000 people, was conducted by the charter service agency Stratos Jet Charters Inc., which also found that young travelers are more likely to blatantly ignore the regulations.
19.7 per cent of respondents who admitted to having tried to deliberately carry TSA banned items on board were millennials, compared to fewer than 15 per cent of Gen X.
The most common items that deliberately slip over TSA security personnel are food and beverages.
More than 3 per cent admitted to having deliberately carried the blades to security, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also said they had deliberately carried prohibited drugs on board.
The company said the survey of travelers across the country was to learn about the number of people who accidentally carried and deliberately carried the embargoed aircraft security board.
Not surprisingly, the people most likely to carry embargoes over security are deliberately or unintentionally as the people who fly the most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guide is a bit complicated and difficult to understand.
People are usually unsure of what kind of liquid can be carried and how much liquid can be carried.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the TSA has seized the most illegal liquids.
At one point it was thought that the TSA might have used books as an embargo.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed.
EPA Administrator Pruitt changes his mind over Obama-era emissions reduction regulations
A day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt changed his earlier decision to delay implementing Obama-era regulations on reducing emissions of smoke pollutants.
Prut proposed this change because the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of environmental regulatory states than previous governments.
He did not mention the legal challenges the federal appeals court has brought against his former position.
The focus of the dispute is the deadline for October 1st to begin meeting the 2015 ground-level ozone standard for states.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay the performance for a year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the program, avoid "interfering with local decision-making or hindering economic growth 燨
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Pruitt was Oklahoma's attorney general, who has long opposed the rigor of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly turned to blocking or delaying regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuels industry.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal hurdle on Pruitt's regulatory return agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled over Viotent, an attempt to delay enforcing the Obama administration's rule that oil and gas companies monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Prutt presented his U-turn on attitudes toward ozone standards, saying it was committed to strengthening the Environmental Protection Agency's commitment to work with states to adopt complex procedures to reach new standards.
"Under previous government administrations, the EPA usually fell short of the specified deadline, and then waited for radical groups and other people to sue, and then agreed to set the specified schedule through an agreement." He launched a dozen prosecutions against the Environmental Protection Agency in his previous work.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, and we take the deadline seriously."
We also take the regulations and the authorities seriously. ”
Still, the EPA statement said Pruitt could again use his "deferred authorization and all other legally available authorizations" to ensure the regulations are in line with "good policies and the best available information"
Republicans in Congress are pushing to rewrite the ozone layer ordinance on a large scale.
The House bill, approved last month, was designed to delay the 2015 rule for at least eight years to be implemented.
The measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the state coalition to sue the EPA this week, said it intends to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: "The EPA's reversal - after we filed the lawsuit - a victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers is a significant victory, with more than 1.15 million American communities directly affected by smog emissions.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C., and the District of Columbia joined the New York State to participate in the case.
Ground-based ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources of sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive populations, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered for Pruitt's surprising shift.
Lori An Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity said: "It is disturbing that this common-sense measure is under intense pressure from the head of the department who protects the air we need to breathe."
“We must fight against the Trump administration ’ s motion to pander to polluters and special interests to the end. ”

On the morning of July 13th, Beijing time, the US company Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the East Texas District Court, accusing Apple of infringing on a patent for battery technology it applied for in 2010.
The company has previously sued Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba in the same patent.
The lawsuit alleges that both the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices infringed the 7,657,386 U.S. patent designation as Integrated Battery Services.
The plaintiff wishes to receive cash compensation, or to charge a patent fee for the infringing device announced after the judgment is announced.
Judging from the indictment, the plaintiffs appear to believe that the iPhone's fast-charging feature infringes the company's patents.
The fast-charging iPhone will quickly charge the power to 80% and then trickle it.
Somaltus is a so-called “patent rogue ” because the company does not offer obvious products and services and is difficult to find relevant information online.
However, they have successfully reached an out-of-court settlement with automakers like Ford and Nissan.
The meeting believes that it is of great significance to accelerate the development of informatization, promote the integration of resources, efficient utilization, and improve the level of industrial digitalization and intelligence, which is of great significance for promoting "Made in China 2025" and mass entrepreneurship and innovation, cultivating new momentum and improving the quality of life of the masses.

According to leaked phone records, Trump has pressured Mexico to pay for the wall
The Washington Post leaked transcripts of the call between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States is reportedly displeased with him publicly bashing the wall, and it is alleged that Putland had said to him, "Don't tell the media."
Trump, on the presidential campaign, promised to build a wall on the U.S. southern border and solemnly announced that he would make Mexico pay for the project.
The transcript of his call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also released, which showed a tense exchange between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. taking on the deal for refugees to be sent to Australia was "absurd" "unsavory" and "stupid." He had advised the U.S. to ban refugee resettlement, and now sticking to the deal brokered by the Obama administration, which would make him look like a "foolish ."
Trump hung up the phone after telling Turnbull that "this is the most unpleasant call today."

SEOUL, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and North Korea concluded high-level talks in Panmunjom on the evening of the 9th, and the two sides issued a joint statement to reach an agreement on the DPRK's participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and the holding of military sector talks between the two sides.

Moore Beach tragedy: activists re-enact racist lynchings, justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car runs through a group of onlookers in the small Moorish beach bridge, rumbling through a group of onlookers in the small Moorish Beach Bridge.
The car, carrying four black passengers and a white driver, was blocked the way forward before the car arrived at the bridge, before a group of whites with guns went.
The head of the gang of thugs - a middle-aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a deep sip of a cigar and eyes glanced into the windshield.
Passengers in the car are full of fear.
"We want - Roger draulic" the man shouted.
“Put him out of the car.
A young black man was dragged down from his former passenger seat, screaming and puncture the silence.
Fortunately, the horrific scene of July 22 is just a repeat.
But when "Roger"'s neck on the bet, almost all the onlookers onlookers gave a real gasp.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore Beach Bridge, recreating the scenes of two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm as well as George and Merre Dosey - who were lynched by the three K-Party lynchings in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
“While we know who they are, although we have seen them in the community, none of them have been arrested over the years, which is truly incredible that the ’ s Timon Brooks has helped organize this re-enactment.
"This is the stain of history, the burden of our soul."
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia lawmaker and life-long rights activist.
For him, a repeat is a compelling call to action, reminding people in the Monroe community every year that injustice has never been rectified.
"We want to prosecute, we're going to close the case, we're going to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice Amateurs first said."
“Unless we have justice, we will not be healed and reconciled. ”
On July 27, 1946, the coroner lided a sheet on the body of a mole beach lynching victim.
More than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in lynching, according to FBI files obtained by NBC News.
None of them have been prosecuted.
While the suspect has been at large for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivations for implementing lynching are well known throughout town: politics and sexuality.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote in the primaries for the first time later in the summer of that year.
According to the FBI, around the same time, black tenant farmer Roger Malcolm assassinated white landowner Barnet Hurst in a fight - which looked like it was for a woman.
Brooks said the town's rumor was that Hurst had slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, the prominent white landlord Loyci Harrison spent $600 to release Malcolm out of jail.
Dorothy and his cousins, Mai Mérie and George Dorsey, accompanied him to prison.
But when they came back from prison and fast to the Moore Beach Bridge, a group of lynching thugs surrounded the car.
"It turned out that it was Harrison's organization and ordered the execution of a copy of the murder of the UNI Familia that came to such a conclusion."
"It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, who have not only been involved in the murder, destroying evidence, but also concealing the identity of the witness."
Brooks is very concise.
“This is a vote-crimination, ” he said.
"They were killed. It was the murderer who sent a message to the black people of this community ”,“ If you sign up and vote, you will have the same ending. ”
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been responsible for leading the annual re-enactment of the lynching of the Moore Beach Bridge.
Her expression is a stark, gripping, with a deep racist background. Many people hope that this racism is no longer in the United States.
It's hard to see, not harder to see, but Green says that's the key.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because lynchings make us face the ugly face of all people's Elaughter said.
"But if you don't listen to me, or if you don't hear me tell my own experiences, I can't have a relationship with you."
This year's show began in June, with nearly 30 actors on the first day - a dozen whites, and the rest being black - crammed into a room to hear Green release an overview of rehearsed performances.
Wade Malbaugh is the co-director of Green.
He has played the role of the Three K Party for years, but he says the role is never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not that the man who was not the case at Ramabao said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this life alive, because we don't want to go back to that era."
In the room, actors playing Roger Malcolm and Bahnett Hurst's actors Darlios Bradshaw and Nick Rasorna rehearsed their lines.
At the start of the play, Malcolm yelled and pushed on Hers. He was angry at his sleeping own wife, Dorothy.
"I said, get out of my turf."
Rascona hit back.
And then they fought.
Then everyone (at least all the black actors) erupted into laughter.
Green laughed the most.
"What's the matter?" asked ’ ullahscona.
He was panicked and confused.
Did I play too much?
"No Hurlin laughs.
"I just don't think white people will say" ah when they fight back. ""
“It was ’ trophies that another black actor quipped.
"Your tone must be tough."
With that, the energy in the room changed; the feeling of fraternity drove away the discomfort.
Everyone struggled to do it, not only to perform the play, but also to honor the four victims.
The scene started again.
This time, when Lascona said the word "a", the tone was sharp and powerful.
No one laughed.
The repeat is strong and quickly over.
Screams, gunshots, then, a silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black standing by the actor's body singing Billy Haledie's mourning word "The Strange Fruits wovens
Her voice overed other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty viewers were constantly wiping sweat and tears.
Black and white people make up almost half of the audience.
There's a couple who come from Issaca, New York, and there are many people who live near the road.
Brooks took them to the cemetery of Malcolm and Dorothy, nearly eight hours away, and everyone was enduring the uncomfortable wetness of Georgia.
Until this time, the murderer was still a fan. But now, standing on the same land where lynching took place, there was anxiety in the air.
When the song's final note disappears, Greene invites people to approach some to examine the body played by the actor.
The children leaned down and looked at the shuffles and the bodies, whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead as a little boy muttering, as if to remind themselves.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and then the show ended.
The actors flicked away the lynching rope and wiped away the tears.
Bradshaw embraced Marbaugh, the suit man who played the head of the three K party.
Nick Lassona embraced two of his colleagues and lost their arms crying; the emotion in the performance eventually infected him.
"It's okay to get structuring one of the women whispers.
“We know that ’ s not that in your heart.
You do this for a reason. ”
Afterward, the audience sat down for dinner with the cast.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted intimately with a black couple they had just met, talking about something about a repeat.
Dennis Duprisky had a hard time finding words to describe how she felt after watching.
"It's hard to imagine those terrible words and actions... it's something like you's said and done, because they look a lot like ET's ET's to you say it to you."
“It ’ s really for me, it ’ s really made me think the lynching is still going on, ” she added,“ and that ’ s called this thing just police shooting. ”
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat at the table watching, tasting and evocating civil rights.
He said he had already planned a performance for next year.
“Re-enactment is an inspiring way to do it because it describes the horrors we ’ ve been through, but it ’ s also very educational, ” he said.
"If you don't learn from it, this kind of thing may happen again."
Those who do not study and do not understand their own history are doomed to repeat the same mistakes. ”
For the reform of the natural gas market, the importance of the reform of the "tube network independence" is self-evident, but the resistance and controversy are also greater.
The reporter learned from the Hebei Kailuan Group on the 7th that at 11: 25 a.m. on the 7th, an explosion accident occurred in the emulsification workshop of Kailuan Group Chemical Co., Ltd. in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, and 13 operators were trapped at the scene.
So far, one of the 13 trapped people has been rescued, and the remaining 12 people are being sent to the hospital for rescue, and the remaining 12 are in a tense search and rescue.
It is understood that the scene has been cordoned off, and local public security, fire, medical and other departments are on-site rescue.
According to witnesses, a loud bang occurred, and a mushroom cloud vacated in an instant.

Scientists from China Air Force Engineering University study laser satellite for removing space junk
Chinese scientists have made a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up the messy Earth's orbit and destroy old satellites as well as its sky junk.
According to the U.S. Newsweek website reported on November 15th, researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University have written a paper entitled "Space-based laser removal of small-scale space debris variable orbit model research", which describes how space debris can be irradiated by laser to smaller, less harmful fragments.
According to the report, space waste has been a concern for the International Space Agency for many years, and the US space agency has considered a variety of options to track, detect and remove man-made debris.
Ways to remove large-scale space debris include giant networks used to clear and collect waste, as well as magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted laser simulation studies to conclude that this would be an effective way to clean up Earth's orbit.
The paper's summary said: "(Mang simulation research) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based laser space debris removal technology."
A 2014 study by U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin found that for satellites operating in orbit, there are about 200 threats a day.
The high-speed debris moving along Earth's orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions, described by experts at the European Space Agency as "a deadly chain of threats over the past year, with high-speed debris continuing to increase."
According to the U.S. "Volkswagen Machinery" website reported on January 17th, space is basically empty, but next to Earth is becoming more and more crowded. Each satellite we send into space will eventually become a piece of debris that orbits the Earth, and over time, these debris will pile up.
The more debris, the higher the chance that a satellite that is still functioning is hit by the debris, which in turn damages or destroys a multimillion-dollar investment.
All space agencies have plans to remove space debris in the future.
NASA is considering reducing the speed of debris with jet gas to get it out of orbit, and Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large network to capture debris and bring back to Earth, and Japan's idea is to capture debris with an electric chain.
At present, China has also proposed a solution to space junk, that is, using a large laser to knock floating space waste into less harmful small fragments.
According to a paper published in the German monthly "Optico" by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University, installing such a laser on a satellite would be able to effectively clean up space, at least according to the simulation results.
The only way to prove the effectiveness is to test it, and there is currently no arrangement for such a mission, but perhaps sooner or later someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space.
Once that's done, we can finally start eliminating the problem of space junk once and for all.

Pearson Group cuts back 3000 jobs, slashing dividends to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut 3000 more jobs and slash its mid-term dividend by 72 per cent as it began another restructuring project to deal with business pressures.
Chief Executive John Faron said that most of the job cuts will be carried out in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, and the previous restructuring has been reduced by 4000 jobs.
Pearson announced in May plans to cut back £300 million ($3.94 billion) in its third cost-cutting project to revive businesses hit by the rapid development of digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann, and published a report saying its basic sales rose 1 per cent to £20.5m in the first half of the year, but said the outlook remained unchanged this year.
A few days ago, the Chinese Athletic Association took a serious notice to crack down on the phenomenon of running, and was ready to give the violator a heavy penalty for the lifelong ban.
KM convoy killed by suicide bombing attack on NATO soldiers
A military convoy was hit by a suicide bomber in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing and wounding a number of NATO soldiers, according to official sources.
The NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Karabagh area.
It was the latest violent attack in Afghanistan - where the Herat mosque bombings on Tuesday killed more than 30 people.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a blast late Thursday, a joint patrol by the Afghan and NATO coalitions was attacked with an "personally armed improvised explosive device," according to a NATO statement.
The statement said all the injured were currently in stable condition and were being treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
The growing Taliban and the so-called Islamic State (IS) group in the Karabakh region have sparked serious concern among NATO forces stationed near Bagram, according to journalists.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, while the capital accounted for about 20% of the death toll.
A suicide car bomb attack in Kabul's predominantly Shiite region in late July killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban claimed they had launched the attack.
On May 31, a huge explosion in central Kabul killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since the U.S.-led multinational force ousted the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights U.S. President Donald Trump's trade-off as a time of whether the security situation in the country is dangerously ringed at a time of increased Afghan support for its troops and police.
The suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also sparked a crisis of public trust in the government and its policies, particularly the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani, according to reporters.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) overturns resolution after lawsuit, delays smoke regulations
In office, Obama made a provision to require states to curb various emissions of smoke, 15 states prosecuted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the provision. A day after the indictment, the EPA overturned the rule.
The EPA announced Wednesday's decision to continue the so-called "Ozone-compliant Zone 2015" and promised that the EPA would work with states.
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement, "We have confidence in the dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to it."
Pruit announced in June that the EPA plans to delay the implementation of the ozone-compliant standard to October 2018, for a period of one year - under which the standard is measured against existing fume pollution in some areas to determine which areas should reduce emissions from smoke pollution to meet air quality standards.
Fifteen leading Democratic states, as well as the District of Columbia, filed lawsuits Tuesday, declaring the act illegal.
As part of a broader agenda, the authority of President Donald Trump has been working to revive the various environmental regulations that former President Barack Obama has introduced to stimulate economic growth.
But those efforts have sparked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups. They fear more emissions will affect public health.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency website claims that air that contains ozone "will reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms, such as asthma."

Mackey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time to discuss possible future decisive battles
The most high-profile 147lb following boxing match will be held shortly, with Vasily Lomachenko and McKee Garcia meeting for the first time on Thursday in a state of possible conflict.
They were separately in the independent room in the Los Angeles office, and the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia took the lead in the hallway and paid tribute to the world boxing organization's ultra-theatweight champion Lomachenko.
At the Showtime boxing match on Saturday, the referee unanimously decided that Garcia defeated the four-district world champion Adrian Brobner to victory, so that the two boxers had become the top five players in the heavyweight list.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "Championship, how are you?"
Good luck to you. ”
In a 7pm ESPN game on Saturday night, Lomachenko overcame Miguel Mariaga to preserve his position.
When they were photographed, Lomachenko's agent Egids Clemas noted that a potential matchup between the two contestants depended on "perfect size ?
“I was lightweight of Galicati.
"I'm upgrading to fight Brona (140 pounds), but I'm not that big.
Relative to 140 pounds, my weight is a little worse.
I want to go back to the lightweight.
And he has to reach the lightweight (135 pounds) and then we can fight.
That's what fans want too.
Then we will satisfy them. ”
Lomachenko agrees.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Clemas asked him whether he should be charged on a case-by-time basis, and part of his strategy was to have Lomachenko make his debut with a 135lb player later this year, thinking that he would have an appointed date with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout) next summer. Garcia was also interested in a showdown with the winner of the Battle with Jorge Linas-Luc Campbell after the September 23 Forum Lightweight Fighters.
"As all the fans are asking this question, this match may be the charge-by-charged by the Arrivo Ali Abdullahi said. After that, he was open to the race on the network that offers the best financial options.
“We are the main people.
Others can't generate such a big level of concern.
As long as they are ready.
Garcia appreciated Lomachenko as "an excellent runner" and possibly watching him on Saturday's boxing match on the spot.
But Lomachenko's accolades for Garcia were hesitant, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "slowly. Sorry, Mackey... you'll be eliminated."
Garcia said the point was to show the power of the fist and then boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing match.
“This is a fighting that must be fought,
Attention and hotness is not available to other boxing matches.
I am very happy to be in the Ausgacia.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and this time it's Mackey's turn.
It's going to be a great fight. "

China's NDRC officials' statement on the November 5th emission reduction target was completed in advance, so that the steel industry with limited electricity production suppression has a strong expectation of resumption of production.
Although the steel mill has not received a clear notice from the local government announcing that the energy conservation and emission reduction work has been completed, the industry estimates that around December 15, 2010, the steel mills that were originally restricted will be completed, and the steel price may begin to be under pressure.
At present, there is no notice of the end of the power supply limit, but in fact, the pressure of various enterprises has been much smaller than in September and October, a private steel company in Hebei Province told reporters.
Some parts of Hebei have repeatedly issued limited production documents, and once adopted a compulsory lock to restrict the production of enterprises.
The reporter learned from local enterprises that the steel mills in most areas of Hebei have resumed work, and the pressure of production has been alleviated.
My steel network analyst Zhang Tieshan expects that the terminal demand for construction steel will gradually turn from strong to weak due to the winter in the north.
In addition to the gradual end of energy conservation and emission reduction, by December 15th, most steel mills will basically resume production, and the products will arrive in various markets before New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put a certain amount of pressure on the steel price that is currently rising.

Results of Sweden ’ s Age Assessment Test for Asylum released
The Swedish Asylum Test takes the latest method to assess their age from medicine, and the latest results show that more than 80 per cent of subjects were judged to be above 18 years old, but not all believed in its accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensmedicinalvertette began the test earlier this year.
After the alleged failure to accurately assess the age of some of the alleged minor refugees, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsvertet) designed the tests with a view to conducting a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Migration Board has sent 6880 testers, and the French Medicine Center has now released the results of a total of 2481 testers between mid-March and July 31.
80% (2002) was judged to be 18 years of age or older, but in another 25 tests, the Swedish National Centre for Legal Medicine determined that the subject was "may be 18 years of age or older."
In a 432 test, the result was that the person "may not be 18 years old."
The test is only for people with age.
According to John Glanson of the Forensic Medicine Center, the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
He told The Local: "The data are not much different from the data in the previous months, and the numbers are very consistent."
A higher proportion of cases of determined age of 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that these asylum-seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the center published 581 test results and said 442 cases "said the subjects who were 18 years of age or older.
The news newspaper Svenska Dagblatt investigated the published 581 test results, and found that 243 of the subjects had publicly stated that they would be 18 years old this year.
X-ray examination of the wisdom teeth, a MRI scan of the joints, and then analyzed by a dentist and radiologist, a medical assessment method that is also questioned in some regions.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose job includes assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they experience puberty before or later than normal.
He told the news newspaper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I think the measurement method used shouldn't be like that."
It is very inaccurate to determine the biological age in such a way.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can do it. "
Glanson of the Forensic Center, however, defended the accuracy of these tests: "Togsingly it is possible to determine the risk of uncertainty for a child as an adult."
The biggest risk is that the person is just under 18 years of age, which accounts for about 10 percent of this.
West Virginia Governor Announces Change of Party
On Thursday night, Jim Justice, the Democratic governor of West Virginia, announced at a rally in President Trump that he would change party.
"Like it, don't like it, the Democrats have left me," the gubernatorial judge said.
"Today, after I've done a lot of prayers and a lot of thought, I'm going to tell you... I'm going to tell you as a Western Virginian today, I can't help you any longer as a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted and cheers.
"So, tomorrow, I'm going to change the party to the Republican Party," Justins added.
"As a coach, I'm going to tell you it's time to start another game."
Trump had earlier promised a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42 percent of West Virginia's 4 percent vote, and while Jastis didn't back the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justins was named the state's only billionaire in 2016.
Forbes pointed out that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal in five states.
Currently, his worth is about $15.9 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night saying: "The change of governor of Jastis is another blow to the Democratic Party, which will not stop our country from becoming great again, but will make our country great again."
"The Democratic Party currently has only 15 governors and the number of controlling state assemblies is at record low, and Governor Jastis's statement is the latest rejection of a party that loses leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unity slogan," said Rona McDaniel, the head of the Republican National Committee, in a statement to the CBS News.
Fang Wenshan admitted that using music to tell the complete story is his dream.
It's difficult to tell a story in four to five minutes.
When I wrote songs, there was only emotion, no story line, and I always felt a pity.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's 'frank' apology for doping scandal
On Thursday, the president of the International Athletics Federation, Sebastian Coe, praised Russia's apology for the doping scandal, saying it was "candid, but he reiterated that it is not the time for Russia to re-enter the sport."
Mitri Hirakdin, president of the Russian Athletics Federation, said at the IAAF conference on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country was right to be banned from the sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he regretted that “all athletes who won gold and silver in the competition have been deprived of their medals. ”

How did the financial rules of the football world affect Neymar's move to Paris?
The rules designed to prevent European club club out of unrestricted spending will not prevent Neymar from Barcelona in Spain at record prices to Paris Saint-Germain Football Club (PSG) in France.
The result is a further relegation of the European Football Association (UEFA) to St. Germain Football Club in Paris. The European Football Association is the governing body of European football matches and has the right to ban teams from the most-watched Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 meant that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club would eventually have to prove that Neymar's move was funded without incurring huge losses.
The Barcelona club has paid €222m ($2.26 million) solely to pay for the Brazilian player's termination, while Neymar's salary will be as high as tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Neymar ’ s move to France.
Considering that the team's funding comes from the wealthy Qatari-dominated family, Paris St. Germain Football Club of Paris can certainly sign Neymar in cash and incorporate him into the squads where other stars gather.
Clubs can spend huge sums on players, but they must use their legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge amount of money they spend and make them breakeven in the related business of football.
The Financial Fair Play Rules were conceived by Michel Platini after his election as president of the UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believes that for clubs in debt to pursue success, if banks or all of them withdraw their support funds, they are effectively deceiting and putting the club at risk of ruin.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from club debt to club debt monitoring.
The change means that Rome Abramovich's business model used to buy Chelsea club in 2003, namely the buying of a club with potential, then spending huge sums to improve the team and build a global brand, now facing a more demanding situation.
In the three-year Ruleperate period up to 2018, clubs could lose €30m.
Despite Abu's being devalued by then-president in 2015, Uefa's successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to stopping excessive spending.
"Of course the Rules have not lapsed, we will certainly strengthen future regulations," Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of the rules-related matters, told The Associated Press last week.
While Paris Saint-Germain FC will pay for Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can also allocate the amount over the term of the contract for the purpose of accounting.
Neymar has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee is likely to show €44.4 million in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of rules sanctions imposed in 2014 has brought the toughest sanctions to Paris St. Germain FC, as well as the Manchester City club owned by Abu Dhabi.
Paris St. Germain was awarded a fine of €60m ($82 million at the exchange rate at the time), later reduced to €20m, and asked for the Champions League in the 2014-15 season the team to reduce the number of players to 21 instead of the normal 25 players.
UEFA is eyeing clubs that try to increase revenue and deceive financial regulators by being tucked into club owners.
While Qatar's company can sponsor Paris St. Germain Football Club, if the sponsorship amount is considered to exceed the standard market price, then UEFA will not see it as a legitimate income.
That's what happened in 2014, and UEFA ruled at the time that the amount of money from the Qatar Tourism Board's sponsorship of Paris St. Germain's football club was inflated.
According to reports, a portion of Neymar's income from Paris St. Germain's football club could come from payments from the 2022 Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee.
But both Paris St. Germain and the organizing committee have denied that Neymar would be an ambassador for the World Cup, and it would be easy for UEFA's regulators to make such a move.
Recent sanctions imposed on Paris-based St. Germain's football club mean that UEFA will be more vigilant against any attempt to circumvent the rules.
People familiar with the matter on Thursday said UEFA did not have a pre-discussion with Paris St. Germain's on Neymar's transfer.
The above-mentioned individuals only made contact with The Associated Press in unnamed because they were not authorized to discuss the status of St. Germain FC Paris.
The accounts that last published show that Paris Saint-Germain FC's operating income for the 2015-16 year was €5.424 million, with a profit of more than 10 million euros.
Accounts for the previous fiscal year have not been published.
Paris St. Germain's club anticipates Neymar's joining to bring the Gospel to sponsorship events, franchises and jersey sales.
The club expects revenue to grow at least 30 percent after signing Neymar.
It is clear that seeing the departure of the most famous player, the Spanish league is deeply angry in an attempt to hinder Neymar's move and claim that Paris Saint-Derman FC is in violation of the Rules.
La Liga president Javier, said of the Spanish newspaper AS, "This is a clear illustration of a 'financial doping', the same club and country, referring to Qatar, which has ultimate ownership of Paris St. Germain's football club."
Arsenal's team (all of whom the club are a U.S. sports tycoon) manager Arsene Wenger has a state-funded club with reservations about the La Liga.
"It's a consequence of ownership, and that has revolutionised the whole ecology of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once the country has a club, then anything will happen.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, because for a country, there are many different ways or interests to ask the players to represent a country. ”

Nostalgia is popular with the market: Ha Lao Summer Camp and Detective Shuangong
This story is to remember the years of the actors in the 1980s and the garbage era of the 1990s (David Wayne and Michael Shuhuat made the sketch comedy "The Nation" for MTV); it is also a nostalgic for the nostalgia itself, nostalgic for 2001; before the year, many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Emile Polyrös and Paul Luther had not yet flourished.
As a cultural art, it is an imitation and embodiment of the permanent memories of our Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time isn't enough.
The first day of Camp was followed by a strong reaction, but not just because of its absurd humor (the plot is an original story about a cann of talking vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin.
Double the use of the core laughing terrier - middle-aged actors playing a child of trick-or-treating age - which makes it impossible to return to the past and become a part of hilarity.
In "Ten Years Later", adults actually play the role of adults, and the emotions are not too deeply rooted, and the imitation is more scattered, including the improvisation of the 90s tracking films, such as "The Carradle of the Hand".
At some point, a character is stuck in an apple notebook, some straight skates, and "something else in 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Mr. Sweetheart (Mr. Shuwart) has now become a novelist, but he still does not forget Katie (Margaret Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still retains the body of the man.
There's another sinister plot involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Shui Huat) instigated by George H· W. Bush (a memorable man).
As always, the best part of this series is interjection.
It's especially funny to see the ever-young Mr. Luther, who flaunts Matt Dillon's soul patch in the film Single aristocrat, and Andy in Campus Giants now feels like a giant.
It's a moment of random madness that might power the movie, like a recursive Seven Years of Life series, until I think it's logical to conclude that it's a logical conclusion: Twenty Years Later, and its last act is to let the gang of cass go to the movie premiere of "Kale Summer Camp."
At the same time, Amazon ’ s Detective Shuangong tells of different nostalgic content: Cold War Revivalist ’ s American Dream, the movie“ Extremely Cold City, ” and even the East-West wrestling imagery of “GLOW: Gorgeous Women ’ Wrestling League. ”

The main characters - the hard-core Grigor and the idealistic Etherf - were played by Little Florin Pierszi and Cornejeuri Ulić, whose dialogue was voiced in English by Chanin Tatum (also the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not just an idea.
There are some good visual stunts (police watching TV playing chess pass time, because the Americans like to play football).
And there are a number of celebrity voice actors - including Jenny Srett, Nick Overman, Maherah Shash Baz Ali and Colo Sevini - creating a wonderful sound event.
But Detective Shuangong is so committed to creating a hustle and bustle of realistic propaganda comedy - a killer in the play that wears a Reagan mask - and it often plays such a role as well.

Reporters recently interviewed learned that the northeast steel, rail transit, ship, machinery manufacturing and other industries have generally declined, and even lost money.
Some experts believe that under the current situation, the new round of revitalization of Northeast industry is not only related to the national economic recovery, but also has an impact on the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, so it is urgent to adjust the transformation.
The efficiency of enterprises generally decline in the traditional industry, which is more cash-making in raw materials industry and heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing, which has a serious decline in the benefits of heavy losses or even losses, which is the primary performance of Northeast China's industry in the current round of economic downturn.
In the past, in the economic downturn, mainly low-end, primary products were hit by the characteristics of the impact, but in the economic fluctuations, the northeast traditional industrial high-end, low-end industrial products are affected.

Bank of England to maintain interest rate of 0.25%
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged, and previously weak economic growth and easy inflation have undone.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be "weak" as it controls interest rates while strengthening household incomes tightening.
Policymakers on the bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held a vote of 6-2 to maintain a 0.25 percent interest rate, while a handful of members this month called for higher interest rates, even as weak economic growth has waned on the boost.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England cut its growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, and issued a warning that the household income crunch will continue, while inflation will skyrocket to nearly 3 per cent in the autumn.
But it said it would need to raise interest rates over the next few years to curb inflation from Brexit, while borrowing costs may need to be raised more sharply in the financial markets.
A year ago, a large-scale economic promotion policy was implemented under the influence of Brexit, and members also voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce a pause in the term financing scheme to provide cheap funds to banks starting in February next year, although the bank says under the plan the bank will need another £1.5bn on a £1.5bn basis at the time of the plan.
In the minutes of the interest rate decision-making meeting, the Bank of England said: "In the core forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term, as the real income squeeze on households will continue to suppress consumption."
Regarding interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for "certain monetary policy tightening" to suppress inflation, and it needs to be "more than the market expects" to the extent that it is expected.
At present, the market is expected to achieve its first growth in the third quarter of next year, for the second time in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any hike would be "slow" and "restraint."
The bank's growth forecasts for this year and next year are on a downward trend, while forecasts for May are 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank maintained a forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.
The pound's exchange rate against the dollar fell, and the euro followed suit.
The pound ’ s exchange rate against the dollar fell 0.5 per cent to 1.31 and the euro by 0.4 per cent to 1.11.
The decision to remain the same came before the incessant increase expectations were dashed by recent unvalorious growth figures. GDP increased to 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with only 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
The bank said growth in the third quarter was likely to remain at 0.3 percent, although it would rise slightly by the end of the year.
The average household is battered by inflationary inflation, and wage growth is minuscule, and the Bank of England's recent report on inflation has not brought them good news, as the bank says austerity will become worse before it gets better.
And it said monetary policy "cannot prevent" the blow to income in the next few years, but that wages are expected to recover "on a scale" at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, because of the depreciation of the pound, demand for British goods has grown significantly, and the economy will be stimulated to offset the impact of some low consumption.
The decision was made a year before the decision-making, with the shocking EU referendum plunging the pound and cut interest rates to 0.25 per cent in August.
The Bank of England estimates it could take four years to fully impact prices and the UK economy.
Ahead of the bank's announcement of its latest interest rate ruling, calls for an increase in interest rates, as inflation has fueled the average household that has long felt pressure, while three policymakers called for a rate hike to 0.5 percent in July.
Inflation retreated to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, although the Bank of England said it was expected and will rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the more than part of the more than the sterling is already entirely the last bottom line of the weak pound.
Andrew Monterick, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more competitive again, as lenders are clamoring for more business and looking forward to a positive stance to the perfect end this year."
Such markets look particularly favorable for those who may be close to ending existing deals, as re-mortgages (a lot of them can be fee-free and have low interest rates) are becoming more popular.

UK's NHS's controversial HIV drug lights green
After the Dust in the High Court's supply of drug funding for the NHS, patients will be able to receive "transformative" HIV prevention treatments starting in September.
NHS England announced that Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug that could be taken before sex, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in at-risk populations by about 86 per cent. Now the health service will now deliver the drug to 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court ruling last year. The ruling said the NHS was entitled to pay for PrEP despite the NHS's claim that local authorities should fund the drug.
The move announced on Thursday was called a "major new intervention" by NHS England chief Simon Stevens, while the National AIDS Trust Fund (NAT) described it as a "critical moment...
Sexual health clinics in places such as London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to register sexual health clinics for people. More clinics will be added in October, followed by a full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug that is taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Trials have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there are enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay, bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV who have not been successfully treated.
The clinic will determine whether participants who are eligible and agree to the trial, including men, women, transgender people and their sexual partner HIV status is unknown.
People who live in England and register GPs can also sign up at sexual health clinics where they attend locally.
The scheme will cost £10m, while the NHS England branch has signed a contract to procure the drugs this week after making international competitive purchases.
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is positioned, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and reinforce HIV prevention in a wide range and increasingly successful.
This is yet another milestone in more than three decades of actions worth making progress in addressing the major health challenges of humanity. ”
Depola King, chief executive of the UK AIDS Trust Fund (NAT), said: "This is a critical time to fight AIDS.
If it is indeed aimed at people in need and at risk, pre-expoirduation medication offers the possibility of changing the UK AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will receive a new tool of permission through this trial, conducted in England, funded by the NHS, which is truly implemented alone, without consultation with sexual partners, which will lead to improvements in the lives of many people.
We have both hands in favor of this announcement. ”
Ian Green, chief executive of Terence Higgins Trust, said: “The first priority now is to ensure that the trial is pushed quickly across the country, and that none of the people living with HIV can fall behind.
Now that we have purchased PrEP trial drugs, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV. ”
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson claimed: "After months of delay and the delay of the government, PrEP's initial trial work was popular and should have arrived sooner.
The evidence suggests how this drug can bring about as part of our approach to preventing HIV and halting the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This trial will allow us to take a step further and fully understand the advantages of PrEP.
It is very important that this experiment be rolled out nationwide as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and help us to go further and end the spread of HIV in society. ”

High quality of life: Apply loft and clever design to make the Earl Palace apartment a spacious home
Joanne Ray was a former banker who was so keen to renovate a house, and in 2014 she moved from the large house in Knightsbridge to the Little County Apartment.
This apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne-style terrace — Joanne has not packed her bags for sale, which is a powerful testament to the new design.
"Before that, I and my ex-boyfriend lived in a bigger house in Knightsbridge, said by Ami Joanne.
“I was looking for a suitable house with an offer.
I saw this apartment at the Earl's Palace, and its ceiling was high.
I was so interested that I made an offer that day. ”
Since the first lookout, this 1,000-square-foot apartment has now been thoroughly overhauled.
The apartment was originally a complex single room — the need to walk through the kitchen to the bedroom — Joanne wanted to add storage space and loft to take advantage of the ample ceiling height.
“I want a high ceiling, a big window, a lot of light.
That's what I asked ’ .A., she said.
To that end, she hired Ervan Azadi from Duck&Shed architecture and design studio (in Notting Hill) to use this 12.5-foot-tall ceiling to craft a home. The home is not only a development project, but also where Joanne lives.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to add two up and down spaces, so the building challenge is to create a loft where the height is enough to make people stand.
Elvan has to use creative thinking in order to solve this problem.
“The steel structure is quite complicated, ” he explained.
"We have to arrange the space for it to be on display up and down, and there's no need for a shrug on the back."
Not only is it simple to build a simple platform, but also to start these steels so that it is at the right height to achieve the function. ”
Through this arrangement, Elvan was able to get two full-body high-coal rooms in the space - which could add many interesting elements.
The loft features retro copper windows from the Retrouvius brand overlooking the charming living area.
Gold furniture with mirrors, small silver furniture and Serge Mouille vintage lighting laid the way in the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing atmosphere, space and light.
A mirror on both ends of the short corridor can make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a splashboard fitted with a mirror is like a window leading to another room.
At the porceage, the plaid with a mirror provides storage space for Joanne to store cutlery and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an engaging sense of space, and the kitchen is able to put away the kitchen when it is unused.
The folding kitchen is not new.
But what's unique about this folding kitchen is a garage-style lift door.
“There is a number of knowledge in engineering here that ’ s involved in a number of engineering areas, ” explains the MDF door of the reinforced veneer.
"It's a balance principle, so it's easy to slide when you push the door."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne gets an extra 16m2, one more bedroom and an improved layout.
“Ultimately, you ’ re selling the size of the house — or your property is valued by the size of the house, ” said Ami.
"Basically, the real estate agent will go into the room and calculate it according to the size of the floor."
They will try to increase the footprint while using high-quality materials, which will bring a sense of luxury to this space.
"Materials are personally selected, so it helps create emotional bonds in your home."
"You don't love the power supply on the wall.
These things are important, but they don't hold you around the heart. "
It turns out that through good design and the addition of extra acres, the standard apartment can shake to make you marvel.
In fact, you might, like Joanne, choose to stay.

Two brothers staged a $500m real estate empire fight
Forty years after the founding of its Italian family, the two brothers waged a battle for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than half a billion dollars.
Colin De Lutis, a former director and developer of Carlton FC, lives in a mansion in the Tukala district, while the distance between the three doors is his brother Paul's residence. The latter takes him to the Supreme Court on the issue of the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has been hoping to break away from the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have engaged in a heated debate over the division of assets in the Supreme Court.
The brothers and their mothers, which had a total of 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, were accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in the Colin Wood district in 1973.
There, the family founded the Westco Jeans company, and gradually grew it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold for $85 million.
After that, that money was put into real estate. Currently, the De-Rutis family's portfolio includes city office buildings, Brunswick and Sorrento development projects, Gold Coast and Bühler Hill apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin, whom his brother Paul called the "primary promoters and dominant figures" of the De Rutiz family, owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul makes up about a third.
Documents filed with the court alleging that the converted, the property owned by Colin was worth $316 million, while the property owned by Paul was worth $176 million.
Paul came to believe that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the negotiations.
"The property split proposal by Colin left him the best property I think is best," he wrote in a first court affidavit in 2015.
On Friday, after several failed mediations, the Supreme Court held its first hearing.
Now that the two brothers are still vying for control of the existing businesses, Paul said Colin had kicked him out.
Colin denied this and accused Paul of poorly managing certain real estate.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed hope for a dispute resolution.
"My Italian tradition dictates that the family is the most important option. My Italian heritage determines that the family is the most important," he wrote.
The cost of the case continues to rise, and there are hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails, and company reports from top law firms such as Deloitte, Pitch Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Ms. De Rutiz and her late husband, Luigi, were both Italian immigrants. They began operating mass restaurants and deli restaurants since the late 1950s, and bought a shop in Braunc in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said, "I was in high school, where he founded Westco," when Paul was too young (about ten years old. "
Anna de Rutis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, want to be able to pass the property to her son in peace
"Luigi used to say to me that he never wanted his brothers to settle in court at the end," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, who were no longer members of the De Rutiz Group Company, said Mark had left the company when he paid $10 million and paid him $26 million to Luke.
Paul said that both Luke and Mark "expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of their property division."
According to a biography published by TV star Eddie McGuire to the 2015 publication, he has kept a low profile despite Colin's board of directors of the former AFL club.
"Fairfax Media" contacted Colin and Paul on Friday, as well as their lawyers.
But only Colin replied via text message. He said that because the case had been submitted to the court "I really can't say too much."
"My brother Paul chose to sue me and brought our family affairs to court, which is very, very sad," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he had tried to meet the demands of his brother.
“Our father did not want to see Paul and I end up in such a dispute, ” he added, adding that he“ remains hopeful of a settlement of the dispute. ”
On Friday, that hope seemed to be dashed.
"Our problems will be resolved through the court in the near future," Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit president's media time
Others have tried it, but all failed.
John F. Kelly may really be able to do it.
If that's the case, he's the first man.
According to Politico, the new White House chief of staff plans to limit information flowing to President Trump's Ashrbs, including news media reports, in a bid to keep big bosses smoother, according to Politico.
Here's a quote from journalist Josh Dodesy:
"When the new White House chief of staff, John F. · Kelly, began working together with senior officials on his day to start discussions, he pointed out that he was going to address one of the main issues of President Trump's entry into the White House: bad information going to the president's hands.
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information helped the president make a better decision, so the information would require him to pass through his hand, either in writing or in the form of a briefing.
Kelly's diagnosis was a modicum, but others had tried to tame it by spying on Trump's media time, but eventually all failed.
President Trump's TV addiction is long-standing in the White House, and his habit of watching TV is still deepening.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Nabergh told Politico: "If the candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, then it will be of great benefit to letting him know that he has also been positive in credible channels."
Politico ’ s Tara Palmery wrote at the time, “Based on the experience of six former campaign officials, the focus of controlling Trump ’ s Twitter habits is to ensure that the media information he receives has always included some praise. ”
It's completely no problem.
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habits were once “controlled ” is ridiculous.
Possibly these campaign officials know something we don ’ t know about the Esseng, which is if it ’ s not had their intervention, and Trump ’ s tweets would even be more blaring.
We may never have known the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff could save him from the fire, even if it was only a few times, their efforts would be worth it.
But no one can keep preventing Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House, made up of competing blocs, people are promoting their worldviews by handing over potentially reliable and potentially unreliable information about Trump, which is likely to be unreliable, to their careers.
Politico is all about this story in May reporting on the advisers' penchant for providing suspicious information to the president.
This is an example of what journalist Xie Gundmancher described:
"The current and former Trump officials said that Trump's reaction to negative news clips such as the eruption of the volcano, especially the leak of destructive information, he would frantically want to find out where it came from."
At the end of February, someone maliciously copied an article on the website of the network instigator Charles C. Johnson, GotNews.com, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh as a "source of a large amount of information leaked" by the White House, and that's how Trump did at that time.
Even if Johnson had been permanently banned on Twitter for the harassment, he did not provide any specific evidence, and he had blown up a lot of miscut control, and later publicly denied it.
Trump read the article and began asking officials about Walsh. ”
Goodmancher also said that then-chief chiefs Reins Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "have tried to establish a system to manage and document documents Trump has received."
And what about the result?
Kelly intends to do the same thing in three months.
Possibly he could prove to be a more efficient administrator than Priebas, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his aides are still competing with each other for influence.
These timeless influences make it harder for Kelly's mission.
Tourist style town: how the style of intoxicating people
The potential of the small town of Zhejiang has been gradually awakened.
Nowadays, these small towns have become an important destination for tourists to Zhejiang to enjoy Zhejiang Shanshui, taste Zhejiang culture, and feel Zhejiang nostalgia, and will also provide an important help for our province's efforts to build "Shemme Painting Zhejiang" China's most beautiful tourist destination.
Winning in the style

Walking Shaoxing Anchang Ancient Town, you can see the traditional craftsmanship of hoops, bamboo, iron, shoes, picklaces, spinning cotton, etc., fully demonstrating the intangible cultural heritage of Anchang Ancient Town, and the four tourists are rebuked in the atmosphere of watching and experiencing the folk customs of Shaoxing and enjoying the historical and cultural accumulation of Shaoxing.
It is reported that during the three-day holiday on New Year's Day this year, there were more than 6.5 million tourists in the town of Anchang.
In Zhejiang, like the ancient town of Anchang, such as the unique town of Anchang, the small town is a beautiful chess cloth: Jiaxing Xitang's light, flowing with the gentle euphemism of Jiangnan Water Township; the white wall of the 15th capital of Quzhou, telling the vicissitudes of the years of the ancient town; the fishermen's paintings of Shitang Town in Taizhou, sketched the fisherman's life with a traditional and modern atmosphere... These towns are the "caps" of Zhejiang tourism, and the "hearts of the tourists" love the "hearts of the children of eight squares."
In recent years, with the advancement of global tourism construction in our province, the potential of Zhejiang town has been gradually awakened.
In 2016, the General Office of the Provincial Government officially issued the "Measures for the Implementation of the Work of the Creation of Tourism Towns in Zhejiang Province", proposing that the provincial tourism style of about 100 folk customs and towns in the province should be accepted and named for about 100 folk customs, beautiful ecological environment, and rich tourism.
Nowadays, these small towns have become an important destination for tourists to Zhejiang to enjoy Zhejiang Shanshui, taste Zhejiang culture, and feel Zhejiang nostalgia, and will also provide an important help for our province's efforts to build "Shemme Painting Zhejiang" China's most beautiful tourist destination.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Provincial Tourism Bureau, under the craze of the creation of the tourist style town, now the towns and cities of all over the province pay more attention to the creation of personalized tourism industry, and the new tourism projects and formats have emerged in an endless stream, which has brought rich experience to tourists and won a good reputation.

Many tourist towns in Zhejiang have deep cultural resources, and Dong, a small town from Huzhou City, Nanxun, has read the national painting Nanxun at the scene.
Jiangnan Water Township has been popular with book painters since ancient times, and now, Nanxun Ancient Town and the Chinese Academy of Fine Arts and other art colleges carry out in-depth cooperation.
The tourist style town must have the necessary elements, tourism elements, service elements and environmental factors.
Among them, the service facilities and environment of tourism are also very important contents.
If you hand over a timely umbrella on rainy days, you can also let tourists better experience the style of the town.
In this era of sharing, the Zhejiang Newspaper Group's All-Media Center has joined forces with the hottest shared Umbrella Company to customize a number of "Song Zhejiang" version of the shared umbrella, hoping to advocate the concept of "shared? green", enhance the civilized tourism awareness and public moral heart of tourists and small-town residents, and create a beautiful tourism environment.
This has become a highlight of the "Songshu Zhen Fang" 2017 Zhejiang tourist style town promotion season.
Looking forward to the wonderful
Up to now, Zhejiang Province has released the first 21 provincial tourism town creation list and 115 provincial tourism style town cultivation to create a list.
As a key area of priority development during the "13th Five-Year Plan" period of rural tourism, the town will eventually build a tourist attraction above the 3A level, becoming a new model of tourism products with diverse tourism products, outstanding tourism benefits, and win-win industrial integration.
The reason why the tourist town is attractive is that it is the original.
The beauty of the tourist style of the town not only stems from the small bridge flowing water, but also from the long cultural tradition; the revitalization of the countryside is derived from cultural self-confidence.
Throughout the world, the small town of Lisser in the Netherlands, the small town of Halstatt in Austria, and the small town of the French pumpkin, the "salt" and pumpkin are the core of the attraction, attracting a large number of tourists from all over the world every year, and the tourism promotion has helped the small town's economy to take off.
For the town, the focus of "high-profile characteristics and retaining nostalgia" makes the town have a clear personality and soul, and it is more about providing cultural infiltration, carrying local culture, and highlighting the local civilization.
The tourist style town, with culture and nostalgia as a link, with people and scenery as the carrier, connecting the four-way tourists, so that the traditional style and culture in the joint construction and sharing of heritage, innovation.
In essence, the tourist town is a complex open tourist attraction, which should be a shared living space for local residents and foreign tourists and even residents.
As the main battlefield for the growth of tourism in the future, the tourism style town may not only change the rural ecological landscape, economic and social development mode, and the direction of the flow of industrial factors, but also eliminate the gap between urban and rural infrastructure and awaken the important force of rural cultural recovery.
In the tide of rural acceleration and revitalization, Zhejiang's tourist style town will perform a richer wonderful story.

Motorhomes negotiate ditches, return to "Rich Street"
Some of the wealthiest owners in the West Midlands have been at a dispute with a determined motorhome who negotiated a government-digger ditch for the return of land outside the mansion.
Motorhomes parked their 20 trailers in a vacant space outside the bustling Solihull Street, which was dubbed "Rich Streets  multiplied"
The RVers, holding horses, babysitting and leading the motorhome team, returned again after being ousted in May, and the "moat" dug up by the municipal department did not stop them from entering.
This sleek and sophisticated team found that there was a gap in the defensive line, and although there was a section of the road that did not set up a barricade to pass through, their vehicle was squeezed through that gap.
Angry residents have been furiously critical of the Solihull Council, saying it "has a very poor performance in dealing with this issue."
One resident, who did not want to be named, said: "They were there on Monday night, before coming to the streets of Bentley Heath and throwing stones at passing passersby."
The committee should be ashamed of their actions because they are simply useless in their handling.
The RVs came here in May and then were driven away, and now they're back.
There's a lot coming last night, and it's probably more today. "
She added: "The Birmingham City Council knows how to do it by imposing a long-term ban protecting its park.
I live in Streetsbrook Road, and if Parliament can't stop something like this, I'm reluctant to keep paying municipal taxes.

This time the number has increased, and some people even see that there are horses on the park lawn on which they are eating grass. ”
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Committee said: "We know that there is an unauthorized camping in a vacant lot on the ShutzBrook Road, and now we are cooperating with the Solihar police and taking the necessary legal action to move them out as soon as possible."
To support us in gathering evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps us to outline an overview of the situation when we submit a case to the Court for review by the Court. ”

Italy takes tough stance on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue to implement the rescue if new rules of action are not signed.
Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin Daily News: "If NGOs do not sign new codes of conduct, it is difficult to see how they will be able to sustain themselves."
A day before Minniti's warning, Italian officials seized the crew of a ship on a German aid group that the "Youth Rescue" was in effect colluded with human traffickers to assist in illegal immigration.
The aid group only operates for a year and declined to comment on the specific subject of the charges against Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartocio.
“For us, the time is and will be the most important thing for us, and we regret that we can ’ t operate in search-and-rescue zones for now. ”
“After collecting all the information, we can only assess all the allegations and the situation at this time. ”
Italian officials have been monitoring the "Youth Rescue" ship since October.
Its crews are suspected of carrying migrants transported directly from small boats by small boats, allowing smugglers to flee in hastily, repurposeing the ships.
At least one such meeting was allegedly occurring at a sea 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, according to prosecutor's documents. The contents of the document were published in Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of blatant disregarding the authority of the Italian coast guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area for humanitarian enthusiasm rather than any other motive.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuvenda are clearly required by an Italian police officer to supervise their activities on board.
Currently, only three of the nine NGOs involved in the search-and-rescue operation have agreed to compliance with codes of conduct, namely, Save the Children, the Malta-based Maritime Assistance Station for Migration and Pro-Ecita Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said Thursday that it did not believe that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable, because they did not bring any "significant changes and obstacles to its rescue operations."
Among the organizations that refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning Médecins du Monsecutors (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has plummeted in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the protection of the coast of Libya and the joint local mayors have begun to bear fruit.
The minister said: "In recent days, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel."
He unveiled plans for in-depth talks this month: discussions with the mayors of Libya on economic development and discussions with Chad, Niger and Mali on how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave those countries to Europe.
Lian Ping, chief financialist of the Bank of Communications, said that due to the end-of-season characteristics of industrial value added in the first three quarters of 2017, industrial value-added growth is expected to accelerate to 6.6% in December.
The cumulative growth rate of fixed asset investment in December is expected to be 7.2%, which is the same as the previous month and lower than last year.
Industrial production, while weaker in October, is essentially flat with November.
In December, China's manufacturing investment was running at a low level, but infrastructure investment improved slightly, so it is expected that fixed asset investment will be flat in November that month.

Beijing "university to ease" new measures: North chemical industry tens of thousands of teachers and students will be stationed in Changping new campus
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Beijing University of Chemical Technology was held on the 2nd in Changping District, Beijing, and the 1800-acre green campus was officially put into use.
The reporter learned from the ceremony that in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital, the governance of "big city disease" in recent years, in the context of the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the easing of non-capital functions, Beijing has accelerated the promotion of central urban colleges and universities to the suburbs to ease, and some teachers and students of some universities are moving to new campuses in different suburbs such as Shunyi, Daxing and Fangshan in batches.

Michelle Carter Sentenced for Texting to Kill Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide via text message and phone call.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20, will serve a 15-month sentence, which can be converted to a suspended sentence after the expiration of the period. Another five-year suspended sentence is added.
Carter was sentenced in June to a crime of no intentional and pre-prostin murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at a hearing on Thursday: "My family is heartbroken.
My son is my best friend. ”
While awaiting an appeal, Carter was allowed to maintain his personal liberty.
She faces up to 20 years in prison, but her legal team believes both she and Mr Roy are mentally ill.
At sentencing, Carter stood, wearing red trousers and beige hoodie, his hands clasped, his eyes tearful, and his eyes facing down.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life for herself to live better.
She was not held accountable, the prosecutor said.
"She doesn't have any remorse."
But Carter's attorney said it was "a terrible consequence, and she has so much regret."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find her "age or maturity, and even her mental illness, which would have any significant impact on her behaviour."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said, "I don't have a day to be sore for not losing my beloved son."
I want him to be proud of what I have done to me and for what I have done. I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my sufferings, and these sufferings will be with us forever, ” the statement said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "trance rathed ra" for realizing that she could never attend her brother's wedding or be his child's aunt
"It's a pain to lose someone who has been with me since my birth, and it will be with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case appears to set a legal precedent, because the law in Massachusetts does not provide for instigating others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning inside the car; this year, Carter was 17 years old.
Carter's text message revealed after she was egging on him to commit suicide, and the case sparked national concern.
"There are many ways to hang, jump, stabbed herself," she said in several text messages she sent two weeks before his death; he was on vacation with his family at the time.
During the time before he committed suicide, she wrote, "You need to do it, Conrad" All you have to do is start the generator, and then you will get free and happy. "
Judge Moniz said Carter came to gain attention through Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are legal differences in opinion in this case.
The number of people defending Carter is one of the few, Amanda Knox, who was charged with the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and acquitted two years later.
Ms Knox, 30, said in an op-ed published in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment."

Reporters learned from Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club on the 2nd that recently, the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth Team won the fourth place in the National Youth Basketball League Finals held in Beijing.

Automakers face shock, Audi to retrofit up to 850,000 diesel cars
Audi announced the modification a day after BMW said it would provide a software upgrade for more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW's chairman said BMW believes "driving has more smart options than restrictions, meaning that European major cities - including Munich, where BMW's headquarters - is considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles."
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would retrofit three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
No company has claimed the move as a recall.
European carmakers are heavily promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by the diesel engine are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset diesel exhaust emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to keep diesel cars competitive in price.
As German carmakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of allowing too powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The car companies are trying to avoid repeating VW's mistakes by masking its so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions to comply with regulations when they are tested for cars, and returning to normal conditions of normal driving.
Multiple VW executives have been charged in the U.S., and others are under investigation by countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zachero Giovani Pamio, who is Italian and therefore unprotected from extradition, may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, which the German government accused Audi of installing the system to evade European emissions requirements, expanding the scope of the investigation previously limited to the United States.
Audi's investigation could have a major impact on Volkswagen: luxury automakers take possession of Volkswagen's disproportionate share of profits.
A film from preparation to release, lasted a year or two or even years, can be described as commonplace.
The animated film "Big Fish Begonia" has announced that it will be released on July 8th, which has been 12 years from preparation to its release!

"The Big Fish Begonia" tells a fantasy story that belongs to the Chinese people. With the announcement of this scheduled trailer, it brings new expectations to all viewers.
Liang said: "These 12 years have only done this thing, and now it's a dream to a reality, I'm both nervous and excited.
Zhang Chun said: "I always think about using the budget of fifty others to make the same picture effect as other people, and the team has to be driven crazy by me."

Provence lavender threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but there is bad news now that it is being threatened by climate change.
Lavender is decaying due to persistent drought and the emergence of virus-carrying insects, leaving scientists and farmers trying to find solutions headaches.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute (CRIEPPAM) in Provence, said: "Provence's lavender is facing a huge threat because the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with heavy rainfall in the spring and raining in the autumn.
This affects the life cycle of lavender.
There's also a smaller singles, a leaf cicada that can spread tiny bacteria, and in very dry weather they'll appear in large numbers. "
The key is that it is huge.
In addition to attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is sought after by the perfume and cosmetics industry in addition to attracting holidaymakers.
Eric Chase said: "In contrast to plants that can open many large flowers and have long ears of grain, we have problems with smaller individuals, stunted, missing or weak.
So we have less content on essential oils. "
Solutions under study include better irrigation techniques and slowing the evaporation of soil moisture, spraying clay and water on plants with protective mixtures, and developing more drought-tolerant varieties.

Mexico is in danger, journalists killed
The entire staff of the Riodoce weekly newspaper typically rallied on Wednesday to review their reporting plans for the riots in Sinalo, which were caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and an endless war on drugs.
But today, the shadow of tragedy hangs over themselves, and they come together to discuss security.
They are told to change their daily habits, which is important.
Two senior journalists discussed which one is even more secure: whether to bring their children to the office (the office was attacked by grenades in 2009) or should leave them at home.
Security experts write three words on the blackboard in front of the room: Enemies, neutrals and allies.
They let these reporters in each column the following names of the following names, it does not require evidence, observation and intuition is enough.
There are suspected drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists, or cartels on the government's list, which the villains put Mexico's reporting into danger.
Violence has never stopped, and there are more and more journalists, including more and more journalists: according to the records of the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Benzaneto's rise in December 2012; 589 journalists have been protected by the Federation after being attacked and threatened; so far, at least seven journalists have died in seven states so far.
The last dead was their editor and inspiration, and Javier Waldiz Cardenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
Valdez has written a lot about drug violence, and he wrote in one of them: "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist."
Everyone could feel deeply that he had left, and while he was everywhere in a huge photograph hanging on the front of the "Riodoce" office building, Valdez stood up with the middle finger, the terms "justice"; Aaron Ivara and Miriam Ramirez were also showing his smile on the T-shirts worn by these two thirty-something journalists, and he wore glasses or his signature Panamanian straw hat.
The seminar took place less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and hypersepticism.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with the case of journalists, the Office prosecuted only two people, according to the records of the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Most of the thousands of crime cases are involved in drug trafficking and organized crime every year, so it is rare that the killers of journalists are brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they insist on reporting on the violence in Sinalo, although they are already heartbroken, though the land has been sore.
Ivara said there was no information on the killers and no justice, so it didn't work much to hold security seminars.
He said "It's stupid to waste a waste of time attending such a seminar."
If we don't know why, you don't trust anyone. "
On the morning of May 15th, Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital, Culiacan.
His red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men only a few blocks; they forced him to get out of the car, and fired 12 guns, guessed because the newspaper's name was translated as the Twelve Rivers.
The gangsters left in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
He left his wife and two children who were already adults.
Culiacan rumors.
But the subject of Valdez, there was actually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinalo has become the country's bloodiest battleground, and rival forces have been frantic.
One or a few people are shot every day on the streets of Sinalo, and the graveyard is covered with two layers of mausoleums of the drug lords, which have become commonplace.
Temporarily forgetting the "calm" state is when there is only one time for a cartel to control the coastal state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdez knew the dangers of the job, the 60-year-old Riodice co-founder and director Ismail Bohomecay was guilty of not protecting his friends.
He believes two mistakes have caused this tragedy.
The first, February was published in the Damaso Lopez interview, where he led a cartel group fighting with several of Guzman's sons.
The report may have infuriated the sons; the newspaper was bought off by the suspected gang members as soon as it was delivered to the newsstand.
The second mistake was that after another newspaper that reported the same story had been confiscated, he did not force Valdez to leave Mexico for his own security reasons.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great significance to the violence against journalists in Mexico.
His spirit endures, and his friends and colleagues believe that he has been with us.
He was also a senior reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he co-founded Riodoce and sold a $50 stake in the year.
In Sinalo, Bohomecui said, "it's impossible to go into journalism without dealing with the drug problem."
As time went on, the newspaper gained a good reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish direct-to-hit investigative reports without fear of censorship, and readers also like newspapers to publish stories that others are afraid to report.
Riodoce won the Latin American Maria Mossibo News Award five years after its inception.
In the same year, the Society for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdez International Press Freedom Award in recognition of his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug coverage.
He admitted that he was scared too.
At the time of the award, the Association for the Protection of Journalists, he said, "I want to keep living."
Later in late October, he said in an interview on local television station Rompevedento TV that "in Sinalo, drug trafficking is a way of life,
You must take on the task of falling to your shoulders as a journalist, either so, or pretend to be deaf and dumb.
I don ’ t want to be asked, ‘ Face so many deaths, what have you done... why are you not speaking out about what ’ s happening? ’ ”
All of the staff of Riodoce miss Valdez, nostalgic for him as a dock worker, a friend who never begrudge hugs and suggestions, and the teacher who knows how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guyaabo bar, which is often across the office, always sits at the same table.
Now, they'll ask: Is his daily habit that caused his fall?
His death also made them have to think about how to do a good job and live well.
Bohoqui said, "They don't like you're giving them the women and children in trouble, nor do they like the secret airport that affects their legal companies and the secret airport used to transport drugs."
It's all over their bottom line. "
The result is that, even at the safest times, maintain a high degree of self-censorship and self-protection.
Believe in your instincts.
If you smell the danger, stay away.
Andrés Veril, editor of Riodoce, said the problem was, "The breath is a feeling of being deceived... and then something like Javier happens."
He and others say that the previous rules no longer apply to the Sinalo (Sinaro) as if it were no longer applicable to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and others, where smuggling routes were lucrative, agencies, corruption and miasma.
The situation is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodoce employees took part in security training, cell phones were suddenly not allowed; a few days ago, spyware allegedly sold only to the government had been used in Mexico to spy on journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers took a cool in the shade to dodge the high temperatures of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were sent by the state government to protect the office of Riodoce, which are located in a four-storey building in the middle-class block of Culiacan.
Some reporters half-jokingly chimed in not knowing that the police would belong to the governor ’ s own letter, which the governor ’ s own letter was not more than 50%.
Journalists have been heading to the mountains for months, where drug cartels are under real control.
This week's Riodoce mainly reported three big things.
Among them was the killing of the brother of the great former boxer of Sinalo, Julio Cesar Chavez,
There is also the disclosure of government funding in the governor's hometown,
As well as the kidnapping inside an expensive restaurant in Culiacan, the restaurant is only one block from the prosecutor's office.
The official did not release information about the subject of the abduction and the abduction process, so it takes care to write what the city knows: that is where the restaurant is a place where drug dealers and officials love to go.
A journalist learned from the public archives that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), which dominated all political classes almost throughout the last.
Recently, several Revolutionary Institutional Party governors have been accused of embezzling in several highly regarded cases.
Verari asked reporters to write about what had happened at the site of the incident, including the fact that a son of Mexico's top drug lord Guzman was hiding from the military attack.
If a few months ago, readers would look at Valdez's column to find the most powerful message about the kidnapping.
Forty-six-year-old Villarille, who called "skinny" because of his thin stature, "he said" before, we already knew what was going on. "
Now all of our sources of communication are cut off.
Valdez's office is now used to store logos and stickers for protesting the killing of journalists, as employees become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, the journalist Miriam Ramírez grabbed a sign and walked out of the room and went to the local prosecutor's office to attend a march related to another journalist.
Salvador Adame is missing in the western state of Méukekee three days after his killing.
An official found a charred body and said that according to DNA tests, this is his body.
Nationwide, journalists have become more outspoken, they organized protests, painted with the words "saved the media" on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, Director Boholqui is not in Washington, and he is working to get justice for the Valdez case and to enlist international support.
The day after Valdez was killed, in a meeting with the governor of Sinalo, Ramirez accused the official spying of journalists and killed them because they had given the facts.
Given that her anger has affected her objectivity, she also asked to step down from her post covering government affairs.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that journalists in Mexico are "encircled" by organized crime, co-habiting government officials and indifferent societies.
In his last book, Drug News, he wrote that journalists were not only mutilated by drug cartels, but on the list of politicians and security forces who were contaminated with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 blames more than half of last year ’ s attacks on police and public officials.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they let you die in order to silence you."
Apparently, the murders were chilling.
No one forgot that six years ago, the blogger Maria Elizabeth Marcias died on the border north of Tamaulipas.
Next to her body a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “I ’ m here for my report. ”
Her head was cut down, next to a computer keyboard and headphones.
After the killing of Miroslawa Brecchi in March, some newspapers chose to close, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of Chivaw State.
Others continue, and the directors of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo were killed in 2014, but they continue.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used a front-page news to open the conversation about the drug cartel, with its headline read "What you want to get from us"
Some of the journalists fled their home country or even left the country.
It is a difficult choice.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still need to be careful and alert to danger on the streets.
Sometimes they would be arrested, and in 2015 photographer Ruben Espinoza was killed in a Mexican city and four women after fleeing Veracruz three months later.
For those who stay behind the scenes, it's a daily dance for high-risk decisions.
Ivara, who had wanted to be a poet, admitted that reporting on the drug trade made him fearful.
He said, "Mexico is turning into hell, so I became a journalist."
In the middle of the night on a recent Friday, the latest issue of newspapers had been printed, and the editors of Riodice sat outside the road outside the office and drank beer, and suddenly their phone rang.
A series of gun battles with gang hostile forces and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatán have been confirmed to have died.
The war is still escalating, as the series of cartel messages uncovered in the region foreshadowed.
They uploaded the news to the Riodoce website on the roadside via their phone.
The next day the headline had to change.
The siren sounded near the Rama area of another life-or-death due battle.
Boholjeeked a glance at the police stationed to guard, to see if they were alert.
If they're a little scared, then they don't show it either.
The paper's founder had been killed, and on his large portraits, his middle finger pointed to a place that the entire state of Sinalo looked out, and that all the staff of Riodoce followed in his footsteps.
Boholcue said, "How can you even want to close it? On the same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the street to participate in the report."
China's self-driving tourism market size or break through trillions of yuan in 2020
[Abstract] In the context of consumption upgrading and the prevalence of free travel, self-driving travel is encouraged by national policies and the love of more and more consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving travel market, which is expected to break through the trillion scale, is also facing a double challenge.
In the context of consumption upgrading and the prevalence of free travel, self-driving travel is encouraged by national policies and more and more consumers are loved.
But at the same time, it is expected to break through the trillion-scale self-driving travel market but also faces a dual challenge, on the one hand, the development of the self-driving travel industry and market demand is not proportional, self-driving tour clubs and travel agencies and other self-driving tour organizers are facing a meager profit dilemma; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services faced by self-driving travel travel are still in its infancy.
Approximately 60% of the total number of domestic tourists, the market size is expected to break the trillion
In the whole year of 2016, the domestic tourism of 44.4 billion people, self-driving travel accounted for about 60% of the total number of domestic tourism, and the size of the self-driving tour market is expected to break through the trillions in 2020.
According to the statistics of the China Tourism and Boat Association on the number of self-driving trips, the number of people from driving has continued to grow in the past five years, and the proportion of travel tourists to the proportion of domestic tourists has stabilized at more than half.
At the same time, regions and countries have shown more attention and support to the emerging field of self-driving travel, and from 2016 to 2017, policies and regulations related to self-driving, passenger cars and camping tourism were introduced intensively.
In July 2017, eight departments, such as the National Tourism Administration and the State Administration of Sports jointly issued the "Car Self-Driving Sports Camp Development Plan; In the same month, the Action Plan for Promoting the Quality Improvement and Upgrading of Rural Tourism Development by the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance and other 14 departments jointly issued the Action Plan for Promoting the Quality Improvement of Rural Tourism (2017)", and the self-driving tour was highlighted.
The introduction of policies provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self-driving travel.
The profit of the self-driving tour club is meager, and the complete industrial chain is the key
Although the domestic self-driving travel market has great potential and national policies are actively guided, the self-driving travel industry is still in its infancy.
According to the "2016-2017 China Self-Driving Tour Development Report", domestic self-driving tour clubs, car clubs, car clubs, etc. have reached thousands, but the proportion of tourists self-made self-traveling has accounted for the majority, and the proportion of tourists participating in various institutions such as Car Friends Association and Self-Driving Tour Clubs accounts for only about 15%.
At the same time, the independent research and development of self-driving travel products online travel enterprises and traditional travel agencies are also a handful of, many online travel platforms sell only some suppliers to provide self-driving travel products, some self-driving tour clubs are also an important supplier.
From the perspective of organizing self-driving travel activities, it covers "eating, living, traveling, traveling, shopping, entertainment", and the degree of fragmentation is high, the upstream supply chain is heavy, and the random consumption of tourists is large.
Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of Beijing Sky World Automobile Club, believes that the self-driving tour club is essentially similar to that of travel agencies, and the main profit model in the early stage is dominated by offline activities, and the core point is self-driving travel line products and leadership services.
However, now the line product homogenization in the field of self-driving travel is serious, the leading service level is uneven, and the self-driving tour club is facing the need for another transformation.
It can be seen that self-driving tour itself is not an independent industry, but with its self-driving tour displacement characteristics to form a cross-regional and industry ecosystem, the formation of a complete industrial chain is very important.
Experts point out that in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important consumer element.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving travel industry, it is necessary to enhance the characteristics of the experience, develop the theme of "self-driving travel +" and the IP of self-driving travel products.
The scenic path is not only the road, the car camp should not only meet the accommodation
In the face of the rise of self-driving travel, the basic supporting development of self-driving travel is also relatively small.
Li Guanjie pointed out that the tourist scenic path is not only a road, but the need to integrate the elements of transportation and tourism, but the construction of roads and tourism itself is responsible for the two departments, the transportation department to increase the tourism elements, but also stay in the construction of toilets, consultation centers, propaganda columns and other facilities, and the combination of tourism is not high.
Compared with the well-known self-driving tour route "American 66 Highway", the construction experience is worth learning from.
The landscape design is no longer the most direct and fast path between the departure point and the destination, but follows the design concept of "experience the fun of driving", providing self-driving tourists with the best enjoyment of the beautiful scenery along the road; the scenic path can connect the dot- and square-like tourist landscape, which not only preserves the historical value and cultural value of the ecological tourism resources along the route, but also organizes various thematic activities to enhance the participatory and recreation experience of tourists, creating economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to scenic roads, the camp is also an important supporting facility for self-driving tours.
But among the self-driving tourists as the Beijing News reporter knows, there are not many consumers who choose to stay in the camp.
They believe that many camps are biased towards infrastructure construction, can only meet the eating and living, the grade is not high, the product is single, can not meet the needs of self-driving travel, which contains many elements.
Some people in the industry, who do not want to be named, many companies that have done camps in the past few years are for the land, after taking land, the later supporting infrastructure construction and services have not kept up, and many of the operating conditions are losses, and there is no later capital injection, it is difficult to do some corresponding supporting products.
Category: Consumer groups
According to the data released by the China Tourism and Boat Association in 2017, from the perspective of age, the self-driving travel group is concentrated in 21-40 years, especially at 31-40 years old, this part of the population has a certain economic foundation, and the demand for personalized tourism is high, and it is mostly parent-child travel customers.
From the accommodation survey, self-driving travel people prefer non-standard accommodation relatively more.
From the perspective of self-driving travel type, the surrounding self-driving car is the most important type of self-driving travel, accounting for 84.32%.
Outbound self-driving is a lot of people's yearning, but the proportion is still small.
At the same time, with the improvement of consumer demand, tourists who used to like self-driving "touring attractions" have begun to change their concept, and no longer "get off the car to take pictures and get on the bus to sleep in the process of self-driving travel", but pay more attention to the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs use camouflage to escape enemies
At first glance, it was terrible, but it looked like a statue.
The researchers published the first research results on the discovery of a rhino-sized, mercurible biological fossil found by Canadian miners, pointing out that the fossil is well preserved, so experts call it the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world" ra china
The fossil is well preserved and can even be determined that the color of its squambed skin is reddish-brown. This shows that it has had some "annoxing experiences" trousing.
The report in the journal Contemporary Biology describes it as "the best-preserved dragonosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered nodosaur species that lives in the middle of the Cretaceous period of 1.1 billion to 1.1 billion years ago.
Its state of preservation was extremely intact and shocked by the researchers, who described it as "really breathtakingly comly by the
According to the National Geographic Journal, the herbivorous dinosaur fossil is the best preserved fossil of the same species ever found.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the fossil while mining at the Senkol Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
At that time, he came across something that seemed to be little like the surrounding rocks, so he decided to look at it carefully.
Later, the fossils he found were sent to the Royal Canadian Terrell Museum of Ancient Biology.
It took six years for the researchers to show the beast the beast hidden inside the 2500lbs (1100kg) of the soil.
After such a hard work, the final result is now announced.
"If you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Taylor Museum. The creature is on display at the exhibition hall.
"It will be one of the most beautiful, best-preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science - the Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world."
The researchers, by studying its skin, found that the herbivorous creature, while draped in armor, was like a foot-to-pass tank, but could be subject to a major threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The species of dinosaurs, draped in heavy armor, used red-and-white camouflage to avoid predators and used a covert technique known as "anti-shading", which was also used by many modern animals.
In this way, experts say, it's better able to blend in with its surroundings and thus avoid the enemy, suggesting it's being preyed on by the larger dinosaurs.
The 1.1 billion-year-old creature, part of a member of the nod Dragon family, made headlines for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyres' ancient biological museum.
After Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who is one of the team members, took 7000 hours to carefully lift the behemoth, researchers now study it, and it is named "Borealopelta markmitchelli china"
The samples were so well preserved that Dr Mitchell, as well as the international team of scientists, could record the patterns and shapes of their scales and armor.
They found "anti-shape", a common way of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the creature's back is darker than its side's color.
Although "anti-shading" techniques are common, the results found are surprising because the dinosaur is so much larger than the existing animals that employ anti-avoidance.
The dinosaur was under pressure to be hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs, thus evolving in a favorable direction, allowing it to hide in the confrontation as a means of survival.
However, most extant animals that use anti-authracity, such as deer, zebra or armadillo, are as small and fragile as prey, suggesting that the creature is facing real existential pressure.
"The wild-predation of large heavy-duty dinosaurs shows how dangerous the Cretaceous carnivorous dinosaurs were," Brown said.
A chemical analysis of the organic complex in its scales also indicates that the dinosaur's skin color is reddish-brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the creature's life cues, including the stomach-laden content it retains to find out the last-dated food.
They believe that the dinosaurs fell into the river while they died, then rushed into the sea and eventually sunk down in the bottom of the ocean.
At the time, Alberta's climate was as warm as the climate in southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans could be deeper inland than they are now.
Brown said: "This nodule dragon is truly amazing because it is completely covered with preserved squamous skin, and is still preserved in Vii space, so that its original shape can be preserved."
"So the creature's present shape is almost the same as it was when it was in Cretaceous."
You don't have to rebuild it with too much imagination; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping. "
The Cretaceous period was a period of bi-footed large-scale-cosal dinosaurs roaming on Earth.
Although Tyrannosaurus rex is the king of the dinosaurs, it only appeared for millions of years after the jaster dinosaurs. The jaster dinosaur may have been killed by some of the ancestors of the Tyrannosaurus rex.
They include a high spindle, a behemoth weighing up to 6 tonnes and a length of 38 feet (11.5 meters).
Scientists who have found the latest study in the journal Contemporary Biology believe that nodule dragons are washed up into the sea after death, and then the mummy forms in the dirt.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink excavated the creature at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved dragon in the world, and the skin and armour in the area from the nose to the hip are intact.
The creature averages about 18 feet (5 meters) and weighs 3000lbs (1300kg).
It has two 20-inch-long, sharp angles protrusions from the shoulder.
The researchers believe that this herbivorous mevae dinosaur is currently operating in the western Canadian region, and then washed into the sea by a flooded river.
However, the dinosaur was buried under the seafloor to preserve its shawl.
The fossil remains of this particular sample are well-preserved, leaving the residual skin still covered with concave pieces of the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic, the degree of preservation is as rare as it is.
The more I look at it, the more I feel it's unbelievable.
The remaining fossils of the skin still cover the mottled armor on the skull of the dinosaur.
Its right front palm is on its side, with five toes unfurling upwards.
I can count it off. ”
The reporter learned that the natural or plant source of seaginal acid, rota and amino acid-like carriers into the urea production process can be modified and synedic, the formation of seagain acid urea, urea, wetland urethra, wetland urea efficiency than ordinary urea than ordinary urea increased by 5-10 percentage points.
Environmentally friendly, crop yield potential is obvious, especially large particles value-added urea is a high-quality raw material for BB fertilizer.
The total number of security personnel is double the number of security at the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest-ever security linkage program.
Previously, the Brazilian government said a total of 8.5 million people from the military and police would work together, including 220,000 servicemen and 6.5 million police officers.
Most of the servicemen will be responsible for defending the Olympic venues, while the 3000 additional military personnel will be responsible for the security of the international airport, subway stations and streets.
Police patrolling other parts of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is reported that six thousand military personnel have arrived in Rio to serve Olympic security services.
In addition to being in charge of the four-pronged area of the Rio Olympics, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport and on the main roads connecting the airport and the Olympic venues.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service industry is no new thing, and in order to make the evaluation mechanism effective, it is important to make supervision more effective and not formal.
How Radicals Learn to Answer Answer: Who's Streets ✔
On August 9, 2014, BrittanyFerrell was troubled inside.
On the first day of your trip to New York City, the St. Louis man sat on a Airbnb-paying bed and browsed Facebook on his mobile phone.
She stumbled across a post from a high school student.
It read: "Police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and the child is still lying in the street loomed on the streets.
She found that there was no one else on the feed message to post the message, and she was confused. She turned Facebook down and opened the tweet.
A @ TheePharoah user keeps pushing her a dynamic Times.
The St. Louis area rapper broadcasts the death of Michael Brown live. Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man with an unarmed weapon, was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's body lying in the street where his body had lost vital signs, and his body lay in the street for four hours.
Crazy as Hurher thought.
But death is nothing new for her and the community she is in.
She put down her phone until the evening that night she opened the tweet and read about the gathering of people on Canfield Avenue.
There were police videos and pictures of people shouting, and a picture of someone claiming to be Brown's father, who read: "The Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son ? ," he said.
She saw a live feed, and a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barter.
In another video, she said, another policeman raised his rifle and screamed: "I'll kill all of you... brutes."
"It's not normal for Arrires to remember.
“It ’ s not what we ’ ve used to, and can be called a typical murder. ”
At that moment, I felt shudder.
I was angry and crying. ”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided the two men to travel to Ferguson the next morning.
For the next three years, what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson was the theme of a new documentary released in the theater on August 11th, "Who's Street ’ s ✔ ”.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of people who live in this community and demand answers in the streets.
When Ferrell and his daughter (wear a flower dress, with a crowned matchta) as they drove to Ferguson, the two re-discussed the topics they had discussed before that morning — “About the Black Experience and the Black State situation. ”
“Do you remember when I taught you when black people had to fight for their faith, ” she recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it's not right.
I had to take her with him after Irified Ferrell.
"What's happening today is the climax of everything in the past... orgasms."
She wants to know, see and rise from this.
Not only does she need to develop well in terms of activism and organization, but to understand the different dimensions of the black experience and the situation of blacks, to understand what we have to do in order to be free and liberated.
Even though I had the privilege of providing her with a racist experience she hadn't experienced in person, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I think I'm hurting her. "
They arrived at a site opposite the South Florida San Road police station, where the militant waited until the result of the final indictment of Officer Darren Wilson became their camp.
Ferrer and her daughter contacted a local business owner who made a bagged lunch.
They prepared the bags and were responsible for passing the bags to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrell began to form a new type of activism.
"My activism changed radically after August 9th," she said. "When she was an undergraduate at the University of Missouri at St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Nurses Association, focusing on the food justice and health gap in the black community."
“I don ’ t have organizational experience.
That's all that. "
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with the film's co-director Sabah Foleyan during a night march.
Foleyyan said she and her director of photography, Lucas Alvarado Falre, "just wanted to record" what happened.
The question came to the mind of Ferrell: "Do you want to record or want to find a story that you can use."
This suspicion stems from a lot of such cases: people - often whites - enter a community to reap the benefits of its pain and tenacity.
As Foreyan explained in a recent interview, "We've heard that people who grew up in Ferguson don't concentrate their voices, and we want to do it differently."
Fulaiyan has been in contact with co-director Dimon Davis. Dimon Davis is a regional artist known for his activism against the death row.
His involvement led Ferrell to join six other locals in the "who-sced Street ’ s réspocampus team, which has been unabashed for a few years after Brown's shooting."
"This documentary isn't someone talking to us or talking to us, it's our statement," Davis said.
"I'm mainly concerned about how these characters are presented, because it's also how I'm presented."
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrell ’ s experience – but to show the movement “not about the Savior leader, but about community cohesion, ” says Fulicalyan – which proved to be the most open-to-motivated participant in film.
As a result, “who ’ s streets ’ éve a surprising record of Ferrell ’ s personal life, such as falling in love, stepping into marriage. ”
“I felt like I ’ d be naked when I first laughed when I saw the finished product.
"But I understand that doing this work and humanizing blacks, there must be a certain degree of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story reaffirms and repositioned the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Event Campaign.
Two of the movement's three founders -- which created #Black Lives Matter on social media following the 2012 shooting of the black teenager Treval Martin -- were identified as queer.
“Black queer women in leadership have generally supported this movement, ” said ’ s said,“ that ’ s because we ’ re fighting on multiple fronts.
Black queer women have to bear it all. "
Fuleiyan agreed and mentioned that "this movement really got the support of black women and many black queer women."
Because of her identity, Ferrell was chosen as the core of the film. However, she insisted that "it is not an affirmative action for things dras in action."
"She was the one who inspired that energy, AMA, she said.
"Although she's on the front lines, it's not a coincidence. Because in these crossroads lives, as a black queer woman, you have a lot of things to do."
Through the screen, you can feel her energy. "
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have long since disappeared, but the tense race between the community and police remains.
Because of trying to block the highway during a parade, Ferrell was sentenced to a two-and-a-half-year suspended sentence.
She described the socio-political atmosphere of the region she calls her family: "A mess."
Still, since taking to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has stuck to the chants she has tried to remember.
“We have a responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We are no more infallible, except the chains of the body. ”
In fact, online translation services were already available on the web ten years ago, and in fact, long ago, the theory that "machines are about to replace humans for translation" were endless.
Resemblance: Artist creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
There are multiple faces in the center of the Brooklyn Art Gallery's gallery: white, black and brown, with almost imperceptible parallels between each face, which are tied by lines hanging from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg using the cheeks twigs and hair crumbs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent hair debris from the Livenworth prison for leaking classified diplomatic cables through the WikiLeaks website, a former intelligence analyst who was sentenced to 35 years serving a serving sentence.
The exhibition, which opens on August 2 with the title "Contemporations 燨
It was the result of two years of communication between Duvie Hagerbo and Manning, with Dewey Hagerborough combining his discipline with his own in technology, computer science, and the arts, and Manning, a prominent dissident who was in prison, and had completed sex reassignment in prison. Former U.S. President Barack Obama pardoned her remaining punishments for three days before the end of his term.
By analyzing the algorithmically from Manning's DNA, and creating a "highly likely appearance" of 30 portraits. Withatilou-Haburger thus made a sharp and slightly unrelenting comment. His comments were both for the polyuseousness of DNA and for the concept of identity itself.
Manning, who was born under the birth name, was Bradley Edward, who publicly pleaded guilty to identifying herself as a woman during adolescence. He was convicted in 2013, involving 20 charges, including six espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photo, black-and-white selfie with a grainy sense, looking visibly unsettling, sitting in a driver's seat, wearing platinum-golden wigs.
In 2015, Hiseduway Haburg had a huge success in her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
In that piece, she uses medium court evidence from cigarette butts and gum, extracted from the debris, to create portraits of 3D characters that may be similar to their looks.
That ’ s when she received an email from Paper magazine.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a portrait," Heather Deejene-Hagberg told the media at the opening of the exhibition.
At the time Chelsea Manning couldn't visit or take pictures, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
As a result, the artist and her incarcerated muse became an impossible pen paler, exchanging many letters with each other over two years.
They even created a comic book, The Repressed Avatar, which was drawn by Shoili Kanungo, which predated that the president could give permission to Manning in the future, and she was able to see the exhibition in prison.
Obama, on the other day after the book's publication, asked for her release. It was perhaps a coincidence that Manning spent exactly the seventh year of his time at the Kansas military prison.
In addition, this exhibition has another layer of deep meaning. Because of the contemporary United States, the Trump administration has constantly declared war on government leakers and transgender soldiers, while finding new ways to hype on Twitter to blatantly incite division, and this exhibition is precisely to bridge such divisions.
Asked about all this special timing, Heather Deehuwi Hagberg said, "Anything happens for a reason all the reason."
In an artist ’ s statement written on the gallery wall, Manning ’ s super-large signature was below (i in the name“ drew with a heart) calling for an end to the “families of partisanship based on gender, sexual orientation and culture ”.
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, with pencil twisting twisting kun, writing the symbol Cs, Gs and As.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleotides, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heusedeway Hagger hopes to express, at least in a physiological structure, by depicting these strangely similar portraits, which everyone is like.
"I hope people get out of this dilemma, our genome doesn't care who we are, how the published genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is," said Hessedouwi Haggeg, whose 2007 video piece "Falotimes" is also on display.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so it's 30 of them."
The last work in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page in the above illustrated novella.
A display of U.S. soldiers holding loudspeakers, King Kong-styling Manning, a trumpeting.
"When they make your speech stop, they win," the wall wrote.
"So don't shut up."
"The content came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm afraid again, I still have to say."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person yet, as foreseen in the comics, but when she does, she'll be made up of her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters in the pavilion center to get cheers.
It was also purposeful, as with all the items in the exhibition, reached the height of her genetic hapterary message (5.2 feet, Manning's height) written in pencil.
“In the past, I ’ ve hung them on the wall, but I want them to feel like a bunch of people, ” said Dewee Hagerborg when he said of the portrait.
"But I think it's like a group of protesters who follow Chelsea, just as people were protesting to release her."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff are wanted for homicide
Police said a man was found to have suffered a fatal stab wound inside a luxury apartment in Chicago. A North-West professor and an Oxford University employee was subsequently wanted and is currently searching for the suspect across the country.
Cook County Court records show that on Monday, 42-year-old Wyndham Leesme and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were issued without bail for murder warrants on suspicion of Trenton H. James Cornell Durrelo's death.
According to document records, 26-year-old Cornell Duranlo died due to multiple stabbings.
A community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
After receiving the call, the police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment and found that the victim had multiple rifts on his body.
Police say Cornell Durandro died on the spot and detectives are investigating the killing of him, and that police are actively searching for the two suspects.
Leeseme has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K · Cobage, deputy chief of campus relations, said in an emailed statement that Leseme has now been left and has been barred from Northwestern University campus.
“Now that this is a criminal case, the relevant authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation. ”
Warren is a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesperson for Somerville College, Oxford University, said in an emailed statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist the US investigative agency on demand."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped he would be able to turn himself in.
Anthony Gullemi, chief liaison officer for the Chicago Police Department, said he strongly encouraged the suspect to turn himself in to the authorities.
Gullemi said, "The police already have an approximate idea of their whereabouts, and we are trying to locate a possible location."
Gulemy said local, regional and national authorities were doing their best to assist in the search of suspects.
Gullemi said police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager, who had just received a secret tip saying there was going to be a situation at the 1008 apartment.
Police said the situation was terrible at the time.
Gullemi said it was still unclear whether the incident also occurred on July 27th.
He said that, according to security cameras, it was confirmed that Lesem and Warren were in the building at the time.
"We believe Professor Lesem and the victims have a certain relationship with the victims, said Auriglimi.
The management team at Grand Plaza issued a statement to residents: "The police are currently studying the timeline and background of the victim's case and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said, "We will complete the World Anti-Doping Agency road map in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitali Mutko said the implementation of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) sub-suplicity of the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would not take too long.
"Implementing the Roadmap standards have been at a certain stage and RUSADA has been given the right to work with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency) on planning and testing.
The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard, Aura Mutko said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko made the above statement in commenting on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency Road Map Compliance, which set out the criteria for restoring RUSADA rights and was recently posted on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the criteria do not contain anything that could cause Russia's concern.
He added, "Everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented."
And the results will be submitted to the IOC and WADA in the near future. ”
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency must publicly accept the findings approved by Canadian lawyer Richard Michaelen on the Russian state's support for doping in sport in its own country.
Speaking about it, Mutko said: "We are investigating and our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind this, and we don't admit that there is something that doesn't exist. "
Mutko's remarks responded to Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's independent public anti-doping commission.
Smirnov, in an interview with the media outlet Rating in the early day, acknowledged the problems of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency in the past, but added: "We have said many times on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations."
No one had planned to accept the report unconditionally, said, "Aimmirnov said.
After the November 2015 doping scandal, WADA suspended RUSADA's right to carry out doping checks in Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director-General Olivia Nigueli said during a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" in an effort to restore its rights.

No need to find a substitute! These 8000 products have zero tariffs
At a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on November 11th, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Commerce said that up to now, there are 15 free trade agreements that have been in force in China, involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8000 zero-tariff imports.
At the same time, imported cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean red wine, ASEAN tropical fruits... you want these products no longer have to spend a lot of money on behalf of the purchase.
At present, China has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, and there are 15 that have been in force, covering more than 8000 zero-tariff imports.
Taking agricultural products as an example, with the implementation of the free trade agreement, consumers can taste agricultural products from different countries and high quality and low price all year round.
For example, ASEAN's temper, lychee, dragon fruit and other tropical fruits, import tariffs from 15% to 30% reduced to zero tariffs.
Icelandic salmon import tariffs from 10% to 12% reduced from 10% to 12%;
Wine in Georgia and Chile, with import tariffs reduced from 14% to 30% on tariffs;
There are also New Zealand's beef and milk powder and other specialty agricultural products.
Take industrial goods, for example, for example, some of the Swiss cosmetics import tariffs have been reduced to zero;
Some watch import tariffs are reduced by 50%, and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years;
South Korea's refrigerators, rice cookers, massagers, beauty equipment and other products import tariffs reduced by 40%, and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years;
There are also more substantial tax cuts in consumer electronics.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the FTZ also include many intermediate products and raw materials needed for the manufacture of domestic terminal consumer goods, which has also promoted the structural upgrading of domestic consumer goods to a certain extent.
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Commerce said that nearly one-third of China's total imports can enjoy the treatment of preferential tariffs on the FTA, most of which are terminal consumer goods, which brings tangible benefits to consumers.
Further reduction of import duties on consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted the import tariffs on some consumer goods, and further reduced the import tariffs on consumer goods, covering food, health care products, drugs, daily chemical products, clothing, shoes and hats, household equipment, cultural entertainment, daily department stores and other consumer goods, involving a total of 1878 tax numbers.
The average tax rate for this batch of consumer goods will be reduced from 17.3% to 7.7%, which is almost "blocked"!
Since January 1, 2018, China has also made partial adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
lip balm, eyeshadow, perfume and other parts of the cosmetics import tariffs from 10% to 5%;
After reducing the tariff, it means that consumers do not need to buy, and they do not need to run abroad to buy foreign products.

News: U.S. malls at the end of the year rule vary widely for shopping returns to be cautious
China New Network December 29th
According to the U.S. "World Daily" reported that just after Christmas, it ushered in a wave of returns.
About half of the goods sold last Christmas last Christmas were returned, according to ABC.
In addition, some readers have repeatedly broke the news online shopping has been cheated, and consumers need to pay more attention when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but if you buy gifts or e-commerce from some small shops, you must be careful.
Ms. Rolandoka's Ms. Hou, on December 1st, local time, spent 60 yuan (in dollars, the same below) in an online store that bought a coat, and the results have not been sent until now.
She sent an email to the customer service and didn't reply.
Another netizen broke the news, last year to the United States travel, to third-party sellers to buy a mobile phone, sent it found that it is a box of rubber mud.
After knowing that you have been cheated, you can apply for a refund to the website, and it is good to get a full refund.
But there are also customers who believe that the website refund service is not one hundred percent perfect.
Mr. Wang, a resident of Northern California, said that he had purchased an accelerated delivery service for a website twice, and once accelerated the service of four dollars, but did not send it on time twice.
Refunds were later requested and no reply was received.
There are better return policies for large shopping malls or shopping malls.
Macy's is a full refund for most of Macy's products within 180 days.
However, the goods must remain "original" and need to have a purchase certificate such as receipt or bank purchase record.
If there is no voucher, customers can also get shopping mall points, which can be used to purchase other goods.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for general goods, and electronic products are usually 15 days.
However, the return period for electronic and entertainment goods purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017 was extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day refund period is calculated from December 25th, which is to be returned before January 25, 2018.
The ultimate shopping experience, the development of shopping in the business circle a new era
More than a decade ago, China was still in the seller's market in general, and people's choices were limited and the demand was limited.
But after a decade of development, the market has long since realized the transformation from the seller market to the buyer market, and today's consumer tastes have become more difficult, and they are no longer satisfied with the simple "hands-on hand-delivery" shopping behavior.
As a result, how to get consumers to a ultimate shopping experience has become the next competitive point for real estate developers.
Among the many factors affecting the consumer shopping experience, the shopping mall in the business district has the most significant impact.
See how urban builders everywhere focus on the shopping experience.
There are no two identical leaves in the world, and there are no two identical shopping malls, and a famous shopping center must have its own characteristics.
For example, Turkey's world-famous Kanyon shopping center, whose unique wavy architectural design is inspired by the Grand Canyon (Canyon), so Kanyon, named homonym, walks in the 200m walk in the Kanyon as if in the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon design, there is also a large-to-express large-eval performance venue in the center of the shopping center, which is unique in shape and often hosts special performances.
Because of the open platform design, visitors can walk on every layer of activities in the "gorge", and have the effect of changing scenery.
In China, Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, known as China's first forest-style strolling consumer farm, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
7000 square of the square, 3000m square meters roof water platform, the project consists of nine single buildings, the interior between the buildings, the overall sinking courtyard design, the edge of the French sycamore tree for the surface of the building, the roof of the water roof, the sky platform, to create a forest-like feeling.
Walking into the forest molar, it is like accidentally falling into the rabbit hole in Alice's roving adventure, climbing along the trunk to surround the building, the grass, the springs, and bringing people into the forest full of vitality and vitality.
There are also in Chongqing, Longhu to build the Lijia Waterfront business circle, planning a hundred-party business, plan to introduce more than 50 international top specialty flagship stores in the future, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 famous domestic and foreign brands, to become a service industry agglomeration, the theme of distinctive business center.
Not only that, Lijia Waterfront Business Circle will also integrate ecology into architecture, TOD public transportation as the guide, set fashion shopping, life services, catering, entertainment, education, sports in one, to bring consumers the ultimate shopping experience at the same time lead them to enjoy Chongqing's unique "waterfront culture", the shopping and water entertainment, leisure perfect integration.
In summary, it can be found that at present, some housing companies have learned of the discovery trajectory of this new urban business, and industry insiders said that this consumer experience as the center, how to combine shopping with experience of consumption models will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
Now the business circle is not only a hub for goods, but also a comprehensive place for the integration of art and culture and creative themes, and also carries people's responsibility for urban housing.
Therefore, while meeting the one-stop material needs of consumers to eat, drink and play, maximize the multi-level spiritual needs of culture and art, and play the livable residential needs, it is bound to be the commanding heights of the future development of the business circle.
In Chongqing, the north bank of Guoxing Jiangshan, located in Jiangbei, close to Guanyin Bridge, the world's commercial essence, the international giants around the ring, first-class brands gathered, close to international fashion connection.
It's bustling and the essence of the world;
Dongyuan Jinyue has a better shopping environment, Dongyuan Jinyue near the Nanping business district, exclusive to the west and even the country's leading four-storey three-dimensional transportation system, improve shopping comfort.
In addition, the landscaping and landscape pavement of the two pedestrian streets of Huicheng Road and Wanda Plaza have been upgraded, and the construction of about 300 plants has been planted, and the land has been transformed into 40,000 square meters, which has enhanced the image of the Nanping Business Circle;
And Longhu Yuhu Lake One, near Chongqing's first low-density waterfront business district, surrounded by nine parks, the density of commercial blocks is low, the degree of openness is high, so that people are more willing to stay, stop, slowly enjoy the fun of shopping, rather than being behind by the flow of people rushed forward, the real realization of "walking commensation communicity shopping"
Today's business competition will only become more and more fierce, how to kill a bloody road in a serious homogenization market, and win the reputation of the "shopping mecca" in the hearts of consumers in the future, which deserves all real estate developers to seriously think about.
It is not enough to use the differentiation strategy alone, only those who really really put consumers in their minds, eager consumers are in a hurry, think that consumers want, and provide consumers with the ultimate and minimalist shopping experience can laugh in the stormy market.
Of course, in the end, I thought it would be most happy with the people of Chongqing, having such a good shopping experience and business district, and no one could imagine the bustling of today ten years ago.
Festival: Consumerism carnival to cover up real environmental prices
1682 billion yuan, this is the 24 hours of the "Tmall Double Eleven Global Carnival" on November 11, 2017, and the turnover of Tmall users.
Specifically, after the opening of the "double11", the turnover of Tmall broke through 100 billion, 6min05 seconds more than 200 billion yuan, and broke 100 billion in nine hours.
On this day, the total number of payments done by global consumers through Alipay reached 14.8 billion, an increase of 41% from last year.
These purchases will bring 8.12 billion logistics orders.
Whether it is the Tmall online shopping platform or Alipay payment platform, all belong to Ma Yun's Ali Group.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that the "Single Day" subculture created by single young people for self-deprecating self-deprecating "Single" will be collected by e-commerce, becoming today's phenomenon-level "double 11" shopping carnival.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba first used the "Single Festival Promotion" marketing gimmick: no one is in love with you, so "single dogs" are coming to the Internet shopping bar.
The result is surprising, this day Taobao mall ("tmall" predecessor) transaction volume exceeded 52 million yuan, which is 10 times the amount of daily transactions at that time.
Since then, "Double11" has become the shopping carnival built by Alibaba, from the beginning of the domestic buyers and sellers to entertain themselves, and now the influx of global merchants, nine years have passed, Tmall "double 11" hundreds of billions of transactions is already more than 3200 times that year, so that "Black Friday" is uncertain.
Follow the trend of Tmall "double eleven" promotion, there are many e-commerce, of which "JD" is the most powerful.
"JD" has its own shopping festival "6.18", but there is a big impact of "double 11", this year from November 11th to 11th, "JD" cumulative sales reached 1271 billion yuan.
After the "double11", it is followed by a similar "double12" discount carnival and Christmas New Year shopping period.
Crossing the New Year, waiting for Chinese consumers and the New Year's purchase period before the Spring Festival, Valentine's Day shopping period, consumption, will not take holidays.
The environmental problems caused by the huge amount of consumption in a moment of instant consumption have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to the Xinhua Daily Telegraph, according to the usual conservative estimates of 0.2kg per box per box in the industry, at least more than 30 million tons of garbage were generated during the "Double11" period this year.
Liu Hua, director of the pollution prevention and control project of Greenpeace East Asia Division, told the Sino-foreign dialogue that the order volume of "Double11" only Tmall will produce 160,000 tons of packaging waste this year.
The State Post Office issued a report in 2016, pointing out that the volume of express shipments during the "Double11" period in 2015 (November 11-16) was about 7.8 billion pieces, using more than 3 billion woven bags, 99.22 billion boxes, 169.85 billion duct tape, and the length of the tape can circle the earth's equatorial 425 rings.
And this year, the State Post Office expects "double11" express business volume is expected to exceed 1.5 billion pieces.
Wang Shi, a manager of a waste incineration center in Beijing, told Xinhua that the garbage entering the site every day after "double11" has exceeded 2000 tons, which also exceeds the processing capacity of the incineration station.
The express delivery company has realized that the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry is not easy to look at.
Some e-commerce logistics companies, including Suning, have launched a reusable plastic delivery box before "Double11", which can be reused as a recycling bag and a circular packaging bag for garbage bags, etc., but the troublesome consumer acceptance is not high.
Ma Yun also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics ..." in Weibo

What kind of mobile payment do Germans want?
Zhang Dongfang: The mobile payment war opened in Germany is not expected.
WeChat Pay and Alipay have moved the battlefield to Europe, competitors have not changed, and the position has not changed to the Chinese, which is also global.
Where there is Alipay, there must be WeChat Pay.
According to the agreement of German electronic payment service provider Wirecard, WeChat Pay officially began to land in Germany in November this year, and gradually laid out the layout of merchants in Europe.
The two “fellows ” ’ exotic reunion took place in Europe.
All along, Alipay and WeChat Pay have been singing all the way on the road of globalization.
For the global way of mobile payment in China, Iri Consulting "China's third-party mobile payment industry research report 2017" summarized into two types: one is through strategic investment, experience output, equity and support foreign local mobile payment enterprises.
The second is to promote mobile payment services to foreign merchants through the consumption behavior of Chinese tourists abroad, and then change the perception and acceptance of China's mobile payment in China.
It's true that the Chinese have to get the world.
China's rapid economic development, coupled with the large population base, the cost of Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure.
But this is also doomed, this time in Germany opened the Chinese mobile payment war is not expected.
WeChat Pay and Alipay just moved the battlefield to Europe, competitors have not changed, the position of snatching the position or the Chinese, which is also global?
A more pioneering discussion is whether China's mobile payment can open up in Europe?
Take Germany for example.
The "new retail" that was spelled
Chen Xinlei and Yang Kaihan: Amazon announced its foray into bookstores and grocery stores when it squeezed into the world's top ten retailers, and it's worth it for both the timing and motivation.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two more bookstores in Portland and San Diego.
At the start of 2017, Amazon opened a storefront in New York and planned to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
At almost the same time, Amazon announced that its unmanned supermarket (Amazon Go) trial operation, customers do not need to queue in the store, do not need to check out, go to the door scan code, take the desired goods to leave, the purchase amount is automatically deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, in recent years, the frequent action on the physical store is very unexpected.
Because as early as the "Open Letter to Shareholders" in 2007, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon will not easily open physical stores unless the following four conditions are met at the same time:
1. We must be confident that this new opportunity can make shareholder investments return;
2. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great significance to the entire company;
3. We must be sure that this new opportunity is neglected by the market;
4. We must be confident that in this market we have the resources to make customer-oriented differentiation.
Bookstores and grocery stores, the most crumbling classification of the two brick-and-mortar retails, are also the first rivals to fall after Amazon's rise.
Amazon announced its entry into both of these physical markets when it squeezed into the world's top ten retailers, both the timing and motivation.
Is Amazon's approach, contrary to the guarantees in shareholder letters?
A similar voice was heard on the other side of the earth. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the Hangzhou Yunqi Conference in 2016, Alibaba's board chairman Ma Yun delivered a keynote speech.
“Starting next year, Alibaba will no longer refer to the term ‘ e-commerce ’.
The era of pure e-commerce will soon end, and the next decade, twenty years will not be e-commerce replaced by ‘ new retail ’.
Online and offline and logistics together, will generate new retail. ”
For a time, the three words "new retail" were as magic as being cast, and the industry was frequently hung in the mouth.
But what does "new retail" mean?
If it's just a combination of online and offline, then the concept isn't new.
In 2016, after tracking 1.8 of the largest e-commerce companies, e-commerce estimated total e-commerce sales of about $200 billion, and the largest of them accounted for more than $15.9 billion.
Of these 25, eighteen are traditional retailers that have only started online in the past five years (e.g. Macy ’ s, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
And Alibaba Group's 283 billion yuan in shares Suning Cloud Merchants, also in the eyes.
Globally, retailers and e-commerce are shifting from a single channel to covering the omni-channel retail system that covers brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce, mobile and social media.
Is Ma Yunti "New Retail", which is more a summary than a vision for the future?
If not, then what's the difference between the concept of omnichannel and "new retail"?
Perhaps the key to the problem is not whether online and offline will merge, but how to integrate.
Looking back at the retail industry in the past two decades, the rise of e-commerce, like the rise of discount retailers in the early years, has focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, e-commerce has moved products with a very high degree of standardization, such as books and CDs, from offline to online.
With the development of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, e-commerce has extended its tentacles to other categories and began to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, "Using the idea and technology of the Internet to comprehensively reform and upgrade the total number of existing social retailers of about 30 trillion, so that the increasingly upgraded consumer demand of Chinese consumers can be effectively met, so that the entire process of commodity production, circulation and service has become more efficient because of the extensive use of the Internet and big data."
Therefore, the road of e-commerce is a road of surface light assets and actual heavy assets.
"Light" refers to the burden of fixed assets, staffing, management processes and other burdens without the traditional retail industry; "heavy" refers to the need for huge investment in logistics, warehousing and so on.
The change of logistics methods ensures the efficiency of e-commerce.
According to the Chinese government network, Premier Li Keqiang chaired an executive meeting of the State Council on April 28th, which believes that expanding domestic consumer demand is an important measure for steady growth and structural adjustment.
The meeting determined that the relevant departments should urgently come up with specific plans on the basis of scientific evaluation.
Some of the daily use of foreign consumer goods with large demand for domestic consumers will be piloted to reduce import tariffs before the end of June this year, and gradually expand the scope of tax reduction goods;
In combination with tax reform, improve the consumption tax policy of mass consumer goods such as clothing and cosmetics, and adjust the scope of taxation, tax rates and collection links;
Add and restore duty-free shops at ports, reasonably expand duty-free varieties, increase a certain amount of duty-free shopping, and facilitate domestic consumers to buy foreign products in China;
Further promote the facilitation of shopping customs clearance and tax refunds for overseas travelers, and strictly implement the tax requirements for active declaration of incoming goods in accordance with the law.
Formulate a inspection and quarantine policy to support cross-border e-commerce imports, and clean up unreasonable charges for import links;
Accelerate the promotion of China's product brand upgrading project, support the development of physical stores, and achieve online and offline interaction.
Regulate the market order, strictly crack down on counterfeiting, and promote the survival of the fittest.
Let consumers be comfortable and easy to shop.

On January 18th, Alibaba held an e-commerce poverty alleviation summit dialogue in Chongqing, announcing that it will promote precision poverty alleviation and rural revitalization by exploring a new model of "Internet + poverty alleviation".
This is after proposing a rural strategy, launching a rural Taobao project, launching a rural Taobao project, launching an agricultural poverty alleviation platform, and setting up the Alibaba Poverty Alleviation Fund, Ali's "plus" plus raucance of poverty alleviation.
Poverty alleviation is one of the most important national strategies in China at present.
Comprehensive poverty alleviation has never been achieved in China for thousands of years.
"E-commerce poverty alleviation is an innovative measure for a new round of poverty alleviation and development, and is an important starting point for achieving precision poverty alleviation and precision poverty alleviation."
The central government attaches great importance to pointing out that it can play the role of the Internet in promoting poverty alleviation, promoting precision poverty alleviation and precision poverty alleviation, and letting agricultural products out of the countryside through the Internet. "
Therefore, Ali put forward a rural strategy as early as 2014, and listed as the three core strategies of Ali in the next 20 years with big data cloud computing and globalization.
In the same year, Ali launched the rural Taobao (village Tao) project, in the countryside to recruit "village two", leading farmers to get out of poverty and get rich through e-commerce.
In 2017, Ali worked with the commercial department to create a popular poverty alleviation channel, which has accumulated to connect 13 provinces and 120 national poverty-stricken counties in the country.
The Taobao Village, spawned by Ali platform, already has 2118.
Of those, close to 400 were in poor counties in the province, and 33 were in 13 national poverty-stricken counties.
In 2017, on Alibaba's China retail platform, sales in Taobao Village across the country reached 12 billion yuan.
Zhang Yong said that in the face of the national strategy of poverty alleviation, Ali has been thinking about how to use the innovation capabilities of Ali's economy in science and technology, big data, cloud computing, etc., and has come a new way out of poverty alleviation.
Among them, Murata is the main carrying platform for Ali's e-commerce to get rid of poverty, and has taken a new link of direct supply and direct sales of the Internet to get rid of poverty.
In the planting process, Murata and Ant Financial jointly carry out agricultural agricultural tools and small loan support.
In 2017, in the 832 national poverty-stricken counties, Ant Financial served 795, providing them with convenient payment, credit and other services.
Cainiao solves warehousing and logistics, Tmall is responsible for sales, Aliyun's big data feed guides agricultural production, and further improves the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of e-commerce out of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talents.
Ali provides e-commerce courses through Taobao University to teach farmers standardization, quality and large-scale planting methods, and realizes the combination of "poverty alleviation + support mind", so that farmers can be sustainably lifted out of poverty.
These courses already cover about 92% of national poverty-stricken counties.
The "public welfare mentality, business means" poverty alleviation ideas, but also to ensure that Ali in poverty alleviation to achieve "true comraits poverty alleviation"
Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba's board of directors, has said that poverty eradication should be divided into three stages of poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation and enrichment.
Poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish, poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish, and to get rich is to build a "fish pond" for farmers, so that farmers can raise fish.
The industrial poverty alleviation driven by e-commerce is to make fish ponds.
In terms of industrial poverty alleviation, the Luochuan apple industry poverty alleviation model created by Ali and Shaanxi Lochuan in cooperation has been replicated and promoted by relevant departments as examples throughout the country.
Ali e-commerce poverty alleviation has also been recognized by the decision-making level.
E-commerce companies represented by Alibaba have been sent to ensure that farmers increase production and income through online and offline channels.
Some village employees and Ant Financial employees were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of e-commerce out of poverty.
At present, the United Nations World Food Programme China Office has cooperated with Murata to carry out e-commerce industry poverty alleviation in Anhui and other places.
The "Third New Economy Think Tank Conference" co-organized by Ali Research Institute and China Vision Think Tank is held on November 16th, and Zhang Li, director of the e-commerce institute of the Ministry of Commerce, attended and spoke.
She believes that our globalization ignores the most important problems, which is the problem of globalization and its use, and the stage of globalization.
In this way, many people think that globalization has stagnated, and many developed and developing countries, in the new stage, their attitude to globalization is not the same, which is different from the model.
The second concept is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what is the constraint of the medium-term phase of globalization?
Constrained by the economic and environmental foundations, it is precisely because the economic foundation has changed globalization.
Zhang Li believes that the global economic adjustment at the end of 2017 basically ends, and it will enter a new round of growth after 2018, and the next round of growth must be a product pull.
Jingdong's first fresh supermarket 7FRESH has officially opened recently, and plans to lay more than 1000 stores across the country in the next 3 to 5 years.
Coupled with Ali's box horse fresh, Yonghui's super species, Suning's Su fresh, Meituan's palm fish fresh, etc., "New Retail Store" began to appear, and in the innovative mode and even price of each other "calling board"
The battle for fresh supermarkets has become a phenomenon-level topic in the new retail field, where is the new retail?
"In 2018, we will quickly enter the country, and we will open a lot of stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival."
Box Ma Fresh CEO Hou Yi revealed the "New Playing ..." New Playing  multiplied by the 2018 New Retail Summit on the 10th
"Since 2018, Box Horse is not just a fresh e-commerce, but a life-category e-commerce that meets the instant service of consumers."
The core model is drainage, experience, online is real sales. "
Different from the traditional hypermarkets, supermarkets, box horse fresh in the eyes of many consumers is a fun and delicious "net red shop", and even some intermediaries have played the concept of "box area room".
Online e-commerce platforms and offline retailers have their own advantages and disadvantages, but consumers are appearing in a variety of channels, so both sides are trying the omnichannel model.
The industry believes that in the context of consumption upgrading, there will be more and more "box horse" stores in 2018.
And the box horse from the initial fresh to continue to explore more consumer areas, indicating that in the new year, the retail market will appear more innovation.
"For example, the combination of online and offline business models, attracting the attention of consumers, all over the fresh supermarkets called and good."
"But these relationships are said much more, no use, and finally implemented whether you brought a good experience to consumers, I was willing to pay."
In the view of Yuan Bin, co-CEO of Drunfa Fei, in the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed, and the purchase demand has also changed.
The original pure online, offline is divided, the line to defeat the line, online to counter-offensive offline, now is holding hands together, because consumers no online and offline distinction.
The rush of capital into the market makes the new retail gunpowder, which is currently represented by fresh supermarkets.
According to the analysis, the current competition of new retail in first-tier cities is far from the pattern of the Red Sea, and there are still large areas of second-tier cities to be excavated, and there are still plenty of opportunities and space for the market.
Different types of industries for the layout of new retail, will bring the development of new retail into a diversified state of development.
CCTV financial channel and the Institute of Financial Strategy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, we have sorted out a dry goods, which is the heavy annual development report of China's e-commerce.
In this year, what kind of report card did Chinese e-commerce have come out?
What are the trends of global e-commerce?
We came to reveal it to everyone.
Total sales break record growth rate back to the accelerated track
Since 2006, China's online retail sales can be said to have been showing super-fast growth, estimated that at that time, it is estimated that online shopping is very fresh, do not go out can buy things, too cool!
However, since 2013, the growth rate of online retail has begun to fall below 50%, and in 2015, the growth rate was lower than 40% for the first time, and the growth rate in 2016 actually became 26.2%.
But this year the situation is not the same, online retail sales accelerated again, in January-September this year, the growth rate rebounded to 34.2%.

Help you avoid the company becoming the next Uber startup
Amy Errett once wanted to survey employee happiness at her e-commerce startup, but the survey had little effect.
The responses are often vague, unhelpful, and even worse, there are deceptive responses.
Even when she promised anonymity, some employees still distrusted the process.
Madison Reed, a San Francisco e-commerce care company that manages 75 people, said "the response to the lack of consistency and objectivity"
So she called for help.
A new batch of HR startups has sprung up to help companies understand how employees feel.
They build and authorize software specifically designed to measure employee engagement, allowing companies to quickly test targets specific teams and demographic groups, provide an anonymous and complaint hotline for employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass executives to report directly to the board.
“Now you can use tools like Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is the company ’ s Fitbit, co-founder and CEO of Glint, a ® Redwood City startup, said. Glint software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained more insight into what employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the rapid surveys and polls by specific teams, Glint offers company heat maps, which units complain the most, and which managers have low approval scores, at a glance – this gives her insight into the reasons.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must master the company's workplace culture and avoid becoming the next Uber. Former Uber employees have published a blog post describing the environment of harassment, which the speakers were punished by the company, and then Uber was caught in a scandal.
For startups like Glint, the company's desire to oversee this kind of oversight is a money-free business opportunity.
According to data from the financial technology analytics website Let's Talk Payments, the value of the global governance, regulatory and compliance industries could be more than $1,187 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a start-up in Denver, Colorado, is dedicated to helping the company prevent and detect bad behavior, and during the loss of Uber's reputation earlier this year, they saw an increase in interest and activity in this regard.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send custom "diagnosis" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides an anonymous texting hotline for employees to report bad behavior.
If the chairman is implicated, then the complaint will go straight to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive of Convercent, said: “The court of public opinion usurps the powers of regulators.
If a company is found to be treated poorly or unethical to employees, and if regulators do not intervene, the company may face the high consequences of consumer boycotts, employee churn, and involvement in lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain spanning over 500 locations and with more than 25,000 employees, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of work guidelines and work procedures, providing an easy way to contact company headquarters.
Before that, if an employee wants to report a problem, you must find a phone number or email at the company's headquarters to file a formal complaint, and hope that the headquarters will take it seriously.
It's often a daunting and unsettling experience, says James Witlanau, general counsel for Ruby Tuesday, who doesn't think there's a good way to track employee complaints.
But now the company uses Convercent to find and resolve issues that previously unknown to executives in remote offices, cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair wage behavior.
“I can learn more and more about the work experience at Across-360s at all levels, ” said Wittlarau, who is responsible for the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
“We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation. ”
Quinnland said that after the collapse of the Andorran accounting firm over the Anrico scandal in violation of ethics, companies began to place more emphasis on ethics, values and employee engagement since 2002.
But it wasn't until "social media came into their own world" that companies realized they couldn't stop their revelations from spreading viral online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people saw hope as a strategy ‡ ‡, he said.
Both Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service and charge companies for recurring charges for product use.
This business model and business opportunity is supported by venture investors who already support both startups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in money from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with its total capital rising to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million in funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, with total funding reaching $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness between companies, cultures and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing body of research shows that today's employees expect more about the workplace than they do before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high-paying water and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued, and spend their time with a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to join the company, feel their voices being heard, and the work they do is good, they are more committed to making the company successful ’ s Vice President of ’  UNICEF Global Wellness and Employee Experience, Nina McCartney, said.
Investors are paying off when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well when employees are loyal and dedicated.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it's not surprising that they'll be looking for financial support.
Workplace culture experts say it's important to have employee engagement data.
But unless the company's administrators take action, the data is useless.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can be expected to change.
If the change is not fast enough, or not, it can lead to disappointment and lead to employee disengagement from the company.
Russell Rasser, head of consulting at Cot International, a business management firm, said: "If you want to seek 4000 suggestions, then you need to be ready for 4000 conversations." He has seen some mistakes that companies rely too much on data collection.
"Because if the whole follow up, the employee will think that you really heard what I said?"
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I care? ”
Errett said Madison Reed now conducts monthly employee surveys and has been able to act on the day of the Glint report the issue.
After collecting feedback from employees about their frustrations about decision-making speed and quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by reorganizing the company's team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees, and in the long run, they hope to make a shift in the industry known for its high brain drain to better retain employees.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose talent," said the Au Vitlan诺.
"If you lose talent, you will lose customers."
And when you lose your customers, you lose the company. "

NCAA cancels twice-daily training, prolongs the Bears' daytime training time
As time approached 11pm, members of the UCLA football team lingered around the team's new campus practice field to chat.
Some players have taken off their sweatshirts, revealing sweaty bodies after the training camp worked hard on the first day of training.
For a large proportion of the team, this idle few minutes is the rest.
Players taking the summer course will return to the dormitory after three hours of practice to prepare for the final exam, and then 6 ’ the next morning ’ s Back to Wasserman Football Center for the conference.
“The next three days are a kind of running-in of the Austa Bear coach Jim Mora said as he enters Tuesday on Monday.
The NCAA canceled two daily exercises (aimed at ease the burden of players) but actually extended their training hours during the day - at least until Friday ends.
That's why the first three sessions at UCLA are scheduled to start at 7.15pm to accommodate the schedule players have squeezed.
From canceling two trainings a day to more one-time training, the Bears began training almost a week before last season, and Mora was trained at summer school for the first time in Westwood's six seasons.
They plan to start 18 trainings on August 20th before they begin preparing for the first Texas farm competition for the first game in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule-making, though it will add another project to the players' busy trip.
"With three or four days, we're going to impose a huge amount of training on them, which is very challenging Amiola said.
"They're also getting through. They're honed, they're all great kids."
I thought about Saturday, we'll have more time, really great. "
As soon as the training camp ended, UCLA would stop training. Given the proximity of the parking lot and the Luckin Center's clear line of sight, it wasn't an easy task. The Luxkin Center's senior hotel had been hurled through footballes that walked through the goalposts of the guard net.
Starting this weekend, Bears will be staying at the hotel. But Mora admits there may be problems once these rooms are vacant during the season.
“We ’ ll take security measures, ” said Aullah.
"It's a really worrying issue. The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in a room to record a training scene is not far-fetched."
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good.
But we'll take security measures there, and there will be security measures in the car park 8.
We'll use the available resources to do the best.
I'm not going to worry too much about that.
We have made plans. ”

Facebook to launch fact-checking feature to combat fake news
Facebook announced on Thursday that it would send more potential prank articles to third-party testing agencies and show the results below the original post. Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to crack down on so-called fake news.
Facebook said in a statement on its website that Facebook will start using newer machines to learn to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact-checkers, and may display fact-checking results below the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main points of communication for so-called fake news, and many believe Facebook has influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, with voters suffering a flood of fake stories before the presidential election in France in May, with Germany taking the lead in passing support for the penalty plan before the September elections, and being fined if social media networks fail to remove hate posts in time.
Facebook said in a separate statement in Germany on Thursday that it was launching a new fact-checking test in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Sarah Sue, product manager for Facebook News, said in a blog post: "In addition to seeing which stories are being questioned by third-party fact-checkers, there's a desire for more context to help them make informed decisions about what they're reading and sharing."
She added that Facebook will continue to test its "relevant article" feature and make other changes to its press feeds to reduce fake news.
Writing a Drawing Novel: The Story of the English Castle
More recently, the small Skatingney Castle became the protagonist in the compressed version of the music film, and at one point became a refuge for Mrs Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scottney has witnessed a 700-year tumultuous history in the cosy position of the Bayer River Gorge in Kent, and now it is an inspiration for the graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man who has a special hobbies on historical documents and has a mop head.
“You can see the handwriting of the ancients from 300 years ago, and I found it so beautiful, ” he said with a longing eye.
"What kind of interpersonal relationship is this to let this letter fall on my hands."
Across the Middle Ages until Edward's time, "A English Castle" read the books of the various families in Scotts, each of which was made by different, British future artists such as Isaackie Lenwicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes ’ first book to use the archives as raw materials: he also wrote The Tooths and Other Stories of the Dead in 2014, a book inspired by the English Library literature, a work he had accomplished with uncontrollable creative passions.
He said: "I can't suppress the impulse of my writing at the moment I saw the thumb mark left on the side of the letter, which was written by a double agent who worked for Jacobs in the 18th century."
That's his fingerprints!
And the letters smelling smoke all the time, because at that time, you need to light fire to have light.
For us 300 years later, the smell makes people feel like they're all around us as well.
Oh, I like archival literature.
For those who were impressed by the old paper, getting the support of the England National Trust and the Arts Council and living in the castle for nearly four months ("To be honest, I've been a little bit long" seems fantastic, and it's simply unconvinced to be true.
Rhodes spent several days visiting Victoria's "new" castles, flipping through archives, researching the treasures and antiques of the estate, such as the heads of hyenas hanging on the wall, and bottles that spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered over the land and ruins of the old castle, with the wanderers, gardeners, and sometimes chatting with the artist who drew the illustrated book for him.
Then at night, he'd "have a little bit of whiskey and write."
The secret history of the Scottni is not yet clear, as the "National Trust" has only fully entered after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth H’ Sea, in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff began to process the archives, and he described them as "hundreds of years ago the nobles are going to go," "Oh, put it in the attic."
Diary, letters from the English Empire era, a map depicting national boundaries: "You would think land disputes would be boring," Rhodes said, "But two families will fight for a birch tree."
Let go, guys
Some of the stories in the work use the castle as a starting point, and then to a broader perspective on British history, including "The Labourer", which leads to a man who left the new castle to participate in the 1381 peasant uprising.
“The story of the book, called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex, ” documents a riot in the castle in 1380, ” says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in that area, and I think it's a good place to start an uprising."
Maybe there's a connection between the two.
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit priest during the English Reformation for seven years.
Or "The Smuggler", the story's owner is the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have a funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a few years later his coffin was exposed to the ground, which was discovered).
The Darrells is Rhodes' favorite Scotti Castle family: "These gentlemen seem to be so rogue, always constantly borrowing money to buy what they can't afford to buy."
Generation after generation of Darrell men to solve their debt by marrying wealthy old women, I think they should be a group of handsome lads, how to pursue women. "
As his mission in the castle ended, Rhodes began to look for other bizarre writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness completing a drawing novel about "El?¤nm?¤nm?¤nm?¤ki" an early 20th-century sanatorium, which was slowly abandoned.
But Scottney has a special status for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"It's like: 'Oh, I've got to face the real life of the gropiures'."

Large energy companies are all "rich and hostile countries, so who are the best money in many energy companies around the world?"
Yesterday, the famous PFC Energy announced the top 50 ranking of the energy company listed in 2011, and U.S. oil and gas producer Exxon Mobil won with a market capitalization of $4.63 billion, followed by China National Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell.
In this list of PFC, PetroChina was twice won in 2007 and 2009, and the top spot for other years was all occupied by ExxonMobil.
In the top 50 list in 2011, a total of three companies from mainland China were shortlisted, in addition to CNPC, which is ranked 9th in China Petrochemical and 15th place in China National Offshore Oil.
According to PFC statistics, however, that although the current oil price is far higher than it was four years ago, PFC Energy CEO pointed out that there are many reasons for the low total market capitalization, mainly including the decline in natural gas prices in North America and the low activity of global stock markets.

U.S. changes green card rules
The media quoted President Donald Trump's speech as saying that the United States will introduce a new immigration program, changing the green card regulations.
The program is intended to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 people a year, and temporary work visas and family-facing visa applications will be subject to stricter restrictions.
The new rules were proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
The U.S. media quoted Trump as saying, "This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars, and achieve the above benefits by changing the way the United States grants green cards to citizens of other countries."
The law will replace the current program and reduce chain migration.
This new application process facilitates applicants who speak English, have financial support, and have skills that are good for economic development. ”

Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful
Just when you don't think 2017 will be even more eerie, the field of sex robots has released a new technology development report.
And yes.
Sex robots are a big deal.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report that looks ahead to the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Shaki, a professor emeritus emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield, we need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
In the new report, Shakie said: "People are laughing behind their backs, but the major companies have really launched a lot of sex robots, and we're going to see more."
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots, which have silicone skins, are very warm to touch, and have deliberately used artificial intelligence to set up human-like sexual reactions.
Users can also "customize" their bots to satisfy their preferences, ranging from eye color and nipple shapes to nails or color.
But even more troubling, a lot of robots with "personality" make it look advanced to "replicated a pampered wife."
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skins.
For example, RealBotix robots can be defined by the characteristics that users find attractive, such as shyness.
There's also a Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion, which pre-set character traits, including slightly shy "cold-catakilla" and "euro-even" "Wild Wendy loom"
“Roxxxy Gold robots have the personality that you ’ re as good as possible with the“ Eminte ” – The True Companion website relishes that.
So she loves you, evil you.
She also had little emotions like normal people in those days!
She can be lazy, she can talk, she can be 'sexually full' 燨
The rise of sex robots has brought a lot of unease that does it not just replace the real Human Relations of the People, but also the feminine characteristics of the grovelling and the stieving rape sinuness of the tinge (interpretation: resisting) Farah is the most worrying.
True Companion compares Roxxxy to a man's vibrating stick on its website.
The website says, "If women have a shaker, then why can't men have Roxxxy"
However, these sex robots are not a simple object, nor is it just a sex toy.
Their emergence and growing maturity point to the darker, deeper part of our culture: to escape from perfect gender equality to sex with surrender as an additional option.
Of course, most men do not have sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more and more popular, they are still on the verge of consumer culture.
But what permeates the edge allows us to see the process of our time.
Many people are not weird and not aggressive until the free market gives them a chance to become so.
It's no coincidence that these fine-grained sex robots have appeared in an era where the rights of women around the world are at stake, and it's no coincidence that the White House and a president boast of sexual violence against women.
The most a bold part of the TV series "The Story of Made a Woman" is not the realistic picture, it is not the body that hangs, it does not lie in the eyes that are exhumed, but in the unimaginable.
The Republic of the Gilead is a jump, but now it looks like it's not far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create the body that is most like the real woman as possible (although it is in the proportion of porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have a human touch and mimic the real human movements.
But bluntly, their "personality" does not represent real women.
They can't break up or go out.
They have no recourse to the agency or follow-up, no independence at all, and no possibility of breaking the outright illusion of slavery.
In other words, they are sex slaves.
Or in the popular saying of 2017: make women.
"The Great Wall" tells the story of a Chinese elite force in ancient times to defend mankind, in the world-famous Great Wall to carry out a life-and-death battle with monsters.
"Running Bar Brothers" has been recorded in the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter, "Running Men's Group" captain Deng Chao received a WeChat interview from the Shenyang Evening News and Shenyang Network reporter on May 30th, from the "study bullion" in the "running man" to the "bad villain" in the "bad man" Chen Ming, Deng Chao's impression of the audience is like "the starry Jun", constantly changing.
Deng Chao said, "In the performance, the same thing I won't do, to be constantly updated."
Trump's great merit?
Let Mitt Romney be the epitome of common sense
Political divisions have polarized American voters, while, from a micro-stature, undermine American family harmony. It's already a surprise to the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, major U.S. newspapers in the comments column are awash with the fear of how to respond to the vooch of Trump's relatives.
It is often thought that we are doing everything in our power to punctured our "filtered foam ®
Less speaking out is the power of Trump to bring his family together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago, who has long-term discord with the Republican in our home, is coming to New York this week to visit me.
She reminded me that rallied against a common enemy could have a powerful effect.
As a result of working with Trump at the White House, everyone she knows, even Republican relatives who have been in political bicker for decades, are now suddenly and strangely standing on the same front.
It's a good thing if it's all at the dinner table, but what strikes me is that from a broader perspective, it's going to be a big risk.
While leftists have been abetted by Trump, the warping effect of his presidency has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the possibility of concern that his outlandish behavior could stop one day.
Yet there is a more worrying long-term scenario in which Trump is going to "normalize" the relationship with right-wing Republicans, who had previously opposed Mr. President's standards, now suddenly seem to be a symbol of reason.
I found myself recently to have some nostalgia for the Mitt Romney version of the madness: put dogs on cars, 14% of income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), and for the crimes of those two moves compared to Trump, it seems too minor.
After the Trump era passed, the next Republican candidate would only need to sanely qualify for an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin lives in town, we took the kids to the Rotary Horse in New York Park, which was the largest carousal run by the New York Central Park administration, and if you don't need coffee, these three-dollar tickets are the most consumer-worth in the city.
The sound of the Trojan was as loud as thunderous, with central cylindrical designs for glass fibers, all the clowns and animals twisting their heads, looking terrorily and sinisterly on their own shoulders, while the tinting music rang strangely.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: from the landscape overlooking the high-rise buildings become old-fashioned, the skyline becomes too familiar to provide much excitement, and the reality of the city has not supported the dream.
Thirty-five years later, I haven't completely forgotten that day, and I found that this "Swiss cottage" is not actually a Swiss cottage, but a Swiss cottage in the theme bar "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage", which I can't remember, but near an intersection in north London.
However, Central Park's carousel remains a magical experience, and everyone has a lot of fun for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and an event where four girls in her 40s can all attend.
If I could rate the carousel, I would give it full, but thankfully no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before swiping my credit card, I was asked to score one to five-star ratings on my transaction "experience."

Does meat, dairy and chocolate help alleviate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
Meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study shows the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products can help relieve associated symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease has a life impact on about 1.3 million Americans and about 30 million Britons, leading to stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or hemorrhagic diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue, among other things.
Researchers at the University of Washington would generally recommend that patients avoid eating meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but the researchers found that the protein's key amino acid - tryptophan helps promote immune cell growth, and these cells enhance gut tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr Marco Colonna explains that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure harmful microbes hidden in food do not creep into the body.
Maintain a balance between cells that cause inflammation and those that improve tolerance, protecting the body without damaging all kinds of sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
When the equilibrium state is too skewed towards inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
A body of immunity was found in experiments that propulsing immunity in mice that carry special bacteria.
Bacteria need tryptophan (an component of the protein) to form the appearance of the cell.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a link between a bacterial population (which is a normal part of the gut microbiota) and the development of cell populations that can promote tolerance.
The more trytophan the mice in their diet, the more immune cells they have.
He suggested that if humans used the same method, namely Lululp Lactobacillus and a diet rich in tryptophan, might form a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barrawas studied a immune cell that enhances tolerance, and when she found that a group of mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain was fed separately.
She suspects this difference is related to the community of gut microbes in mice (referring to bacteria, viruses and fungi that typically live within the gastrointestinal tract).
DNA sequencing of the mice's cholesterol found that six bacterial populations were present in mice with immune cells, but mice without immune cells did not.
The mice were kept in a sterile environment, so they lacked gut microbes and could not appear this immune cell, and Lactobacillus was present to produce immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers culture Lactobacillus in the fluid and then transfer a small amount of fluid without bacteria to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells develop into cells with tolerance.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be shown that the active ingredient is a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, called indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the inmate levels were halved, the number of cells was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people, like mice, have the same cells that enhance tolerance, and most of us have Lulc Lactobacillus in our gastrointestinal tract.
Whether humans can induce the inmate-of-try by-products from Lactobacillus in the body, like the mice in the experiment, induce the cell development, and are not currently known, but genetic defects related to tryptophan are found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
“The development of these cells may be exactly what we want to get, because these cells can control the inflammatory response on the surface of the gut. ”
It is impractably that the high level of tryptophan present in Lactobacillus Lactobacillus may lead to an increase in the number of this species.
Jose Mourinho thinks United has signed a "genius" Nemani Matic
On Wednesday night, Nemania Matic after his debut in Sampdoria against the match, Mourinho determined that Manchester United had signed a "talent" midfielder.
Matic, who hails from Chelsea, signed up to £40m, opened 2-1 in the final preseason game of the league before the Europa League against Real Madrid on Tuesday, winning the favours of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, in the blues pre-season Asian Tour, Matic's game was woefully ill, completing only 45 minutes, with Mourinho admitting that improvements were needed before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has the experience, wisdom and the way he thinks about it, and he thinks about dhichi RAMHurour said.
"We'll help him get ready as soon as possible."
Mourinho began scheduling his starting lineup at the start of the season. Like Matic, new signing players Viktor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Ingbergas Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still wants to bring in three more signed players, but he insists the club is "did great work, that he has four preferred signing players in his heart and the club has brought in three of them."
"The club brought in three of the signed players, and I am very grateful," he added.
"If the club can bring in all four players, I'm happier, but they've made a lot of effort for me."
Will the world fall at the climax of the frigates in China if it does not build this type of warship will fall behind?
With the recent announcement of the construction plan of the new frigates by the world's major naval powers, as if the frigates have become the focus of the Navy's focus overnight, first Japan in the 2018 defense budget to determine the procurement of two new frigates, so that the Japanese DEX frigate plan finally has a substantial breakthrough, and then the United States Lockheed Martin recently announced the latest plan of the United States FFG frigate, so where should China's new frigates go?
With the launch of a new frigate of the new Type 054A frigate at the end of 2017, the 50A frigate has been built up to 29, which has been close to the sum of the 053H series of frigates, and the construction of the 054A has been launched from the first 054A in 2006 to the 12th year, even in the world, such a large number of high-performance universal frigates, in addition to China, only the United States in the 7th and 1980s "Peri" class frigates can be compared.
And the reason why so many R054As is built is that it is affordable, easy to use, and add years of Navy debt.
054A frigate with a high cost-effective and good combat effectiveness for many years has been favored by the Chinese Navy, its 4000 tons of drainage, equipped with a 76mm main gun, 32 unit sea flag-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missile co-launched vertical system, eight eagle 83 and a straight-9 helicopter, although it is 2006 began to build, the design time is a very early type of ship, but its combat effectiveness is not too bad today, the world's frigates can also reach the level.
But after all, this is a type of first-stage 21st century design of the ship, the weapon configuration on the side, its power system and electronic radar equipment and the current world's mainstream frigates already have a big gap, like Europe's same type of frigate has been equipped with full-electric propulsion, small multi-functional phased array radar, large-size helicopter deck, the time to develop new models.
Then it is directly related to how China's new frigates should be developed, which has a direct relationship with its future positioning and our strategic approach to the Chinese Navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will be completely become a blue-water navy, and the future will also be the ocean, with China's vital interests closely related to the region for rapid deployment, show the existence of force, if necessary, can have a strong combat effectiveness to ensure that China's vital interests in the region are not damaged, so it seems that the new Hu Weijiang will be towards large-scale, oceanization development.
Looking at the positioning of the new frigates in the future Chinese Navy sequence, the future Chinese Navy should be similar to the US Navy, in addition to the necessary offshore defense ships, other main ships will be necessary to form a carrier strike group or amphibious assault ship strike group according to the situation.
The role of the new frigates in the future aircraft carrier battle group should act as a position of anti-submarine main force and near-regional release, and should act as a escort ship in the amphibious assault ship strike group, so according to such needs, the new frigates must have a strong anti-submarine capability and a good intermediate-range regional air release capability.
Based on the above positioning, you can boldly imagine the future of the domestic frigates' approximate appearance.
First of all, the drainage capacity will have a substantial increase relative to the current Type 054A frigate, it is estimated that the drainage of the new frigate will reach 5000-6000 tons or so; the power system will use a QC280 to improve the gas turbine and two diesel engine composed of a comprehensive power propulsion system, the maximum speed is expected to reach about 30 sections, the endurance will also increase significantly; as for the weapon configuration of the 76mm main gun and the nearly anti-aircraft gun will be retained, but a red flag 10 launch system will be added, the main gun should have a 32-48 unit red flag16 improvement and the fish-to-ship carnage.The rear should install a large matrimon system of 8-16 units for launching Hawks18 and new cruise missiles; hangar and off-site platforms will also increase, reaching the parking and storage of two 10-ton helicopters; for electronic radar systems, high matching should be equipped with small four-sided fixed phased array radar based on the development of 346A, and the low-match can use a multi-functional rotating phase control phalancing array radar similar to that on the European frigate.
In this way, the overall level of the new frigate will reach the current level of the world, and even if it is not more than the US FFG.
Of course, the above concept is only the author's conjecture of the new frigates in China, and how can we only wait for the new frigate to go into the water before we can find out, let us look forward to it together.

In recent years, the city has encouraged enterprises to actively participate in the construction of national, industry standards and regional group standards, and give a 300,000 yuan reward to enterprises that mainly participate in the formulation of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards, and reward 500,000 yuan for enterprises certified by Zhejiang manufacturing brands, which is the highest amount of the province's reward, which stimulates the enthusiasm of enterprises to participate in the benchmark.
A few days ago, Wang Li Group production workshop, the group system leader Gao Jian and employees are packing a security door box, as a Zhejiang manufacturing group standard to meet the standard work samples, ready to be sent to the Shaoxing quality testing center.
Just two days ago, Wang Li had passed the on-site audit of the "Zhejiang Manufacturing" certification expert group.
Gao Jian said that the professional team composed of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations praised the group's achievements in the core of quality excellence, independent innovation, and agreed that it was fully combined, and as long as the product passed the inspection, Wang Li would become one of the first companies to pass the standard.
Wang Li Group is only a microcosm of the standard prying industrial transformation and upgrading.

China's household debt rate close to the United States is more terrible than can afford a home, is it difficult to pay for debt?
Recently, everyone is discussing what has the recent changes in real estate policy, is it that real estate policy is loosened again? The diversification of land policy supply providers will not let house prices decline?
However, when we are worried about real estate prices, worried about macroeconomic regulation, worried about the future trend of the real estate market, the People's Daily wrote again, the last time we devoted to the "People's Daily" review on the regulation of real estate regulation, and now the "People's Daily" wrote a more serious topic than not buying a house, this is even if you can afford to buy a house, debt?
Today, we're going to talk about the more serious problem than buying a house: repayment.
China's growing housing debt crisis
The overseas edition of the People's Daily published an opinion article on November 17th, "Profit for Credit and Loans. Worries for Youth", according to the data in the article, in November 2017, the "Three-quarter China deleveraging Process Report" released by the National Financial and Development Laboratory and the National Balance Sheet Research Center of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences pointed out that the leverage ratio of the residential sector still continued to rise, from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter of the quarter, up 1.3 percentage points, and rose by 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The proportion of debt in the entire real economy has increased, and the leverage ratio has risen rapidly.
Studies have shown that the liabilities of Chinese households in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, accounting for about 2/3 of residents' liabilities, which is about twice that of operating loans.
Among them, in consumer loans, medium and long-term loans dominated by housing loans account for about eighty percent, but from the incremental point of view, short-term consumer loans are growing faster, higher than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition, China's household debt rate only counts the total amount of credit obtained by the household sector from financial institutions, and there are many private loans from Chinese families, including borrowing from relatives and friends, and there is a large-scale hidden debt.
Seeing such data, people can't help but be a little jaw-dropping. According to the statistics of Suning Institute of Finance, the leverage ratio of Chinese residents in 1996 was only 3%, and only 18% in 2008, but the leverage ratio of residents has begun to grow rapidly since 2008, doubling to 36.4% in just six years.
In May last year, HSBC released a survey across nine countries, respondents close to tens of thousands of people.
The report was interviewed by “millennials ” young people in nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
According to the report, China's post-80s and post-90s high-level housing ownership rate for young people as high as 70%, far ahead of second-place Mexico (46%), which is also the two-fold level of the United States indicator (35%).
These data tell us a highly likely problem, which is that Chinese residents' biggest potential "gray rhinos" at this stage, compared to the inability to afford a home, it is estimated that Chinese residents will not be able to pay off debt.
Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have previously analyzed, although we have been saying that China's house prices are higher, compared with other countries in the world, China's housing ownership rate is actually quite high, so it is not so much that house prices can't afford to buy a house, I'm afraid to ask a lot of friends now is the question of whether you can afford a loan?
We look at the real estate market in the world, China's real estate market has started late, in addition to what we said Hainan, there has not been a major real estate crisis, but just a decade ago, the origin of the global financial tsunami in 2008 is the real estate crisis in the United States.
And the cause of the U.S. real estate crisis has been blamed on two homes: Fannie Mae and Freddie.
At that time, in the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold their houses to low-income people in the United States in order to expand sales, and when the U.S. economy was good, the real estate market was also thriving, but the sky was not long, and with the stagnation of growth in the U.S. economy, it caused the income of homebuyers to decline, so a large amount of household consumption expenditure began to decline.
However, at that time, the current situation in the United States was a component of financial assets and real estate assets of household assets in the United States, and almost all households in the United States were real estate, and most of the assets of the top 20% of the high-income group were financial assets, so the higher the debt ratio of real estate in the United States.
A serious fact is that these people are in the economy when they buy a house, so the money to pay mortgages is also calculated by their better income, when the income declines, the pressure of mortgages not only has not decreased or even because some subprime plans have become floating, so the real estate problems of these American families have gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
So some people because the income is too low to pay the mortgage, so the bank began to recover the property, when the bank from the loan home buyers after the property, they will be sold at a very low price, resulting in a gradual decline in the house price, the process has triggered a further decline in house prices, the formation of a vicious circle, when the house price fell to a certain extent, more and more buyers found that the value of their house is even lower than their own loans, so there are more people to stop repaying the mortgage, resulting in more bad debts.
Thus, a huge vicious circle is formed:
“The economy is in a slump, income declines as a part of the people can ’ t afford the mortgages Bank selling the houses of the under-age people at a low price? ’ s house rates, the house bill falls?
And the problem is not so, because the house price continues to fall, we stop repaying the house to the bank after you do not have debt, if the bank auction house to get the money you can not owe the bank's loan, then you still need to pay back money, simply say that you use the down payment of 600,000, loan 240 million to buy a set of 3 million houses worth at that time, when the house fell to the house worth only two million, you no longer loan to the bank, after the bank auction house, you not only lost their own down payment.
As a result, in this vicious circle after another, the US economy gradually collapsed, which eventually triggered the financial crisis of the United States in 2008.
Therefore, at this stage, the level of China's household debt rate to a high of 46.8% is a very need to be a very vigilant issue, this data is still lower than the level of developed countries, but the problem has begun to appear, the country has repeatedly stressed the deleveraging problem since last year, which is a very insightful judgment, if the family debt rate is allowed to continue to climb, it will inevitably lead to huge risks, so to strictly prevent the emergence of financial risks.
As a result, with the location of the house used for living, not for speculation, the country has accelerated the establishment of multiple measures such as multi-subject supply, multi-channel guarantee, rent and purchase, and further resolve potential risks.
For our personal families, we must give up the speculative thinking of real estate, buy a house when doing their best, to avoid their own family into a huge burden, only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt level is a healthy family wealth development path.

The green Sikorsky VH-3D (President also said Marine One) was an important exhibit at the White House's July 17th unveiling of the U.S. construction project.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials haveured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
Exhibits include Connecticut-made helicopters, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the records of the Marine Corps Helicopter First Flying Team (HMX-1), which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter, the White House military office asked the helicopter to appear on a daily order (FRAGO) that the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "special" event only 36 hours before it landed at the South Lawn for the "special" event.
The day before the event, Commander HMX-1 said in an email to the Deputy Commander of the Flying Corps at his superior Marine Corps Flight, "I just want to confirm that you know, because this event is highly valued."
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive at the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17 to attend the event at 3pm, leaving after emptior-knocking the lawn from 6pm to 9pm that day.
The message also said that in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, the return flight would require a second crew because of the duty time limit.
The original crew was on standby at the side of the helicopter during the event, while security forces personnel were on standby nearby when the aircraft was on the ground.
The record that Time magazine got was not clear about whether a second crew member was ultimately needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record states that HMX-1 had asked whether the event had violated the bill.
The commander wrote that “one question we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act and was told that there was no violation of it. ”
"It sounds like you're locked up ah, the deputy commander of Aria replied.
The White House defines the "Made in America" campaign as an official event and is therefore not governed by the Hatch Act.
But even official events are political.
At the event, the president pursued the issue of the Senate at that time: health care reform, and touted the control of government regulations.
The use of Marine One or Air Force One aircraft for propaganda purposes is nothing new.
Successive presidents have been required to travel on these planes.
However, it is not common to requisition them for photo-taking purposes only.
Trump received attention in February, when it was in Melbourne, Florida, where the presidential plane slowly glid and eventually stopped at the background of his first campaign rally, and his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the previous president's use of the presidential plane.
White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said, "The White House is thrilled by the 'Made in America' exhibition, which showcases products from all 50 states, all of whom are made of American materials by American workers."
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn, practicing accurately placing the president of the United States in the White House.
During Trump's G-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 practiced 58 landings at the White House.
One official said the U.S.-made activity flight was included in the crew's training requirements this month.
Helicopter forces also flew an extra 11 hours of "non-presidential support mission on the same day."
The White House said taxpayers were not responsible for any other props at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging a South Lawn Helicopter display.
The HMX-1 does not keep the budget records of the president's flight, so it is very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly cost record for the 2017 fiscal year, the VH-3D's Department of Defense can be reimbursed for $24,380 per flight hour.
Force records of the time each time the aircraft flew from the base of the Marine Corps Airport in Quangtico, Virginia, for 30 minutes.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower than the cost.
Walters said it was "very misleading to estimate the cost incurred by taxpayers based on reimbursable expenses."
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs included in annual grants.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the Department of Defense's reimbursements did not include personnel costs, but did include fuel, maintenance and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spike defended the use of the helicopter at the event,
“The idea is to show something made in the United States this week,
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, and they all contribute to our national security, and I suspect that even if there are hundreds of thousands of jobs to rely on it.
And I feel like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of countless Americans' hard work.
So it's not anachronistic to show this. "
We don't know if Trump interacts with the helicopter when he's on tour of the South Lawn at the event, but he did get on the fire truck's cockpit.
Within the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's company, joking with the media about the company's plane he owned.
He said, "I know the Sikorsky plane well. I have three."

According to the market star, from 2005 to 2011, our province's GDP rose from the middle to the "bottom" in one fell swoop to the second seat.
However, the economic growth of the province still has difficulties such as low investment efficiency and lack of core competitiveness of the industrial economy. To this end, the latest issue of the Economic Blue Page of the Provincial Economic Information Center recommends improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
Compare them with the national and central regions on the basis of some representative indicators of our province's economy in 2005 and 2011.
In terms of industrial economic benefits, in 2011, a considerable proportion of high-energy-consuming industries such as industrial energy and raw materials in our province, which are affected by market fluctuations and "double pressure", at the same time, the innovation power of leading industries such as home appliances and automobiles is insufficient, resulting in meager profits.
And a large amount of investment did not bring corresponding economic benefits, which is an important reason for the low quality and efficiency of economic growth in our province.
In this regard, experts suggest that effective measures should be taken to encourage enterprise innovation, and the scientific and technological achievements of universities and research institutes should also be transferred to enterprises in a timely manner.
For the economic benefits of the industry are not high, experts say that it is also necessary to actively promote industrial merger and reorganization, optimize the industrial layout, and extend the industrial chain.

The British Confederation of Trade Unions (GMB) is concerned about the investment in the University of McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union wants the management of the biscuit manufacturer McVeith to pledge a long-term commitment to production at the plant in Lago.
The UK-based trade union Scotland has said the company has been silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross plant.
The plant has more than 500 employees, producing products such as Hobnobs, Rich tea.
Pladis, the owner of McVietnamese, said the company had invested more than £5m in the plant over the past few years.
He added that if there was a change in plant operations, employees and union representatives "will be the first to know the rath
In a letter to the company's factory director, the Scottish branch of the Confederation of British Trade Unions called on McEase to "solve the problem of capital not being carried over to the modernization of the production line."
Drew Duffy, senior host of the UK-based trade union, said: "We can't be clear from the plant's general manager about the business needs and investment plans of Tollcross, which worries our members deeply.
Generations of families work here, and the high concentration of local communities and the Greater Glasgow area workforce is an important pillar of high unemployment and social deprivation of decent employment in areas.
Therefore, in terms of employment, pay and economic prosperity, in the context of Brexit, rising cost of living and a prolonged decline in manufacturing, there is an urgent need for McVie to expand the production network in the eastern part of Glasgow. ”
A spokesman for Pradis said: "The director of Tollcross had just received a letter from the UK Trade Union Scotland yesterday and the company will respond immediately as we value continued engagement with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with employees in Tollcross and representatives of the British General Confederation to discuss some issues publicly.
We've held discussions with our employees, and then, like all other companies operating in a competitive and uncertain environment, we've reviewed the ongoing operating model we apply to businesses and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5m at the Tollcross plant, particularly in terms of production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the historical status of Tollcross as a production site, and if there is any change in our operations at the plant, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to know. ”
China News Agency Tibet Presing Day May 11th (Reporter Chen Taobin) Nima Tsering, deputy director of the Tibet Autonomous Region Sports Bureau, said on the 10th at the North Slope Base Camp of Mount Everest that in the future, the domestic garbage clean-up of the North Slope of Everest will move from the past public welfare action to the normalized behavior led by the Chinese government and the participation of all walks of life in the international community.
On May 10th, environmental volunteers loaded the classified garbage into the truck.
In the past ten years, with the sharp increase in Everest mountaineers and tourists, the environmental protection problems of the peak location have become increasingly prominent.
In the spring of 1997, the Mountaineering Association of the Tibet Autonomous Region launched its first clean-up campaign in the North Slope of Everest, cleaning up a batch of domestic garbage such as oxygen cylinders left in the 1960s and 1970s. The video was also broadcast at the Tokyo World Climate Conference that year, causing world concern.
According to Nima Tsering, after 1997, the public welfare team has cleaned the Bei Poe of Everest, but the participants are mostly non-professionals.
Paris Saint-Germain warned Barcelona three years ago to sign Neymar.
La Liga may regret throwing olive branch on Marco Villati
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on signing Neymar after making a £189m offer to try to get it out of the exemption clause, but did they have warned Barcelona three years ago to launch an attack on the world record raider?
This sensational approach has opened the summer transfer window, with the French league club ready to break the world transfer record at a price of more than double the last transfer record. Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season with a amount of £89m.
Once the transfer is complete, Neymar will jump to become the world's most valuable player, and it will also be the world's highest-paid professional athlete, Paris Saint-Germain, to provide an after-tax salary of more than half a million pounds per week.
Barcelona, who is angry about Neymar's aggressive approach and breaking out of the way out, sources with knowledge of the Catalan board insist that the club has done everything in its power to take care of him after his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the Paris Saint-Germain president have made such predictions about the world of football three years ago?
When City expressed interest in signing Bryce Maddie in 2014, Nasser Alherifei issued a stern warning to any club that wanted to sign Paris Saint-Germain's best player.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they come into contact with any of our players, we are bound to be tit-for-tat with them, and we'll also contact their player, Hurryfly, to say.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to sign our players, then they're going to have their own consequences. "
Earlier this summer, the Spanish club appeared to cross the line, with Barcelona throwing an olive branch to Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Villati.
Paris Saint-Germain has made it clear that they will not allow the Italian international to leave anyway, and that Barcelona is likely to be affected by the loss of the mid-winged Neymar.
