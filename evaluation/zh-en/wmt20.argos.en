State-owned enterprises and dominant private enterprises entered the old region of the revolution in the south.
From 26 to 27 September, with a view to further developing the educational achievements on the subject of “Don't forget, remember your mission”, the Central Civil-Military Integration Office, the National Defence Institute and the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry organized a joint study on “State-owned enterprises and elite private enterprises entering the old area of the revolution in Kanan”, which reviewed the history of the revolution, pursued the red footprints, passed on the red gene, matched the needs of the city with the needs of the enterprises concerned and promoted the accelerated development of the old zone of the revolution.
The Deputy Director-General of the Central Civil-Military Integration Office, Kim Yong-hoon, the Deputy Minister of Central Integrated Operations, the Secretary of the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Deputy Chairman-in-Office, Seo Lo Jiang, the Director-General of the National Defence Service and Industry, Zhang Kee-hyu, the Deputy Secretary-General of Jiangxi Province and the Secretary-General of the State Department, Li Bing Jun, participated in the study.
The research activities were carried out by eight military engineering group companies, including China Aerospace Science and Technology Group Ltd., and 10 private-sector enterprises, including the Hunan Institute of Rare earth and Metal Materials, and 15 private-sector enterprises, such as Zimang Group.
In the course of this visit, the researchers visited the Central Red Army Commanders' Memorial Camp, remembering the pioneers of the revolution and receiving the traditional education of the revolution, reviewing the difficult journeys of the Red Army during its long march, conducting on-site research on seven enterprises and a testing centre in the city, holding special seminars, concluding eight cooperation projects and conducting on-site contracts.
At the symposium on research activities, the city presented its unique industrial advantages and promoted quality projects to participating enterprises.
China Armaments Industries Group Ltd., China Steel Research and Technology Group Ltd., Xianxian and Defense Technology Co. Ltd., and Jiangxi Kim Lilong Magnetic Technology Co. Ltd., respectively, made statements on behalf of the Military Industrial Group Inc., the People's Republic of China State Enterprise, private enterprises and local enterprises, stating that they would continue to strengthen the matching of the needs of State-owned enterprises, leading private enterprises with the needs of Jiangxi province and the city, gradually widening the area of cooperation, helping to transform industries and promote high-quality development in the old regions of the Revolution.
The study resulted in a better understanding of the unique industrial development advantages of the old region of the revolution in the south, the identification of priorities for economic and social development in the old zone of the revolution at this stage, and the firm conviction that State-owned and private enterprises serve the people and start their own businesses. It has played an important role in promoting qualitative, efficient and dynamic changes in economic development.

"The Chinese in My Mind" competition at Confucius College of the Royal Cambodian Academy of Sciences
The “China in My Mind” competition, the theme of the 70th anniversary of the New China, was unveiled and presented at the Confucius College of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Cambodia.
The award was presented to the award-winning guests by the Foreign Service of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, a representative of the Cambodian Councillors General and the President of the Jiangxi Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, Wei Shih.
According to Zachqing, the director of the Confucius College of the Royal Cambodian Academy of Sciences, two months later, the contest was directed at Cambodian primary, secondary and university students, including social workers.
The Foreign Service of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia also holds the award certificate for the first awardee of the University Group, Lin Weiji, and the first award winner of the Primary and Secondary Group, Guo Lina.
Zachqing indicated that the entries were divided into university groups and primary and secondary schools, and invited senior Chinese-speaking experts from Cambodia to evaluate the first, second, third and tenth and twentieth prizes.
The first prize winner of the university group, Lin Wei, said that 15 years of learning Chinese had had a tremendous impact on himself.
Through the essay contest, it was written about the well-being of Cambodia and the traditional friendship between China and Cambodia under the “across the road” and it was hoped that the younger generation would continue to add value to the friendship between China and Cambodia.
Here are the guests and the winners.
Guo Lina, the first prize winner of the primary and secondary school group, said that, as a Chinese diaspora, there was a different excitement when he was given the opportunity to express the feelings of “China in his heart” in his native language.
The organizers indicated that the contest not only created a positive atmosphere for Chinese-Cambodian relations, but also attracted more and more Cambodian students to study Chinese and study in China.
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) published a report on 26 September that Iran has begun to use advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, further violating the nuclear agreement reached with the world ' s major Powers in 2015.
Comprehensive media reports that the IAEA report states that Iran’s advanced centrifuge at Natanz Nuclear Facility “is accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium.”
Since the withdrawal of United States President Tripp from the nuclear agreement in May last year and the imposition of sanctions on Iran, Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the nuclear agreement reached with the major Powers in 2015.
The agreement provided that Iran could only use the first generation IR-1 centrifuge to refine uranium.
The other signatories to the agreement, the United Kingdom, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to save the agreement, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
According to the Japan Commons, in the afternoon of 25 local time, Foreign Minister Moikishi of Japan met with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York, United States, where he visited, confirming that he would move forward with the negotiation of a peace treaty covering the territories of the four northern islands (the disputed islands of Japan and Russia, referred to as “the four northern islands”, and Russia as “the South thousand islands”) and the development of relations between the two countries in a wide range of political and economic fields.
This was the first consultation with Russia since Shigeki took up his post as Foreign Minister, as the head of negotiations for the conclusion of a peace treaty.
Shigeki stated to the Russian side that “involving the promotion of common economic activities (on the four northern islands) he hopes that consultations will take place”.
According to the Government of Japan, there was no detailed discussion of the Territory.
At the Russian-Russian summit meeting in December 2018, the Foreign Ministers of the two countries, in their capacity as heads of State, confirmed their approach to accelerating negotiations.
At that meeting, the Foreign Ministers of the two countries welcomed the progress made in consultations on joint economic activities in the areas of tourism and garbage disposal.
Shigeki looked forward to the pilot tour operation scheduled for October: “I hope it will be successfully implemented and lead to the next step. It's not like it's a bad idea.
In addition, the talks confirmed that Lavrov would accompany the visit of the Group of Twenty (G20) Foreign Ministers meeting in Nagoya in November.
Tuionetoa was elected as the new Prime Minister of Tonga.
Nukualofa news: The Tongan Parliament of the South Pacific Island State elected the current Minister of Finance and National Planning, Posiva Tuionetoa, as the new Prime Minister of Tonga, replacing the former Prime Minister, Akilisi Posiva, who died of illness earlier this month.

In the parliamentary vote of the same day, Tuionetoa was defeated by 23 votes against his competitor, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Infrastructure and Tourism, Semisi Sika, and was successfully elected.
Tonga is a constitutional monarchy with a separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial branches.
Tuionetoa is also to be appointed by the King.
The next parliamentary elections will be held in 2021.
The women's platoon is expected to defend the World Cup early!
On 27 March, in a match against the Dutch women, the Chinese team was pushed back to the city in two consecutive games, culminating in a nine-hundred-hundred-thirty victory.
The World Cup is nearing its final stage, and while the crown is at stake, the Chinese women ' s platoon must remain indifferent to the Serbian team.
In the first two games with the Netherlands, the Chinese women ' s platoon was as strong as it had been in the past: 25:19,25:16, first down the two towns, until the third.
The Dutch women's ranks had increased their aggressiveness in the background of backwardness, and the Chinese team had been hit, and the girls had begun to attack, and their mistakes had begun to increase, and they had been driven back to a city at 21.25.
In his interview, Ryoping also said: "The third round, we gave about eight points because of the error. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Of course, the Dutch women's ranks were not to be underestimated, and the Chinese women were prepared to lose one game, but they were still in Rongping's hands. “It's normal to win and win with a strong team, and it's normal to play five games, so we said to focus on the team,” Rongping said.
In the fourth round, the team actively adjusted its position, Zhang Zhang opened fire at the end of the offensive and received eight points in the single game to win the team.
So far, 11 rounds of confrontation have been left with only two rounds left, and although one hand has touched the champion's trophy, a wake-up call has indeed been made to Chinese women in the match against the Dutch team: the more critical the moment, the greater the effort.
In another race on 27th, Russian and American women were full of five games, and the United States team failed to get three points from their opponents, so that Chinese women would be able to achieve their coronals in a round ahead of schedule if they were to score three points in the match against Serbia.
The situation is moving towards a favourable position for women in China.
However, while Serbia's team of six was in short supply, that did not mean that they would give three points easily to the Chinese team.
In its current form, Serbia’s team is already largely incompetent, which means that they can “go in the light” of the Chinese women’s race, drop their burden and hit their opponents with their full force, while China’s team is under a crowning pressure.
Moreover, the replacement of the Serbian team was not the lamb of “everyone to slaughter”, as shown by the depth of the battle with the Dutch team, which had been fought five times, and the Serbian second team, which had eventually reversed the whole of the Dutch force at 3:2.
Before the third phase of the competition, Rongping also said that neither the Hao nor the Sing team would be able to deal with it: “The game in Osaka will be very difficult, and we have to prepare carefully as always. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Now the horn of the coronation has sounded, and the competition has really reached the "white-hot phase."
As far as power is concerned, the Chinese women are above their rivals, but only at the last critical juncture. It is also important to see whether the girls are able to play their normal level and release themselves in the arena.
Today, the University of Macao (27) holds the Second Macao Dry Cell Seminar, which attracts over 100 specialists from countries and regions such as the United States, Singapore, the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao in the field of “extreme stem cell” research, to share and discuss the latest techniques and developments in stem cell research with teachers and students at Macao University.

Stoltenberg, speaking at the West Point military academy in the United States, said: “For 70 years, both containment and defence measures taken by NATO have been based on preserving technological advantages. It's not like it's a bad idea.
He said that times were changing.
Stoltenberg says, "We're experiencing increasing competition.
It is therefore time to redouble our efforts in order to be sure that no one will surpass us. It's not like we're going anywhere.
He said: “Some new technologies are not developed by NATO member States, but in authoritarian countries.
Chinese companies are studying the 5G network.
Russia has developed an independent Internet and invested heavily in developing the next generation of weapons, such as high-sonic missiles. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Stoltenberg said that NATO's future security “ depends on its ability to understand, accept and apply state-of-the-art technologies”.
On September 24, “a ticket to take me to see” the heart-helping event took place at the top of Changsa Orange, and more than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to board the Orange cruiser to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
Most of the more than 100 disabled people who participated in the event were first on a cruise ship.
Zhao Jing, aged 56, is a crippled person, who usually rarely goes out because of his mobility.
He said, “Today, for the first time on a cruise ship, it was very exciting to appreciate the splendor of the Yangtze River and to feel the pulse of long sand. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Volunteers from Fukang Social Workers Service Centre and Blue Sky Rescue Teams in Changsha City provide nuanced services to the disabled.
In particular, for highly physically handicapped clients, volunteers carry them on and off the cruise ship.
The director of the Social Services Centre for Social Welfare and Work said that, over the past 70 years, with the support of the Party and the Government, the cause of persons with disabilities in Changsha city has continued to evolve, and that a growing number of persons with disabilities have become real participants, contributors and beneficiaries of socio-economic development, and that caring for and caring for persons with disabilities has become a social consensus.
The Republic is about to celebrate its 70th anniversary, and the spotlights in the media on every street have soared so many images that we don't remember, flashing – they are the ones who bring heat and light to our bright days, silk and silk...
However, a hero who walks around looks like you and me.
Yuan Yong-Ping, a researcher in sublime rice, has grown a variety of seeds, so that billions of people will not be hungry again, and will be able to do a great deal of work, as an old farmer who likes to be in the field; Nan In-dong, a leading scientist who thinks so much about making China's "eyes" angry, does only one thing in one person, life, a pot, does one thing in his life, chews a cold collage in the mountains of Guizhou, and the old Han in his castle; Zhou Chang, a red scientist, a very late village boy who still looks like him, learns from the middle west, with a white hair on top of his head, says that learning comes to the heart, likes a big laugh; and Qinya, a film artist who spends half a day in the mountains, is over 90 years old, and is running around the highlands every day. Six or seven hours and happy to be an unknown handmaiden...
Those who seek kindness, and live in peace, and are pure and devoted, and so long as they sink into the grotesque cause of the outsiders, they are easily able to live up to themselves, without regard for their names, and for the wealth and glory.
As in the golden novel, the monk of the Shaolin Temple, who is hiding through the loft, does not brag about martial arts, nor does he rejoice.
Every "sweeping monk," every naked man's heart, behind his back, has a kingdom other than mine.
It is not only on the shoulders of heroes, but on the hands of billions of people.
Once upon a time, a girl in high school was mad at her friends, "When a hero passes by, someone sits and applauds and I don't want to be a hero, I want to be the one who sits and applauds. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Actually, there is no contradiction between being a hero and applauding a hero.
Those who applaud by the road are also passing heat and light, and they are also glowing.
Like you, there are opportunities in life, in moments, in days and months, in the shape of heroes.
High-quality Shanghai judge Zou Beihua, who is responsible for the reform of the judiciary, sends the messenger teacher to tell his story at the annual conference, receiving and sending numerous newspaper letters throughout the year, “doing the simple thing is not simple,” and the judges of Zou Beihua will give a round of applause to this old “sweeping monk.”
It's a relationship between heroes and a hero applauds another hero.
There are Shaolin temples, Yuan Longping has vast rice experiment fields, Nan Indong has “the Eye”, Qin Jiayi has a stage, Zhou Chang has a platform... to be a hero, not to work on its own, but to have a good environment and a positive incentive.
For example, "China's Eye," which now appears to be a myth.
In the 1990s, Chinese science and technology continued to climb the slopes, and the novelist Liu Zhisin has yet to write " Three bodies " .
The greatest “eye” at that time was the one-sided radio telescope in the Puerto Rico Valley of the United States – Arecibo, 350 metres in diameter – considered to be the world’s greatest “uncapable.”
The Chinese radio telescope was less than a tenth in diameter.
But Nan Indong, who enjoys world-class scientific conditions and salaries in Japan, insists on returning home with an almost insane idea: building a new generation of radio telescopes in China, receiving more messages from outer space.
China's a waste of life, so it's for the stars?
The motherland trusted Nan Indong, and the sky-eye project began.
It took 12 years for the site to be selected and another 9 years for the project to come to fruition.
The 500-metre-calibre "eye of the sky" has opened up, and China has become an unprecedented "unique scientific engineering" in the world.
So, "The Eye of the Heavens" is great, the Nan Indongs are great, and the Republic with a big face and a great view.
With the trust of the State and the goodwill of its nationals, Nan Indong had the chance to become the soul of the nation.
It is a beautiful and harmonious country with young and talented, white-haired heroes who walk through it, and people who applaud on the side of the road.
Waste classification education starts at Jilin Kindergarten.
On 27 March, a kindergarten in Jilin City, Jilin Province, conducted a garbage classification education course to teach young children to identify recyclable waste and other types of waste.
It is known that this is the first time that garbage is classified into local early childhood classes.
The nine departments of Jilin Province jointly issued the Work Programme for the Advancement of Local Urban Waste Classification.
In 2019, on the basis of the pilot of the compulsory classification of waste from living in Changchun City, the province decided to carry out the classification of waste from living in local cities.
The city of Jilin is one of them.
Through this event, we hope to achieve the results of the early childhood-led family, the kindergarten-led society and the promotion of environmental concepts.
The event was organized by Liu Li Xin, Executive Director of the International Kindergarten.
On the same day, the head of the park read an environmental initiative, hoping that the garbage would start with children.
After performing the low-carbon bees dance, the children group up to do a garbage sorting game.
The instructors also issued the "Recoverable" "Other Waste" label, advising the children to stick it to the trash can and make a video when they come home.
Liu Li Xin said that the kindergarten had been promoting the concept of low carbon and green environment, with regular environmental workshops.
Disaggregatable trash cans have been set up at the dump in the garden, where the type of input is indicated.
The teacher taught the kids what to do with recyclable garbage.
According to preliminary statistics, approximately 5.4652 million tons of municipal waste were generated in 2018 in Jilin province, all of which were placed in disposal sites.
Of these, 3,29.29 million tons were disposed of in sanitary landfills, 2,092 million tons were burned and 80.1 million tons were treated using integrated processes.
After many years of effort, all municipalities and counties in the province have the capacity to treat household waste harmlessly.
The Work Programme for the Disaggregated Management of Land-based Living Waste in the Province of Jilin, which has been published, clearly calls for further activities such as the classification of garbage into schools, educational materials, classes, etc., to strengthen interaction between students and parents through the creation of the work of garbage-classing songs, songs, comics, micro-videos, etc., with the effect of “education of a child, influencing a family, promoting a community and nurturing a new generation”.
According to data released by Maada on 27 September, the global sales volume in August was 110,7015.
Sales in China declined by 21 per cent due to the effects of inadequate new vehicle delivery and reduced prices.
Domestic sales fell by 6 per cent in Japan, with limited demand for end-of-cars before the consumer tax hike in October.
In August, Maada sold 17,729 in China.
In August 2018, there was a 13% drop from the previous year, and sales continued to decline.
China's dedicated primary SUV “CX-4” sales decreased by 14%.
CX-4 has been on the market for a long time since 2016 and the effect of new vehicles has declined.
Declining prices due to strategies to increase brand value from a long-term perspective are also known to have a significant impact on sales.
Maada's sales in the United States increased by 7 per cent over the same period, reaching 27482, 14 months later.
SUV "CX-5" and so on was increased in August, when the sellers had one more day of business than in the previous year, plus "sold promotions such as advocacy" (Mavda).
Domestic sales fell by 6 per cent to 1442.
The company stated that the pre-tax emergency purchases “were not as high as the previous (2014)”.
The small car "Demio" and so on has decreased sales.
Herake is dead.
On 26 local time, former French President Chirac passed away and was 86 years old.
At a time when the world is in the midst of a century of great change, the many political legacy left behind by this French politician when he came to power still deserves our praise.
Chirac was President of France for 12 years in a very charming manner.
He inherited the diplomatic spirit of de Gaulle independence and independence, as well as his firm support for European integration, and represented the pursuit of the “European dream”.
At the same time, he was a strategic statesman who advocated multipolarity and multilateralism in the world.
That is why the French media judge him as “the distinguished representative of France on the world stage”.
One of the heartening political decisions of Hirac was against the American-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France stood up to the pressure from the United States and was at the forefront of the war.
One year after the war, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to an intensification of terrorist activities and make the world even more dangerous.
Later, the Chirac warning proved quite right.
At a time when European integration is perplexed and the unilateralism of the United States has become more pronounced, the past has certainly been tempered by the strategic thinking and choices of Chirac in international politics and global affairs.
Chirac is also a French politician who makes Chinese familiar and friendly.
He was one of the proponents and creators of the “Golden Decade” of Chinese-French relations, which, after his first election as President of France in 1995, was driven by the strategic vision of politicians.
In 2004, China established a comprehensive strategic partnership and entered an entirely new phase of bilateral Chinese-French engagement.
During the Chirac administration, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly and cooperation between the two countries in a number of areas, including aviation, nuclear energy and rail transport, made groundbreaking progress.
The Middle-French Cultural Year of the Hirac initiative created a completely new cultural exchange pattern in the history of Central-French culture.
Herake's love of Chinese culture has been particularly impressive throughout his life.
According to his Chinese diplomats, Shirak can carry some of Li Bai and Dufu's poems and even make an accurate judgement of the history of Chinese copper.
“Not to look at the pyramid is not really to go to Egypt, not to look at the Qin, not really to China” – the golden phrase comes from Chirac.
“The West has concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth, and China's political status at the international level.
But I have full confidence in China.
I believe that China, as a country with a long history of civilization, has sufficient experience to help it build ideas and values for harmonious development and to shoulder its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time. It's not like it's a bad idea.
I also believe that China ' s revival will bring new creative vitality to world culture and enrich it.
The people have gone, but the political legacy and revelation of Chirac left to the world will last forever.
The Seventh China Computer Institute's Big Data Academic Conference, 27 on the theme “Mixed Light Valley, the Future of Thought”, was inaugurated in Wuhan by nearly a thousand leading experts and industry leaders in the field of data research, focusing on the issue of big data hotspots and reading technological processes in the age of artificial intelligence.
The Congress was hosted by the China Computer Institute (CCF) and co-sponsored by the CCS Big Data Experts Committee and the China University of Science and Technology, organized five special invitees and 188 forum reports, and established 33 thematic technical and industry sub-forums for the exchange of research on big data fundamentals, big data education, big data visualization, big data finance and science and technology.
After seven sessions, aimed at strengthening links and exchanges between national and international scholars working in the field of big data, promoting multidisciplinary cross-fertilization and the development of the big data industry, the CCS Big Data Academic Conference, which focused on the exchange of scientific results and was the most influential in the country, was expanded to cover basic theory and technology applications.
The Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region co-sponsored the bill against the United States of America and Hong Kong.
In a joint statement issued on 27 January, a member of the Legislative Council of the HKSAR expressed strong opposition to the passing of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 by the Foreign Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress.
This statement, co-sponsored by 40 formed members of Parliament, states that Hong Kong currently enjoys the rights conferred by the Basic Law of the HKSAR, including maintaining the status of free trade ports and separate customs zones, entering into and implementing bilateral and multilateral agreements in different areas of the economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports, as well as in the name of “Hong Kong, China”, for the purpose of trading, cooperating and developing relations with different countries and regions of the world.
These rights are not exercised by any foreign Government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always been committed to international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, and has engaged in numerous areas of cooperation with different countries and regions.
The statement stated that the adoption of the bill by the Foreign Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States was not necessary, but merely served as a means of brazen interference in Hong Kong ' s internal affairs and seeking political leverage for its agents in Hong Kong, as called for by its proxies.
The formed parliamentarians expressed their deep regret and strong opposition to this move by the United States.
The statement noted that Hong Kong was an important trading partner and the largest source of trade surpluses in the United States.
Hong Kong ' s excellent rule of law, a fair and free business environment and a clean society make it a good place for United States businessmen to conduct business.
If the United States were to adopt the bill, in addition to attacking Hong Kong and its own interests, it would make relations between China and the United States worse, without any advantage or harm.
The statement stated that Hong Kong would continue to implement the “one country, two systems” approach, as it had done in the past, and continue to enjoy the rights enshrined in the Basic Law and to fulfil its obligations effectively.
Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and to international trade, past, present and future.
According to the European Times 26, the reform of immigration policy will be discussed next week in both houses of the French Parliament.
French President Marlon recently stated in this regard that France cannot “host everyone,” but at the same time seeks to “take everyone well.”
It was reported that Marklon was trying to find a compromise route in immigration matters to ease the upcoming debate.
In a recent interview with the General Assembly during its general debate in New York, the United States of America, Marlon expressed the hope that there would be a genuine “two-pronged” approach to immigration policy that would strike a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Marlon said: “If France wishes to receive (immigrants) properly, it cannot accept all”.
The four priorities of the migration policy are: to grant asylum to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; to promote the integration of migrants more efficiently; to receive and protect all immigrants entering French territory; and to resettle more efficiently those who have entered France illegally and are not suitable for stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the “State Medical Assistance” (AME) system has been the subject of much discussion before.
Marklon indicated that he would like to be able to “assess” the system, but not to eliminate it, but to limit it.
Following that statement, the far-right leader of the “National League” Le Pen wrote that Marklon's statement was “no talk”.
Members of the right-wing Republican party, the President of the Senate, Rachel, also stated that immigration policies should be discussed in a “mitigated” but “realistic” manner, indirectly criticizing Marlon.
Senator Valao of the Left Socialist Party believes that France should “receive more and better” on the issue of immigration, and criticizes Mark Long for “playing” the subject.
Reports indicate that the new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act, which has been in place for one year, has led to differences within the ruling party, but at the same time has not been able to appease the right-wing opposition.
In the next general election in 2022, the topic of immigration policy will once again become the focus of the far right, and Marklon needs to do something about it, but at the same time at the risk of provoking left-wing elements within the ruling party.
It was reported that immigration policy would be debated in the lower house of the French National Assembly on 30 September and in the Senate on 2 October.
There are indications that China’s A share is on the way to a “back-to-back” wave, and that many listed companies have come forward to buy back their shares.
According to the East Wealth Statistics of the Financial Data Service, the total value of repurchases by A-listed companies in 2019 was more than RMB 100 billion (the same amount), well ahead of the figures for the same period in previous years, creating a record high in stock repurchases of A.
In response, Xu Yang, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Consulting for Information and Limited Liability, stated that the lower overall valuation of the A stock market this year, the buy-back of shares at relatively low prices, the increased efficiency of the funds of listed companies, the willingness of listed companies to manage market value proactively and the abundant cash flow, helped to boost investor confidence.
In addition, the continuously improved stock buy-back system has promoted active stock buy-back by listed companies.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued regulations for the implementation of repurchase shares of listed companies, which provide detailed guidelines and guidelines for repurchases of shares by listed companies.
Media statistics also show that since this year, listed companies that have implemented buy-back schemes have concentrated on infrastructure, real estate, information technology and electronic equipment manufacturing.
In addition, in terms of the amounts paid back, six listed companies have repurchased over $1 billion this year.
The first of these was the Ely shares, which were repurchased for over $5 billion.
What are the market implications of repurchases of listed companies?
The Vice-President of the Finance and Finance School of the People ' s University of China, Zhao Zing Jun, in an interview with a reporter from China News Agency, said that the buy-back showed, on the one hand, that listed companies had a strong economic power and a better financial position, were able to maintain stock price stability and give investors confidence, and, on the other hand, that listed companies and their shareholders were responsible to companies, to markets and to investors.
The former is based on good corporate performance, while the latter requires higher quality for listed companies and their controlling shareholders.
These are the core building blocks for capital markets.
Repurchases by listed companies help to boost investor confidence and support the stock prices of listed companies.
The Eastern Securities Institute has also estimated that, based on the expected stock buy-backs set by A-listed companies as a whole since the beginning of this year, and the average exchange value of the stock buy-backs, the increase in stock buy-backs for the A-stock market this year is expected to exceed $150 billion.
In the past two months, the restoration of a large painting of the Sanctuary of the Queens of Tianjin Palace, a national focal point, was completed on 26 days and will be reopened during the national holiday.
The Queen's Landscape is a large, traditional mural that fully reflects the life of mother and father.
With the approval of the State authorities, Cai Changqui, the director of the Tianjin Folk Museum (the Queen's Palace), was created from 1991 to 1994.
It is known that this mural was painted on the walls of the Palace of Queens south and north, 32 metres long and 2.6 metres high, in two parts, with more than 30 stories of the late Queens, the sea and the fermentation of the sky, and 358 people recreated the life of their mother.
Cai Changqui explained that in recent years Tianjin had experienced heavy summer rains and dry winters, which “wet dry” had led to the fragmentation of the mural, which accounted for 60 per cent of the entire mural area.
In order to protect and save Mother ' s ancestral murals, the ancient cultural street council and Tianjin City Palace in the southern Kasai district of Tianjin city initiated the restoration of the palace and the interior mural.
The restoration project, which was awarded by Cai Changqui, brought together four prominent national painters.
The restoration work was based on the principle of `old as old', while the original murals were partially adjusted and additional repairs were made to areas where the murals were not perfect.
We have also made innovations and attempts in colours, materials, pen ink, etc.
After repair, the original mural style, spirituality, spirituality and artistic style was maintained.
Established in 1326, the Queen's Palace, formerly known as the Queen's Palace, has been refurbished many times. It is one of the oldest buildings in the city of Tianjin and one of the oldest temples in China's present age.
On 25 September, the shipping ceremony at the Beijing Dae-hyun International Airport took place.
The construction of the Beijing Dynasty International Airport terminal, known as "phoenix wings", is the top of the seven wonders of the new world.
Currently, Beijing Capital International Airport is overloaded, carrying 100 million + passengers last year and becoming the second year of the world's second-year airport after the United States airport in Atlanta.
It is expected that by 2022, 45 million passengers will pass through Beijing International Airport and 20 per cent of international flights; by 2025, 72 million will pass through, and the proportion is expected to reach 30 per cent.
How cool is it, as a "new kingdom"?
The Beijing Dae-hing International Airport, located between the Beijing city district of Da-Hing and the Hebei province's Guangyang district, is 46 km from Tianan Gate, the largest new airport in the world.
The surface projection of the roof-covered steel structure of its terminal is 180,000 square metres, with 25 standard football fields in size.
Beijing’s Dashing International Airport is the world’s first terminal with two arrival and two departure layers – F1-F4 for international arrival, domestic arrival, domestic departure, and international departure.
The two-storey bridge that connects the high-speed to the airport outside the terminal corresponds to the terminal buildings F3 and F4 — the international floor and the domestic floor.
The first flight to Beijing’s Da Xing International Airport opened the Beijing era of “twin airport”.
To date, 66 airlines are interested in entering the Beijing-based Dae-hyun International Airport, including 20 domestic airlines, 46 Hong Kong/Australian and foreign airlines, which continue to be approved.
In the winter and spring season of 2019, Beijing's Dashing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, of which 101 are domestic and 15 are international; 112 are global, including 97 domestic and 15 international.
This has led to the formation of a well-coordinated, well-competitive and internationally leading “two-hub hub” airport pattern with Beijing Capital International Airport, which has both eased the pressure on the capital airport to operate at a saturated capacity and better met the urgent need for rapid growth in air transport in Beijing and its surrounding areas and effectively enhanced the international competitiveness of our civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Dae-hyun International Airport takes due account of its geographical location, its relationship to the surrounding airspace and operating environment. The airport runway was set up for the first time in the country, using the world's largest automated air pipeline system and establishing China's largest terminal control area, thus maximizing the efficiency of aviation operations.
Domestic airports of this size have for the first time used an automated system of national baggage handling and information management, using innovative baggage transfer modes to improve the efficiency of baggage processing.
The first flight to Beijing Dynasty International Airport is a sign of the phoenix's flail.
The creation of more than 40 new international and domestic airports, with a national production rate of over 98 per cent, will certainly have a direct and indirect economic impact on the industries in the surrounding areas and will give life to the economic development of Beijing.
Maverick's provisional November convention is scheduled to be transferred to 16 years of age.
Marawa is tentatively scheduled to hold a central congress in early November, with a proposed amendment to the age of transfer under the party charter to 16 years.
With Congress adopting a lower voting age for the general elections, Marwa announced that the 66th Central Congress would be convened this year to propose changes to the party ' s statute, including a lower age of integration from 18 to 16.
According to Dato ' Seri Wei Xian, President of the Council of Marwa, the Central Assembly was scheduled to be held on 2 and 3 November this year, but the General Assembly ' s dates may change as a result of the by-elections to the seat of State Daneu-Ai.
He said that, since the Electoral Commission would meet only on 1 October to finalize the nomination and polling day for the By-elections in the By-elections in the Danyuby-Ai State, they would meet the following day, 2 October, to discuss whether to change the date of this year ' s Central Assembly.
He also explained that the purpose of the CNC meeting yesterday (26 days) was to finalize the date of the congress and to amend the party ' s statute, but that it had just happened to be on the agenda of the national by-election, following the tragic death of Member of Parliament Dan Yubai of the Indigenous Unity Party and the tragic death of Dato ' Mohamad.
Zhuang Zhuang, Secretary-General of Shandong Zhuang Zhuang Zhuang Zhuang Zhonghuai
Wang Bao-Chang, born in February 1943, participated in 1967 and served as Secretary of the Commune Party, District Secretary, Mayor, etc.
In 1986, Wang Baoxiang became the Secretary-General of Shou Gwang County, Shandong Province, when the lifelight was poor in the village of Zhuangjong.
In his five years of service, Wang had focused on three things: promoting the industrialization of vegetables; developing salin beaches; and laying the groundwork for industrial roll-overs, which had enabled the supple to raise their pockets and lift their backs.
Lifeless farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables and lessons learned.
At the beginning of the 1980s, lifeless farmers were unable to sell their harvests and rot on the ground.
Wang's research found that the key to catching vegetables is to make a flow.
Lifelight led to the creation of a wholesale market for vegetables, opening the way for the development of a market economy.
Party cadres take the lead, screw up, all the damage is in the county.
In 1989, 17 winter-hot vegetable sheds were set up by 17 members of the party, including Wang Lo Yi of Zhu village, with the support of Wang Zhang. In that year, 17 “two million households” appeared in the village.
Subsequently, an outreach team was set up in the county, and Wang Lo Yi was mobilized to travel to various townships; in the first year, more than 5,000 vegetable sheds were promoted, followed by the expansion of the vegetable sheds into the county and throughout the country.
For centuries, 1.6 million acres of land in the north have been painted on shallow beaches, in addition to salted beaches.
The local population lives in harsh conditions.
Su-nam has a vegetable shed. What about Su-bei?
Wang had organized a general war for hundreds of thousands of people, camped on the desert beach for 40 or 50 days.
Wang Bok-sang and the county's seniors are eating on the work site, pushing their loads like a civilian worker, sleeping in the open, hanging out their thumbs when people see them... At that time, 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields were developed in Subei, and a “polypot” was developed on salt beaches.
In July 1986, for the first time, he participated as the county secretary in the industrial conference of the city of Luangjong.
During the conference, a “table of comparison of industrial economic figures in the 12 districts of the city of Zhangjiao City” was published, at first glance, with a good lifelight, ranking fourth.
However, if the original salt is removed, the pure industrial value of the birthday light is only $119 million, which is the third lowest.
Wang Zheng, with a group of over 70 people, went to the field to “change their minds”.
Less than a year later, the county invested $150 million in 77 projects.
Every year since then, they have organized a “calibration” to Shenzhen, Toung and Shanghai.
There are fewer businesses and fewer entrepreneurs.
Wang Bok-hyun chaired the panel: 40 “working men” emerged from the public selection of the manager of the factory throughout the county and were pushed onto the industrial front.
In 1991, after entering the ranks of the country ' s 100 counties, Wang Baixiang was seconded to the Vice-President of the city of Zhongqiao.
He left behind over 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, 4854 enterprises, more than 100,000 “millionaires”, a popularly recognized cadre. He is still known as "Our Secretary of Peace".
On 26 September, local time, Wang Yi, State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs, presided over the Foreign Ministers of China and the African States Members of the Security Council at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The meeting was attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Côte d ' Ivoire, a member of the current African Council, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Equatorial Guinea, Oyono, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of South Africa, Pandor, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Niger, a member designate, Carla, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tunisia, Jesinawi.
Wang Yu has made four recommendations for strengthening cooperation between the Central African parties in the Council.
First, we must work together.
The greatest challenge in the current international situation was unilateralism, the immediate consequence of which was that the basic norms of international relations were being challenged and the role of the United Nations was being undermined to the detriment of developing countries, including African countries, and small and medium-sized countries.
To meet this challenge, Central Africa must stand hand in hand and shoulder to strength.
In the Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, and the focus is not just three votes, but the continent as a whole.
Together, China and Africa will not only be four votes, but will lead others to follow, influence and shape the Council ' s agenda.
Since 2018, China has established a “3+1” coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council, which needs to be fully utilized.
Secondly, it is through negotiation.
China has always advocated a political solution to the hotspot problem. Africa has a good tradition of consultation and experience of successful good offices by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex challenges on the Council's agenda, particularly the hotspots in Africa, are mostly rooted in colonialism and, in some cases, directly related to external factors.
Together, we want to use Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter to play the role of good offices, mediation, etc.
Thirdly, self-empowerment.
African countries and peoples know their problems best, and Africa has the capacity and wisdom to solve its problems.
The Council should focus on listening to and respecting the will of Africa when dealing with hot spots in Africa, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is ready to strengthen its coordination with non-governmental organizations and to firmly promote capacity-building for African-owned peace operations.
Fourthly, development is fundamental.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries, and we insist on putting economic and social development first and supporting each other in their chosen development path.
China would like to align the establishment of a “one-way street” with the AU Agenda 2063, the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030 and the development strategies of African countries, in order to help African countries to strengthen their development capacities and address the root causes of conflict.
Together, we want to promote greater United Nations investment in Africa ' s development.
China has provided and will continue to provide all possible human and material assistance to the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a result of the renewed outbreak of the Ebola epidemic, and is ready to coordinate its efforts with African countries to mobilize the United Nations, WHO and others to enhance their assistance in order to fulfil the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Newborns, etc. relays save small lives.
Surprise!
Mothers of second-born babies had an early onset, and on their way to the hospital in a panic, a 32-week premature baby was born on Dad's car driver.
Fortunately, obstetrics and newborns were treated in a timely manner and the relays saved this little life.
By chance, on 19, 20 and 21 days, the maternity and neonatal sections of the Hubei provincial maternal and child health centre received three premature births on the road for three consecutive days, and the other two were born in 120 first aid trucks, both 29 weeks.
At 7 a.m. on 19 September, Ms. Cheng, a second-born pregnant mother, felt a little tummy pain and thought that she was 32 weeks pregnant and that the first one was premature, and she packed up the items to be delivered and was ready to take a shower and go straight to the hospital.
At 9:30, Ms. Cheng packed and asked her husband to drive from Seo Dong ' s home to the hospital.
I didn't expect the baby to be born in Dad's car co-pilot soon after the car opened.
After 20 minutes, Ms. Cheng and the baby finally arrived at the maternity and obstetrics building at the Hubei Health Centre for Women and Children.
The hospital security officers saw the husband and wife and the baby who were in a state of panic and immediately informed the maternity ward, and the Deputy Medical Doctor Zhang Jian and the midwife Liu Ying, who were waiting for four doctors, carrying their bags and cords, stormed downstairs.
“At the time, the mother was lying on the side of the car, under the water of sheep and blood, with a baby boy standing next to her, with an umbilical cord. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Zhang Chau enquired about the fact that the baby was a 32-week premature child, that parents on their way had not been able to cover the package, that the early autumn morning had been cold, that he had frozen his skin pale, that he had no crying, and that his limbs had collapsed.
Yoo Ying went to the co-pilot to process the baby's umbilical cord, Zhang Jing went into the cab, quickly opened the delivery bag, provided the child with the inside healing towels and the handbags to keep the baby warm on several floors, and cleaned the newborns' respiratory tracts (e.g. graphs), then carried the baby up to the 12th floor of the neonatal unit.
Upon receiving the news, the Neonatal Medical Officer arrived at the nurse ' s station to rescue the premature baby.
At the time, the baby had a purple color and suffered from a lack of oxygen asphyxiation, and the doctor immediately inducted him with a trachea, less than a minute later, the baby recovered its heart rate and gradually recovered its skin color and recovered successfully.
After admission to hospital, the 32-week-old baby was placed in a respirator, which, after sustained rescue and steady breathing, was successfully evacuated the following day.
After a week of treatment, the baby ' s vital signs are now stable and breathing well and a small amount of breastfeeding has begun.
On the 19th, 20th and 21st days, three premature births on the road were attended by the obstetrics and newborns section of the hospital, and the other two were born on 120 first aid trucks, all 29 weeks of premature births, which are currently being actively treated in the neonatal section.
The Director of Obstetrics at the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Institute, Sun Guoqiang, explained that in recent years, mothers and children in the province have received many babies born in subways and private cars, a situation that may threaten the lives of mothers and children.
The Director reminded that pregnant mothers should come to the hospital as soon as they had abdominal pain, broken water and seen red.
In the event that she is in the home or on the road, the mother should make every effort to be in bed, with blankets, etc., under her hips to prevent the baby from coming out and hitting the ground, and the child should be warmed immediately and brought to the hospital as soon as possible.
Newer Aviation Technology is officially open
The establishment of VSTEA was one of the details of the memorandum of cooperation signed in April 2018 between VAECO and ST Engineering Aerospace, marking the emergence of Viet Nam ' s first aircraft equipment maintenance and repair consortium.
Two leading aviation technology companies in Viet Nam and Singapore cooperate to provide aircraft equipment maintenance and repair services to domestic and foreign airlines.
The Managing Director of Crossing International indicated that its associate partner, ST Engineering Space, was the world’s largest and highest aircraft maintenance group.
It is believed that this cooperation will bring benefits to both sides and that it will be the beginning of a future of promising cooperation.

Three points for a penalty?
On 27 Beijing time, the NBA Development Alliance announced a new penalty rule that would be applied only once per penalty, the value of which would be determined by the violation.
O'Neill has a low hit rate among NBA stars.
The new regulation provides for 2 points for two-point basket offenders, 3 points for three-point basket offenders and 1 point for one penalty.
The last two minutes of regular time and the extra time, following the previous penalty rules.

Wuhan promotes the intellectual transformation of industrial enterprises.
Journalists were informed on 27 January of the launch of the “Hero Zin China Games” by the Wuhan City Press Office that since the beginning of the year, the city has accelerated its efforts to transform industrial intelligence and has implemented a transition subsidy of up to $20 million.
To date, more than 800 industrial enterprises of more than size have been able to gather information on the need for smart transformation.
The Deputy Director of the Department of Economics and Information Technology of Wuhan City, Mr. Zhang Hong, has since the beginning of the year launched an action plan for the intellectual transformation of industrial enterprises to provide free advisory and diagnostic services and solutions for industrial enterprises above the scale required, and to promote a new round of high-level technological upgrading.
It is planned that the City of Wuhan will conduct an annual public screening of specialized diagnostic services for the purpose of carrying out a survey of the need for intellectual adaptation for all industrial enterprises of all sizes and above in the city, including through the creation of columns, questionnaires and door-to-door filings.
To date, information has been collected on the intellectual adaptation needs of more than 800 regulated industrial enterprises, accounting for nearly one third of the total number of industrial enterprises above the municipal scale.
Five city-level diagnostic platforms have organized teams to be deployed in enterprises to conduct “one-on-one” site assessments and programme validation.
Zhang Hong, the city is currently organizing 373 smart transformation projects, with a total planned investment of $29,760 million, the first 5G smart-phone production line in ICW, the national lead on smart-phone production in Motorola, the digital unmanned plant for the Wuhan Siemens transformer, the national first batch of quantitative satellite production lines for space scientists, the leading new veterinary-drug-smart production line for re-emerging biology, and the European Networked Smart Homes Production Line, among other industries.
In addition, the city of Wuhan has increased its financial support for smart transformation projects.
These include the implementation of smart transformations of industrial enterprises, which are actually invested; and investment in hardware and equipment, and soft investment in research and development, which is granted 8 per cent and up to $20 million in conversion grants.
At the same time, financial institutions such as the Zhejiang Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Zhejiang Branch) have been actively involved in providing personalized financial services for the intellectual transformation of industrial enterprises and have made significant efforts to ease corporate financing pressures.
Trudo's man-made collapse. Can he be re-elected?
This time, Trudo tripped out of a big pit, and Trudo dug it up.
In recent days, the media in Canada have been exposed to multiple photographs of the current Prime Minister, Trudo, in which he pretends to be black.
This is considered to be a clear act of racial discrimination, which has triggered a wave in Canada.
After what happened, Trudo repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, Canadians do not buy much.
Trudo kind of threw a stone at his feet.
Since the rise of the “anti-black-faced movement” in the United States, Trudo and the Federal Liberal Party have been making high-profile accusations that opposition parties or dissidents within the party “have suffered a loss” in this regard, and have repeatedly threatened “that whoever makes this mistake should be expelled immediately.”
To put it simply, it was Trudo who dug up the big pit that tripped Trudo.
Trudo is the son of the former Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Trudo, a young and handsome man who, when he first got out of his way, had a whirlwind of “political idols”.
He was originally a “political activist” and, after taking over as the head of the Federal Liberal Party, played an unexpectedly beautiful battle in Canada’s federal legislative elections in 2015, when the Federal Liberal Party was halfway in the lower house of the Federation, gaining valuable separate cabinet power.
At the same time, Trudo has put forward many deafening political platforms, concepts, such as “ethnicity and gender equality”, “ecological conservation”, “economic revitalization”, emphasizing the eradication of corruption and “irregular wind”.
However, for five years in power, he has been in almost all of the above-mentioned areas, and he has “go back and forth”.
On the issue of “ethnicity and gender equality,” aside from this “black-faced” incident, he had previously made it possible for indigenous groups and leaders to move protest tents to Congress’s gates on the 150th anniversary of Canada’s founding.
In the fight against corruption, at the beginning of last year, Trudo was involved in the burgeoning “Rangeing events”.
He was exposed to major frauds committed by his home construction engineering company, “Rang Wanling”, and pressured the department and officials responsible for the investigation to “show him”.
Moreover, Trudo, after what went wrong, became angry with the officials who disclosed the fraud – Wang Chongdi, who was the first to disclose it and who was the Attorney General of Canada.
Although the case itself remains questionable, its suspicion is difficult to clear.
Many observers have pointed out that the collapse of Trudo's five-year administration was due mainly to his own “cavity pit”, the largest of which was the three words “eating his own fruit” and “broader than his lawmakers”.
Canada ' s most authoritative Angus-Red poll data show that since 2015, supporters of Trudo have slipped from over 60 per cent to over 30 per cent, while opponents have jumped from less than 30 per cent to over 60 per cent.
Even though the other opposition parties and their party leaders are equally underperforming, even a significant proportion of the voters who still vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now disconcerting with the Federal Prime Minister and the leader of the ruling party.
On 21 October, when the new Canadian federal legislative elections are about to begin, will Trudo again be able to win five years ago?
The answer may be one word: hard.
Both at the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience and from regional aviation integration to the development of integration are far-reaching and positive.
On 25 September, Beijing Dae-hing International Airport was officially sailing.
Ninkyo journalists have been informed by the Beijing Municipal Development Commission that the capital airport is already oversaturated and that the opening of the Indonesian International Airport will enhance the capacity of air services in the capital.
Following Shanghai, Beijing became the second city to have two airports in our co-city, similar to the Shanghai Rainbow Bridge International Airport, which mainly serves domestic aviation, and the Pudong Airport, which is dominated by international shipping, where the future capital airport will also be positioned to serve the differences between domestic and international air operations and provide more disaggregated services.
In terms of business development, the impact on the airport in the capital is more beneficial.
The capital airport, with 100 million passengers per year in 2018, is among the highest in the country, but there is still a significant shortfall in capacity compared to the rapidly growing business demand, especially for international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passenger tourism, travel, etc., and in line with the trend towards increasingly open and internationally integrated cities in Beijing, Da Xing International Airport has been positioned as a major international hub airport, with plans to meet 100 million annual passenger throughputs and 4 million tons of post throughputs in the future.
As a result, there is no overlap in the location of the two airports, with different customer groups and sufficient market space.
At the level of the economic accounts, it is clear that the movement of the airport will have a win-win effect, ease tensions in the air traffic in Beijing, accelerate the growth of passengers and cargo throughput and create an incremental cake for the dual nuclear operation of Air Capital.
From a user ' s point of view, the future does not have to focus on the capital ' s airport, but may also reduce the range of problems associated with the excessive concentration of routes, such as extended pass-through security, slower passenger arrivals, indirect increases in the length of stay of aircraft and passengers at the airport, an increase in the burden on airport operations, and a reduction in shipping through the capital ' s airport, which in fact improves passenger travel experience.
According to media estimates of the time and cost of travelling to large international airports, such as travelling from the South Five Circles to the High Highway in Kyoto to the High Highway in Da Xing Airport, 50 minutes to drive, around $40 in oil and $15 in high-speed charges, and choosing the rail transport subway bus bus route, which is at a distance of 20 kilometres and 30 kilometres, the fare is set at $10, $25 and $35.
In general, citizens have a wide range of transport options to travel to the airport, and costs and time are within a reasonable range.
From the point of view of trends, the location of the airport is that of the main transport hub of Kyosin, thus far from the Beijing metropolitan area, but it has increased radiation exposure to Hebei and Tianjin and has facilitated more travel, which is of great significance for the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, Hebei and Tianjin passengers will benefit from additional international air line services provided by Daejing International Airport, as can be seen from traffic planning at the airport.
In addition to the new airport line in Beijing, which runs directly to the airport, there are several highways connecting the airport to the surrounding area.
Just as passengers of the cities of Guangdong Dongdong, Fushan and Chiangyang can go to White Cloud Airport in Guangzhou via the Guangfu and Deep Highways, residents of the Beijing neighbourhood, Yu An Xin district, etc. will benefit from the airport and will have easy and efficient air services.
As can be seen, the access to the international airport of Daejing has not only added several runways and aircraft, but also has far-reaching and positive implications, both at the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience and regional aviation integration, and the development of integration, not only for the long-term layout and development of the shipping industry in Beijing, but also for the diversification of the options available to the population at large, and for the further improvement of the quality of services in the shipping industry in Beijing, which is more conducive to the promotion of the integration development process in Kyoto and to economic and trade development in the vicinity of the airport.
Thus, for the transport of the airport, we have to account not only for the economics of individuals but also for overall development.
On the 27th, the thumb of the medium plate increased by 1.46%.
Xinhua’s 27th September (journalist Zhao Rishi) medium-span pictorial pictorial move, which resulted in a total of 6077.23 points, an increase of 87.55 points, or 1.46 per cent, over the last trading day.
On that day, the small and medium plate was sold at $10.8 billion, which is $31.9 billion less than on the previous day.
Of the stocks traded on that day, 668 were reported as stock-taking, 15 as stock-shares, such as Hiro Kocai, 222 as stock-shares, 4 as stock-shares, such as Sunway, and 40 as stock-shares, such as Great Star.
Viet Nam Forum on Economic and Social Issues, 2019, in the province of Chengxiang
The Deputy Director of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly of Viet Nam, Nguyen Dejan, revealed that early this year, Viet Nam ' s economic and social development showed many new developments and continued growth.
The Forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development in late 2019 and 2020.
At the Forum, participants had an in-depth exchange of views and views on four themes: economic development in 2019 and the impact of selected FTAs; salient issues in the economy of Viet Nam in 2019; salient issues in the socio-cultural context of Viet Nam in 2019; and projections and proposals for the economic and social development of Viet Nam in 2020.
There was general agreement that global economic growth had slowed in the first months of 2019, with increased risks and challenges.
Trade frictions among major economies further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded that, despite the uncertainty surrounding the global economy, where 70 per cent of the global economy ' s economies are at a standstill in growth, Viet Nam ' s economic development has made many encouraging gains, with a smooth macroeconomic performance, inflation being effectively controlled, and an average increase in the consumer price index of 2.64 per cent in the first half of 2019, the lowest in almost three years.
GDP grew by 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2019, down from 7.05 per cent in the same period last year, but the increase remains high compared to the same period in 2011-2017.
In predicting trends in Viet Nam ' s economic development from 2019 to 2020, the Deputy Director of the National Centre for Economic and Social Projections of Viet Nam, Dundeon, stated that the economy of Viet Nam had shown a high growth momentum in 2019 against the backdrop of the turmoil in the world economy.
By 2020, Viet Nam ' s macroeconomics are expected to remain largely stable, the implementation of FTAs will contribute to trade development, economic restructuring and business improvements will be further strengthened, and Viet Nam ' s external export activities will decline as a result of trade frictions.
There is therefore a need to strengthen the early warning mechanism for monitoring and forecasting, to proactively seek trade relief measures for Viet Nam ' s exports, to find opportunities to expand new export markets and to facilitate external exports of commodities such as agricultural and water products.
At the same time, inflation rates have been kept at a reasonable level, thereby promoting complementary industries and supporting the development of high-tech, organic and ecological agriculture.
Liu Chijie, Director of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, held a reception in Siem Reap to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the New China.
Liu Zhijie said that, in its 70 years of existence, China had actively participated in international affairs, contributing more Chinese wisdom and Chinese programmes to improve global economic governance and promote global common development, making an important contribution to world peace and development and bringing tangible benefits to Cambodia ' s economic development and human well-being.
As the world's second largest economy, Liu Zhijie described China's contribution to world economic growth as more than 30 per cent. In particular, China's “one-way road” initiative, cooperation between local provinces and cities in China and Siem Reap and the provinces of the region is deepening.
This year, he said, marks the beginning of the 61 years of Chinese-Cambodian friendship, with fraternal friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation that will drive local economic and social development.
The Governor of Siem Reap, Disaiha, highly commended the great achievements of the new China over the past 70 years and congratulated China and Cambodia on their friendly cooperation.
Disaiha expects both sides to continue to work together to advance Chinese-Cambodian friendship and cooperation, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit and continuously improve the living standards of the people.
The Ministry of Siem Reap and the provinces and cities of China, Dixieha, said, have made a remarkable effort to establish friendly relations between Siem Reap province and China's provinces and cities. To date, it has concluded friendly city relations with 28 provinces and cities of China. In Cambodia, the people of Siem Reap and Guangxi have been the direct beneficiaries of the large cultural performance projects, Wu Kosumi and Wu Ko Dynasty.
The reception was attended by the Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, Ken Wensson, the President of the Siem Reap Provincial Council, the Governor of the five prefectures, the Siem Reap Branch of the Cambodian Council of Ministers, the volunteer teacher, the Siem Reap Branch of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Cambodia, representatives of Chinese enterprises and representatives of the foreign Siem Reap Consortium.
In the town of Yunming, a decade of digital China's Cloud Rise was witnessed.
If the 2009 local website forum were used as a starting point, it would have been 10 years since the 2019 Cloud Habitat Congress, held in Hangzhou, from 25 to 27 years ago.
From the concept of a cloud, to the practice of a cloud, big data, cloud computing became one of the core technologies underpinning China's economic development, social management and public services for 10 years.
At the Zhejiang Heining Zhejiang Xinhai Energy Photovoltaic Battery Workshop, there have recently been a number of new “colleagues” with Aliyun's artificial intelligence on the side of the mass examiner.
It is 24-hour open, is identified at a rate of more than twice that of manual work, and has stabilized at more than 95 per cent quality accuracy.
According to the head of the company, the “mass inspector” with the camera has focused on over 40,000 defective samples, which, with the cloud computing power behind it, allow for the rapid conversion of infrared images into binary languages and the sorting of defective batteries.
This enterprise is only a microcosm of today's cloud computing-aided manufacturing transformation.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology published a Guide to the Promotion of Cloud Implementation in Enterprises (2018-2020), which proposes that by 2020, a significant increase in cloud awareness and motivation in enterprises and a significant increase in cloud coverage and application depth will be achieved.
Wang Jian, founder of Aliyun, stated that today, data-centre cloud computing has created a bridge between data and the digital economy, which is a key element.
At the same time, our cloud computing industry has grown in size over the past 10 years.
The White Paper on Cloud Calculator Development (2019) issued by the China Institute of Information and Communication in July of this year shows that China’s cloud computing market in 2018 was 9,628 million yuan, an increase of 39.2% over 2017.
In addition to being the key technology underpinning industrial transformation and digital economic development, the invisible cloud has unwittingly transformed urban management and social life.
For the third consecutive year, the “urban brain” at this year's Cloud Habitat Congress remains of concern.
For its part, Ariyun described the fact that the urban brain has now become a hub for urban management from a traffic governance tool and that collaborative applications have been extended to 23 cities worldwide.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the urban brain is able to perform new urban management services such as “stop and pay” “real time perception of the number of visitors” and “tourist route design” through a strong computing capability.
In the field of government services, the use of a "one cloud" to connect "one thing" to "one thing" and the "hand over" to "hand over" to facilitate the provision of government services.
At present, Zhejiang has built a province-wide unified public data platform through the top-of-government cloud.
As of 11 September, the platform had covered more than 57 million resident people and over 15 million corporate entities in the province, grouped into 3,066 types of 19.08 billion data.
The monthly average number of calls and shared data across the Zhejiang provincial government has reached 12 million, and every time the data is called on the cloud, it may mean that the crowd is running low.
Makoto makes tea with a plastic bag!
According to Central, a recent study in Canada has found that a bag of plastic tea bags may release billions, or even billions, of plastic particles, significantly higher than a person's estimated total intake of microplastics, but there is no evidence to date that the ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humanity.
Researchers at McGill University in Canada have reportedly found that immersing plastic tea in an almost boiled hot water (95°C) would release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into a cup.
This number is significantly higher than a person ' s estimated total intake of microplastics.
According to studies published earlier in 2019, at least 50,000 plastic particles are eaten annually by the general population, while the same amount of microplastics is inhaled.
It is known that the study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, where researchers tested four different types of commercial plastic tea parcels at the Montereau Shop and Café, opened the tea pack, immersed the tea bag in almost boiling water for five minutes and analysed using electronic microscopes and spectrometers.
According to this study, they found that more than 11.6 billion plastic particles were released from a single tea bag, “a few orders of magnitude higher than the previous plastic load of other foods”.
It has been reported that most tea bags are made of natural fibre, but many brands made of natural fibres are still sealed with plastic.
Some of the branded tea bags are no longer paper-based and instead use plastics, which are the subject of testing by researchers.
Plastic particles are small fragments of plastics, defined by researchers as being in the range of 100 nm to 5 cm, produced mainly by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and the deepest trenches around the world, and found them in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
For the first time in October 2018, researchers found plastic particles in human faeces samples from several countries in different regions of the globe.
In order to test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from the tea pack, the Canadian research team placed daphnia in contaminated water and found that microplastics affected the behaviour of the daphnia and caused them to develop in a developmental malformations.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that plastic particles can pose a threat to humans.
However, WHO noted that more research was needed to fully understand how these plastics spread to the environment and what effects they had on humans.
Researchers speculate that these tea packages release large quantities of plastic particles, which may be in contact with boiling water, and even if “eating” plastics heat up to 40°C, they may break down or see some toxic substances.
Gutierrez stated that climate emergencies posed the greatest threat to the survival of small island States.
There, a natural disaster erodes the human development gains of a generation.
This is illustrated by the hurricanes that have hit Papua, Dominica and the Bahamas since this year.
About a quarter of people in small island developing States live at altitudes of 5 metres or lower.
The relocation may have serious implications for their society and way of life and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At this Monday ' s Summit on Climate Action, small island developing States committed themselves together to achieving carbon neutrality and 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030, thereby again leading the world in the right direction.
Gutierrez said: “The climate crisis is placing new injustices above the old ones.
Although small island developing States contribute little to global warming, they pay the highest price.
Owing to their middle-income status, many countries are also caught in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must act, and the time has come to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Today ' s high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for the search for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and transition to renewable energy; and urge international agencies to help small island developing States, particularly highly indebted middle-income countries, to access finance.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the planet's lifeline, the oceans.
The latest special report issued this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans are already suffering from the “spreading” consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of the century, some extreme sea-level rise that would have occurred only once in a century may occur in many regions each year.
The report warns that, without significant investment in adaptation, some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable.
Contamination, overfishing and acidification have caused enormous losses.
Over the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold over the past 40 years.
Demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is reducing resources, including maintaining fishing grounds in many island communities.
Small island States also face high transport, energy and infrastructure costs.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets and subject them to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also working to address the security impact of illicit trafficking in persons, arms and drugs.
Gutierrez said: “A problem can be solved anywhere by addressing it in the most challenging environment.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples to be drawn from around the world. It's not like it's a bad idea.
He stressed that small island developing States were a special case for sustainable development.
They require long-term attention and investment from the entire international community.
The Ministry of Finance of India indicated that the financial system was sufficiently liquid.
The Indian Minister of Finance, Sitaraman, on 26th, stated that the current financial system was fully liquid and that India ' s economic growth was expected to recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by the demand for holiday consumption.
This was done after a meeting with representatives of Indian private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks, etc.
Sitaraman did not explain the relevance of these statements.
Earlier, some Indian and overseas media blamed the continuing slowdown in India's current economy on the liquidity constraints of non-bank financial institutions.
Citing the decline in car sales as an example, West Taraman denied that liquidity constraints were the main cause of the decline.
According to Sitaraman, the decline in car sales was mainly due to cyclical factors.
It is expected that India ' s economy will recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday consumption.
The annual shopping season in India began in September and will continue until the end of the year.
Markets expect that shopping consumption will contribute significantly to economic growth in India.
The Department of Education of Jiangxi Province has recently issued a circular prohibiting all primary and secondary schools throughout the province from making non-compliance during the national holiday period and organizing random unannounced visits.
In its circular on the strict prohibition of compensatory time off from the National Day, the Jiangxi Department of Education stressed that primary and secondary schools in all regions must make a firm commitment to: There shall be no group remedial or new courses for students, no courses of study, special courses, Osai classes, interest classes, promotion courses, etc., and no schools or school premises may be rented to other educational institutions.
At the same time, it is strictly prohibited to organize, recommend and induce students to attend remedial classes for in-school and out-of-school violations, to participate in extra-school training institutions for in-service primary and secondary school teachers or to be organized by other teachers, parents, parents ' committees, etc., and to introduce and provide relevant information to out-of-school training institutions and others.
The circular made it clear that in the case of confirmed remedial behaviour in primary and secondary schools, points would be increased in the district education administration for the high-quality development of education at the district level in the same year; in the case of teachers involved in remedial behaviour, they would be dealt with in a serious manner in accordance with the rules relating to teacher style.
Support for the production of pig products
Faith demands that measures be implemented in six ways.
A provincial teleconference on the promotion of guaranteed market supply for the production of pigs was held today to mobilize and re-deploy the policy measures of the Central and Provincial Councils and provincial governments to support guaranteed market supply for the production of pigs.
Punctuality demands that measures be implemented to catch raw pig production in six areas.
The implementation of the “basket” is carried out by the mayor, and this year the province-wide explicit 45 million-headed pigs have been divided into the municipalities and included in the accountability test.
The implementation of policies and measures to effectively address the “last kilometre” of policies.
(b) To ensure that the production of fertilizers is carried out, to implement carefully the policy of subsidies for fertilizers, to encourage pig farming enterprises to scale up their production, and to systematically select excellent hogs from the group of commercial pigs.
In this regard, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia has made it a priority to secure funding for major farming enterprises that have not yet entered our province.
The implementation of market circulation systems and the acceleration of the construction of cold chain logistics facilities for pig production have made a comprehensive contribution to the transition from “dipping pig” to “dipping meat”.
The implementation of the modern system of prevention and control of the disease is being carried out, with basic quarantine personnel commensurate with the scale of the farming and the tasks of the work, and the establishment of the first line of protection against the disease.
Faithful demands are made that the meat market be fully guaranteed, that there be no large-scale shortages and large-scale disruptions, and that the pork market for major holidays be stabilized.
The meeting also deployed efforts to keep the African swine plague under control, to stop arrests in key waters of my governor's river basin, and to buy rice in the middle and late hours of the province.
Old Shanghai characters like Fatherland, Spirit of the Nation, Big White Rabbit, attend party classes for college students.
The campus of "Me and my country" has a card point for college students to "get happy."
On the occasion of the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, Shanghai's soap-making, millennia, large white rabbits, and four famous Shanghai Polytechnic University “Arts” have gathered on the 27th day. Four Shanghai's old characters, representing an average of more than 90 years of history, have told over 200 young students about their homeland and their nation's spirit.
The products of the old brand are displayed on the scene.
The talk in the classroom has caused the students to wonder that the products of the old brand have been carefully displayed outside the classroom, and that the “Me and My Country” campus has been marked with a “no-show.”
Big hare plaster, big hare ice cream... as an old brand name, big hare milk has been actively changing in recent years, taking the initiative, insisting on innovation and crossing borders.
The Great White Rabbit, born in 1959, coincided with his 60th birthday this year.
It will also target the youth consumer groups.
Wang Weiji, Deputy Director General and Secretary of Shanghai Living Food Company, referred to the scene of “spreading abalone, summer inflammation, Autumn Depression and Drunk Shrimp, and Winter Clouds,” reflecting the constant innovation in “eating”.
Companies are also further exploring brand culture in terms of taste innovation, caricature packaging, etc. to adapt to the heritage of the younger consumer groups.
The old sign represents a live talk about the path of innovation in the art class.
The manager of Shanghai's New Year's Cake and Catering Company, Yuji, also said, "All innovations are based on solid foundations, and every innovation with an old code is a thin process.
Every person has a hidden expectation of the old word.
The era of small and beautiful should begin with product-centred. It's not like we're going anywhere.
As one of the first “old Chinese characters” in the country, Shanghai has also rapidly adapted to market trends, upgrading brand VI visualizations, introducing professional operating teams and achieving substantial increases in turnover.
“The old characters are not only visible in these traditional channels, such as supermarkets, but are now also actively involved in new retailing and activities.
All of our changes, ultimately, will be achieved by making them accessible to consumers, hearing them, and finally buying them. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The Deputy General Manager of Soap (Group) Ltd. in Shanghai said O-Yang Ling.
In the future, Shanghai soap-making will also adhere to high-end development, with the system developing promising and user-friendly energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products and pursuing high-technology and cost-effective paths.
Through this art class, students have gained a lot.
I grew up with the old words, carrying the good memories and emotions of my childhood. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Song Xien-jin lamented.
The old Shanghai characters represent more than 200 young students who tell the story of their country and the spirit of their nation.
Zhou Xiaoting said that the question of how to exploit brand culture so that quality traditional culture can be inherited from generation to generation is a matter of reflection and exploration as a design student.
The party course is based on the "Shanghai Image" project of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts of the Technological University of China, Professor Nishang's "old-name integrated brand innovation studio", which seeks to deepen the cultural potential and modern business values of the old-named characters, to build on the competitiveness and influence of the old-name Shanghai characters, to increase cultural radioactivity, to achieve the industrial effects of "1+1>2" in the form of "design+culture", and to present Shanghai culture from a new perspective.
According to the information received, the art class will also continue to invite speakers from literature history, drawing masters, pottery masters, non-pentine masters, architects and landscape masters, through their talk of innovation and adherence to Chinese culture, highlighting the features of the times, further strengthening the ideal beliefs of university students, the love of university students, speaking out and making their work sound, the form of innovation party classes, the subject matter classes that students love, the ideological, theoretical and personality of party classes, the relevance of the party classes, the inflammation of party classes, and the development of new people who are capable of taking up the post of national renaissance!
Abe 3rd video to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the New China.
On the 26th of local time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe via video message congratulated the People ' s Republic of China on its seventieth anniversary.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good evening, I am Shinzo Abe.
On the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the establishment of the People ' s Republic of China, I wish to extend, on behalf of the Government and people of Japan, our warm congratulations.
At the G20 Osaka Summit in June, Japan and China collaborated to make the summit a success and, through the G20 Leaders Osaka Summit Declaration, expressed the firm will of the G20 to the world.
In addition, at the Japan-China summit and dinner preceding the summit, it was agreed that President Xi Jinping would undertake a State visit to Japan next spring, with a unanimous determination to usher in a new era.
Together, Japan and China have a great responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.
I am convinced that a new model for future relations between the two countries will benefit from the joint efforts of the two countries to address the problems facing the region and the world and to contribute to the international community.
In conclusion, I wish the day for relations to flourish and for the cause of my friends.
“In some cases, over-age rural workers are estimated to account for more than half.
Now, where do we find young workers?
There is no way to use so many old people on the site. It's not like it's a bad idea.
In recent days, Zou Zou Qui, a long-time construction contractor, has lamented the presence of a large number of over-age migrant workers (over retirement age) on the site.
In the recent period, the university where the author is based has been working on the rain-contaminated diversion project, and there have been a number of peasant workers on the campus, and if you look carefully, you will find that there are many older migrant workers.
Overage migrant workers are not “suspensive,” but rather “suspensive,” with the “must be so” impatience and hardship – whether they save money to solve their own old age and medical problems, or to help their children – driving these old people, who should be “suspensive,” to work.
The “old age” of overage farmers is not as easy as we thought.
With children, elderly people, children’s children, children’s homes, cars, children’s families, and grandchildren, when the peasant workers have done their “life tasks”, the bags have been empty, and even debts, mostly lacking wealth.
In order not to drag on children, but also to save some wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insist on “dating to work until they do”.
Many “after 80” or “after 90” or even “after 00” new generations of peasant workers are reluctant to engage in hard, labour-intensive secondary industries or low-end services, creating structural “unworkable” jobs, which offer opportunities for older rural workers.
In the absence of skills, physical and labour capacity has been reduced, and many overage migrant workers are engaged in high-intensity, low-income, high-risk and low-security jobs.
A day is a day, a day is a day to earn a little bit more, and the survival of the overage migrant worker behind the "no time" cannot be ignored or ignored.
To solve the problem of unpaid work, to improve labour protection, to reduce safety risks, to increase labour income and to improve the survival of over-age migrant workers, in addition to their “self-saving” system, the public sector’s welfare and human care are equally essential.
It has been pointed out by scholars that over-age migrant workers are no longer likely to rely on home farming to solve their old-age and medical problems and that they have to provide for their families in other ways.
The impotence and strength to read “no time” for older migrant workers helps us to better understand the love and pain of older migrant workers.
Seeing the shadows of over-age migrant workers, hearing their groaning, trying to get them back to the countryside to truly “live their old age,” requires shared responsibility among the public sector, the market, and society, and a combination of efforts.
Chemezov said that Russia would not export such a system for the next five years, because “first supply its own army, then export production”.
This approach is fully consistent with international practice.
The major producers of arms and military equipment are always the first to ensure their defence needs before processing export orders.
Earlier, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Sky Force, General Yuri Grihoff, indicated that the development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by the “Folder-Antaire” Aerial Defense Concien.
This is a new generation of anti-aircraft systems, using the working principles used to destroy ballistics and aerodynamics objectives.
The main role of S-500 is to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles and to intercept missiles with a range below 3,500 kilometres.
In addition, according to some information, S-500 can destroy high ultrasound cruise missiles, as well as aircraft, almost all types of drones, high ultrasound missiles that exceed five times the sound speed, or even near-space targets.
Such weapons could also form a unified network with other air defence systems, particularly the S-400 system, which was very important from a national defence perspective.
Sergei Chemezov expressed particular concern about S-400.
He said that the system was currently in great demand in the world, but that the Russian army also needed it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 anti-aircraft systems entered the Arctic Air Defence Corps.
According to information received on 15 September, work has been completed on the conversion of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system by the New Island Arctic Air Corps.
This is not the militarization of Russia in the Arctic.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, this is entirely a process within the plan for the transition to a more advanced defence tool in the strategic direction of the north.
According to the Russian Northern Fleet Information Service: “As a result of the transition to the new S-400 air defence system, the controlled airspace of the Arctic region has increased significantly. It's not like it's a bad idea.
It is very important that the military assess that the system has been used successfully in the far north and the Arctic.
Air defence unit officers trained and prepared for combat duty on the new system.
Previously equipped with a S-300 long-range air defence system, a portion of it remains.
As far as air defence systems are concerned, they must possess weapons capable of destroying a wide range of aerial targets, be they high-speed targets at an outer altitude or “spillfish” near protected facilities.
According to open sources, the S-400 "Trimph" system, developed by the “Gold Diamond-Anteté” Aerial Defence Concein, was designed for strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high ultrasound targets and other aerial attack weapons.
The weapon can strike aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 kilometres and shoot down ballistic targets flying 4.8 kilometres per second within a distance of 60 kilometres.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defence forces in the far north to ensure the security of airspace on the northern sea lanes.
Not long ago, the first 12 sets of Tor - M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, sufficient to form an air defence camp to strengthen the Arctic air defence systems.
The Russian Ministry of Defence stated at that time that the Arctic “Tor” forces would be expanded to full brigade-size formations in the future.
These sophisticated anti-aircraft weapons, together with the new S-400 long-range systems deployed on the New Island and the Kola peninsula and the “Pantsir-SA” short-range systems deployed in the far north, provide a powerful shield for the Russian polar sky.
It will be difficult for enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles to break through this defence.
According to the Russian Government, the flagship shop would be a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods and avoid a complex and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
As an operator of a Russian store, the Russian Multi-product Company focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
The largest trade platforms in China, such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduduo, Hand Q (ShouQ), Multifunctional Instant Communication Software (Wechat), have online shops and own their own online platform, Ependuo.com, and Russian retail stores.
The Russian export centre will develop marketing strategies and participation criteria for the shop, together with the Russian Federation, and screen for virtual shelf-mounted companies.
The shop is scheduled to open before the end of this year and build products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
Information from the Russian Export Centre indicates that the total number of visits per month to the Chinese electrician platform is as high as 1 billion.
At the same time, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, reaching over $1 billion in 2018.
At present, the group will also open pilot shops to sell commodities from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of the global import strategy.
According to Alexei Kojevnikov, the new store will display the commodities of enterprises with a sales volume of at least 500 million roubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and the sales of 500 million roubles are still inadequate.
We all know that Chinese consumers are quite positive about Russian goods, considering our goods as high-quality and green products.”
Kozhevnikov stated that competition for highly purchasing power Chinese consumers was intense and increasing.
He said: “Our goal is ambitious, with 500 businesses launched through this shop within three years. It's not like it's a bad idea.
At the same time, the platform will build the products of Russian enterprises in the Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, Professor at the Trade Policy Fundamentals Unit of the Economic University of Plekhanov, Russia, said: “This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, since Russian export centres are State-owned and not private institutions.”
“I do not see a large number of highly competitive Russian goods in the market. It's not like we're going anywhere.
He believed that the project would probably not really be implemented, but would help to strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to Russian news agencies, the President of the Russian Export Centre, Andrey Slepnev, stated during the Eastern Economic Forum that the product information of more than 170 Russian enterprises had been published on the largest international wholesale platform, Alibaba.com, which could be purchased in China and other countries.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with the Ali Baba Group, namely, the training project for Russian enterprises by experts from the University of Poppy, whose first seminar was held in July of this year.
The Russian export centre at the second China International Import Fair in Shanghai in November this year will also be the organizer of industrial exhibitions and commercial projects for Russian enterprises.
A large exhibition will be held in the 1,000 m2 exhibition hall, which will also serve as a centre for commercial project activities, signing of agreements, promotion sessions and meetings with Chinese business representatives.
Some 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Information Service of the Russian Export Centre said: “In addition to the agricultural stand, we will certainly hold business meetings, that is, arrange direct links between entrepreneurs”.
“This is another direction of our efforts to support businesses and to ensure that dozens of specialized meetings are organized for them. It's not like it's a bad idea.
In addition, there will be a master's class, a cooking competition and a Russian food fair for cooking in Russia under the project “Exploring the Sea Station above Russian foods”.
Following Friday ' s decision by the Coroner ' s Office of Mohamad Adi that the death was not accidental, the police waited for a full report and for instructions from the Attorney-General ' s Office to proceed.
The National Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation issued a statement on Friday that, in accordance with the decision of the Coroner, the police would await further instructions from the General Prosecutor ' s Office.
In his statement, he stressed that the police had never terminated the investigation into the Mojam murder, which was still ongoing.

In the past, the anxiety scene of waiting for a car was staged almost daily at a bus station.
It is difficult to know how long the bus runs, how far it travels and where it is located, and the problem of the public handing over of pain points needs to be addressed, especially in some large cities, where long commuters and complex traffic at peak hours of early and late commuting, which has made it difficult to secure the speed of the bus.

Xinhua Times: Stand firm and stay on our own path.
The White Paper " China and the World of the New Age " , published on 27 July, answered: For the past 70 years, China ' s development has been successful essentially because, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the correct path of Chinese identity socialism and have steadfastly followed it.
It was the choice of history and the choice of the people that China would follow the path of its own development.
In recent times, in an environment of weak poverty and internal distress, a generation of ingenuity volunteers have sought and followed up on the path to the rescue of the nation.
However, “the constitutional monarchy, the revival of the monarchy, the parliamentary system, the multiparty system, the presidential system have all been thought of, tried, and the results have not worked. It's not like it's a bad idea.
It was only with the Communist Party of China and the new China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a path of Chinese socialism in practice.
This path has been followed by China as a path of happiness for its people, as well as for the revival of the Chinese nation, and as a path of common development between China and the rest of the world.
It is on the right path that China will be able to do its job well, become the second largest economy in the world and contribute most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world from its own development.
As the White Paper points out, this path of development in China is in line with China ' s national circumstances and adapts to the requirements of the times, and will increasingly show bright development prospects as the times move forward.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how hard it is to find the right path; looking around the world, the Chinese people value it more.
The Chinese understand the logic of the North and South Orange and understand that what suits others does not necessarily fit themselves, but only what suits them.
It was with that confidence and strategic strength that China created a miracle of world visibility.
In the twisting process ahead of humanity, the "end-of-his-life conclusion" has been famous.
Today, the success of China’s specialist socialist path has declared the end of the “end of history”, the collapse of “China’s collapse” and the failure of “socialism’s failure.”
China ' s success has boosted the confidence of the developing countries to become rich and rich. It has broadened the path towards modernization in the developing countries. It has provided experience and lessons for the world ' s countries and peoples who wish to accelerate their development while remaining independent.
The world is rich and diverse.
China has always respected the right of countries to choose a path of development appropriate to their own circumstances.
Rather than “input” foreign models or “output” China's models, China will firmly move its own path, achieve its own continued development, strengthen its relations with countries in governance and make its due contribution to the common achievement of good governance.
At the Fair Work Commission, it was discovered that a 66-year-old female worker had been fired by text message from a director of the Foodworks supermarket because he preferred to hire an employee from an Asian background, and that the boss’s practice had been harshly criticized as “a disgraceful”.
The Commission stated that Ms. Gail Ayton's boss, who had worked at Wagga Wagga's store for more than 20 years, Jianbin Wang, translated it in English by Eddie, treated her employees “extremely unfair” and could violate anti-discrimination laws.
Ms. Ayton told the Committee that Mr. Wang had taken over the store in 2016 and that he had been “wanted to fire me”, because she was not Chinese.
In this case, the Vice-Chairman of the Commission, Peter Sams, conducted a search on the Internet and found “a number of job advertisements previously issued by Mr. Wang at various Australian Chinese employment forums”.
Among the job requirements listed for these positions is one that says "Present Asian woman" and the other that "Present Asian employee".
The third post says that he “will prefer people abroad (sic)”.
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton by text message in April of this year, later claiming that this was due to her absence from work and to a small cash shortage allegedly occurring on the cash register ranging from $5.10 to $30.
However, Mr. Sams stated that the reasons for Mr. Wang ' s dismissal of Ms. Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
She has only been absent for one shift in three years, and the “missing amount” amounts to several Australian dollars.
He states that Ms. Ayton was dismissed “in fact unrelated to her conduct or behaviour”.
He said, “It seems to me that the real reason why Mr. Wang should dismiss her was that he preferred to hire staff with an Asian background, supported by evidence of an advertisement.
According to section 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang ' s conduct appears to constitute a violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or dismissal of the applicant is unlawful. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Mr. Sams said that, given Mr. Wang's “horrifying” treatment of Ms. Ayton, it was inappropriate for him to consider reinstating her position.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, a casual worker with an hourly salary of $26.
In view of the possible violation of anti-discrimination and labour relations legislation, Sams indicated that he would submit his decisions and documents to the Committee to consider whether Mr. Wang ' s actions should be referred to other bodies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
He states that Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
He said: “I believe that an irremediably unfair and biased procedure should be adopted to dismiss the applicant, and Mr. Wang has the opportunity to “wait”, which he believes would `prove' the termination of the applicant's employment. It's not like it's a bad idea.
“He is wrong ... the defence should have completely ignored any natural and fair treatment given to the applicant when dismissing her, and it is alarming that he acted in an indecent and grossly unjust manner. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Mr. Sams stated that, although Foodworks was a small business, “it must be said frankly that no decent employer would dismiss an employee in the most unfair and perfunctory manner recognized in this case. It's not like it's a bad idea.
He said: “This is shameful and extremely unfair. It's not like we're going anywhere.

On 27 September, a journalist from Guo Guo Guo Guangzhou, China, was informed by the Guang Iron Group that, in order to meet the need for passengers to travel on National Day Gold Week, the Group would continue to open hot-side trains, which would bring the total number of passenger trains to 175 per day during the holidays, thereby increasing overall traffic during the peak of the Golden Week.
The Group will undertake a number of initiatives to provide passenger services during peak passenger flows.

In addition, in order to facilitate the flow of passengers to Guangzhou South Station, a total of 19 self-service real name verification devices were added, totalling 71.
In order to alleviate the presence and congestion of vehicles on the north-south stop, three new parking lots will be opened at the south stop in Guangzhou, with 1,000 additional parking spaces to alleviate the pressure on traffic around the south stop.
The Shenzhen North Station will open a “high-terrestrial” green exit.
On 6-7 October, passenger traffic reached its peak, and the A2 exit at Shenzhen North Station will be connected to the subway to provide access to passengers arriving during peak hours.
In addition, East and West Square provides normal U-coloured shortcuts for passengers arriving at the station 15 minutes before driving and for specially focused passengers.
On the eve of the National Golden Week, the Guang9 passenger section conducts full-time operational training to ensure that the full crew of the crew learns to acquire business knowledge, improves the quality of their services, and ensures that the train crews perform each and every trip with a good mental and more professional quality of service and provide better service to passengers.
Six people denied selling fake Makkah paper.
The six men suspected of forging and selling our passports, paper paper and identity cards, including an Assistant Director of the State Register, as well as a businessman with the rank of Governor, were brought to court on Thursday, and the judges of the Chamber approved the charges against trafficking in persons and migrants and referred them to the High Court for trial.
One of the defence counsels, originally representing the Dao-Chinese accused, Le Zhenhua (translation), and Member of Parliament Rael of the Sunset Hole District, applied to the judge to withdraw from representing the case, i.e. no longer acting as counsel for the accused, which was granted.
He states that he himself has been criticized by his political opponents on behalf of the accused and that his party of action has been implicated.
He stressed that he was not afraid of any threats in himself, but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to denigrate the party and the HLC Government or other HLC leaders, and that such a decision was taken after careful consideration.
He adds that there is no conflict of interest between representing the accused and being a member of Parliament, and that he is not legally prohibited from representing any of the accused, nor has he been convicted to date.
The six defendants were charged in court on 12 September this year, facing charges under article 26E of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Trafficking in Migrants Act, as well as under article 466 of the Penal Code (false documents), without having been granted leave to stand trial.
On Thursday, two District Judges, Nosaha, and Mazlan, after the presentation of the prosecution and the defence, granted the prosecution ' s application for referral to the High Court of charges relating to the anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking of migrants decrees involving six accused; the case of forgery of documents will be heard in the District Court on 3 October, pending the transfer of documents from the prosecution to the defence.
The first six defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Ordinance 2012 (SOSMA) and the judge did not grant bail.
Traveling with the motherland — Script by one of the FAPD teams
Kimqiu, a brigade of uniformed police officers of an average strength of 1.83 metres, is busy with training.
Shining stings, unique olive greens and red shoulder bands together form a beautiful landscape.
The day before, journalists walked into the party and felt the determination of the officers to remain party and people's loyalists and their “honour best” love and pursuit.
“Dreaming a glorious life, writing the legends of the new age...” is a collective song written by soldiers and soldiers of the Flying with the Fatherland.
This song is the motto of every member of the team.
Zi Xiaoqin, 1.92 metres tall, stands out in the line.
As the flag-bearer of the flag guard of the former Military Police, he had a deeper understanding of honour.
The honour of soldiers comes from hard training.
Training has always been highly standard and demanding as a flag player.
He was dressed in sandbags, he was stuck in seconds, he was blindfolded, and he was stable against the wind.
In his “flag career”, one picture remains unforgettable.
A flag-raising ceremony took place with heavy rain and none of the tourists who came to watch the flag-raising ceremony left.
At the moment when the flag was raised, Zi Xiao Gwang felt deeply the glory of the five-star red flag on his shoulder.
In 2019, Zi Xiaogang was selected as the reference soldier.
The benchmark and the flag-hand movement standards are different.
Zi Xiaogang explained that while the movement of the flag-bearers and the base soldiers was only 20 steps away, more effort was needed in training.
The base soldier is the first in the first row and directly determines the degree of alignment of the formation.
After intensive training, he kicked repeatedly every day and practiced hard kicks.
In the demonstration, he won a round of applause with a precise scale and speed.
Almost every soldier in the unit has the same experience as Zi Xiaog.
The father of the soldier, Zhu Xudong, attended the military parade on the fiftieth anniversary 20 years ago.
In order to follow his father ' s footsteps and become a member of his team, he suffered setbacks from time to time and was never discouraged.
He said, “It is an honor for me to walk through Tiananmen Square like my father, to be seen by the party and the people, and to suffer whatever it takes.” It's not like it's a bad idea.
Entering the team's honors room, the eight big words of the capital's "Standing Master" were shown in the curtains.
We're all from the Beijing Chief of Military Police. This is a unit with an honourable tradition, which has been entrusted with such important tasks as the opening of the country, the celebration of national celebrations, the security of successive party national congresses and the security of the capital in the fight against terrorism. It has produced a large number of model groups and individuals, such as the “flagged champion” “Defence Heroes Squadron”, and more than 50 units and individuals have been awarded honorary titles by the State Council, the Central Military Commission and the Armed Police.
A reception of foreign experts to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China
The reception of foreign experts to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the People ' s Republic of China was held in the People ' s Hall on the evening of the 27th, with the presence of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, Deputy Prime Minister Han Zheng, and his address.
On behalf of the Chinese Government and on behalf of President Xi Jinping, Han Jing first expressed his sincere thanks and greeted all foreign experts and international friends interested in, supporting and participating in China ' s reform, openness and modernization.
Han is saying that, since the establishment of the new China, and especially for more than 40 years of reform and opening up, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has led all the peoples of the country to their thorns, their strength and their strength, and has succeeded in moving out of a Chinese-style path of socialism, ushering in a great leap from standing up and being rich to being strong.
Since its 18th anniversary, the central party centre, with Comrade Xi at its centre, has taken a holistic approach to the overall “Four Ones” and coordinated the advancement of the “Four Alls” strategic layout, which has led to historic achievements and changes in the Party's and the State's cause.
The 70-year development achievements of the new China were the result of the tireless efforts of the Chinese people and the hard work of foreign experts.
Over the past 70 years, a large number of foreign experts have come to China and have joined the Chinese people in their efforts to modernize and build, making indelible contributions that the Chinese people will never forget.
As Han pointed out, China ' s development is at the beginning of a new history, and the Chinese people are struggling to build a small and prosperous society for the final victory, to take over the great victory of China ' s new era of socialism and to achieve the great revival of the Chinese nation.
China will insist that “development is the first priority, that talent is the first resource, and that innovation is the first engine”, and will vigorously pursue innovation-driven development strategies and promote high-quality economic development.
The human being is the most innovative and dynamic factor, and China will accelerate the development of a large number of strategic scientific and technological skills, leading science and technology personnel, young science and technology personnel and high-level innovation teams at the international level.
Han Zheng stated that China ' s cause was one supported by the people of the world, one open to learning from the world and one of cooperation with the countries of the world.
In a more open and inclusive gesture, China will learn from the peoples of the world in a conscious spirit and firmly pursue a policy of introducing more active, open and effective talent.
We sincerely welcome the increasing number of foreign experts coming to China for innovative entrepreneurship, and the participation of talented and handsome people from all over the world in the modernization of China and their greater contribution to the building of a community of human destiny and to the cause of world peace and human progress.
Liu crane, Yang Jiechi, Chen Chi, Zhang Chun Xian, Shaw Jie and Wan Gang attended the reception.
The reception was hosted by Wang Zhigang, Minister of Science and Technology.
The reception was attended by older foreign experts who have been working in China for a long time, by representatives and spouses of foreign experts working in China, by the competent authorities of central and State institutions, and by comrades in Beijing, for a total of about 1,800 persons.
Our most deep rail well is dug into the end.
On September 27, Xinhua’s electricity service (journalist Ding Yiquan) reported that the country’s railroad’s first-largest rail station – the main well of Tunnel No. 1 of the Grand (Leary) railway – was successfully drilled to the end on the 27th day, with 762.59 metres deep breaking the country’s most deep railway rig record.
During tunnel construction, wells can be used to improve tunnel ventilation, improve efficiency and secure construction.
The chief engineer of the project's long wells, Song Tao, said: “The successful excavation of the main wells of the Tunnel No. 1 will help to advance the construction of the underground of the wells, open up multiple working surfaces for later construction of the positive holes, and smoothing, and speed up the construction of the entire Tunnel in the Mount. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Song Tao described the construction of the Tunnel No. 1 in Gao Lilongón as a well-drilling exercise, which was accompanied by a well-drilling rig, a well-drilling rig, a general moving metal template, a FJD-6A umbrella drill, a central roller, and a large specialized machinery, which resulted in a mechanized flow of water, such as a mechanized excavation system, a scavenger system, a suspension system, a winch lifting system, and a full-process mechanized operation, such as eye-hitting, blasting, scavengering, template installation, concrete work, etc.
It is understood that the Trans-Sino-Kino-Kino-Kino-Kino-Kino-Kino-Kino-Kino-Kino-Kino-Sino-Kino-Kino-Kino-Kino-Kino-Kino-Sino-Kino-Kino-Kino-Kino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Kino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Kino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Kino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino railway railway route is located in the eastern Dajiji and West-Si Rily, which is approximately 331 kilometres long and designed at 140 kilometres per hour.
The 34.538 km long tunnel at Mount Goligon is our first railway.
The TV show "Foot-Foot" takes the field view, and we're back on line.
In recent days, the series " Fox Hunting " , a series of cross-border criminal investigations, has taken a live view at Tianjin airport, and actors such as Wang Kai and Wang Gook have taken important scenes, such as the return of the fugitive economic suspects, with the support of South China Airlines.
The Fox-Foots team this time at the airport filmed the most important performance of Operation Fox's law enforcement – the Fox-Foots team's pursuit of fugitives, the taking of planes, the signing of arrest warrants, etc.
The team took pictures of the aprons, customs border controls and the cabins, doors, etc., and recreated the difficult and professional journeys of China's dry detectives and fox hunters to catch fugitives.
In order to successfully complete the film, the Fox-Foot-Creating Team has done a lot of preparatory work, repeatedly confirming each of the details of the execution and ensuring the most real and direct visual impact.
It is known that the play will also be viewed abroad.
Viet Nam needs to seize opportunities for artificial intelligence development.
The four criteria used to assess and rank cities against the level of preparation for the wave include prospects, realization, asset base and direction of development.
Singapore is ranked first, followed by cities in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
In response to an interview with the journalist, the expert from Oliver Wyman said: “I find it very interesting to review and evaluate cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.
On the whole, I believe that Viet Nam ' s future is bright in the context of high growth rates, a strong path towards economic development and a rapidly growing talent base.
I believe that Viet Nam is on the right path and has done well.
It was important for Viet Nam to know how to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the fourth industrial revolution to promote greater economic development. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Artificial intelligence is completely changing people ' s work, communication and lifestyle.
It brings greater efficiency, but also poses the threat of exacerbating social, economic and technological inequalities.
However, according to a global study organized by Oliver Wyman, there are only any cities in the world today that are prepared for the breakthroughs of the age of artificial intelligence.
Gutierrez expressed his pleasure at celebrating here together the seventieth anniversary of China ' s founding and congratulated the Chinese Government and people on the impressive achievements of the past 70 years.
Gutierrez said, "Every time I visit China, I'm shocked by the speed with which it changes and advances.
You have created one of the world’s most dynamic economies and helped more than 850 million people out of poverty – the largest poverty-reducing achievement in history. It's not like it's a bad idea.
He stated that China had witnessed transformative results in achieving the vision of the Millennium Development Goals: reduced infant and maternal mortality, improved nutrition, reduced stunted population, and halved the number of people without access to safe drinking water and sanitation.
At the same time, China has one of the best educational systems in the world, attracting international students from all over the world.
A photo exhibit celebrating the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China was opened today at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
According to Guterres, this year is also the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations presence in China.
Over the past 40 years, China has been a key participant in the work of the United Nations and a pillar of international cooperation and multilateralism.
After promoting the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, China is actively pursuing the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030.
As the second largest contributor to the regular and peacekeeping budgets of the United Nations, China has been a partner in ensuring the stability of United Nations activities.
China has contributed troops to eight peacekeeping missions, including more than 1,000 Blue Helmets serving in South Sudan.
Gutierrez stated, “On the threshold of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, we need to renew global partnerships to support multilateral solutions to global crises.
I look forward to China ' s continued commitment and engagement in building a better world for all. It's not like we're going anywhere.
Wang Yi, State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, stated that the Chinese people had struggled hard for 70 years to create unprecedented opportunities for development.
For 70 years, the Chinese people have been with the world.
China ' s achievements are not just those of China, but those of the world and humankind.
The exhibition described the struggle of the Chinese people, their remarkable achievements and their contribution to the world.

Wang Yi, State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs, is reading the report on sustainable development at the United Nations.
The story of national unity is here, and China ' s policy of regional autonomy for its people has achieved great success, both in Xinjiang, North and South of Tianshan, and in Tibet, in the snow plateau.
Rapid economic development, social peace and stability and the well-being of the people.
Wang Yi said that the exhibition also told the story of the Chinese people building eco-civilization, the story of peaceful development, the story of the development of the “one way forward” initiative, and the story of the community that breeds destiny.
As President Xi Jinping of China has said, Green Water and Green Mountain is Silver Mountain.
As a result of continuous efforts, China had embarked on a green development path.
China pursues a peaceful foreign policy, actively establishes diplomatic relations with all countries of the world, plays a role in resolving hotspot issues and is a central force in world peace.
In the face of the major changes that have not been seen in the world for a century, China is actively defending the international system, with the United Nations at its core.
After 70 years, China is young, young and bright, and no matter how international winds change, we will stick to our own beginnings.
Wang Yi met with Kasera, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malawi
On 26 local time, the Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Wang Qi, met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malawi, Kaserra, during his appearance at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Wang Yi stated that for 12 years, relations between the two countries had developed steadily and in good health, and that exchanges and cooperation in various fields had been advancing steadily.
Last year, President Xi Jinping invited President Mutharika to China to attend the Beijing summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, and the heads of State of the two countries met fruitfully to lead China-Ma relations to a new level.
China is ready to work with the Chinese side to continue to implement the important consensus of the heads of State of the two countries and the outcome of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, and to promote practical cooperation between the two countries.
China is ready to work with the Chinese side to enhance communication and cooperation in international affairs in order to safeguard the common interests of both sides and the great interests of Central Africa.
Kasera stated that China was a true friend of Malawi and African countries and that its development benefited the people of Malawi.
The Chinese side is committed to the one-China policy and is grateful to China for its support and assistance to Malawi.
It looked forward to the further development of relations and welcomed more Chinese enterprises to invest in the country.
About 800 million people travel around China to resonate with China's tourist demand and supply.
About 800 million trips will take place in the coming 11 Gold Week!
The large number of tourist platforms shows a boom in the supply and demand of our tourism consumer market.
The national holiday travel report predicts that, based on past national holiday tourism statistics, there will be close to 800 million domestic tourists on national holiday this year, and that there will be more than 7.5 million departures.
Currently, tourists from more than 500 cities booking products such as tour tours, free trade, custom tourism, local play, etc. through the platform, covering 100 countries and territories.
According to the Chinese Institute of Tourism, last year ' s national holiday was attended by 726 million tourists, an increase of 9.43 per cent over the previous year.
This year’s national holiday will not only be a new year for tourists, but an upgrade in consumption will also be the “main melody” of the national holiday trip.
The trip reported that the country spent more than $3,000 on national holiday trips across provinces, an increase over the same period last year, owing to the fact that tourists generally chose to experience better products, such as high-rated brand hotels, no-shopping tours, elite groups, specialty cars, etc.
A similar trend has been recorded in the booking data of the Mother Donkey Tourist Network, where the use of the Comfortable Car type for all long distances is more popular than in previous years.
Spring and autumn tourism data show that their consumers prefer experience, service, and differentiated “slowness”.
Flying pigs data show that the fastest increase in bookings for tourists in our four and below cities is 30%, reflecting an increase in consumption in more areas of the country.
Personalization is a feature of this year's Golden Week 11 tour.
The travel data show that the purchase order for a car to be rented on a national holiday is expected to increase by nearly 60% over the same year, and that short-distance trips to explore small crowd lines continue to be popular; and that the number of private groups enrolled increased by 155% over the same period.
Sharing joy becomes the main purpose of people ' s leisure.
Data on travel show that 28 per cent of visitors on national holiday are family members, 25 per cent are lovers and 23 per cent are friends of colleagues.
In terms of the age of visitors, “after 80” and “after 90” account for more than 50 per cent of all visitors.
It is a matter of concern that this year, in contrast to the past gold journeys, have grown more rapidly, the domestic market has been more “eye-opening”.
According to flying pigs, the number of bookings of the country’s official travel routes for this year’s national holiday increased by 42 per cent over the year, faster than the rate of departure.
The industry analyses that while demand is strong, tourism supply-side reforms are being promoted throughout the country, providing visitors with a much richer “gang-room dinner”.
For example, the National Directorate of Sports and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism have recently issued a joint publication entitled “The Golden Week Sports Tourism Quality Line in 2019”; The Shanghai Tourism Festival in 2019 was launched with seven blocks of 100 cultural and tourism events to attract both Chinese and foreign tourists; and close to the Golden Week, the provinces of Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong and other provinces have introduced price reductions or free measures.
The booking data show that the country’s destination with its unique natural or cultural characteristics is the most “fire” and that Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xi’an, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Tianjin will be the most popular domestic tourist destination cities.
The country's first live cinema-based film, " At this moment -- Celebrating the 70th Anniversary of New China " , will be broadcast simultaneously in 70 cinemas in more than 10 provinces across the country on October 1.
Central Radio and Television will broadcast live on the screen the 70th anniversary of the New China Congress, parades and mass marches via a 4K super-high-resolution signal.
The head of the Central Radio and Television Service (RTC) introduced it in Kyoto on the Day of the Fourth of the Nation, where it will build more than 100 air slots and place more than 200 sound-picking devices along Chang An Street and in regional high spots where celebrations take place, using camera language and simultaneous sound, for the first time achieving full flow, full element 4K super-high resolution and 5.1 round sound broadcasting.
China is expected to be Australia's largest export market for beef.
According to an animal protein analyst at the Dutch Cooperative Bank (Rabobank), after the outbreak of the African swine plague, China faced a severe shortage of pork and was expected to be Australia ' s largest export market for beef.
After the outbreak, Chinese consumers are shifting from eating pork to other animal proteins, which has led the authorities to destroy many herds. Over the past year, China ' s number of raw pigs has been halved and the price of pork almost doubled.
China produces and consumes two thirds of the world ' s pork.
The Senior Animal Protein Analyst Pan (Chenjun Pan, an interpreter) in the China region of the Dutch Cooperative Bank states that demand for other meat, including beef, has increased, and that China, the world’s largest animal protein importer, currently imports 27% of pork and 24% of beef.
Ms. Pan said that China ' s imports of beef from Australia had increased by 65 per cent in the first half of the year, and China had surpassed the United States and Japan and had become Australia ' s largest export market for beef.
Yesterday, the Chinese Government indicated that more pork would be released from emergency reserves before the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party of China.

Wang Yi: China has never been absent from helping Africa achieve peace and security.
On 26 September, local time, Wang Yi, Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs, attended the Council's public meeting on “Peace and Security in Africa” at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
In his statement, Wang Yi stated that China and Africa were good friends, brothers and partners.

On the path towards peaceful development in Africa, China will continue to stand firmly with Africa and join hands.
The world's oldest barber died at 108 years old.
An Anthony Mancinelli, the world’s highest-aged hairdresser with a gold world record certification in New York, has never retired to cut his customer’s hair on a daily basis, but Mancinelli died on 19th of his 96-year-old haircut.
CNN reports that Mansinelli emigrated to the United States at the age of eight, helped clean the floor in a barber shop for a short time, and started picking up scissors to serve his guests at the age of 12, thereby reducing the financial pressure on his family.
Mansinelli was in primary school but did not graduate.
The son of Mansionelli, Robert (Robert), revealed that his father loved work and people from all over the world liked him, but that he had been diagnosed with cancer in February and was unable to work six weeks before his death due to physical factors, but that was not retirement, because he planned to come back and cut his hair.
Robert, 82, said that after his father's death he must now find a new barber, because he had helped him cut his hair all his life.
In the course of the year, companies listed on the market repurchased over $100 billion to record-high Xinhua Network.
In order to stabilize the company ' s stock prices and preserve its image, the listed companies have, over the past two years, begun to buy back their shares frequently, hoping to send the information that the company ' s value is undervalued to the market through targeted buy-backs, pooled bidding, etc., thereby stabilizing stock prices and enhancing investor confidence.
The Eastern Wealth Choice data show that in 2017, the funds used by listed companies to buy back shares were $7.9 billion, rising sharply to $51 billion in 2018. Since 2019, the total value of repurchases carried out by listed A companies has exceeded $100 billion, resulting in an increase in the historical volume of repurchases of A shares, well above the previous year.
From the point of view of the purpose of the buy-back, the company's share buy-back appears to be the same as that of the large shareholders, but there are significant differences in the subject of the buy-back, the source of the funds, the purpose of the buy-back, and the equity itself.
In an interview with the daily Securities Journal, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Information Consulting Limited stated that in November 2018, the Opinions on Supporting Repurchases of Shares by Listed Companies, which had been issued, had improved the current system of repurchases of shares in a narrow range, complex decision-making procedures, and inadequate stock systems, which had led to a significant increase in repurchases of shares by listed companies since they had been encouraged from a policy standpoint.
In January of this year, the official regulations for the repurchase of shares by listed companies were issued, which broadened the sources of finance for listed companies, streamlined the procedures for implementation, and led to improved governance arrangements, encouraging listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee holding schemes.
With the issuance of the opinion, the listed company conducted the stock buy-back exercise with greater applicability, simpler buy-back processes and greater incentive to repurchase shares.
Repurchase of shares in a relatively low location would also facilitate more efficient use of funds by listed companies, thereby increasing the level of profits per share, increasing the rate of return on net assets and reducing pressure on corporate profitability indicators.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies is of greater significance than the increase in the number of large shareholders, and reflects the willingness of listed companies to manage their active market value and the abundance of cash flows.
Xu Yang argued that undervalued stock prices were the main factor in repurchases by listed companies, whose stock prices no longer reflected the future development prospects of companies, and that such companies were therefore of concern to investors, but could not be invested blindly, and required attention to the financial accounts of such listed companies and their specific operations.
A listed company with large-scale buy-backs at least demonstrates its development confidence and financial strength.
The interest in buybacks by A-listed companies is increasing, and repurchases have become a norm, with data showing that nearly a thousand listed companies have repurchased shares this year, and leading firms in various industries have become the main market for buybacks.
China has recently disclosed the progress of buy-backs in a safe manner, stating that the company has cumulatively repurchased 5.75 million shares of A shares, or 0.315 per cent of the company’s total equity, and that the total amount paid is $5 billion (excluding transaction costs). Repurchases will be fully used in the employee-held scheme, including but not limited to the long-term service plans that have been considered by the company’s shareholders conference.
Ely has paid $5,792 million for equity buy-backs and has recently adjusted the purpose of the buy-backs, with the planned change from “the buy-backs will be fully used as a source of equity incentives for later implementation” to “the cumulative buy-backs of 183 million, of which 152 million will be used to implement equity buy-backs and the remaining 3.049 million will be used to reduce the registered capital”.
Ely indicated that the cancellation of part of the repurchased shares would further increase the level of return per share and effectively increase the return on investment of the company ' s shareholders.
The TCL Group issued a repurchase announcement on 25 September that the TCL Group had repurchased a cumulative 359 per cent of its shares at a total cost of $1.65 billion.
The TCL Group Board Office indicated to the daily Securities Journal reporter that the buy-back shares would be used for employee-held schemes, equity incentives or corporate bonds that could be converted to shares issued by listed companies.
The TCL Group adheres to its established business strategy and continuously improves competitiveness and sustains healthy development.
Based on confidence in the company ' s future development and the preservation of investors ' interests, combined with the performance of the company ' s stock in the second market over the past year, and taking into account the company ' s business performance and financial position, the company plans to buy back its shares using its own funds, self-financing and other forms of financing.
The Chief Economist of the former Open Source Fund, Yang Drum, stated that the operation of repurchases of shares by listed companies could, on the one hand, reduce the number of shares in circulation in the market and increase the earnings of each share of the listed company, which would be an important benefit to the stock price of the secondary market; moreover, the willingness of listed companies to take out real silver and silver and cancel their repurchases from the stock market had greatly boosted market confidence.
Repurchases by domestic listed companies have gradually increased in recent years, particularly in the case of performance equity, and the promotion of investor confidence through repurchases of shares is a very good way to go and is a positive and encouraging practice.
The Hunan Provincial Council's Standing Committee, Changsha City Council Secretary Hu Jinhua, and the four leaders of engineering machinery – Jan Juncheng, Liang Changgen, Ho Qinghua, Liu Feixiang – set up a “small target” around Changsha, “From engineering to intelligent manufacturing” – three or five years later creating a world-leading cluster of engineering machinery industries.
The world’s leading industrial cluster of engineering and machinery in Changsha is, in modern terms, “the strongest surface.”
As an inland provincial capital city, Changsha calls out this rhetoric.
The power of the hegemonic side leaks.
The four engineering mechanics who participated in the dialogue, one by one, covered the whole field of air, ground, sea and land: a river-smart light aircraft, a concrete delivery pump in China, a full-ground crane in China and China, and a tunnel shield for iron and steel heavy workers.
At some point, China had little say in the area of engineering machinery.
In time, Chinese enterprises “into” and “out” are driven by double-wheels, taking advantage of the "one-way" initiative, and taking advantage of a combination of acquisitions, mergers, plant-building, etc., to become the global business of engineering and machinery.
Among them, the leading engineering and mechanical enterprises, such as the three heavy workers, the Central and Central Trade Union, the Iron and Steel Industry and the Mountain River Intelligence, have achieved a significant lead in terms of the value of their production, market occupancy and sales.
It's a camera that moves at the moment.
The Engineering Mechanical Corps, the “Four Great Kings”, is the leader of the Changsha Engineering Mechanical Cluster and the leading enterprise in the global engineering machinery industry.
In the midst of the global industry, who survives and lives well is the hard man to speak.
Earlier on, the global engineering and machinery industry experienced a cold winter, with a number of internationally known engineering and machinery manufacturers falling, but Changsha’s engineering and machinery manufacturing companies used “cat winter” as a “winter swim” when they put pressure on themselves to break through, transform from manufacturing to intellectual construction, and not only survive, but also strengthen their bodies.
It's because of the political partnership of the stars.
The development of niche industries requires active enterprise and government action.
Changsha's reputation as a “complex of engineering machinery” is based on bringing together industry-wide chains from upstream to downstream, creating clusters of related industries and significantly reducing the costs of research and development, manufacturing and marketing by optimizing the business environment, improving support services and simplifying the approval process.
Good commercial ecology has brought engineering and mechanical manufacturing enterprises to the fore.
History has pushed long sand to the front stage of building a global engineering machine leading the way.
Both Governments and enterprises, as well as the relevant producers and researchers, should seize opportunities, move forward, target and sustain their efforts and contribute to building strong nations.
Wang Yi chaired the Foreign Ministers of China and the African States members of the Security Council.
Wang Yi said that China was a good brother and a good partner with African countries.
China stands firmly with its African brothers, past, present and future.
Our initiative to hold such a meeting is a concrete step towards implementing the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and the leaders of African countries at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation last September. It is aimed at strengthening China ' s solidarity with African countries in the Council and at promoting better international support for Africa ' s peace and development.
Wang Yi said that Africa was China ' s most important and trusted partner.
As a permanent member, China's vote on the Council has always belonged to a large number of developing countries, including African countries.
In the light of the new situation, China is ready to work with African countries in the Security Council to strengthen solidarity and cooperation and to safeguard its common interests.
The two sides should be united in strength, settle their disputes through negotiation, become self-reliant and govern on development.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the participating African States thanked China for its initiative in convening this meeting and congratulated the new China on its seventieth anniversary.
The Ministers stated that inter-Chinese relations are based on equality and mutual respect, and that Africa and China have always been the most trusted and trusted partners.
The Non-Aligned Movement appreciates the important and positive role played by China as a permanent member of the Security Council in African affairs, which has contributed significantly to the just and rational resolution of African problems and has made great efforts and contributions to the preservation of African interests and the promotion of peace and security in Africa.
At a time when Africa is facing the threat of terrorism and extremism, Africa can truly achieve long-term peace and development only if security issues are addressed.
We look forward to further coordination of positions with China in the Security Council and strengthening solidarity and cooperation.
Wang Yi said that there was an important consensus at today's meeting.
We all support multilateralism, strengthen the authority and role of the United Nations, uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and reject unilateralism and bullying; we all agree to strengthen mutual supportive cooperation between Central Africa in the affairs of the United Nations and the Security Council and to safeguard the common interests of Central Africa and the developing countries in general; we all support African countries in their African approach to African issues and call on the United Nations to provide financial support for African-owned peace operations; we all support the concept of “cooperation for development, development for peace” to help African countries achieve autonomous and sustainable development; and we stand firm in our defence of the legitimate rights of developing countries and in our opposition to any country that creates obstacles to developing countries and denies them the right to development.
Gansu Qingyang: The lake goats come to "get out of poverty."
In the autumn of September, the yellow-earth plateau was rekindled.
The 58-year-old villager, Shavili, at the Lew Farming Professional Co-operative in the town of Tama, fills the herb in the sheep's canopy with the last straw and sits by it, watching the white lake sheep chew.
"Eat well, and when the autumn winter is full, the price will be good." It's not like it's a bad idea.
Shavili said he fed “specially prepared meals” to sheep every day, regularly cleaning, disinfecting, and taking care of things.
Chavili raised sheep for more than 20 years and it was not until he came to work in the cooperative that he knew how thick the sheep had been in the past.
Shavili is a member of the village of Shai pool, Qingyang city, Gansu province.
His right-hand neighbour was a sheep farmer, but he insisted on the traditional way of spreading, with a poor quality of sheep and a small number of bars.
In June this year, the Government led 140 poor people in the village to join the cooperative and everything began to change.
Shavili spent all his days working on farming because he was holding on to something.
All those who entered the stock were poor households, who had taken sheep to the cooperative and were counting on him for a bonus and a price at the end of the year.
Fortunately, with the guidance of technicians, he slowly learned how to prevent disease, mastered scientific feeding, and became the “good play” of a small number of farming in the village.
The Professional Cooperative for Benevolent Farming is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1,400 lake sheep.
The head of the cooperative, Zoutao, said that there were doors inside and outside the standard sheep shed.
“The wool is thick, and it tends to breed bacteria, and the lake sheep cannot stay in the hot and humid areas, and the sheep sheds must be built in the three-faced ditches, and they must be equipped with wind-resorters to ventilate and heat. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Zoutao stated that, in order to prevent the disease, regular spraying of the sheep shed was also required, with three to four vaccination needles administered to the sheep for a quarter.
In addition to living well, the “weasel” has to eat grass that is mixed with corn, wheat straw, sorghum, etc., and is sufficiently broad to stretch its bones.
Cooperatives have adopted a foster care approach that leads local farmers to place their good seeded lake sheep here, to harmonize breeding, management and marketing, and to achieve good seeding, scientificization, standardization and intensive farming.
Today, 140 poor households with a share of sheep are divided into more than $6,000 per household per year, and four of the poor people working in cooperatives work on the build-up cards.
From "Mountain Range" to "precision feed", from "local mating" to "artificial insemination", from "look in the shape, feel in the belly" to "do "B" next to... In Gansu-yang, sheep farming is not just a shift in feeding patterns, but rather a change in the model of the “leading company + cooperative + farmer” that used to be “a goat on the slopes, a goat on the market”, overcoming the weakness of traditional farming and livestock, and the poor lives of farmers have been made better by modernity.
Zoutao stated that if market prices were weak, the local leading firm, Gansu-sun-sung-sung Agricultural Development Co. Ltd., would buy it at a price of $27 per kilogram to protect the market and help farmers spread market risk.
Xu Jianfeng, General Adviser of Gansu China Agricultural and Livestock Development Ltd., said that enterprises were promoting “herds” by providing credit guarantees for poor households, sheep farming, order farming, bid acquisition, integrated processing and marketing.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have managed to achieve a steady increase in harvests through “union” forage farming, breeding, scale farming, slaughtering and marketing.
The city of Qingyang is located in the north on a staggered farm and is rich in fodder.
There are currently 913 meat-scale farms, cooperatives, and over 5 million meat-meads, as well as two processing production lines of 1.3 million meat-scaved sheep, which are becoming the “head sheep” of pro-poor industry.
The French finance minister said that he would cut taxes by over 10 billion euros next year and called on Germany to follow up.
The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said on Thursday that France will cut taxes by more than Euro10 billion ($10.9 billion) next year, and that Germany should keep up with France’s fiscal stimulus to revive its depressed economy.
In presenting France ' s 2020 budget, Lemel stated that the European Central Bank ' s latest monetary easing initiative had created an opportunity for Governments of member States that could afford to increase investment.
The ECB’s interest rate fell to record lows on 12 September, and plans to repurchase the debt in order to reduce borrowing costs in the hope of stimulating economic recovery and boosting inflation.
“low interest rates will not allow Europe to prosper again, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not sufficient.” Lemel said to journalists.
“Germany needs to invest, now, as soon as possible. Don't wait until the situation gets worse," he adds.
He has made this appeal to Germany on many occasions.
France has implemented tax cuts of over Euro10 billion this year, which have boosted its economic growth.
The global economy has lost its dynamism, and the export-dependent German economy has borne the brunt.
Lemel noted that next year the tax burden on French families will be reduced by Euro9.3 billion, including an income tax relief of Euro5 billion.
In addition, with the gradual reduction of the corporate tax rate from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent over a five-year period, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost 1 billion euros.
In recent days, the General Secretary of Xi has issued important instructions for the protection of the Martyrs Memorial Facility, emphasizing the need to strengthen the planning, construction, renovation and management maintenance of the Martyrs' Homes.
In order to follow up on the important instructions of Secretary-General Xi and to invest in the management of the Martyrs ' Memorial Facility, the Central Office of the Chinese Communist Party, the Office of the State Council, and the Office of the Central Military Commission issued the General Work Programme for the Management and Maintenance of the Martyrs ' Memorial Facility Plan.
The Programme of Work is a programmatic document for the management of the protection of martyrs ' memorial facilities. It defines the objectives of the management of the protection of martyrs ' memorial facilities. It proposes to plan for the construction of the Martyrs ' Memorial Facility and the improvement of the system of spiritual red-red educational bases for the promotion of the memory of martyrs; to repair the preservation of the Martyrs ' Memorial Facility and to create a strong social atmosphere that honours and honours the merit; and to manage the maintenance of the Martyrs ' Memorial Facility to form a well-regulated system of organizational safeguards and management.
The Programme of Work clearly states that the renovation and protection of the Martyrs Memorial Facility should be strengthened, in accordance with the principles of integration and a long-term perspective, with a view to improving the repair and protection of the Martyrs ' Memorial Facility, focusing on the development of institutional mechanisms for leadership and improving the policy and regulatory system; organizing the renovation of the facilities, improving the facilities and strengthening the capacity of the service; and optimizing the presentation and innovative presentation methods to improve overall effectiveness.
The Programme of Work emphasizes the need to improve institutional and organizational security, strengthen organizational leadership, establish working mechanisms led by the Ministry of Veterans Affairs, with the active cooperation of the relevant units and with the broad participation of the community; continue to promote the institutionalization, regularization and professionalization of the management of the construction and management of the Martyrs ' Memorial Facility, focusing on the implementation of the law on the protection of heroic martyrs; strengthen team-building and the introduction of volunteer services and encourage the active participation of veterans, martyrs ' families, expert scholars and young students in the teaching and maintenance of order at the Martyrs ' Memorial Facility; and improve the mechanisms for social participation, consistent with the leadership and diversity of the Government, and actively advocate for the encouragement of corporate, social organizations and individuals to contribute to and support the renovation of the Martyrs ' Memorial Facility.
Study: The national healthy diet index in the United States has grown slightly, but it is still challenging - the new medium net.
On September 27, China Newsnet reported that in recent days, a recent study in the United States has shown that the United States government has seen a modest increase in its healthy diet index from 56 to 58.
But when the score is 100, it is not a celebration.
American nationals continue to face “significant challenges” in their diet.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Fongfan, a nutrition researcher at Tafts University, Massachusetts, stated that Americans continue to consume too much food that could cause diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and obesity, which are the most common diseases of American nationals.
The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on 24th.
The study was based on the findings of a health survey of 44,000 adults conducted by the United States Government between 1999 and 2016.
The authors wrote that “Despite considerable improvement, significant dietary challenges remain”.
These challenges are known to include reducing United States nationals ' consumption of food containing saturated fats, such as snacks, hot dogs, fat cattle and butter.
The study found that the intake of these unhealthy fats in people ' s daily diet increased from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent, exceeding the recommended 10 per cent intake limit.
The biggest improvement in American diets is that the sugar intake dropped from 16% to about 14%, but the intake is still too high.
Officially, sugar-added intake should be less than 10% in the daily diet.
With regard to the reasons for the decline in sugar intake, researchers consider it to be related to the decrease in the consumption of sweet soda, but Zhang Fang emphasizes that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yoghurt and ketchup.
There has been a slight increase in adult consumption of fruits, nuts, oats and other whole- grain categories in the United States.
However, data for 2016 indicate that these foods still account for less than 5 per cent of daily diets.
Despite a slight decrease in salt intake and a reduction in drinking juice leading to low-quality carbohydrates intake, Zhang Fang indicates that they still account for as much as 42 per cent of the daily calorie, many of which come from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on biennial personal health surveys that remind adults of the food they have eaten in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have asked the question twice every few days since 2003.
The government’s Food Guide for American Residents recommends “a healthy diet” to reduce the risk of chronic disease.
The guide points out that people should consume more nutritious foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, skinny meat, poultry meat, eggs, seed foods that can provide protein.
During the study period, the number of people suffering from diabetes almost doubled, to over 7%, and obesity increased over many years – today about 70% of all Americans are overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among United States nationals.
EU promotes strategic partnerships with Asia
The Forum was attended by members of the Central Political Bureau of the Viet Nam, the Secretary of the Central Registry and the Secretary of the Central Economy, Nguyen Pilgrim.
In line with the close cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the theme of the Forum was “The EU-Asia interface: building bridges for a sustainable development future”.
The forum took place one year after the implementation of the docking strategy on two European Union continents.
The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Junk, stated that strengthening the interface was part of the idea, as it benefited the peoples and economies concerned.
These relations have helped to bring stability and prosperity to the parties concerned.
At the same time, he believed that the European Union wished to send a message about increasing participation and consolidating a mutually beneficial interface between Europe and Asia.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan is a special guest of the Forum and will make an important presentation in the plenary.
The country's first joint-stock management subsidiary was set up to fund its operations with technology.
On 26 December, the first joint-stock bank management subsidiary was formally established in Qingdao.
The expert indicated that asset management was an important area in the development of financial science and technology, and that the Bank ' s establishment of a financial subsidiary facilitated its use of scientific and technological means to upgrade its operations.
In April this year, the Bank of Guang Dynasty and the Bank of Marketing issued separate bulletins stating that the China Bank of Banking Supervision had approved the preparation of a financial subsidiary.
On 24 September, the Grand Bank of Guangcai announced that it had been officially authorized to open the business.
Just two days later, the Bank led a number of equity banks and took the lead in setting up a capital bank in Aoshima.
Mr. Lee Xiao Peng, Chairman of the Gwang Gwak Group, said that Gwang Gwak would accelerate the pace of innovation by using modern scientific thinking and tools, relying on big data, networking, cloud computing, increasing the coverage, use and penetration of financial capital, and increasing client access, happiness and security.
By 2021, the creation of the “Four Pillars” for the development of our financial science and technology will further enhance the capacity of the financial sector to apply it, achieve a deeper integration and coordinated development of finance and technology, and significantly increase the population's satisfaction with digital, networked and intelligent financial products and services.
Mr. Zhang Xuyang, President of Gwang Dynasty, explained that the management platform for Gwang Dynasty would use technology such as smart investment, smart investment, big data, etc. to help Gwang Dynasty better judge the macroeconomic situation.
New technologies such as block chains will also be applied in the future to capture the direction and trends from traditional to alternative assets to digital alternative assets.
According to Dong Xio, a researcher hired by the National Laboratory of Finance and Development, in the face of an entirely new competition in the regulatory sector, financial science and technology companies and regulatory agencies will work together to explore new growth paths with management science and technology.
The Enabling Sector of Financial Science and Technology is both a need for its own transformational development and a source of new life and dynamism for its business development.
At the beginning of this year, Kyoto Digital Science and Technology launched a new management and technology system to upgrade the research and development and wind control capacity of managed products through technology and digitization.
The new system starts with four capabilities: product design, sales transactions, asset management, and risk assessment, to upgrade the overall intelligent operation of the management industry.
It was argued that, while improving client service capacity and generating innovative and rich products, IT could also enhance risk prevention and improve management efficiency.
Zhang Xuyang indicated that while previous risk preferences to locate clients through questionnaires were prone to deviations, the use of artificial intelligence for user graphics now helped to better locate clients, and the introduction of products based on their investment preferences helped to mitigate risks.
“Another kind of big data, such as electricians, time and space data, can help us better map a region, an industry’s activity, and the atmosphere. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Zhang Xuyang said that while mitigating risks, big data technology would also help to improve wind control.
China Railway Tunnel's deepest record was refreshed.
After more than 1,200 days of day and night construction on September 27, China's Social Security Hill (Zhang Wei Ming, the country) completed the excavation of the rig No. 1 Tunnel No. 1 for the construction of the Da (Riyadh) railway, reaching a depth of 76.59 metres below ground level, breaking the deepest record of the China Railway Tunnel, which was created in a flood.
The 34.5-km-long Grand Ribbon Hill tunnel, located in Yunnan, is the longest one in Asia with a single-line tunnel across the high Logon Hills in the West Bank.
The tunnel runs through 19 fracture strips and is buried at a maximum depth of 1155 metres, as it covers the undesirable geological and significant risks that may be encountered in almost all of the tunnel constructions, known as the “geological museum” of the tunnel construction at Mount Korgon.
The wells, which are the most important auxiliary tunnel for the Tunnels of Mount Gao Ligon, have the important task of increasing the operational surface to achieve “long and short blows” and to operate ventilation at the later stages of railway operations.
The successful excavation of the 1st well to the bottom of the well marked the official entry of the Tunnel at Mount Gao Ligon into the horizontal tunnel, where four additional operational surfaces could be added to the well, pending the opening and replacement of the underground garage, to speed up the tunnel ' s opening.
“All the wells are in the granite layer, which is essentially as deep as the water pressure is due to the fact that the granite layer has more cracks and can't stop the water. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The chief engineer of the Dae Riang Railway Project of the China-China Tunnel Bureau told journalists that during the construction of the rig, there had been a number of mudslides and collapses, and that experts had been invited by the construction party to look at the veins on site and to discuss the programme more than 20 times.
“When the water surges in the wells are greatest, they reach more than 300 cubic metres per hour and the bottom of the well is 700 metres deep, with a water pressure equivalent to 700 metres deep. It's not like it's a bad idea.
"If you don't pump the drain in time, you'll flood the well 10 meters in an hour, and we'll spend almost 85% of our time on water and 15% on digging." It's not like it's a bad idea.
In order to overcome the geological difficulties of vertically managed development, mud surges and water-rich granite, tunnel construction uses a combination of “detection, insulation, excavation” and water treatment measures to reduce construction risks.
As a result of several improvements, the construction of the rig 1 resulted in mechanized water lines, such as an excavation system, a sling system, a winch lifting system, and full process mechanization operations, such as eye openings, blasts, scavengers, templates installation and concrete-stamping, which accelerated the construction process.
Eventually, after more than 1,200 days and nights of construction, the wells successfully completed the excavation at a depth of 76.59 metres.
The Grand Shwe Railway, which has a total length of 330 kilometres, is an important component of the international link between China and Myanmar and an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the “one-way road”.
With the construction of the driveway, Daikichi's travel time to Riley will be reduced by six hours on the current road to two hours, which will significantly improve transport patterns in the Pheixie region and will facilitate trade and trade cooperation and friendly human relations between China and South-East Asian countries.
Lin Zheng Yuta: As a Chinese, I am proud of the nation's achievements
The Hong Kong press celebrates the 70th anniversary.
“The Hong Kong press celebrates the seventieth anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China” 27, held in Hong Kong.
In his address to the meeting, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Lin Zhengyu, stated that the achievements of the country over the past 70 years are well known and that we are proud of our Chinese.
Lin Moon-tae, Deputy Director of the Central Government Liaison Office in Hong Kong, Lu Xin Ning, Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Special Representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, Song Yoon-Ann, Deputy Political Commissioner of the Liberation Army in Hong Kong, Chen Aden, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Hong Kong Press Committee for the celebration of the National Day, and was the main guest.
In his message, Lin said that, despite the difficult challenges faced by China over the past 70 years, China has managed to overcome its achievements and that we are proud as Chinese.
Hong Kong has been close to the Mainland since its return, making progress and sharing fruitful results.
It is believed that, in the context of the “one country, two systems”, Hong Kong can continue to take advantage of the “one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, and another, one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, and another, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, and another, one country, one country.
She also stated that Hong Kong society had suffered from social strife over the past few months and that every Hong Kong citizen had been affected and journalists faced different challenges.
At this critical juncture, it is hoped that the friends of the press will continue to face up to the challenge, in a professional manner, to provide fair and balanced news coverage for society and to contribute to a dialogue for the future of Hong Kong and to a return to rational communication.
Kang Jian-hwan stated that the bright journey to the new China was also a journey to Hong Kong with its motherland, to progress, to blood, to honour and to life.
In particular, since the return of Hong Kong to Hong Kong, the central Government has been steadfast in its “one country, two systems”, “the Hong Kong people to govern their ports”, and its policy of high self-government, which has helped Hong Kong and the Mainland to keep watch and watch together, creating the miracle of a mutually beneficial win-win economy.
To that end, the Hong Kong press was gathered to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China.
He states that the past three months have been marked by a series of blatant violations of the law and wanton acts of violence against the stability of society, fuelled by distorted and false media reports.
He called on the media to promote a climate conducive to popular resistance to violence and the maintenance of the rule of law.
Professional media professionals are required to adhere to the rules governing the journalism profession, to direct citizens to their own self-consciousness and violence, and to uphold the integrity and integrity of the law, through genuine reporting and responsible speech.
Some 500 people from all walks of life, including the press, attended the event and joined the guest of honour in presenting their greetings to the People ' s Republic of China on its seventieth anniversary.
The journalists were informed by the Communications Department of the Sinning City Council that the City of Sining will implement the Sining City Civilization Promotion Ordinance on 1 October, which will focus on 15 uncivilized practices, such as the failure of pedestrians to follow traffic lights and the throwing of objects out of buildings, as well as on priority management lists and penalties.
The Deputy Minister of Publicity of the Sining City Council and Director of the City Civilization Department, Wang Sainbin, introduced the city of Sining as the city of the nation ' s civilisation city in 2017, which has seen a marked increase in civility and morality.
However, uncivilized behaviour such as pedestrians crossing roads, breaking red lights, non-motorized vehicles not following traffic lights, high-altitude and window-pasts, smoking in public places, walking dogs in public places and allowing them to defecate remains prominent and is easily repulsed and needs to be addressed as soon as possible.
The regulation, in combination with the practical aspects of Siining, imposes more comprehensive and higher standards of civilized behaviour on individuals and units in terms of public places, public order, public facilities, public environmental sanitation, travel of civilizations, civilized tourism, the Internet, the building of civilized campuses, the promotion of civilized family building, the performance of official duties, the remembrance of heroic martyrs, medical services, etc., and makes society understand what “advocacy” and what “prohibited” “is possible”.
“Promulgation of regulations to eliminate blind spots and areas of error in the area of awareness of civilized behaviour, and comprehensive regulation of citizens' behaviour, housekeeping, food, travel, education, tourism, Internet access, green life, funerals, etc., will provide strong guarantees of the rule of law for the normalization of the work of popular spiritual civilization in Sining City. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the Sining City People ' s Congress said that he was invincible.

British tourists' car keys fell into the lake and their families were trapped in France for five days.
In recent days, a couple in Wales, England, took two children to France on vacation and accidentally dropped the car keys into the lake, and the family was forced to wait five days to get the new keys made by the car manufacturer.
The couple then left France with the children.
It was reported that on 16 September, local time, when the British family was visiting the upper part of a lake in France, her daughter accidentally turned over a purse and the keys to the car fell into the lake.
But it took them hours to find the key.
And all their belongings and cash are locked in the car.
Although British tourists had purchased insurance prior to departure, the insurance company refused to help on the grounds that the vehicles were not at risk of theft.
They had to hire a trailer to take the car to a garage and store it, and then reordered the keys from the car manufacturer.
A few days later, British tourists finally got the key to the formulation and the couple left France with their children.
They were forced to cancel their scheduled journey because of the loss of car keys.
Saudi Arabia has officially liberalized tourist visas to 49 countries, including China.
(Dubai 27) As of that date, Saudi Arabia officially liberalized its tourist visas to 49 countries, including China, for a total of SAR 440 (approximately RMB 836).

Of these, e-signatures are multiple entries of a year, allowing tourists to stay for up to 90 days.
For ordinary tourists, Saudi Arabia is the most mysterious country, as it never issues tourist visas.
In recent years, Saudi Arabia, under the leadership of Deputy Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, has advanced Vision 2030, aimed at reducing the country's economy's long-term dependence on oil, with open tourism and tourism development as an important component.
The Deputy Prime Minister of Belarus, Igor Liashenko, undertook a working visit to the province of Hingan, Viet Nam.
During the meeting, the Secretary-General of the province of Xin An highlighted the remarkable achievements of Belarus in industrial production and the investment of Belarusian enterprises in Xin An province.
The completion of the production of the MAZ ASIA automobile production and installation plant is an important step in the development of enterprise cooperation between the two countries, which has helped to promote cooperation between the province of Xingan and Viet Nam and Belarus.
The Secretary-General of the province of Hing An indicated that the province of Hing An has been facilitating the investment of Belarusian enterprises in the province, and it is hoped that in the future more vigorous measures will be taken to encourage Belarusian enterprises to invest in the province of Hing An and Viet Nam and to assist in the training of workers in the province and the transfer of industrial production technologies.

Following the meeting, a group of Deputy Prime Minister Igor Liashenko attended the completion of the MAZ ASIA auto production and installation plant.
Pilot notification of commitments in areas such as licensing of the production of low-risk varieties of food products, devolution of foreign business representation to the FTA
On 27 January, the Shanghai City Market Supervisory Authority signed a memorandum of work with the Government of Putu Nin District to introduce 20 market regulatory reform measures, some of which were pioneered throughout the country.
It was explained that notification of a promise means that an administrative authority, when registering a permit, informs the applicant, in writing, of the conditions and requirements set out in the laws and regulations.
Once the applicant has signed the commitment, the administrative authority may proceed directly with it.
According to the memorandum, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority will support the registration of business names in the Pudong District and the Shanghai Free Trade Pilot Zone, the licensing of the production of simple and low-risk varieties of food products, and the pilot notification of commitments in three areas, such as partial approval of measuring appliances, to make access easier.
Shanghai Food Company Ltd. 27 became the first enterprise to benefit from the pilot bonus by notifying its commitment to obtain a Food Production Licence on the spot.
According to the head of the enterprise, food permits can also be presented on the spot, and the “dismissal” approach, which allows the enterprise to submit part of the material within the time limit agreed upon in the notification of the promise, “the ease of reform is felt. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority indicated that the implementation of a notice of commitment to food production permits was a national pilot.
As a result of the reform, the processing process was reduced from the previous six stages of “registration, processing, on-site verification, sample testing, examination of materials, certification of approvals” to three links of “registration, acceptance, certification of approvals” and from 20 working days before the reform to closure on the spot.
In view of the high external orientation of the Podong economy, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority has delegated the registration of foreign (regional) enterprise permanent missions to the Shanghai Free Trade Zone to facilitate close proximity.
Statistics show that the decentralization involved a total of 1592 permanent representative institutions in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, 99 of which were already regulated by the new regulations.
"xi" small-scale consumption surveys: the choice is more diverse and tourism is first.
The National Day is approaching, and people's vacation plans are being finalized.
The recent launch of a mini-survey by the daily Securities Journal journalists on the “XI” holiday arrangements in their friends' circles revealed that while there are different plans, “Tourism + Consumption” became the key word for the “XI” holiday.
In particular, in the feedback received by the daily Securities Journal journalists, over half of the people chose to travel.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said that “the family was scheduled to travel to Shanghai during the ‘11’ period, and Disney was the first stop before going to the surrounding cities”; Ms. Li in Beijing chose to travel to Taiwan, “The family left for Taiwan on 28 September, planning a trip around the island for 10 days”; Ms. Chaoqing planned to travel abroad to Singapore; and Mr. Zhang in Hebei chose to travel on his own, saying that “the daughter is less than two years old, it is not convenient to leave the country and plans to travel to Shandong for a few days.”
A report on trends in the travel and travel of residents of the 2019 National Day Gold Week, published jointly with the traveler, shows a clear upward trend in consumption in the three subdivisions of travel, residence and cruises this year.
The penetration rate of aircraft, high iron movements has been steadily increasing, as has the proportion of Star-class hotels, individualized de-standard accommodation needs.
The 2019 National Day of Tourism Consumption Trends Report, released by the United States Corps on 23 September, showed that tourism consumption continued to flourish and showed an increase in diversity of “food and play”.
More young people travel in favour of high-quality and distinctive experiences, and the heat levels of cultural tourism and night tourism continue to rise.
In addition to tourism, various types of consumption demand were released centrally during the Eleventh.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the Journalist, “The main plan this year is to buy a car. It's not like it's a bad idea.
According to a Beijing-based car brand 4S shop staff to the daily Securities Journal reporter, the months of September and October of each year are generally described as periods of gold for car sales.
A number of events will be launched during the eleventh period, such as the drawing of prizes and the reduction of access to the store.
In addition, new models have recently been introduced in a number of brands, and the boost to sales is expected to be more visible.
The upward trend in consumption has been accompanied by a greater emphasis on spiritual demand satisfaction and a growing share of consumption of services such as culture and education.
According to Ms. Dou, who lives in Beijing, “since the birth of the child, cultural and educational consumption has become the bulk of household consumption expenditure.
This year’s 11th is full of hours, going to the Astronomical Days, Children’s Theatres, a few family weekends to camp in tents at the Moose Museum, and some trial lessons. It's not like it's a bad idea.
According to industry sources, the theoretical path to consumer upgrading is the evolution of subsistence to developmental and enjoyable consumption, with a significant portion of the consumption of enjoyable consumption being in the service category.
Tourism and mobility are a good way to go, as our economic and social development and the rising income levels of the population are becoming more focused on the spiritual demand for consumption.
In particular, keeping up with the “XI” national holiday, with more time and a greater willingness to travel and consume, both meets the demand for consumption at the spiritual level and reflects an escalation of consumption among the population.
Loneliness began in the afternoon and the children were not ready to leave the house.
Cheer up and say to Nana, the dog: Mama takes you out.
It's hard to write a few things about going out, and the character of type A blood is getting tougher.
Get a suit, buy nutrients, pay, buy fish chips, a snack for Nana.
That's why I left.
On the phone, she just fell in love with her sister, thanks to Nana, or she wouldn't even have an excuse to buy a snack.
He smiled a few times and said the kid called and hung up.
Nana jumped on the bench, lying on the ground, knowing that she was carsick, frightened and reluctant.
My husband Boo came home early.
The salad, which was so delicious as to make salmon with butter, went to the bedroom to watch TV.
Take a look at the wall, just at 7:00, and the sun sets early in the rising country, and it's already dark.
It's been invented in the circle of friends. It's mid-Autumn today.
I washed a bunch of grapes sent by friends, left them half for Boo, and the rest was in the little flower bowl that I liked, and I brought out to see the moon.
And Nana sat on the ground, and I ate her grapes and ate her skin, and We threw forth the seeds of the grapes.
And the moon hides in the clouds, so that it walks, and then it appears suddenly, and some of its brightness appears.
All the poems about the moon are raging in their minds, and only the words are clear: every three-and-a-half centenary/full of light-guarded jade bars/the last round of the sky, the names of all human beings look up.
Maybe we've given the moon too much emotion. I'll tell you now, in fact, the word of God belongs to God and Caesar's to Caesar is the best.
The moon is the moon, the mood is yours.
After the grapes, this is a cold moon.
The group had a slight snoring on the side of its feet and stood up and laid its little blanket over her little house, where Nana was resting happily.
Open the door and shout, "Is the bath water ready?"
The windows in the bathroom are not able to see the moon, but only the moonlight is felt, the light in the bathroom is turned off and the glass is lifted.
No mooncake, no drink.
The Dubai Expo in 2020 released mascots.
The 2020 Dubai Expo mascot launch ceremony was held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
The mascot consists of six cartoon images, including two UAE children, three flying robots and a UAE tree with beans.
The launch presented the viewer with information on six mascots through video clips.
9-year-old Rashid and 8-year-old Latifa are brothers and sisters representing the people of the Emirates.
Three robots correspond to the three sub-themes of the Expo, blue robots represent “mobility”, green robots represent “sustainability”, yellow robots represent “opportunities”.
An old bean tree, named "Salamar", is the "old grandmother" of five "little children" and symbolizes the ancestors who protected the land.
Ahmed, Chairman of the Dubai World Expo High Council, said that mascots can strengthen emotional ties between large-scale events and participants, “believing that the mascot of Dubai World Expo will convey the traditional spirit of storytelling, show the creativity of indigenous talent, and express our ambitions and expectations.”
The launch was attended by the Vice-President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed Dubai, Crown Prince Hamdan of Dubai, the Minister of State for International Cooperation of the United Arab Emirates, and the Director of the Dubai World Bureau, Lim Hashimi.
The Dubai Expo will be held in Dubai from 20 October 2020 to 10 April 2021 under the theme “Communication of ideas for the future”.
This will be the first time that the Expo will be held in the Middle East.
Starting next year, Chinese students can apply for German undergraduate studies with their high grades.
In recent days, the Anabin database of Germany, which is responsible for certifying foreign academic qualifications, has been announced on the official web: starting in 2020, Chinese high school graduates can apply directly for undergraduate studies at German universities on the basis of their high-level qualifications, without having to enrol in domestic universities.
Prior to this, Chinese high school graduates applying for a university in Germany had to study undergraduate studies in the country for one semester (211,985) or three semesters (general undergraduate studies), and had passed the APS review or the TeestAS examination.
The issuance of the new regulations may save at least six months for Chinese students who wish to study in Germany.
It was informed that the new regulations would enter into force in the second half of 2019.
Applicants are required to complete 12 years of regular compulsory education and obtain a high school diploma, to take the examination, to pass the examination, and to achieve 70 per cent and above of the total score (more than 525 if the score is 750), and to include the requirements of two languages and one mathematics or natural sciences.
In addition, specific professional requirements for the achievement of advanced examinations vary.
For example, applying for specializations such as medicine, oral medicine, veterinary medicine, pharmacology, etc., requires 80% of the full score for advanced examinations and must include at least two in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, or participation in general; applying for legal studies requires 80% of the full score for advanced examinations, and advanced examinations must include foreign languages, history, at least two in geography, or participation in general.
According to incomplete statistics, China ' s high-level examination has been endorsed by a number of countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.
In the case of the United Kingdom, universities such as Cambridge University, Birmingham University and Lester University have accepted applications from Chinese students for higher education.
The military "mechanical dog" starts with a performance class The Sun Circus: Consider inclusion in the performance formation.
The US military has funded the development of a "mechanical dog" for use in the field, and may be on the circus stage now!
The Cirque Soleil has recently indicated that it is approaching Boston Dynamics, which is developing robots, to discuss the feasibility of robotic applications to circus performances.
Comprehensive media reports that Boston Dynamics Technology released a “Four-foot robot Spot” propaganda film on 24 April, which shows Spot as a fast mobile robot weighing 14 kg, highly adapted to the terrain, 360 degrees of shielding, navigation, remote control and autonomy.
In particular, Spot has a proprietary software platform specifically designed for Spot only, and users can customize Spot robotics through various applications.
The idea of a robot dog was first published by Boston Power Technology in 1992, when it caused a sensation, but it has not yet been put into real commercial use.
However, Boston Dynamics has indicated that Spot is now in the production phase, with buyers mainly in construction and energy industries.
In addition, the Cirque Soleil is currently in contact with Boston Power Technology, which says that the plan is still in its conceptual stage and is assessing the potential of Spot to be used at the performance site.

Did Maverick go to a by-election at the Danwuby-Ai Conference in Johor?
"The Supreme Council of the Front!" It's not like it's a bad idea.
On the eve of the by-election for the First Nation, it is a matter of concern whether the PFDJ member Marwa is in the traditional seat.
However, following a meeting of the Central Committee, it was announced that the Supreme Council of the PFDJ would decide whether to continue to place the Mawa traditional seat in the ranks of the other members of the party.
On Thursday afternoon, after presiding over the meetings of the Central Committee of the Mahwa, we indicated to the media that any by-election would be conducted by the PFDJ in accordance with the standard operating procedure (SOP), which would require a meeting of the PFDJ Supreme Council before a decision could be made.
He said that the PFDJ Supreme Council meeting was expected to take place in early October, as the Electoral Commission would not meet until Monday (1 day) to finalize the by-elections for the Danvu-Ai.
Yesterday morning, I also met with the PFDJ President, Dato ' Sri ' Ammozahi, and we all agreed on the need to regain this seat from the League of Hope. It's not like it's a bad idea.
“We have finalized a meeting of the leaders of the PFDJ in early October, in which the leaders of the PFDJ three parties will determine which party will join. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Asked whether the Marwa would insist on standing in the traditional seat of the PFDJ Supreme Council, Wei Jiaqi reiterated that as President of the PFDJ, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures and that any decision must therefore be agreed by the PFDJ.
“It is common practice in any by-elections that there are those who are willing to go out, that there are political parties and that there is a certain perception that they should come out. It's not like it's a bad idea.
“What organizations and political alliances do we come from?”
“This is a great test of our political alliance over the years, and we believe that the PFDJ has come along with some valuable values. It's not like it's a bad idea.
“Someone may say something in the process, and that's strange.”
“However, once the PFDJ Supreme Council has taken a decision, everyone must be ready for war, which is most valuable. It's not like it's a bad idea.
In any event, Jiaxian Wei indicated that Marwa would be fully engaged at three levels, namely, district councils, state boards and the centre, in preparing for the forthcoming by-elections for the Danyuby-Ai.
“The regional council will be headed by the Chairman of the District Council (Danboubyi); the State Board will be headed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Zouzhou, Daolin Peking; and the Central Council will be deployed personally by the Director General, Da Maham Sun, and the Secretary-General, Da Zhang. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Last Saturday (21st), the indigenous unity party Danwuby-Ai Member of Congress Dauphin Mohamad Falli died of heart problems at the stupid Jane government hospital and was 42 years old.
A villager hunting wild animals in Paukang County in Hubei was ordered to "compulsory mountain patrol."
A villager in Hubei Bokang County was sentenced for hunting wild animals and was ordered to pay compensation of $15,420 for the cost of repairing the environmental damage to ecological resources (RMB, same as).
Due to the poverty of the accused ' s family, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office used alternative labour to compensate for the cost of ecological restoration, thus achieving an organic harmonization of legal and social effects.
On the 27th day, Wang Zhonglang, Deputy Prosecutor-General of the Poucon District Public Prosecutor's Office, described the fact that, through alternative labour such as 3 months of “compulsory mountain patrols”, the accused had established deep feelings with the wild monkeys and was deeply responsible for the previous animal hunting.
On 21 June this year, a criminal incidental civil service action in the area of ecological resources was filed by the District Prosecutor ' s Office of Paukang, which was heard in public court and sentenced in court.
The accused was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment and four years ' probation and a fine of $3,000, and was ordered to pay $15420 for environmental damage to ecological resources.
It was found that Zhou had installed an electrical grid at the cliffs in late January 2014, hunting more than 20 wild animals, including euphemisms, twigs and furs.
Antelopes belong to the endangered wild animals of the second national level, and small euphemisms and furs are listed in the National List of Land-based Wildlife Protection.
During the trial, Zhou confessed to his unlawful facts and conduct and was willing to assume incidental civil liability.
However, in view of the poor financial situation of one family member in the week, the local village council, the forest station and the three parties in the week, in coordination with the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the county of Paukang, have reached an agreement on alternative labour to compensate for the cost of ecological restoration: i.e., the provision of public goods to cover the cost of ecological rehabilitation through a one-year training and maintenance of monkeys in the village ' s monkey reserve.
In response to the Prosecutor's recommendation, the Court accepted that the obligation of “alternative labour to compensate for ecological rehabilitation” should be actively fulfilled, while at the same time granting a suspended sentence.
At present, Zhou Zhou Zhou has worked for three months in the Monkey Reserve and is active and performing well.
In recent years, the Prosecutor ' s Office of the county of Paoucon has in practice integrated the functions of prosecution and social governance. Scientificly, by means of oversight, such as prosecutorial recommendations, investigative supervision and procedural supervision, the ecological damage caused by criminal acts has been minimized by judicial means.
United Nations Earthguard Award for Ant Forest
In a lively round of applause and resounding music, the leader of the Ant Forest project, Seo Tsi and the user's representative, Shen Zheng Zhi, came to the podium and took the United Nations “Geoguard Award” for 2019 from the moderator.
The “Ant Forest” project, which brought hundreds of millions of people involved in environmental action with a small mobile phone program, was awarded the “Incentive and Action Award” at the 26th Earthguard Award in 2019, New York, United States.
A week earlier, the United Nations Environment Programme had announced its award list at its headquarters in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, but those who had participated in the ceremony on that day remained implacable.
The Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Ingénie Annault, in an interview with Xinhua journalist, said that “Ant Forest” is an exciting innovation that allows hundreds of millions of people to act to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans can do about the environment.
It connects people and the environment with technology, allowing every individual to participate in efforts to protect the planet, which will have a tremendous impact.
The Ant Forest was launched in August 2016 by the China Ant Financial Services Group (known as the ants gold suit) at the Pay Treasure Platform, where users accumulate “green energy” through low-carbon actions such as recording their daily green trips in the Ant Forest and paying water and electricity online, and “planting trees” in their mobile phones.
For every virtual tree that a user grows, ant forest and a public good partner grow a real tree in a desertification area.
As of August this year, 500 million users of the Ant Forest had accumulated carbon reductions of 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in desertification areas.
In the “Earthguard Award,” which Costa Rica won for its national environmental efforts, Costa Rica’s president, Carlos Alvarado, praised the contribution of the “Ant Forest” on the spot, “enlightening the participation of so many people in green action.”
The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the ants gold suit, Kendo Well, stated that the Earthguard Award was a recognition of the Ant Forest project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for people to participate in low-carbon lives, an honour that belongs to all participants.
According to Hyeon Choon, the “Ant forest” has affected 500 million people over the past three years and the goal of the “Ant forest” for the next three years is to engage 1 billion people globally in low-carbon action.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to increase the income of farmers from green and green water.
In addition to providing employment through tree planting, farmers are expected to be helped to grow through agricultural development projects, electric power platforms, etc.
The public good environmental model based on digital technology, created by the Ant Forest, has also been successful in reaching the sea and has been used by other countries.
In June, the country's largest “electronic wallet” GCash launched the Philippine version of “Ant Forest” to encourage Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon livelihoods.
It was stated that GCash, in partnership with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines, the Environmental Public Interest, etc., planned to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within the first year of the project.
The Earthguard Award is the highest award in the environmental field of the United Nations and is awarded annually.
The “Ant Forest” award was awarded to the Green Innovation Project from China for the third year in a row, following the “Incentive and Action Award” project by the builder of the Sehan Dam site in China and the Zhejiang Province of China, the “Thunmura Demonstration, Manmura Settlement” project.
Trade-related frictions affect the United States economy's “checklist”.
The United States economic “pay card” for the second quarter of this year shows that the United States gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a significantly slower rate than in the previous quarter, affected by a sharp decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts noted that economic and trade frictions and the resulting uncertainty were the main causes of the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data released by the US Department of Commerce on 26 June show that US GDP grew at an annual rate of 2% in the second quarter, which is the same as the revision data published earlier, but is significantly below 3.1% in the first quarter.
The data show that consumption growth is the main factor underpinning the growth of the United States economy in the second quarter.
Individual consumption spending, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the total economy of the United States, increased by 4.6 per cent in the current season, boosting economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumption expenditure and investment boosted growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment declined by 6.3% in the second quarter compared to the previous quarter, slowing down growth by 1.16 percentage points in the current quarter; exports declined by 5.7 percentage points compared to the previous quarter, and net exports slowed down growth by 0.68 percentage points in the current quarter.
According to Barry Knap, the management partner of Einsideside Macroeconomics Consulting in the United States, private sector investment has not only failed to maintain the momentum of last year ' s growth, but has declined sharply, owing to the impact of increased trade friction and uncertainty on business confidence.
According to Knap, United States corporate capital spending is expected to remain declining next year, influenced by policy uncertainty.
Analysts argue that, while consumption growth has strongly supported the United States economy in the second quarter, there are growing indications that trade and trade friction and the uncertainty it creates have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected United States consumption prospects.
The survey leader, Richard Cortin, Professor of Economics at the University of Michigan, had recently indicated that, in a recent survey, 38 per cent of consumers had spontaneously referred to the negative effects of tariffs on the United States economy, a percentage that had been high for a year and a half.
With regard to future economic developments in the United States, analysts generally believe that the United States economy will continue to slow down.
However, it was also suggested that if trade and economic friction were eased, the performance of the United States industrial sector and financial markets would improve.
The British Economist think tank global economist, Karin Burch, predicts that in the future the United States economy will continue its downward trend since the beginning of the year and that the rate of growth will fall to a lower level than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandy, the chief economist for Moody’s Analysis, predicts that, assuming that economic and trade friction does not continue to escalate, the US economy will grow by 2.3% this year, slowing further to 1.6% next year.
Ellen Hazen, investment manager of Patnam Investment, stated that the greatest concern of the enterprise today is economic and trade disputes and the uncertainty they bring, which, if resolved, would be significantly reduced and the industrial sector would perform much better.
According to Matt Melly, stock strategist in Miller-Tabak Asset Management, economic and trade frictions remain a “prior problem” and are the main cause of the large volatility of US capital markets this year, and their proper resolution will be the key to influencing the direction of US capital markets for the rest of the year.
The first joint parental leave for couples in Ningxia is 10 days per year for parents aged 0 to 3 years
Ensuring the legitimate rights and interests of women is an expression of respect for and guarantee of human rights and an important sign of the progress of civil society.
On 27 September, at the fifteenth session of the Standing Committee of the 12th People ' s Congress of the Ningxia-Region Autonomous Region, the Regulation on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women of the Ningxia-Region Autonomous Region was adopted.
This is the local regulation issued by the first province of Ningxia for the protection of women ' s legitimate rights and interests in a comprehensive and systematic manner and will be implemented as of 1 November 2019.
It is understood that the Regulations adopted on this occasion were amended on the basis of the 2007 Ningxia Measures for the Implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women and are divided into 9 chapters, article 65, which includes general principles, political rights, cultural and educational rights and interests, labour and social security rights and interests, property rights and interests, personal rights, marital and family rights and interests, legal responsibilities and by-laws.
In the Ordinance, Ningxia encouraged the exploration of joint parental leave, which was the first in the country.
In April this year, the Office of the State Council issued a Directive on the Promotion of the Development of Care Services for Children and Adolescents under the Age of Three, which contains a description of joint parenthood.
In the course of the revision of the Regulations, Ningxia introduced an innovation that “encourages employers to give joint parental leave for 10 days each year between the ages of 0 and 3 years to couples who have children in accordance with the law and regulations”.
At the same time, the Ordinance highlights the fight against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative results from the current personal status code of the Chinese Civil Code, detailing the constituent elements of sexual harassment, the main subjects and mechanisms against sexual harassment, etc.
Article 44 of the Ordinance explicitly prohibits the occurrence of sexual abuse against girls and requires educational institutions to carry out the relevant educational, protective and preventive work as a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
With regard to women ' s right to know and dispose of marital and family property, article 35 of the Ordinance clearly defines women ' s right to know and the obligations of property registers and related subjects, providing strong institutional support for women ' s defence of their rights.
Moreover, in response to the social hotspots – gender discrimination in employment – section 26 of the Ordinance prohibits not only direct discrimination, but also indirect discrimination, and draws on recent experience in joint interviews, strengthens penalties for gender-based discrimination offences, and strengthens the defence of women’s legitimate rights and interests.
In recent years, the Ningxia Women ' s Union ' s Joint Public Prosecutor ' s Office, Civil Administration and others have been very effective in promoting and introducing social and professional involvement in the mediation of marital and family disputes and in combating domestic violence.
This is summarized and promoted in the Regulations, which in several articles encourage the mobilization of social forces, the pooling of social resources to defend women ' s rights and interests, and require people ' s governments above the county level to provide stable and institutional guarantees and support, including through the purchase of services.
Inner Mongolia, UNITA's Yuanlong Pilgrim Station is saline rice acre for rice.
On 27 January, journalists received good news from the UNITA administration in the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia about the recent launch by the Union of the “Audience and Evaluation Council of Salted Rice Site at the UNITA Yuan Yong Ping Station” and an average of 1,000 pounds of rice produced by salted rice.
A team of six experts from the Agricultural Academy of Sciences of Heilongjiang Province, the University of Yangzhou and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Hunan Province conducted on-site sampling of rice from the “Hing salt series”.
On average, acres of saline-resistant rice produced 508.8 kg of rice on land with a salinity level of 5 to 6 per thousand, measured by experts from 8.8 to 9.6.
As Wang Shik, Chief of the Executive Station at the Yuanlong Park Station of Heung UNITA, said, “We intend to build on this year’s experiment and to innovate and reform to re-plant and optimize saline-resistant rice varieties to make them better quality and more productive. It's not like it's a bad idea.
“With no change in the factors of production, I believe that the continued strengthening of the scientific and technological response will continue to produce miracles in salinized rice. It's not like it's a bad idea.
UNITA is part of a cluster of special hardship areas located in the southern part of the highlight.
In October 2018, the Yuanlong Pilgrim worked on UNITA's showdown.
Zhonglong Pilgrim led the team of experts to accelerate the introduction of the latest growing “salin-resistant hybrid rice” varieties and advanced technologies, to build 960 acres of salin-resistant rice base on the right-wing central flag in Kolgyong, to introduce pilot demonstration at the border, and to promote technical routes to boost the production and income of the local poor.
This saline-resistant rice field production provides a scientific basis not only for the upgrading of low- and medium-yielding UNITA saline fields to medium- and high-yielding fields, but also for the cultivation of saline rice under similar conditions in our country.
According to the Australian Network, on 26 September, following a marathon debate and weeks of protests, the new Australian state passed the Legalization of Abortion Bill.
According to the information received, the bill has given rise to political debate over the past eight weeks and serious differences within AFP have emerged since the introduction of the bill by independent Congressman Greenwich.
It was reported that, after nearly 40 hours of discussion, the New Zealand Senate passed the bill decriminalizing abortion by 26 votes to 14 on the evening of the 25th, making it the third longest bill to be considered by the new State Senate.
In the morning of 26, abortion was legalized in the new Länder following a final vote in the House of Representatives.
The Act allows a woman to terminate her pregnancy during the 22nd week of pregnancy and, if two doctors agree, she is also allowed to have an abortion later in the pregnancy.
On the evening of 25, the Senate had adopted an amendment whereby doctors could seek advice from the multidisciplinary team of the Hospital Advisory Committee before performing an abortion for a woman after 22 weeks of pregnancy.
In addition, the amendments adopted by the Senate include the need for doctors to provide appropriate care for infants who survive termination of pregnancy.
Previously, the Governor of the new Länder, Beriegekilen, had faced public criticism of the bill from conservatives, intervened several times to gain more time for debate on the bill, but she did not attend the final vote.
Beriegekilyn argued for her absentee vote: "I need time to run the new state. It's not like it's a bad idea.
According to the information received, AFP Congressman Davis was the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, which threatened to withdraw from the new state government and called it a “government crisis”.
But then Davis made concessions.
Davids said: “The content of the amendment to the Act on the Legalization of Abortion, which was submitted to the House of Representatives in the morning of 26, effectively provides more guarantees for women and doctors. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Meanwhile, Barilaro, the leader of the New Australian National Party, said that he was proud to be a member of the Government that legalized abortion.
“Our achievements last night were historic for the new Länder, which legitimized abortion, which was no longer a criminal act and did not treat women who had abortions as criminals. It's not like it's a bad idea.
A major Tri-group project is located on the island.
A total investment of $15 billion focused on the development of oil-smart equipment and intelligent steel industries.
Today, the people ' s government of the city of Jizhou holds a project signing ceremony for the Trinity Group.
The Trinity Group has invested $15 billion to develop industrial projects such as the smart steel industry, oil intelligence equipment and regional research and development centres (headquarters bases), and the market for second-hand vehicles for engineering machinery in Jiachu, with a combined annual output expected to exceed $200 billion.
A total investment of $10 billion in the location of the smart steel industry project will focus on the largest steel and product trading centre in the province and even in the centre, as well as on the three groups of metal-structured smart manufacturing and processing centres; a total investment of $5 billion in oil intelligence equipment and the regional research and development centre (Headquarters) project will focus on the construction of oil intelligence equipment production bases, regional research and development centres and headquarters bases.
At the same time, the Trinity Group will also build a market for second-hand vehicles for engineering machinery at the Grand New District of Jiazhou, with practical cooperation in areas such as intelligent manufacturing.
The Japanese city attaches great importance to cooperation with the Trinity Group.
The city has included cooperation projects as a city-wide call for funding for Project No. 1 this year, with the Municipal Secretary Mao Teng Fei, the Mayor of the City, taking the lead in setting up a dedicated coordination group, which will provide high-quality and efficient services to the Sanichi group’s development of the island, and will be approached for formal cooperation agreements for less than 100 days.
The Minister of Finance, Liu Qun, and 67 financial institutions have transferred $860.1 billion to fund the Social Security Fund.
The Minister of Finance, Liu Qun 27, stated that to date, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions had completed the transfer of part of the State-owned capital to the Social Security Fund, bringing the total value of the transferred State-owned capital to approximately $860.1 billion.
Liu Quin made this statement at a national mission to transfer part of the State-owned capital for the work of the Social Security Fund, which was organized by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the National Finance Commission.
“The transfer of part of the State-owned capital to the Social Security Fund is an important initiative to reform and improve the basic pension insurance system. It is a full expression of universal ownership of the results of State-owned enterprise development and of the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system. It is an immediate and long-term policy measure. It's not like it's a bad idea.
In 2017, the State Council issued the Programme for the Transfer of Partial State Capital to the Implementation of the Social Security Fund, which calls for the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces for piloting.
According to Liu Quan, the transition process had yielded positive results.
At the central level, three transfers of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been completed, totalling approximately 8,60.1 billion yuan.
Of these, the transfer of central financial institutions from the Ministry of Finance to carry out the responsibility of financiers has largely been completed.
Central enterprise conversions have taken place on a certain scale.
At the local level, the transition from enterprise to enterprise continues.
By the end of 2018, pilot projects in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had been largely completed, transferring State capital of $15.8 billion and $18.5 billion respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, preparatory work for the transition has been carried out successively in other provinces, laying the groundwork for further implementation.
According to a joint circular issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the National Council of Finance, the General Tax Administration and the CSR, the transfer of part of the State-owned capital to the Social Security Fund was fully rolled out in 2019 and substantially completed by 2020.
The meeting held on that day provided a concrete deployment for the full roll-out.
The need for a pragmatic and efficient transition was stressed.
“In accordance with the schedule of progress, the transition process will be substantially completed by 2020.
Shift hours are tight and tasks are heavy. It's not like we're going anywhere.
Liu Quan said that the regions and departments needed to be well organized and well organized to ensure that the transition was completed as required; to move forward in a solid manner to capture accurately the elements of the transfer policy; and to improve communication coordination and timely resolution of problems.
The State transfers to strengthen the Social Security Fund – starting from the start of the “Facilitation of the Fund’s money bag” – the destination is to provide strong support for old-age security.
However, according to the writer, this is not a simple "physical shift" of equity, but a "mathematic addition".
On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Welfare, the National Council of Finance, the General Tax Administration and the Securities Commission jointly issued a Circular on the Full Transfer of Part of the State Capital to the Work of the Social Security Fund, which sets out the timetable for the transfer of State funds to the Fund, i.e., the transfer of parts of the State capital from the central and local levels to the work of the Fund was fully rolled out in 2019.
Following the publication of the document, the Ministry of Finance and others were able to implement it quickly.
On 25 September, the Ministry of Finance transferred all 10 per cent of the holdings of business banks and agricultural banks to the Social Security Fund, with the transfer of two shares to a total value of over $115 billion.
Under the regulations, recipients such as the Social Security Foundation, as financial investors, have the right to receive, dispose of and be informed of the shares allocated to the State.
In the bulletin, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry stated that the change in entitlement would not result in a change in the shareholders in the Bank ' s holdings and the actual controller.
In response, it was argued that a similar transfer of equity from a State enterprise was not a simple change in attribution of equity, but a “plus calculation” that could trigger a series of effects.
The first step of some State transfers to social security is the “plus result”, which naturally reflects universal ownership of State-owned enterprises and the sharing of development results.
After many years of reform and development, State enterprises, in particular conglomerates, are mostly in important sectors and areas of our economy, with overall profitability and stability.
Among them, the leading firms are more likely to be able to do well on a sustainable basis.
On 10 July, the Standing Committee of the State Council decided that the transfer of some State-owned capital to fund the work of the Fund would be fully implemented this year.
The Ministry of Finance subsequently indicated that it would work with the relevant departments, in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Committee of the State Council, to make a comprehensive transfer of part of the State-owned capital to the Social Security Fund, fully reflecting the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system and the sharing of the results of State-owned enterprise development among all.
The second step of the transition, the “plus result”, is to enhance the sustainability of our social security fund and to further strengthen the foundations of the social security system for old age.
With the ageing of the population, our social security funds are under pressure, and most of the national funds that have been transferred this time have the capacity for continued profitability and dividends, not only to effectively supplement the social security fund, but also to provide it with a source of water.
An increase of 1 percentage point in the contribution rate for basic old-age insurance in enterprises has been calculated for each 3.8 percentage point transfer of State capital.
The third step of the transfer, the "plus result", is to add stabilizers to the capital market.
This transfer is made in the form of a "red-dominated operation supported by " .
As a financial investor in State-owned capital, the Social Security Fund does have a strong stake in receiving dividends.
However, as a value investor in capital markets, the Fund has a strong capacity to operate capital.
In the case of listed assets in State capital, the participation of the Social Security Fund in holding shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of the listed enterprise and contribute to the upgrading of business operations, with a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the rise in equity weights, as a sign of investment, has helped to further increase its influence in the market and serve as a “stabilizer” in the market.
It also facilitates the full utilization of the “value discovery” function of institutional investors, leading to rational investment and value investment by investors.
Karl Hartmann was admitted to the Leipzig Conservatory at the age of 18, followed by a teacher from Weibourne.
After the Nazis came to power, Hartmann first resisted in the form of works not published in Germany and then even stopped creating.
In 1933, he created Miserae and dedicated it to “My Sleeping Friends”.
This symphony was inaugurated in Prague in 1935, but was harassed by Nazi bureaucrats.
Then Hartmann resolved not to play any of his works under Nazi rule.
Hartmann's funeral concerto was a violin and string concerto when the manuscript was stolen from Germany and the premiere was held in Switzerland.
Listen to the funeral concert at the Beethoven Music Festival in 2018 played by the Berne Indoor Orchestra.
The United States Senate has approved Scalia as Minister of Labour, Xinhua Network.
Xinhua’s Washington message of 26 September (journalist Sun Tin Dunsemley) voted for President Trump’s nomination of Eugene Scalya as Minister of Labour on 26 September.
The result of the vote was 53 in favour and 44 against, and no Democrats voted in favour of Scalya.
Republicans believe that his curriculum vitae makes him well suited to the post of Minister of Labour.
However, according to Democrats, Scalya has long stood in opposition to workers and trade unions during his legal career.
Scalya will succeed Alexander Acosta.
Acosta, then Minister of Labour, announced his resignation in July of this year, under great pressure from public opinion.
Scalya, 56 years old, is a partner in a well-known United States law firm, whose father was the late United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalya.
The Department of Labor is the United States Federal Government Cabinet-level department responsible for labour-related matters, etc.
The White House also issued a statement on the same day that Trump had nominated Peter Genna, Acting Director of the Federal Emergency Agency, to formally lead the institution.
In accordance with the procedure, the nomination of Guna also requires the approval of the Senate of Congress.
The Federal Emergency Response Agency, which is part of the United States Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for coordinating federal government resources to deal with emergencies such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks and their aftermath in the United States.
Since the first parade on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the National Day, every time a military parade is organized, there will be a “mixed-up” of strategic missile forces.
“It is the first time that the Rockets have seen the sight of An Street since the National Day of War. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The Commander of the Rocket Armaments Unit, Wang Bo, said.
The missile-reading forces are fully motivated by a spirit of special suffering, combat, dedication, discipline, scientific group training, and the three main features that characterize the entire course of military training, displaying a good image of a strategic army and a greater emphasis on rigorous conduct.
During this parade, both generals and soldiers were subjected to strict criteria for the development of a harsh and forbidden pattern.
They have also focused on promoting the spirit of craftsmen and craftsmen, capturing every detail of the technique, persistence, style, and so forth. They have developed the characteristics of “army postures, speed of movement, clarity of response”. They have continued to build a robust missile array with a rigorous and realistic approach, with greater emphasis on scientific and technological innovation.
As a high-technology strategic force, rocket forces are excellent traditions and advantages in terms of technology and innovation.
Based on past experience, the parade has broken down mindsets, broken traditional approaches and used advanced techniques such as satellite positioning, laser ranging, high-resolution imaging, real-time speed measurement to improve the level of training and quality benefits, ensuring that the combination of human vehicles is not bad, that teams are operating in substantial seconds, and that they are more responsive to operational standards.
Rocket forces are subject to the same standards and higher requirements as they are for the parade and launch sites, holding each gate close to each detail, allowing the parade forces to undergo a hammer of fire, and truly making the national parade a training and testing ground for force multipliers.
Iran has confirmed the development of advanced centrifuges and further suspension of the Iranian nuclear protocol.
On September 27, China Newsnet, according to “Central” reports, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated on September 26 that Iran had once again violated the Iranian nuclear agreement by using advanced centrifuge mechanisms to enrich uranium.
It is reported that Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the Iran Nuclear Agreement in response to the withdrawal of United States President Trump from the Iran Nuclear Agreement in May 2018 and the resumption and strengthening of sanctions against Iran.
Iran has suspended two other commitments in July, to keep uranium enrichment stocks below 300 kg, and to keep enriched uranium below 3.67% purity, with further moves now.
Under the nuclear agreement, Iran was allowed to accumulate uranium by installing only about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz, and only a small number of more advanced machine types were allowed to be used for research, but no enriched uranium was produced.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for the manufacture of nuclear bombs.
According to the report, the International Atomic Energy Agency reports that: “On 25 September, the Agency confirmed that Iran's advanced centrifuges of type 2 and 3 were accumulating or were ready to accumulate enriched uranium. It's not like it's a bad idea.
This report was presented to Member States on 26 December by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency, and a diplomatic official responded: “They are busy at the uranium enrichment facility in Natanz. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The Association of Vietnamese Investors and Entrepreneurs is officially visible.
Chen Hailing, President of the Association of Vietnamese Investors and Entrepreneurs, said that VKBIA would work together as a bridge to strengthen inter-Korean relations.
The two countries are striving to increase their two-way trade to $100 billion by 2020.
Mr. Chen Hae-Ling believed that the birth of the Association had been an important step towards that goal.
He hoped that the Viet Nam Party, the Government and the relevant Korean functional bodies would assist in the future operation of the Association.
The Deputy Ambassador of Viet Nam to the Republic of Korea, Chen Yonghei, stated that VKBIA would create a good platform for exchange and sharing of experiences and ideas between entrepreneurs in the two countries with a view to expanding the space for investment cooperation, making mutual assistance a more effective contribution to Viet Nam ' s economic development and integration into the international economy and helping to boost the flourishing of Korean trade relations.
At the ceremony, VKBIA representatives signed cooperation agreements with representatives of the Vietnamese Association of Farming and Agribusiness.
The VKBIA coincides with the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the strategic partnership between the two countries, and is being born in the context of the strengthening of practical cooperation in the areas of foreign affairs, defence and security, and the promotion of trade and investment cooperation aimed at achieving the goal of 100 billion dollars in two-way trade by 2020.
The Italian Minister of Education proposed a sugar tax to protect the health of the population.
A recent motion by Lorenzo Fioramanti, Minister of Education of the Cabinet of the new Italian Government and a member of the Five Star Movement, proposed to Parliament a new tax policy for sugar-rich drinks, snacks and air tickets.
It has been reported that, under a bill proposed by the Minister of Education, Fiolamonti, the Italian Government will introduce a snack tax on food commodities that are harmful to health, such as sugar beverages and snacks; and a stringent environmental tax on air tickets, a euro for domestic flights and 1.5 euros for international courses.
Fiolamonti indicated that, through a series of seemingly small tax measures, the Government expected to receive 3 billion euros in tax revenues.
Funds from this tax will be available for education, health and environmental protection.
In response, Italian Prime Minister Conte stated that he considered this to be a viable option, while Italian parliamentarians, European parliamentarians and Unionist Party leader Salwini had sarcasticly said that you should hide desserts, cookies, bread and candy as the new Government was beginning to levy a snack tax.
The reports indicate that the snack tax refers generally to a special tax on sugary beverages and high-calorie foods.
The introduction of the tax has helped to bring benefits to public health.

China is facing serious difficulties in its relations with China and is not responsible for it.
"The ringing must also be the bell man."
It was to be hoped that, as soon as possible, the country would come up with an appropriate solution to the outstanding problems in bilateral relations and would create the conditions for the return to normal relations between the two countries.

China-ASEAN relations continue to escalate, maintaining mutual respect, understanding, trust and support, and strongly promoting peaceful stability and prosperity in the region.
Shao Chi said that the fundamental reason for the change in development in the new China over the past 70 years was that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, had opened and developed the path of Chinese socialism.
This path, adapted to the times and circumstances of China, profoundly alters the fate of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation, and makes a significant contribution to the peaceful development of the world and the region. It is a path of the powerful that is able, right and right.

The reception also featured a “Thematic tour to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China” and attracted guests to attend.
The first auto-driving taxi teams started testing.
Yesterday, 100 degrees in Changsha announced that the auto-pilot taxi team, Robotaxi, was officially operational.
The first 45 “red flag” Robotaxi convoys, developed jointly by Apollo and a red flag, began to operate on a test segment in the Changsha sector.
As of this date, ordinary citizens of Changsha will be able to access the Apollo network to apply as seed users and have the opportunity to take advantage of the experience.
One experienced passenger indicated that he was sitting in the back of the vehicle, clicking on a screen in front of the passenger ' s seat and opening the auto-driving journey of the vehicle with one click.
Within the vehicle, for the safety of passengers and in accordance with current policy regulations, the pilot operation of the vehicle is carried out with a security officer at the driver ' s seat to maximize passenger safety.
In the course of travel, the vehicle may undergo an intellectual shift based on the condition of the road. It may also determine the condition of the vehicle in the vicinity and make automatic concessions in circumstances such as close-range overloads.
Throughout the journey, the passenger area screen shows in real time the roads of pedestrians, cars and even some traditional blind areas.
Even in case of vehicle coverage, information about changes in front and waiting times can be seen in advance, and all traffic conditions are clear.
The drones used to hear it on television, thought it was far from us, but it was amazing to find it in our lives today.
We look forward to its coming into real civilian life.
In June 2019, Apollo received 45 portable test plates issued by the Changsha Municipality.
At present, Changsha's auto-pilot tests open roads, passing through the City of Changsha's City of Artificial Smart Technology, Lake May Creek, Lake Ocean, Mount King, and the High New Zone, are up to 135 kilometres in length and the demonstration area is 70 square kilometres. This is the longest, largest area of Chinese road, with the most complex scenes and the most advanced intelligent pilot zone of the combined road infrastructure.
By the end of 2019, it is expected that the Apollo Robotaxi fleet will have a pilot road of approximately 50 kilometres in Changsha and that it is planned to cover 135 kilometres currently open in the first half of 2020.
There's still a problem with girls winning the game: it's hard to play so many mistakes.
In the afternoon of Beijing time, Chinese women won the ninth round of the 2019 Women's World Cup, while the strong Dutch women's row ended up with Chinese women in 3:1 against the Dutch women's row, and women in the nine-time World Cup.
However, after the game, the female platoon manager, Rongping, expressed dissatisfaction with the third game performance of the team.
“In the third round, the other side increased its aggressiveness, and some of us failed to take it down, and we made a lot of mistakes. It's not like it's a bad idea.
"To fight the strong, to make so many mistakes." It's not like we're going anywhere.
After his interview, he said:
“We tell the team to focus on what we're going to do, what we're going to do, what we're going to do and what we're going to do. It's not like it's a bad idea.
He also evaluated Zhang Chang Ning ' s behaviour, stating that she was experiencing some difficulties in the attack, that she was anxious, that she wanted to kill the ball, and that the movement was deformed.
I hope she's patient, "Let's protect her."
China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
White Paper: China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The White Paper states that China ' s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
The White Paper states that, as China’s combined national power and international influence have risen rapidly, there are international fears that China will follow the path of “national domination” and some have put forward the so-called “China threat theory.”
This is both cognitive misreading, deep-rooted prejudices, psychological imbalances brought about by growing power and deliberate distortions in defence of their vested interests.
The realization of national prosperity, national renewal and the well-being of the people are the dream of both the Chinese people and the common dream of all peoples.
“China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge. It's not like we're going anywhere.
The White Paper states that China is the main stabilizer and engine of world economic growth, that China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, that China ' s science, technology and innovation have injected new dynamics into world economic growth and that the role of China ' s economic stabilizers and engines will become more prominent in the future.
The current world economy was not sufficiently dynamic, and a robust Chinese economy was increasingly important to the world.
China ' s economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development. New types of industrialization, informationization, urbanization and modernization of agriculture are accelerating. The economy is undergoing a deep structural adjustment, industrial optimization is continuing and new economic growth points are emerging.
“A study by the McKinsey Institute of Global Studies concluded that China’s integration with the rest of the world’s economies is expected to generate $22 trillion to $37 trillion in economic value by 2040, equivalent to 15 to 26% of the global economy’s total. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The White Paper emphasizes that China ' s economy has undergone structural changes and has been deeply integrated into the world economy.
A more stable economy, a better quality of growth and sustainable growth prospects for China would be of long-term benefit to the world economy.
Looking at China’s economic development as a “threat” and a “challenge,” it is neither feasible nor harmful to try to squeeze China out of global industrial chains, supply chains, and value chains, and to “delink” China from the world economy.
The White Paper states that full-fledged openness creates more opportunities for countries to share the “China dividend”.
China is determined to pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win open-door strategy and to achieve greater and higher levels of openness to the outside world. China has the world's most promising consumer markets. China is the most attractive destination for investment, benefiting more countries on a larger scale.
“Openness should be two-way, mutually beneficial and not one-sided.
Both directions of mutual benefit can last for long. It's not like we're going anywhere.
The White Paper states that China is committed to continuously expanding imports, liberalizing market access, improving the business environment and enhancing intellectual property protection, and that other countries should expand their openness and take corresponding initiatives to improve their business environment.
An open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment can be created only if all parties act in the same direction. Together, the “cakes” of development become bigger and the community of interests is mutually beneficial.
The White Paper states that China provides the international community with more public goods.
This includes the promotion of high-quality “one way forward”, the establishment of multilateral platforms for dialogue and cooperation, active participation in international and regional affairs and active external assistance.
“China's development has benefited from the international community and has not forgotten to give back to the family of nations and to provide the international community with more and better public goods. It's not like it's a bad idea.
In a written interview with a reporter from Xinhua, the General Manager of the Russian Export Centre, Andrei Slipniv, expressed his country ' s readiness to strengthen cooperation with China in the economic and trade fields, further optimize its export structure and promote the diversification of Russian exports to China.
Slipniv noted that, while the forestry, mechanical and chemical industries account for a significant proportion of Russian exports to China, agricultural exports are also important, including oil, meat and dairy products, as well as cereals, fish and seafood.
In recent years, Russian exports of non-material and non-energy products to China have also shown good and steady growth.
Referring to Russia ' s optimization of its export structure to China, he said that the Russian side had set a mandate to expand exports of high-technology products to meet the import demand for high-technology products from countries and regions around the world, including China.
The Russian Federation will then improve its financial and non-financial support measures and promote further growth in the number of high-tech enterprises.
Slipniov indicated that the Russian side was ready to export construction technology and high-tech construction materials to China and to develop cooperation with China in the areas of medicine, air manufacturing and so forth.
There is also great potential for cooperation between the Russian and Chinese sides in the field of urban environmental development.
He stressed that Russian products in many areas were “quality superior and price competitive” compared to Western products of similar kind.
Referring to the two countries ' goal of achieving $200 billion in bilateral trade by 2024, Sripniov said that areas such as agriculture, mechanical manufacturing, the chemical industry and forestry would play an important role in achieving that goal.
The Russian side intends to promote the diversification of supply in these areas and to promote the export of deep-processed products.
He stressed that the Russian side intended to push its exporters into the global value chain, of which China was one of the development directions.
Russian manufacturers in the fields of agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas, and chemicals are well placed to participate in this process.
Currently, the two countries need to continue to deepen cooperation between enterprises, “to establish more Russian-Chinese joint ventures and jointly develop exports to third countries”.
According to Slipniov, Russian export centres are supporting Chinese exports of Russian products through various measures and services of the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Export-Import Bank.
At the same time, the Russian export centres will continue to deepen their cooperation with the relevant Chinese authorities in order to facilitate easier access to the Chinese market for Russian goods and to develop new categories of Chinese exports.

At the annual conference of SWIFT, held in London in 2019, the Agency issued a special publication entitled " Insight of the RMB in London " , which shows that the number of financial institutions paying in the RMB worldwide increased by 11.31 per cent from July 2017 to 2214 from 1989.
Among them, Africa and the Middle East experienced the largest increase in the number of financial institutions paying in the renminbi, from 143 in July 2017 to 173 in July 2019, an increase of 20.98 per cent.
The report shows that, as of August 2019, the RMB share in the global currency of payments was 2.22 per cent.
At the same time, London played a leading role in the offshore exchange of the renminbi.
According to the report, in July 2019, London ' s share of the global renminbi ' s offshore foreign exchange transactions was 33.79 per cent, leading the world.
According to the report, London is at the top of global foreign exchange transactions.
In July 2019, London ' s share of global foreign exchange transactions was 40.14 per cent, the United States 12.93 per cent and France 7.67 per cent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the so-called "diplomatic breakthrough":
In response to a recent visit by Chinese officials to United Nations Headquarters to attend a conference on religious issues, the spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded at a regular press conference that such a small move was a disgraceful one and a big smile.
According to reports from the Taiwan press, the Taipei office in New York had recently entered United Nations Headquarters to attend meetings on religious issues in the United States, calling them “diplomatic breakthroughs”.
The meeting to which you have referred is a side event held by the United States on the premises of the United Nations and is not a United Nations meeting at all.
They say that the T-shirts are sneaking into the United Nations, disparaging themselves, and that it is called a “diplomatic breakthrough,” which is a disgraceful little move.
He noted that the United Nations had repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to addressing the Taiwan issue in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2758, and that the wider United Nations membership had adhered to the one-China principle.
Ho and Hott accelerate the upgrading of the dairy industry - Xinhua Network
On September 27, Xinhua’s news reporter Hou and Hott (journalist Ann Lumon) learned from the cities of Huo and Hott in the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia that the city of Huo and Hot has accelerated the upgrading of the dairy industry, with the participation of Ely and Monooxin in the world’s top ten dairy companies, accelerating the implementation of a number of projects such as the Ili Healthy Foods Estate, the Monoox China Dairy Estate, and so on, making every effort to build “China Dairy Upgrading”.
The dairy industry, which is the traditional advantage of the cities of HOPE and Hott, is growing rapidly, thanks to unique resource endowments, industrial base and policy support.
In 2018, the city-wide cattle-scale farming rate was over 98 per cent, nearly 85 per cent of the farmers entered the industrial chain, and the sale of two businesses, Ely and Mono-Cow, had a total income of nearly $150 billion.
With a view to further developing the dairy industry, the cities of Huo and Hott have issued a number of recommendations for the creation of a “China Dairy All Upgrading” and a three-year plan of action to promote the upgrading of the dairy industry (2018-2020), with a view to taking the lead in achieving the objective of making 4.0 in the dairy industry.

The protest has struck the president down in the Egyptian mountains.
Twitter theme tags and social media are strongly advocating for Egyptians to take to the streets today and peacefully demand the removal of President Sessi.
However, the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress them.
Since Sessi, the then head of the military, launched a military coup in 2013 to seize power, the expression of dissent has almost disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest is at greater risk.
The British Guardian reported that the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, a non-governmental organization in Cairo, had stated that more than 1900 people had been arrested since the rare outbreak of protests last weekend demanding the removal of Sessi.
Allegations of corruption surrounding the wasteful pursuit of vanity by Sessi and his family led thousands of people to demonstrate on the streets from 20 days on.
The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior firmly stated yesterday that any attempt to destabilize the country would be met with determination and no mercy.
The city centre of Cairo has long been heavily guarded, with riot police, security agency vehicles and plainclothes policemen everywhere in the streets around Tahrir Square, where the Egyptian revolution blew up in 2011.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces had detained several leading scholars and sociologists on 25 days, including Professor of Political Science at Cairo University and well-known columnist Nafa.
In his tweet on 24th, he said: “I have no doubt that the continuation of the absolute rule of Cessy will cause disaster.”
“It is in the interest of Egypt that he be removed immediately.” It's not like we're going anywhere.
Prior to Nafa ' s arrest, Hosni, who had served as spokesperson for Anna Anna, former chief of staff of the Egyptian military, was detained.
Anna was arrested last year after trying to compete with Sessi for the presidency.
The President of the Constitutional Party, Davud, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that, at a time when the economic plight of the poor and middle class is worsening, the practice of sweeping out dissidents reflects the instability and fragility of the Government.
The leader of the opposition, Ayman Nour, who once ran for the presidency, said: “The capture highlights the regime’s disregard for the Egyptian people and its own fear.” It's not like it's a bad idea.
“As the economy is already in disarray, and as a result of widespread political repression, Sessi is trying to send a clear message to the important generals and politicians who may replace it. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Nor noted that, in the context of the continuing deterioration of the socio-economic situation, the Government ' s high-handed approach would only increase the anger of the population.
Since the barrier of fear had been breached, he expected more people to go to the streets.
A businessman and actor currently in exile in Spain, Ali, who was an Egyptian military construction contractor, began uploading a series of videos early in the month, claiming to benefit from the corruption of the Government, setting off a small wave of demonstrations in different cities last weekend.
Ali stated that his company, Amrak General Contracting, could obtain a lucrative contract without going through the statutory bidding process, emphasizing the corruption of the military and members of his family, including the First Lady, Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He expressed deep remorse for his involvement.
Ali claims that he helped the luxurious palace and the luxury hotel in Sesage, in stark contrast to the current abject poverty of Egyptians, and that the other party has not paid.
On Twitter, subject labels such as “Standing Up You Are Not Alone”, “Cessy You're Done”, “Cessy Rolling”, and “Friday Next” have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and tweets calling for people to take to the streets peacefully to demand that Sessi step down.
On Twitter, the Egyptian man of Hollywood Amarwick has nearly 7 million followers.
Yesterday he tweeted in Arabic: "Cessy is doomed. He's finished. It's not like it's a bad idea.

Yu Peng Chun, Chairman of the Employees Retraining Board, indicated that all course fees were free and that the plan was expected to support some 10,000 people in need.
The participants in the programme receive a special allowance of HK$4,000 per student per month for each full-time or part-time course and 80 per cent attendance.
It was described that the training course, which lasted between two and three months, was provided by some 50 training institutions and that citizens could read it in newspapers from 3 October to 31 March next year, with up to four courses per person.

The study was initiated by the National Institute of Physical Education and Sport (INSEP).
Experts at the school are responsible for directing athletes to the Olympic Games.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from over-training syndromes, i.e. an irresistible sense of fatigue following high-load exercise, inability to recover and a decline in performance.
INSEP asked whether part of the illness was caused by nervous fatigue, which was caused by over-drain work.
The study was published in the journal Contemporary Biology.

Make it easier for Chinese citizens to “go out” — visit Choi Ae-min, Director of Consular Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Wherever you go, the country is behind you.
On 25 January, the first Ministry of Foreign Affairs consular protection short film came online, and the closing sentence of the short film resonates with a wide range of netizens.
In an interview with Xinhua journalist, Choi Amin, Director of Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated that the short film was designed to give the public a greater sense of the love and temperature of “diplomatic for people” and to give Chinese citizens the help, strength and hope that they would receive from Chinese diplomats, regardless of their place in the world.
There's nothing wrong with being safe overseas.
CHOI Amin stated that, over the past 70 years, the number of Chinese citizens who “going out” has increased dramatically, from less than one million per year before the reform and opening up to more than a billion times a year; at the same time, Chinese citizens travelling abroad are more secure and consular protection and assistance is extended from overseas to various groups of Chinese nationals, tourists, students and workers.
According to statistics, since the 18th Congress of the Party, we have organized more than 10 major evacuations or transfers of Chinese citizens abroad and have evacuated more than 40,000 Chinese citizens safely from dangerous and volatile areas.
Some 500,000 cases of various kinds of recourse have been received and dealt with in a coordinated manner, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.
In times of danger, the country can take you home; it's no longer a dream.
According to CHOI Amin, by the end of August this year China had concluded visa-free agreements with 14 countries covering ordinary passport personnel.
In addition, an increasing number of countries have unilaterally granted Chinese citizens entry facilities such as visa waivers or landing visas.
Forty-two countries and territories, such as Thailand and Egypt, unilaterally granted entry visas to Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports, while 15 countries, such as Indonesia, unilaterally granted exemption from entry to Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports.
In addition to visa waivers and landing arrangements, Chinese citizens have become more and more accessible and simplified in their visa applications.
By the end of August, China had concluded agreements or arrangements to simplify visa procedures with 41 countries.
These include agreements with the United States, Canada, Israel and Argentina for the mutual granting of multiple visas to tourists, commercial personnel valid for 10 years and the United Kingdom for two years to travel, commerce and family visits.
The United Kingdom, Belgium and France have jointly introduced a “visa one stop” service, and France, Italy and Singapore have reduced the processing time to 48, 36 and 24 hours respectively.
For business people who travel abroad frequently, multiple entry and easy clearance APEC business travel cards are a good option.
According to Choi Aemin, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining more than five-year visas for 16 economies in the Asia-Pacific region, which is of great importance to business people, especially private business people.
China currently has the highest number of valid cards in the APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa-reciprocity agreements, promote visa facilitation measures for more Chinese citizens, translate the results of diplomatic work into pro-people initiatives, and continuously increase the " gold content " of Chinese passports.

In 2018, the company established a dual-nuclear-driven synergistic development strategy based on intensive medical testing operations (IVD operations) and a breakthrough between the health-intensive operations (SPD operations) and the regional testing centres to upgrade the SPD operations over time, building on the advantages of consolidating the original IVD operations.
Sélèse-related sources told journalists that the three main lines of Sélèse ' s business were moving steadily towards a rapid expansion in response to the general trend of medical rehabilitation.
In the SPD field of operations, in January of this year, Sélis announced the signing of a cooperation agreement for the construction and day-to-day operation of a medical assembly operating platform with the People ' s Hospital of Lingwu City and the Central Hospital of Lingwu City, for a period of three years.
“In fact, SPD operations are being significantly expanded to provide medical institutions with sophisticated operating services such as centralized procurement, storage management, distribution and settlement services in medical institutions to generate long-term income. It's not like it's a bad idea.
According to the above.
On 17 September, according to an announcement from the Zhejiang Government Procurement Service Information Platform, the Zhejiang Government Procurement Network (Zhejiang Government Procurement Service) announced that Sélèse had been awarded a “Logical Extension Service Project” at the Zhejiang University College of Medicine attached to the Zhejiang Hospital.
According to pharmaceutical industry analysts, the winning bid is highly gold-bearing, and the first public hospital in mainland China, through the International Hospital Review (JCI), is an important development opportunity for hospitals in the future.
According to its analysis, prior to this, Sélèse had largely completed the operational area coverage of the national province through regional outreach, national strategic cooperation and through mergers and acquisitions.
Today, the successful fugitive hospital is in the city of Zhejiang and should continue to replicate the model in different hospitals to enhance the competitiveness of companies in the market in China.
In addition, this year Sélèse has set up new areas such as industrial cannabis and block chain technology.
Seven hundred and eighty thousand volunteers in Beijing were travelling on the National Day.

After two months in detention by Iran, the British tanker “Stanner Empire” was finally released and left for international waters in the morning of 27 hours from the Iranian port of Abbas.
In mid-month, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory had just released an Iranian tanker that had been detained for more than a month.
According to the news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran, at 9 a.m. local time, the British tanker “Stanner Empire” departed from the port of Abbas for international waters in the Persian Gulf.
Iran ' s Ports and Shipping Organization in Hormuzgan confirmed that the ship ' s commander and crew had made a formal and written undertaking that they had no claim despite the ship ' s seizure.
The Swedish shipowner of the “Stanner Empire” also indicated that the ship was sailing from the port of Abbas.
In addition, the vessel tracking data of Refinitiv also revealed that the tanker had started moving on 27 and had left the port of Abbas.
The British-flagged Steena Impero tanker was seized by Iran in July this year.
The company's spokesperson said that the tanker was preparing to leave the port of Abbas.
Two weeks after the British seized an Iranian tanker in the waters of Gibraltar, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards detained the tanker, Steena Impero, in the Strait of Hormuz.
The boat was released in August.
Earlier this week, the spokesman of the Iranian Government had stated that all the legal procedures required for the release of the “Stana Empire” had been completed.
However, the Iranian side indicated that the investigation was still ongoing.
A video of the tanker's departure was also released in various Iranian media.
On 19 July, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy detained a British tanker, the “Stanner Empire”, in Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz, and then transported it to the port of Abbas.
Iran was taken from the waters of Gibraltar by the tanker Grace I.
In addition, on 4 July, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory seized the oil tanker Grace I, carrying Iranian crude oil, in the Strait of Gibraltar on suspicion of transporting oil to Syria in violation of EU sanctions.
More than a month later, on 15 August, the Gibraltar authorities announced the release of Grace I.
This afternoon, a thematic session on the educational review and rehabilitation of undergraduate colleges across the province was held in Changsha.
The Vice-Secretary of the Provincial Council, Ulan, stressed the need to raise political positions, strengthen political responsibility, take a critical look at the problems and reform them, and promote high-quality development in the construction, thinking and reform of institutions of higher education through the effectiveness of thematic education.
The Ulan fully acknowledges the initial results achieved by the undergraduate colleges in the second series of thematic education.
She pointed out that the implementation of the theme “Don't forget, remember your mission” was a major deployment at the party's centre, and that undergraduate colleges were expected to follow up on the important message of the General Secretary of Xi Jinping on the theme “Don't forget your mission”.
From raising the “four consciousness” to “two preservation” to the political level of the original mission, to carefully implement the actions of the provisions of the subject education, particularly to overhaul the set of issues that emerges, to integrate school reform and development efforts to achieve “two by one.”
Ulan stressed that it is important to stay inside, keep looking for the problem, follow the “Four Checks” and “Four Searches”, and ask for advice from teachers and students, parents and all sectors of society on how to identify the problem, so that the underlying causes can be examined in a serious and intellectual way, and so that efforts and improvements can be clearly directed and improved, so as to find a way to solve the problem.
The word “change” should be used consistently and consistently in order to maintain precision and strengthen real change.
It is important to combine thematic education with work such as the "Led Trees" and to improve accountability and effectiveness by ensuring that the problem is clear and clear.
It is necessary to ensure that the rules and regulations are followed and that the system is truly in charge.
In keeping with the above, the leadership has taken the lead in strengthening the doctrine, in taking the lead in examining corrective changes and in taking the lead, and in playing its role as a model “key minority”, in an effort to complete the thematic educational review and overhauling tasks.
Statements were made by the five Higher Education Committees, including Hunan University, which are in charge of comrades and the provincial authorities.
I've been working on two very high-pressure projects.
On 26 November, the direct transmission of electricity from ±1,100 kV and the Sotun 1000 kV exchange high-voltage GIL complex project were shipped.
Both of these projects occupy the high point of the current world power transmission technologies in their respective fields, which, when delivered, will result in a significant increase in the country ' s vastly optimized energy allocation.
According to Guo Ji-ji, the General Economist of the National Energy Agency, the para-east to Zhongnan projects are the most capable and distant in the world.
Its transportation is important for promoting the development of Xinjiang ' s energy base and guaranteeing electricity supply in East China.
GIL, i.e. gas insulation metal, shuts down the transmission line.
The Sutonic Pipeline Project, which created a record of the highest level of global voltage and the highest transmission capacity of the GIL Project, brought into operation the `twice-ring network' of the highest voltage level of the China-East backbone grid.
According to the National Electricity Network Company, the distance from the para-east to the south is 3324 km.
If conventional technology is used, more than 15 per cent of electricity will be lost in transit, and the project has been developed and developed, raising the economic transport distance to more than 3,000 kilometres.
After the launch of the quasi-east to south projects, 100 million degrees of electrical energy are delivered every eight hours and 20 minutes, helping to break down the new energy available in Xinjiang.
According to full load estimates, this route alone will reach 60 to 85 billion kilowatt hours per year, meeting more than half of Shanghai ' s electricity use throughout the year.
The Suton GIL complex is a controlled project across the Yangtze River through a high-pressure communication ring.
The use of conventional open lines to cross the river requires the installation of two giant towers over 450 metres over the Yangtze River and the construction of an artificial island of over four football fields per tower.
In response, the national grid was boldly innovative in its development of compact high-pressure communication GIL transmission technologies, which bypassed the river through tunnels and avoided the impact on the gold channel.
Two projects contributed to a new leap in our electrician equipment manufacturing capacity.
At present, the national electricity grid has accumulated high pressure of “10 to 11” and “4 to 3” is under construction.
Foreign exchange bureaux: our external debt structure continues to improve
“In general, the country's external debt structure continues to optimize and its stability has increased. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The press spokesman of the National Foreign Exchange Administration, Wang Chun Ying, the chief economist, stated on 27 January that the main indicators of our external debt were within internationally recognized security lines and that external debt risks were generally manageable.
Wang Chun Ying made this statement when he published data on the foreign debt at the end of June 2019 at the Foreign Exchange Office, in response to questions from journalists.
The data show that, as of the end of June 2019, the country ' s total-calibre (including foreign currency) external debt balance stood at US$ 1998 billion, an increase of US$ 26.3 billion, or 1.3 per cent, over the end of March 2019, mainly as a result of the increase in debt stock balances.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70 per cent of the increase in our full-calibre external debt was driven by the purchase by non-residents of domestic renminbi bonds and the majority of non-residents were medium- and long-term investors, such as central banks.
At the end of June 2019, medium- and long-term external debt increased by 3 percentage points compared with the end of March 2019 and by 1 percentage point compared to the end of March 2019.
According to Wang Chun Ying, international investors' recognition of the Chinese bond market has increased further, with the inclusion of renminbi bonds in our country's global composite index of 20 April 2019.
“Our balance of payments is generally balanced and external debt risks are manageable. It's not like we're going anywhere.
Journalists learned on 27 January from the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences that the green moths in Yunnan grassland were being effectively protected from widespread outbreaks and that the prevention and control efforts had produced milestones.
In January this year, for the first time ever, the town of Yunnan Pum Mae County discovered grassland night moths that had been moved from abroad, which were subsequently confirmed in 129 Yunnan counties, and gradually spread from Yunnan to mainland China, posing a direct threat to Chinese food production.
Grassland night moths are important agricultural pests originating in the tropics and subtropical regions of the Americas that are food-rich and remote flight and are significant flight pests of the FAO Global Early Warning System, characterized by “internationality, flightability, outbreak and destruction”.
The pest endangers more than 80 crops, such as maize, sugar cane and sorghum, and can produce as much as 70 per cent of the food.
The difficulty of combating the disease is such that China does not have a registered pesticide to combat the disease.
Since the grassland night moths moved into Yunnan, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences has selected Eedong Research Fellows to lead the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences ' cross-border harmful organisms in agriculture, in collaboration with the Green Control and Control Provincial Innovation Team, to a line, field surveys, sample collection and technical guidance and pilot demonstration.
The team has acquired initial knowledge of the species characteristics of night moths in the Yunnan herbs, the natural insect resources, the origin characteristics of the insects outside the country, the migration trajectory of the population, the poison and the effects of field control.
They have been actively engaged in research and application of green-control technologies, which have achieved over 90 per cent of the control effects in the demonstration areas through the implementation of new green-control technologies such as stock monitoring, insect booby traps, scientific medicines and agronomic measures, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting natural enemy resources and the ecological environment, and providing technical safeguards for Yunnan to effectively control the eruption of grassland night moths and sustainable governance.
At present, moths in Yunnan grassland are effectively protected from large-scale outbreaks and control efforts have produced milestones.
As a next step, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on the ecological mechanisms of stock migrations and invasions, which will go beyond the construction of biological control and green technology systems.
At the same time, international cross-border cooperation has been actively promoted with a view to establishing joint priority laboratories and joint monitoring sites and demonstration areas outside the country in order to enhance the full range of surveillance and early warning capabilities of night moths in Yunnan grasslands.

White Paper: China ' s way out of a country-specific development path
China News Agency, Beijing, 27 September, released the White Paper " China and the World in a New Era " on 27 September.
The White Paper states that over the past 70 years, the Chinese people have worked hard to explore and move forward and have succeeded in opening the path of socialism, which is characteristic of China, with remarkable development achievements.
The White Paper stated that China ' s development depended on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development is based on the spirit of “800 million shirts for a Boeing” and generations of hard work and sweat that others can hardly imagine. It is based on the spirit of “self-burdened” responsibility, whether in good or bad, not to export problems, not to develop itself by selling or selling by force or plundering others. It is based on the spirit of “spreading through the river with stones”, not following the old path of imperialism and colonialism, not following the Western model of development, but rather to combine China's actual, lessons learned, learning from human civilization and dare to try and walk out of its own path.
The White Paper states that China has developed in its interaction with the world, that China has injected positive energy into world peace and development, and that China ' s roads are adapted to China ' s national conditions and times.
China maintains world peace with practical action.
For 70 years, China had not initiated any war or conflict of its own and had not invaded one inch of the land of another country.
The White Paper states that China has achieved great success in its development over the past 70 years, essentially because it has found the right path to Chinese identity socialism and has been steadfast in pursuing it.
It is a path to a State based on national circumstances, where the interests of the people are at the forefront, where reforms and innovations are made, where common development is sought in openness and where the rule of law is fully respected.
China, which is large and complex in size, has no easy governance in the world. Without a centralized and strong leadership, China will move towards division and disintegration, with catastrophic consequences for the world.
The White Paper states that, over the past 70 years, China has overcome risks and challenges and created yet another remarkable Chinese miracle.
In particular, since the 18th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, China has made historic achievements in its development and made historic changes, and the Chinese nation has embarked on a great leap from standing up and being rich to being strong, closer than ever before to the great goal of national renewal.
This path of development in China will increasingly show bright development prospects as the times progress.

The median price of RMB, measured by the routing, is in the vicinity of $7.0883, with a countercyclical effect of 460 points.
Reuters calculated the renminbi exchange rate as published by the China Foreign Exchange Exchange Centre (CFETS), which is expected to be around 7.0883 yuan on Friday against the United States dollar, with a devaluation of about 154 points from the previous day.
The last Yen to the United States dollar received an immediate return of $7.1315, while the median price was $7.0729.
According to the pricing mechanism, today's intermediate price movements have a 586-point decline reflecting the effects of market demand and supply, while a further 27-point decline reflects the points required for the overnight basket of exchange rates to remain essentially unchanged; and a 460-point increase reflecting the effects of the “reverse cycle factor”.
The median value of the last Yen to the United States dollar, measured by the Reuters, is 7.0947 yuan, with an actual deviation of 218 points from the published value of the Exchange Centre.
The last pass is measured on the basis of the average price published by CFEDS, the renminbi exchange rate CFEDS index, the reference SDR (special drawing rights) basket index and the reference BIS (Bank for International Settlements) basket index of 91.26, 91.46 and 94.92, respectively.
China's first high-rise building, Tianjin Zhou Dafu, was completed, with over 100 national patents.
The completion of the financial centre in Tianjin, China’s first high-rise building, Zhou Dafu, in the afternoon of 26, marked the success of the building information model, the coordinated management platform of the high-precision BIM model, in the construction of the skyscraper building, which was developed by the project department of China’s eight station, Tianjin Zhou Dafu Financial Centre.
The financial centre of Tianjin Zhou Dafu, located within the economic and technological development zone of Tianjin City, will have a total construction area of 390,000 square metres, 4 floors underground, 100 floors above ground level, 530 metres high, covering level A offices, luxury apartments, over five stars, etc., and will form an important part of Tianjin ' s international landmark complex.
According to the director of the project department of the eight Chinese financial centres in Tianjin Zhou Dafu, the total amount of the project was over 70,000 tons of steel, approximately 376,000 metres of welding by high-altitude groups equal to 42.5 Everest heights, 40 circles around the Earth using welders, 42,000 pieces of steel, and more than 50 per cent of non-platforms, including the two-barred elliptical poles with the world ' s most unipolar angle of 90 degrees.
The complexity of the steel structure and the difficulty of processing is unprecedented.
According to industry sources, the financial centre of Tianjin Zhou Dafu has taken the lead in implementing all aspects of building information model (BIM) management in the skyscrapers built or built throughout the country.
The innovative introduction and successful implementation of the “three-in-one BIM application” model, which was implemented throughout the process, developed a platform for synergistic management based on the high-precision BIM model.
The Officer-in-Charge indicated that, during the construction of Zhou Dafu, the project department had first set up BIM in a virtual world, which had been scientifically verified before physical work had been carried out, thereby eliminating problems that might arise in the construction of previous construction projects and eliminating them.
In 2017, the BIM innovation of the Zhou Dafu Financial Centre project won the first award of the Global Award for Excellence in Engineering Industry at the Global Masters Pool and the Global Award for Excellence in Engineering Industry 2017.

According to the Taiwanese scholar, "The Age of Uncertainty" Thai firms need to follow the mainland to develop the mainstream industry.
The 2019 Business Forum on Innovative Business Models26 was held in Taipei for two days in a row.
The event invited a number of participants and academics to share their experiences on business transformation, innovation, succession and markets.
The forum was organized by the Taipei Institute of Business Management and co-sponsored by organizations such as the Group of Gains, the Distinguished Continental Federation of Business Associations and others.
The two-day meetings were organized in consecutive workshops, in which more than 100 participants participated, in the form of a transition promotion model and business strategy.
Chen Myung-chul, Director of the Taipei Institute of Business Management, stated that trade friction between the United States (in mainland China) continued and that the Thai business faced a “era of uncertainty”.
In his view, there was a need to keep pace with the development of mainstream industries on the continent, with particular attention to innovative products related to science and technology, culture, tourism and health.
“In the past, the importance of quality, effectiveness and delivery was emphasized. It's not like we're going anywhere.
In Chen ' s view, the only conditions described above are no longer sufficient at this time.
He suggested that it was more important for business enterprises to combine speed and services, to speed up supply chains, and to focus on extension and livelihood services.
In addition, “value added to services” is a new area where the industry can flourish.
In a statement by the representative of the Taishu commercials, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Taishu company Aumu Electronics Ltd. from Guangdong explained that Aumu electronics had experienced difficulties in operating because of the collapse of the purchase order, and that the group had sought to improve its operations in a number of directions, including restructuring, activation of assets, etc.
It took three years for enterprises to collect traditional electrical appliances, transform electronics for vehicles, and advance into the Intelligent Power Company.
For its part, the General Manager of Sun god (Zhui Sea) Electronics Co. Ltd. Paek Hong Zheng suggested that if it was difficult to develop new customers, it would be better to provide a “one stop” service for focal points.
In addition to the six-pronged factors of poor service, high price, low quality, slow delivery, low variety and good faith, a customer can become an irreplaceable supplier to the customer by addressing these six points, together with timely re-engineering of production lines and expansion of product lines.
The award ceremony for the 2019 Distinguished Continental Taiping Corporation Award, also hosted by the Taipei Institute for Business Management, was held in Taipei on 27 January.

New regulations for consultation: Qualification of social capital for rural land ownership
Qualification of social capital for rural land ownership
The Rural Land Management Scheme is open to comment.
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs website published a public consultation notice on the Rural Land Management Scheme (revised draft for comments) (hereinafter referred to as the Opinion), which increased the regulation and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital flows, such as business enterprises, to land ownership.
The draft opinion is now open to public consultation.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, in order to implement the newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act, to further consolidate and improve the basic rural business system, to deepen the reform of the rural land system, and to implement the “triple-ownership” system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has revised the Rural Land Contracting and Transfer Management Scheme, resulting in a draft opinion.
The Beijing Youth Reporter learned of several important changes to the draft opinion first published.
The newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act, which defines the scope of land transfers, introduces the concept of “triple power-sharing” with separate sections on “land contracting rights” and “land management rights”, and makes a clear distinction between land contracting rights transfer, swaps and land transfer rights (rent, subcontract, shareholding or other).
In this Draft Opinion, in order to implement the concept of “triple power sharing”, to respond effectively to the main thrust of the reform of the Rural Land Contracting Act and to take into account the wide differences in the transfer of land ownership and the transfer of rights to land contracting, in terms of parties, procedures, regulations, etc., this revision defines the scope of the transfer, focusing on the transfer of rights to land, including through leasing, equity, etc., by changing the name of the regulation from the Rural Land Contracting and Management Scheme to the Rural Land Management Transfer Scheme.
The transfer and swap of land contracting rights will be regulated separately.
According to the draft opinion, in the context of the “triple power sharing”, farmers are only entitled to a limited period of land ownership.
Theoretically, even in the event of liquidation, farmers risk losing their business rights for a certain period of time, and thus providing for the return of the place of contract to the original contractor is no longer legally necessary and is in conflict with the Insolvency Act.
In response to farmers ' risk of land loss, methods such as preferential shares, rentals and buy-backs have emerged in practice.
Taking into account that priority shares are more well developed theoretically explored in corporate law, they are recommended as advocacy provisions to protect against the risk of stock loss.
