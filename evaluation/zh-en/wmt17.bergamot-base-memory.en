28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who has just moved to San Francisco was found dead this week in a stairwell at a local mall.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't think of anyone who wanted to harm him, adding that "it's all finally getting better."
The San Francisco coroner’s office said the body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was found to have killed him and was investigating.
The victim’s older brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s San Francisco radio station, KGO, that Frank, who had previously worked as an assembly line chef in Boston, had found an ideal job for an assembly line chef at San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were “very shocked” by Frank’s death.
The spokesperson said, “We are a small team that lives together like a close family, and we will miss him deeply.”
On this sad occasion, we express our deep sympathy and condolences to Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank first lived in a guest house, but recently “everything is finally getting better.”
Louis Galicia told KGO: "Frank found an apartment and was in a relationship with a girl at the same time."
Louis Galicia said he couldn’t think of anyone who would want to harm his brother.
Frank had a good heart and a broad heart.
According to Louis Galicia, “Frank often cooks dinner for his family.”
He never wanted to argue with his family.
He is a man who follows everyone’s opinion.
Louis Galicia said, “Everything in the world can go wrong, but Frank is a man who shines every day.”
For those with a clue, please call the San Francisco Police Department to report 415-575-4444.
Junior doctors strike: call for new labour action
The junior doctor’s representative called on the Union to approve its new labour action in response to the new contract dispute.
The British Medical Association’s Junior Doctors’ Council will ask all of its members to support more labour initiatives since early September.
The Junior Doctors Committee said the ministers had not addressed their concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical scientists voted in July to boycott a contract deal with the British Medical Association.
Of the members who participated in the vote, 58% opposed the contract transaction.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Doctors Committee, said in a letter to members posted on Twitter late Thursday that the government had “consistently remained silent” about the issue that led to a boycott of the contract.
“In view of this, the Executive Committee of the Junior Doctors Committee has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and has called for a new formal consultation on all concerns.”
In response to the government’s silence, the Executive Committee of the Committee of Primary Physicians has today formally requested a special session of the Council of British Medical Associations to approve a long-term plan to escalate labour from early September.
The dispute has led to six strikes by junior doctors this year, including the first full-scale strike in the history of the UK’s National Health Service.
Dr Johann Malawana, leader of junior doctors at the British Medical Association, resigned after the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the British Medical Association were boycotted by the vote.
At a meeting before the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students, he told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should therefore be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be enforced among English medical staff.
Russia and Turkey: "Unin alliance"?
A gesture to end a crisis.
Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday, shaking hands and announcing the official end of an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish president in the golden hall of a palace in St. Petersburg, I had a strong feeling that this reconciliation was what Ankara most wanted to see.
Yes, the two really shook hands.
However, even by Mr. Putin’s always-bound standards, Putin is only smiling and barely showing enthusiasm.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan reportedly referred to “good friend” Putin five times.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised to return to pre-crisis levels, or even higher levels, of relations with Russia.
The next day, a newspaper wrote that Mr. Erdogan was acting as if nothing had happened.
But, I think his enthusiasm suggests something the opposite.
However, Mr. Putin’s persistent cold attitude shows that he has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s response was intense.
Mr. Putin lashed out at the incident, accusing Ankara of counting Moscow behind his back.
Attacks from so-called friends are more difficult to accept.
It is difficult, if not impossible, for both sides to re-establish true trust.
Since November, Russian public opinion has also reversed.
For months, government-controlled media have carried out a shocking full-force attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden, the Turks seemed to be responsible for everything.
The worst of these came from accusations from senior officials that Mr Erdogan’s family profited from illegal oil deals in the so-called Islamic State-controlled region of Syria.
He has categorically denied this claim.
However, news from St. Petersburg shows that it is time to look ahead.
After all, the premise of this meeting is that Putin receives an apology from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Russia can claim victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are clear.
First, Erdogan was almost ousted after a failed coup last month, so he needs the support of all his friends.
It is clear that the ongoing terrorist attacks have hit him hard.
There are also economic motivations.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially by banning charter services that can transport millions of Russian tourists to Turkish shores each year.
The figure has dropped by nearly 90%.
With the resumption of flights, Russian travel agencies and charter companies will surely breathe a sigh of relief.
They will usher in the end-of-season Mediterranean tourism boom.
State television even predicted this week that the price of fruits and vegetables would fall once Turkish agricultural imports were re-opened.
A report in the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti said: "The tourists went, the tomatoes came back."
For Moscow, the visit also has additional political value.
Ankara is angry at the Western world’s weak reaction to the intent to take over.
In addition, Ankara is unhappy with the slow progress in EU negotiations and Putin’s long-term involvement, which is keen to exploit political chills and weaken Turkey’s relations with the Western world.
By espousing the elected authorities after the defeat of the coup, the Russian leader will surely receive additional points from Ankara.
Note that this is a gift to Moscow, which has always been deeply rooted in the fear of regime change.
As a result, the meeting at this magnificent seaside palace has led Russia to form an ally with two countries in the Western world that the Western world has refused to engage with abuse, with one analyst describing it as “out of the league.”
However, despite the open reconciliation, major differences remain between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors. Moscow has recently played the role of a peacekeeper in Syria, while Russia and Turkey support the opposite faction.
It is foreseeable that after nearly three hours of initial talk, the two presidents said at the press conference that they had not yet touched on the topic.
The Turkish president deliberately sidestepped the issue of differences between the two sides, while Putin stressed it.
The two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to find common ground on the Syrian issue.
With the possibility of months of open hostility and major disasters caused by the shooting down of Russian warplanes by North Atlantic Treaty Organization member Turkey, the two leaders are certainly a good thing to restart dialogue again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside of Scotland
According to the Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank will be reduced to a logistics unit.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve clients outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand was committed to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago, when it was closed down, I had to accept the bailout and have given up that pursuit since then.
During that time, brand strategists used ‘RBS’ to protect other consumer finance brands.
The Group has spent millions of pounds to sponsor international sporting events in the same way as the Rugby Six and Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right thing to do is to make more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to customers in Scotland, but will not revert to the same.
In England and Wales, all references outside the headquarters and stock exchanges will be changed to National Westminster Bank.
The Ulster Bank brand has been used by customers in the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Community.
There are other, more prominent smaller private banking brands, such as Capital Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEune was interviewed during a visit to Inverness County clients and employees.
He told the BBC Scotland: “The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and one of the employee-employed brands, as we have now become a bank with a large number of brands in a larger sense.”
As the bank itself became an international brand, RBS also became a global brand.
At the moment, I would say that we are no longer focused on the world, and we have turned our attention to home.
Each brand represents a difference in their industry, and our employees serve their customers through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championship; at the same time, it has worked to raise the profile of different brands sponsoring sports events.
“Now is the time to become a multi-brand bank, because in private we’ve been exploring how to be a better bank for our customers,” the CEO said.
If three years ago we were determined to become a big bank with many brands, we would have been ridiculed.
We are currently focusing on our customers’ needs, and I’m sure you’ve noticed these changes.
I think we can reboot these brands, and now the time is right.
Daturi wins 3,000 career with Predilection in Newmarket
Two wins in Newmarket helped Telluri win a career of 3,000, after which he sprayed champagne to celebrate.
On Friday, professional horse jockey Frankie Dettori scored his 3,000th victory at Newmarket.
He worked on the horse-training master John Gosden's Predilection on the horseway, which achieved two victories that night, and also achieved a career of 3,000 victories.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional horse jockey to reach this milestone in the field of flatland racing.
The top five are: Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Dai Turi, who had previously won at Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
I was very excited because my family was there too.
I’m happy with what I’ve achieved in Newmarket, because I started here 30 years ago.
It’s not a massive horse race, it’s not the Royal Ascot, it’s just a regular Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I am very happy and humble.
Dai Tuli brought Predilection after winning, causing cheers for the whole scene.
In the field of steeplechacks, two jockeys achieved this achievement, namely, champion jockey Richard Johnson and now retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, in which Sir McCoy achieved more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Berg is a nine-time German champion with 4,493 wins in his career.
Dietli is one of the best jockeys of our time, so it’s no surprise that he achieved this milestone, not many before him.
He is fashionable and healthy, but what really makes him stand out in the weighing room is his tactical rationality.
He was an amazing equestrian ambassador who, over the years, attracted a large number of fans of the sport with his passion and charm.
A few weeks ago, I told Dai Turi in Epsom that if he wasn’t just a weekend with a big jockey, he would have been able to get 6,000 wins!
To be serious, Daturi is arguably the best equestrian winner in Britain in three decades, and that’s all too important.
He was lively, which was a good thing for English horse racing, but beyond that he was an incredible jockey.
Daturi celebrates this milestone with his iconic jump dismount
From jumping to jumping off the horse, Daturi has been a typical representative of the British field of flatlanding for two decades.
His career was like a roller coaster.
He won several major tournaments, including his famous "seven-game winning streak" at the Royal Esco Jockey Club in 1996, but he also suffered a crash and was banned for taking the doping.
Three years ago, when he returned to the game after the six-month ban, he was very difficult. However, he showed a surprising personality advantage and finally returned to the top, giving the skeptical people the first time.
He may not be able to do it for too long – Dai Tulli has said before that he hopes to compete at least until he is 50 years old.
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismisses Sergei Ivanov as chief of staff
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov as chief of staff.
For many years, Mr. Ivanov has been a part of a core group that has the confidence of Mr. Putin.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed as a special representative for environmental and transportation issues.
A Kremlin statement said Mr Putin had “declared the dismissal of Ivanov’s chief of staff to the president of Russia,” but gave no reason.
Anton Vaino, who began his role as Mr. Ivanov's deputy in 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he managed the presidential bill and government employees, as the Kremlin website (in Russian) said.
After his appointment, he said to Mr. Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important task of this Government is to support the head of state in drafting laws and control directives.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself had asked for his resignation and had recommended Mr. Vaino to take over.
Is that smile convincing?
Moscow is puzzled by this move.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin’s closest aides, working with the Soviet Security Service (KGB), like Putin.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
At a meeting with President Vladimir Putin aired on state television, both said the chief of staff himself had called for his resignation.
Despite a smile in front of the camera, few people are convinced – especially at this time before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this due to a defeat in some kind of power struggle?
Not yet known.
But the official narrative — a candidate once seen as a presidential candidate who suddenly chose to run Russia’s environmental policy — has raised many doubts.
The Kremlin website quoted Mr. Ivanov's conversation with Mr. Putin, who said: "Yes, in early 2012, I asked you in a conversation to give me this difficult position, even a difficult position, a four-year term."
"As a result, I have been the President's Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Mr. Ivanov assumed this position in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, a former member of the National Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin became director of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly known as the National Security Service), Mr. Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
After Mr. Putin came to power, he appointed Mr. Ivanov one of his five most trusted men.
At one point, it was thought that Mr. Ivanov might become the president of Russia after Mr. Putin’s second term, because three consecutive terms were unconstitutional.
But the position ultimately belongs to Dmitry Medvedev, another of Putin’s close aides.
Before re-serving the presidency after three and a half years, Mr. Putin served as Prime Minister of Russia.
Mysterious Fish Surprises Banff a Garden
One of Banff’s residents found a fish in his garden and asked for help.
Kevin Bain believes that the 75 fish may have been shaved by a sea tornado.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the strange scene on Periscope, hoping someone could explain why the two-inch-long fish appeared.
The Queensfield Bridge is now accessible to Fav.
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the North Bridge and the viaduct of the Queensferry Crossing, which is now available to Fave.
Helong, a four-way “bridge-faced fan” located near three bridgeheads of each bridge, is now close to completion, and the project is the first Helong bridge.
The bridge, which started in Faf, is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 metric tons.
It used 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 slanted lassos.
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the scene today and became one of the first to climb the bridge.
"This is a historic moment in the construction of the Queens Ferry Bridge."
We have all witnessed the work on such an ambitious project, using more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel in this section of the bridge alone.
Although the size and weight of the bridge are huge, the completion of the joint between the viaduct and the bridge deck requires fine work and very accurate assembly.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now installed, and the last section of the concrete bridge deck is poured in Rosyth today, which means that all the bridge decks are ready to be put in place.
Michael Martin, project director of the Kuns Ferri Bridge Construction Company, said: "No matter which bridge project, the first Helong is a major milestone."
In terms of this remarkable project, this time Helong shows the cutting-edge civil engineering technology.
After installing the last section of the road panel and connecting it to the expanded North Bridge Fort Road panel, it is then necessary to complete the remaining gap joint dragon on the north side or close to the land side.
To complete this operation, it is necessary to move the northern elevated bridge to the south by 700 mm.
This is a huge operation, but also a very sophisticated operation.
It is said to be huge because the viaduct is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 metric tons, and needs to pull out a slope of about 3%.
It is precise because the engineering team needs to make sure that the deviation is very small, only a few millimeters per side.
It is good to say that everything is going well.
Simon Byers won the women's gymnastics all-around champion.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is not affected by this.
It is full of energy when jumping.
Balance the wood upstream edge is more than enough.
Free gymnastics is amazing.
The overall performance was great.
He has finally become an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the all-around title on Thursday, fully demonstrating her talent for leading the world in gymnastics on the Olympic field.
She scored 62.198 overalls far more than the silver medalist, Final Five player Aly Raisman and bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simon Byers from the United States performed a balance wood performance at the women's individual all-around final of the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byers helped the U.S. team achieve four consecutive crowns in the Olympic Games women's gymnastics individual all-around, and she personally won a total of five medals at the Olympic Games, further confirming that she is the generation, and may also be the best gymnast ever.
The moment she saw her total score, Byers couldn't help but shed tears. She finally ended the long journey.
Byers, who have been among the “once-in-a-decades” like Michael Phelps, have taken their respective sports to new heights:
Byers has dominated the field for the last three years, winning a total of 15 World Championship medals, including ten gold medals. She trained hard every day to achieve greater precision. 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said: "Byers is the best gymnast I have ever seen."
There was still a last race in Brazil, but the match was not so much a competition between Byers and other gymnasts, but rather a contest between herself and the pressure of great expectation.
If Byers does not return to her home in Spring, Texas, with a full gold medal, everyone will be very disappointed.
Simon Byers (left) and Lesman hug each other, winning gold and silver medals in the women’s individual all-around finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August.
Byers won his first gold medal on Tuesday, offering a surprise tribute to retiring national team coach Martha Karolyi.
Although Byers insists that he does not plan for the future in the perennial occupation of the championship, this is not the case.
A section of Byers’ free gymnastics—including her signature churning-up, was accompanied by Latin music, which she often listened to in a place just a street away from the Rio Olympic venues.
This is no coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a baby and discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman during a field trip to the gym, has now grown into a backbone.
Since the summer of 2013, Byers has not missed a game in the all-around, as long as she wants to win, she will win.
A slight lead after two spins by Mustafa was just an illusion.
The defending world champion of the two projects of Balancing Wood and Free Gymnastics, Byers, is in wait.
Her balance wood scored 15.433 and free gymnastics with 15.933.
While waiting for the final score to come out, Lesman held Byers lightly. When Byers learned that he had achieved his dream results, he burst into tears.
Leisman’s performance was a bit of a revenge against four years ago, when she tied for third, but lost to Mustafina in the tiebreaker.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, who was nicknamed "Grandma" by the Americans, was far ahead.
She flew to the crowd after the end of free gymnastics and announced her return, but such a return sometimes seemed to be in doubt.
Byers is only 19 years old. Since earlier this week, the news has spread virally on Twitter. As far as Byers is concerned, his life has been given a new meaning.
Mahaj Brown, 6, survived the Philadelphia shooting.
Police said a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old in the city to be shot this week.
The children’s grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child was shot by Mahaj Brown.
They said there were multiple gunshot wounds to Brown’s groin, legs, arms and abdomen, but the child was awake on the way to the hospital.
“He suffered a lot of crimes, and his little body was bruised by bullets,” his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the television station.
I couldn't believe it.
The boy was in a critical condition in the hospital and had undergone several surgeries.
His family told television that the child was expected to recover.
He was about to start a local primary school in the first grade.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Of the other three people who were shot, two were 29 and one was 32.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims was in critical condition, and the other two were in stable condition.
The TV station said the child and the 29-year-old victim were found in the front seat of the car.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether among the injured were the gunmen.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like multiple gunmen had exchanged fire.
A number of assault weapons were found at the scene, which inferred that they were using different assault weapons.
In this case, this is undoubtedly a continuous war.
There are bullet cusps on the sidewalks on both sides of the street.
“So, as a result, there were several armed men at the scene who were in a state of intense fighting,” Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told television.
Many houses and vehicles were damaged in the area.
Arrests have not yet been carried out, and the police are said to be watching surveillance video.
On Tuesday, a six-year-old (girl) was also ejected in the arm while playing on the doorstep of the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is currently recovering and police are still hunting the suspect.
Why we need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie
That’s how I rated this year’s women’s Olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First, I went to every Summer Olympics since 1984, but the United States has never been the dominant player.
Second, the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnasts—Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren Laurie Hernandez—who have always inspired girls of color.
The composition of the team is very proud of everyone, because it includes the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
The team finally looked like the U.S. team.
It also cemented the pinnacle of the sport for black and Latino women.
For the past four years, the leading female gymnast has been African American.
Last year, Simon and Gableier were ranked first and second.
This is too great.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabriel Douglas "unexpectedly" became an Olympic champion, which made the United States cheer.
Today, the world can witness the remarkable performance of three-time world champions Simon Byers, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez. They have deduced conventional gymnastics techniques.
On Thursday, Simon helped the U.S. team achieve four consecutive titles in the women’s individual all-around program.
Her teammate Ali Lesman won the silver medal.
We reached the top of the sport, but that wasn’t the case in the National Gymnastics classroom.
Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie have the same access to the Olympic team as Ali and Madison.
They are the Final Five, as the next Olympic gymnastics team will consist of four gymnasts, the last year Marta Karolyi has coached.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly sport, gymnastics players are mainly trained in private gymnastics clubs, and their parents need to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotels (including the costs associated with coaches and gymnasts and family), and the list of fees is increasing.
Most gymnastics clubs are located in the affluent suburbs that can support the industry.
All the training of gymnasts is done at these clubs, which is a long-term and expensive expense for the gymnast's family.
Byers coach Aimee Boorman and Hernandez's coach, Maggie Haney, have coached the two gymnasts since they began practicing gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to countless young girls who are influenced by Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie.
Twenty years ago, I founded my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we offer free, inexpensive gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic) in black neighborhoods, and to produce national and even world champions.
In September, we will expand into Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and who will benefit from this amazing Olympic sport.
Gymnastics helps to cultivate the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, and also helps to cultivate hard-working spirit, self-discipline and determination.
These can bring lifelong benefits to a person’s health, academic and work success.
Inspired by this team, it’s really great that thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics.
Participation in sports is significant, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabriel and Madison for their “girls’ strength” in winning the Olympic team gold medal, and for inspiring so many young girls of all backgrounds to open the way to health, strength and success.
After dismissing Jeremy Hunt's proposal, junior doctors plan to launch further strike
Ministers initially hoped to end the change-induced dispute by accepting a revised contract from a British Medical Association (BMA) official, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who voted against the contract.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose a contract, saying the NHS was currently in a “vacuum zone” and that a slight delay would harm employees and patients.
The new contract begins by referring to the modification of the practice of primary doctors working all-night and weekend work to improve care during non-working hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Junior Doctors Committee, said in a statement: “Junior doctors remain serious about the proposed contract, especially as it exacerbates the current labor crisis and fails to treat all doctors fairly.”
With only eight weeks left to sign the new contract with the first doctors, we need to make progress and there’s not much time left.
The BMA works to resolve disputes through negotiations, but people are reluctant to participate, and sometimes the government responds with silence.
Still, just last month we got the promise of Jeremy Hunt, who said his door was always open.
“Jeremy Hunt needs to act now to remove enforcement and address the concerns of junior doctors.”
If he doesn’t, junior doctors have made it clear that they are ready for further labor action.
The last strike, which took place at the end of April, resulted in the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants covered the picket line for doctors.
Ministers initially hoped to end the dispute over the change by accepting the BMA’s revised contract.
The BMA wants to fight for better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors covered by the contract.
NHS Employers CEO Daniel Mortimer has called on junior doctors to stop any further strikes.
Mr. Mortimer said: “Labour actions have had little success, but on the contrary, they will put pressure on already devoted teams and services, leading to concerns, worries and confusion among patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have been in constant negotiations with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other departments, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and the whistleblowers.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics – such as deployment, flexibility in training, other training for those who re-inscree after career disruptions, training costs, shared perceptions of the curriculum, continuing studies and gender pay differences in health care, which illustrate the importance employers have attached to the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
£2 a day of medication reduces the threat of heart attack
Officials are proposing to promote a £2-a-day drug to more patients and prolong medication, after which thousands of heart patients will benefit from the drug.
The anticoagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease.
The drug, which lasts for 12 months after a heart attack, can reduce the risk of another stroke or heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE), the NHS’s watchdog, recommends that patients continue to take medication for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now, NHS regulator NICE has recommended giving patients a lasting four-year medication to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people develop heart disease each year, and a quarter of them continue to suffer a recurrence of heart disease or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by plaques formed by the deposition of fatty substances in the walls of the arteries.
If the plaque is disconnected, it will cause blood clots, which in turn hinder the blood from flowing into the heart and lead to a heart attack.
If the blood clot moves, it will enter the blood flow, hindering the blood from flowing into the brain, causing a stroke.
In patients who have experienced a heart attack, the risk of another heart attack is higher.
Manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca, Tikagre is marketed under the name Brilique and can reduce the risk of developing the disease by reducing the formation of blood clots.
The draft NICE guidance released today recommends that patients take 90 mg of ticagre for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of ticagre and two aspirins per day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: “Despite effective secondary preventive treatment, as many as a quarter of patients who have a history of heart attack have a recurrence or stroke, often with serious consequences.
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence suggests that taking ticagre with aspirin can be effective in reducing the risk of heart disease recurrence and stroke in those who have experienced a heart attack.
We are pleased that the temporary recommendation of Ticagre will provide more treatment options for thousands of people who have benefited.
Due to limited information about the efficacy and safety of ticagray after three years, especially the risk of bleeding, the draft guidance does not recommend that it be continued to be treated after this period.
Computer culture makes ‘election fraud’ prevalent in Muslim areas
Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was sacked last year for corruption, prompting the publication of a government report.
The culture of “political correctness” has blinded the widespread electoral fraud in the Muslim community, as the lethal government report reveals today.
Former Cabinet Secretary Sir Eric Pickles has accused police, election regulators and town hall of turning a blind eye to evidence of abuse of elections because of “excessive sensitivity to ethnic divisions and religious issues.”
The former community minister and current anti-corruption chief said that the practice of intimidating voters with religious positions has a bad impact, and the police should be allowed to set up a cordon outside the polling station to protect the terrified voters.
He advised voters to carry identity documents when they cast their ballots to confirm their identities.
Currently, voters only need to report their names and addresses.
The report even suggested applying incoke to voters’ fingers that could not be erased to prevent someone from voting twice.
Sir Eric said the protection of whistleblowers should be increased.
He called for increased media access to parliamentary documents and the means by which decisions taken by non-official committees or working groups were made.
“It’s not just about preventing election fraud, it’s about protecting local governments from a broad culture of corruption and financial fraud that is closely linked to it,” he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral tribunal ruled that the mayor of Rahman should be dismissed for a series of corruption and offences.
The court found that Rahman "extremely irritably abused" the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and kept silent about the sword's allegations of racial discrimination and Islamophobia.
It is said that Rahman “declared in his campaign that it was a religious duty to vote for him as a loyal Muslim”.
As many as 300 ballots are in doubt, and it may be that voters faked the votes of others.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of electoral fraud across the country.
He warned in particular of mail-in election fraud, with senior members of the Muslim community reportedly putting pressure on voters to vote for their designated candidates.
Sir Eric (in the photo) has given several suggestions for clearing the voting mechanism, including with a good identification document to confirm his identity.
“The evidence shows that senior members, especially those in Pakistan and Bangladeshi background communities, put pressure on vulnerable groups in some minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote as they wish,” he said in the report.
“Because of their excessive sensitivity to racial division and religious ‘political correctness’, they fear that state institutions will turn a blind eye to such behavior.”
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the election mechanism, including a ban on political activists processing postal voting documents to stop the "vote harvest".
The report also called for strict registration information to prevent the electoral roll from being used for immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa May is also considering the report.
These recommendations include requiring voters to show identity documents before voting.
After the vote, the ink that cannot be erased on the voter's finger is applied to prevent someone from voting twice.
Systematic verification of the ethnic affiliation of voters to ensure eligibility for voting.
The validity period for automatic mail-in voting requests is set at three years.
Political activists and activists are prohibited from handling completed postal voting and postal voting envelopes.
Police are authorized to set up a cordon around the polling station.
The amendment of the provisions of the law made it easier to charge the person with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
It is illegal to take photos at polling stations.
It is stipulated that only English can be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff strictly implement the "voters go to the voting hall alone" regulations.
Sir Eric lambasted the Metropolitan Police, saying they had made no criminal charges in the wake of the Tower Hamlets, which was “surprising”.
“Rahman and his election officers had a lot of corruption and illegality, and were therefore disqualified from the electoral court,” he said.
According to the criminal proof standard, he is in no doubt guilty in many ways.
He also criticized the virtual "check box inspection" of the election registration department of the city hall.
Sir Eric said: “Last year the court’s decision on Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call for everyone.”
Our country has a glorious tradition of “mother of parliament”, but some institutions have secretly secretly relied on electoral fraud and the subsequent rejoicing of real concern and threaten this good reputation.
The Rio Olympics are popular for their bikers, like Princess Kate's, and other famous players who have hit their faces.
This week, French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevot, who looked like Princess Kate at the 2016 Rio Olympics, was sought after by spectators.
But the 24-year-old is not the only gold contender for a face-to-face celebrity at the Summer Olympics, at least not on social media.
So to honor the Rio Olympics with all the celebrity faces that appeared on the screen at the time, FEMAIL put together a list of Olympic players who hit the face of a Hollywood star.
Hunter and Wolf: American man archer Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the riders who hit Kate on the bicycle track, many netizens soon found that an archer was the twin brother of Leonardo DiCaprio.
Since his photo, which resembles the styling of the Wolf of Wall Street, has been on Twitter, American man archer Brady Ellison has caused a huge uproar on social media.
In fact, the archer perceived the hype on social media and admitted to playing small, some people said they looked like a little plum.
“I don’t think it looks very alike, except for the beard,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome playboy, so I think that's what I'm saying."
One of the most popular comparisons at the 2012 London Olympics will no doubt find more similarities this year: British long jumper Greg Rutherford looks like the famous actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with a pair of big talking eyes, is accused of resembled the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
For years, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee starring Matthew Morrison.
Dress Up: The user thought Nathan Adrian was the “sports version” of the Inception actor.
Another pair of olders were compared to tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who had strong eyebrows and lips that looked similar.
The silver-winning Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova and actor Annalynne McCord have the same bronze skin and blonde hair, while Ni Jiajun of the United States is likened by fans to "the sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
Women: Football star Hope Solo (left) and "Dexter" actor Jennifer Carpenter (right) with similar faces and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was happy to find that others saw the similarities too.
Communication theory: According to the user, this pair may look like a reason.
One Twitter user recently happily declared online that “other netizens also believe that Hop Soro and Jennifer Carpenter actually look exactly the same.”
Indeed, the American football star and the protagonist of "Blood-hobly Forensics" have a very similar face and eyes.
Other popular contrasts include Kerry Walsh Jennings, who has a smile almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose beautiful and brilliant smile is the same as the smile of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologises for comments of Chinese swimmers 'as slow as pigs'
On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald angered viewers who watched the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) live broadcast of the Olympics.
A commentator for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "swim faster than the stink" during the competition, and finally "slower like a pig", and then CBC was forced to apologize.
Narrator Byron Macdonald gave some of his opinion at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final, when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
The audience heard Byron, a commenter on the CBC narrator team wearing “colored glasses,” said: “The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake.”
Because it was so excited, he started swimming faster than the stink, but then it was as slow as a pig.
I really lose her.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanyan swims the second best, taking 1:57.79 – 1.61 seconds behind Canada’s Taylor Ruck, which in turn narrowed the gap with China.
The entire Canadian audience was struck by the nexter’s tone and wording, and they quickly reacted online.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “The CBC commentator said that China’s 14-year-old swimmer was ‘slow as a pig’?”
This idiot didn’t realize it was on the live broadcast.
Chinese junior general Ai Yanyan, who participated in the final of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay, was described as follows: "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
Criticism of Byron Macdonald on Twitter quickly hit Twitter, and many asked for his exit.
When Twitter users heard that Byron MacDonald was unresponsive, they didn’t stop there.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wow #Byron MacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and your words and actions make us all sound like a bunch of racists. ##
Shortly after, CBC radio host Scott Russel apologized for Byron's comments live, saying: "We apologize for the comments of the live swimmers."
“We are sorry to see this untimely wording.”
CBC apologizes more than 90 times to Twitter users who responded to the remarks
Another commentator, Scott Russel, also apologized on behalf of Byron.
CBC later copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who protested Byron's explanation.
The channel also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We are very sorry to say something like this and broadcast it live.
Last night, we moved quickly to apologize to the audience who watched our live broadcasts and the viewers who followed us on social media.
It should be noted that Byron's commentary is aimed at the swimmer's performance, but not for her personal.
That said, the wording is really inappropriate, and Byron is deeply sorry about that.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized on the live broadcast, saying that his words did not mean a little personal attack, and tried to absolve himself of his words.
“I want to take the time to apologize for what I said last night after the women’s relay,” he said on the CBC Olympics.
"I'm just commenting on the swimmers' performance, not the individuals."
"Of course, I don't mean disrespect, I'm sorry."
Primark customers express anger at a woman who has the shameless trial of underwear in the middle of the store
A woman undressed for underwear in the middle of a Primark store, and the customer in the store did not know where to look.
To make matters worse, she also looked at what she looked like when she put it on, and then took off her underwear and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves and eventually tried on four panties inside the store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The woman was constantly trying on her underwear at the Primark shop at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone before putting it back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson, who was also in the store at the time, said that after trying on her underwear, the mysterious woman “dressed again and walked out of the store and bought nothing.”
She said, "Everyone can't believe what they're seeing."
She stood in the middle of the store, took a pair of underwear from the shelves, took off her leggings and underwear, and put it on like this.
"She didn't try to find a hidden place to try on it - she just stood there, it was brazen."
"When she took her underwear off again, everyone was stunned. Obviously, she was still not satisfied, because she put the underwear back on the shelf."
After that, she tried three times like this, and finally found that it was not what she liked, and then dressed again and went out of the store.
“She didn’t seem to care if someone was looking at her — or who would end up buying the panties she tried to wear.”
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "It's disgusting to think that someone else would buy the underwear that someone else had worn and had not been washed."
This happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “After she left, the clerk obviously had to take off the underwear, and fortunately.”
“I hate buying a new pair of underwear home, but I find another woman trying to pass through and not being cleaned.”
A spokesman for Primark said: “Primark is aware of what happened in our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9th.”
All problematic goods have been removed.
How to use maga to protect yourself in a gun attack
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com may give you a little sense of security.
We asked Rhon Mizrachi, a master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, to learn how to deal with the perpetrators of the gun in close proximity.
Whether it’s from the front or behind you, the video will teach you how to turn the win.
Mizrachi said that if the gunman approaches you from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and “clear the line of fire.”
Then, clamp the gun with your forearm and shoulders, and then hit the attacker in the face with your elbow.
Next, with his knees to his groin, when the attacker bent down with pain, turned the gun in his hand, hit him in the face with the barrel and the back-up gun, keeping the weapon all the way to him.
If the gunman approaches from the front, use similar techniques – keep your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist the muzzle so the gunman can’t fire.
In the meantime, weigh the weight against the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, and turn the muzzle from the hand he gripped, then point the gun at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Check out the video to see what Mizrachi does.
But remember, if you’re not a maga master, the safest way to get rid of a robbery is to hand over the cash.
A rogue family destroys low-cost rentals in Saltash, Cornwall, before being deported
A rogue family who was evicted for terrorizing their neighbours has damaged the low-rent housing they live in before leaving, costing £50,000.
After a long list of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, were evicted from a low-cost rental in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being forcibly removed from the residence, housing association officials were surprised to find that it had been severely damaged.
There were holes in the walls, the floors were ripped, the garbage was thrown all over the floor, and the walls were smeared.
The family has been moving since being evicted and is said to be living in a private home.
Donna McEvoy, home manager at the Cornwall Housing Association, said she was concerned the house was not saved.
“It’s a nightmare for the people who live here, and I don’t think people can live like this,” she said.
There are a lot of things to weigh in now, because this home is likely to be a not-so-good element in Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and their names are equally notorious.
The couple, who have three sons, live here from time to time. Police say the family's terrors include using baseball bats to fight in the streets, terrorizing nearby residents, drugging, drug trafficking, shouting, arguing and swearing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant, Skeldon, received an anti-social behavior resolution.
In the house, which may have been demolished, many rooms are littered for a long time.
In this once-trading drug room, the floor is lifted up.
Neighbors said they were often seen fighting in the streets and often called the police.
After giving them an extension of 11 weeks to move them out voluntarily, the Cornish Housing Association forcibly removed her from the residence with her husband this week.
The relaxed neighbors cheered, saying that life before was simply hell on earth.
One neighbor said, "They don't care about anybody."
We lived next door to them for 20 years and have been so bad.
We have seen the police come to the door many times.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up early because it was so quiet – we weren’t used to it yet!
It’s great that they’re finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, community executive manager of the Cornwall Housing Association, said the family had not been able to cooperate well with the local government.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, and the police visited them frequently.
Garbage and old toys are thrown on the weedy side of the low-rent housing
He added: “Regrettably, the tenant was not held to be held responsible for the conduct of her and her family, and the eviction was the last consideration by the Cornish County Housing Association.”
This is a very difficult case because their behavior is very extreme, and what they do must make their neighbors feel very afraid.
I would like to thank my team for the work they have done and for the fact that Devonshire and Cornwall Police have also been grateful to the members who have bravely provided us with information.
I hope that this will bring some comfort to our neighbors and send a message that we have no tolerance for anti-social behavior.
Mr Fitzpatrick said their three sons had lived in the house at various times, but said they were all in their 20s.
After they were driven away, one of the bedrooms also threw a dirty mattress on the floor.
Housing Association workers will soon clean up piles of rubbish around the house
In 2014, police searched the house, found more than 70 grams of marijuana, and found balance, drug utensils and £1,700 in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of Class B drugs and drug trafficking.
She claims the money was used to buy a tombstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is understood that after being homeless, Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house are covered with graffiti.
Police said they would evict tenants who disobeyed the tenant rules.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction issued a clear warning to other tenants who continue to defy the tenant rules.
“This warning is directed at those who believe that their actions will not be blamed, and those who are devastated by it,” she said.
The Devonshire and Cornwall Police Departments will not tolerate crime and anti-social behaviour, and they will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Reid: Hillary Clinton Will Nominate Garland to Supreme Court If He's Elected President
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he was confident that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was elected president, she would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated Garland in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president will choose this person to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he predicted Clinton would choose Garland with "some credibility."
A spokeswoman for Reid then said Reid would not nominate Garland to speak directly with Clinton, and said he was only speculating.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton’s team did not want to “disturb” the new candidate.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said the Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination were the "pets" and "accomplis" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit to be president.
Treats: Naked calendar "loved by both men and women"
Treats magazine will work with photographer David Bellemere to photograph a set of 2017 calendars inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
This time, they plan to find a new generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar, rather than the famous naked people.
Steve Shaw, president of Treatats, said earlier this year that their nude-dominated magazine is different from the old-time Playboy because “the latter is geared toward men.”
And we are facing women.
Obviously, he thinks the same is true of this set of calendars.
“We need to show the timeless and classic nudity that makes both women and men feel at ease, and this time it’s inspired by that,” Shaw said at a calendar launch.
Women will be happy to participate in this shoot because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online to apply for jobs, or apply for public recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York in person.

French court rejects petition to demolish shops in jungle camp
A French court has rejected a petition by the Calais government to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the "Jungle" camp, which is currently home to thousands of refugees.
At the court's hearing this week, the Calais government argued that the French government should have the right to demolish a total of 72 makeshift shops in the camp. People in these shops in the camp sell goods, including cigarettes to energy drinks, provide hairdressing services, and sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or basic meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The office of the Governor of Calais believed that these places should be demolished because they were a parallel economy that did not pay taxes, and there were fire and health hazards.
Humanitarian groups have indicated to the courts that these shops and restaurants are extremely important, as free food provided by state-backed associations and other groups simply cannot meet the growing needs of the camp ' s refugees.
They say the makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the operators of the 72 temporary shops, but said the calair governor's concerns were "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said the role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants goes far beyond simply providing food to refugees who “live in extremely dangerous conditions.”
He said these places were a calm meeting point between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with the demolition was the camp’s Jungle Book Kids cafe, a non-profit shop that provides 200 food, English and French lessons a day, and shelters for hundreds of unaccompanied and vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was written that closing the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, many of whom are only eight years old".
The two charities, Help Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants, estimated Friday that the number of refugees in the bush camps has topped 9,000, the highest since the surge in the number of refugees in the summer.
“That $5,000 helped me get my head down.”
Zhou Fen, a poor Kado girl in Miyu Village, Changle Township, Huayuan County, received an acceptance letter from South China University.
Just when she was worried about the cost of enrollment, on August 9, the group county committee promptly implemented 5,000 yuan in funding for her.
In the past few days, the relevant departments of the county have also implemented 2.838 million yuan for more than 690 poor college students.
At the same time, for the family's economic situation is particularly difficult, it is also helped to complete his studies through the organization of social donations and other forms.
This year, Huayuan integrated more than 18.5 million yuan of student aid funds, and raised more than 2.5 million yuan in finance, and the financial department entered the real-name bank card of poor students according to the prescribed time limit.
She said gratefully: "I thought my father died, my brother and I were not in college, I did not expect the county to solve the difficulties for us in time."
As of August 8, Huayuan has implemented more than 21 million yuan of various rescue funds for 13,140 poor students in the first half of this year.
All the poor students of this county have achieved the assistance and supplement.

The New South Wales government announced on the 11th that it will spend 200 million Australian dollars (about 154 million US dollars) to carry out the largest renovation since the completion of the famous Sydney Opera House.
The New South Wales government said the repairs would not change the shape of the opera house.
The Sydney Opera House is one of Sydney’s landmarks, designed by Danish architect Joen Utsson and built in 1973, receiving around 8 million visitors a year.
Rory Jeffs, managing director of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes that the Sydney Opera House will use this transformation to play a "turnaround" and become "one of the best sound concert halls in the world".
Non-Beijing citizens who have lived in Beijing for more than 6 months and meet the conditions for legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence, and continuous study in Beijing can apply for a residence permit.
Recently, the implementation rules of the Beijing Interim Regulations on Residence Certificates were promulgated, which means that the "temporary residence permit" will be upgraded to "residential certificate".
The person in charge of the relevant departments said that the change from "temporary residence permit" to "residential certificate" means that Beijing's non-Beijing resident population will change from "management" to multi-faceted service.
The reporter learned from the State Administration of Taxation today that as of the end of June this year, tax authorities at all levels had announced 2,470 cases of "blacklist" of tax violations.
It is understood that in July 2014, the State Administration of Taxation took the lead in the functional departments of the central government, and jointly issued the "Measures for the Publication of Information on Major Tax Illegal Cases" with the Measures for the Administration of Tax Credits.
Not only the illegal facts, legal basis and punishment of these cases will be published, and the basic information of the parties involved in the law and the responsible persons of the relevant intermediaries will also be included in the "black list" and exposed.
Quality inspection, finance, customs and other government departments have also taken relevant disciplinary measures against the "black list" parties.
"The credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and even the construction of the whole social credit system, marking that the construction of China's social credit system is constantly developing and improving, and it is becoming more and more mature."
“Environmental problems are manifested in atmospheric, water, and soil pollution, but the roots are still in the production and lifestyle.”
For example, in 2015, the land development degree of Jiangsu Province was as high as 21%, ranking the highest among provinces and autonomous regions in the country.
Therefore, the problems of high pollution, large energy and large-scale occupation have not yet been fundamentally addressed from the change of production and lifestyle.
On the one hand, from the perspective of the effectiveness of the creation of various ecological environments at all levels in Jiangsu Province, it ranks first in the country with absolute advantages; on the other hand, the resource environment carries great pressure.
Solidly promoting ecological environment protection and governance need to fundamentally promote the transformation of production and lifestyle, and promote the transformation of ecological civilization to benefit people's livelihood.

Qingdao is the 12th and first pilot city in Shandong Province for paid use and trading of sewage rights.
On the 11th, a number of enterprises came to the Qingdao Municipal Emissions Trading Center to submit sewage rights to apply for purchase, and will pay paid royalties after acceptance.
The upcoming transaction first order also indicates that the pilot work of Qingdao sewage rights trading has officially kicked off, which will also be the first ticket of the province's sewage rights trading and the first national city-level sewage rights trading.
On the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Fine Chemical (Group) Co., Ltd., came to the Qingdao Municipal Emissions Trading Center to submit the sewage rights purchase.
The company is located in the old town of Qingdao factory at the end of last year completely discontinued, environmental protection relocated to the new factory in Pingdu.
After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, the environmental impact report of the construction project and other materials, the Qingdao Municipal Pollution Right Reserve and Trading Service Center began to conduct the first trial of the application materials.
According to the collection standards determined by the price, finance and other departments of Qingdao, the initial estimated use fee for the right to discharge is about 641,200 yuan, and the staff will complete the approval within 7 working days.
The upcoming transaction first order also indicates that the pilot work of Qingdao sewage rights trading has officially kicked off, and will also be the first ticket of sewage rights trading in the province and the first transaction of municipal sewage rights in the country.
Zhao Xiuping said that at present, the company's environmental protection has invested 400 million, on the surface, the amount is huge, but the enterprise management concept, social benefits have a great impact, and the enterprise innovation management has also opened up space.
On the same day, Qingdao Sangxin Chengzhizhuo Bus Parts Co., Ltd. also applied for sewage rights for the annual output of 4,200 pieces of high-speed rail and EMU interior accessories.
The project belongs to the machining enterprise, and the initial sewage right applied for is 0.514 tons/year of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 0.052 tons/year of ammonia nitrogen (NOX).
The paid use and trading of air pollutant discharge rights are key industrial enterprises for the city's power and heat production and supply.
The existing sewage units that have obtained the environmental assessment before January 1, 2016 will not levy paid use fees.
“Reimbursable access to sewage rights does not mean that the right to illegal discharge is not the same as obtaining the right to illegal discharge, and it is not possible to discharge pollutants at will.”
Han Hongyan, deputy director of the Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau, said that if illegal sewage and excessive sewage are still punished in accordance with relevant regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises to avoid punishment by purchasing sewage rights.
That is to say, through legal means to crack down on environmental violations, severely punish enterprises for excessive sewage discharge, so as to protect the environment and protect public health.
Now enterprises for their own benefit, improve the enthusiasm for pollution control, cherish the limited discharge rights, reduce pollutant emissions.
Driven by economic benefits, reducing pollutant emissions has changed from compulsory behavior by the government to conscious market behavior of enterprises, so as to truly achieve the purpose of protecting the environment, protecting nature, and protecting public health.
The right to discharge pollutants, also known as "emission rights", refers to the right of the emitters to discharge pollutants into the environment within the amount allocated by the government.
Such a right is essentially the right of the sewerers to occupy, use and benefit from environmental capacity resources.
The next step is to adjust the amount of pollution between internal pollution sources through currency exchange under the premise that the total amount of pollutant emissions does not exceed the allowable emissions.
Since the American economist Dales proposed it in 1968, the United States began to apply it to the management of air and river pollution sources in the 1970s.
China has been piloting since 2007, and 14 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) such as Zhejiang and Jiangsu have been fully implemented.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, in order to assist the six strategic bombers to carry out air strikes against the "Islamic State" targets in Syria, a number of Russian warplanes were lifted off from the Hmeimim Air Base in Syria.
On February 22 this year, the United States and Russia reached an agreement on a ceasefire between the parties to the Syrian conflict, which began on the 27th of the same month.
According to the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes against terrorist organizations designated by the United Nations Security Council, such as the Islamic State Support Front.
Russia will continue to build relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of Russian soldiers will be guaranteed accordingly.
He also said that if extremist forces are not attacked, these forces will be extended to Russia.
Although Russia and the West have not reached an agreement to jointly combat extremist forces in Syria, Russia will strengthen cooperation with Syria, Iran, Iraq and other fields in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia began a military strike against extremist forces in Syria at the invitation of the Syrian government.
On March 15 this year, the main Russian military forces in Syria began to withdraw, but the Russian side promised to continue to retain the base at the Khmeimim Air Base and the Naval Base in Tartus.

Today, an average of 100,000 people gather in Takeushiyama each year, either to bring a variety of ideas or to seek inner peace.
In fact, the relationship between the countryside and the city should be accompanied by each other, just like mothers and children, there is no difference between strength and weakness, there is no need for who to rule who, it should be very warm.
There is no fixed model for rural development, but it is difficult to change spontaneously by the countryside, and the most important point should be to let the right people go to the countryside.
Shanghai Songjiang District Traffic Management Department recently used electronic police remediation drivers to drive and play mobile phones, and more than 30 cases were seized in a week.
With the popularity of smart phones, mobile phones are more and more fun, brush WeChat, micro-blogs and even play games, shopping Taobao have become the norm, many people seem to be inseparable from mobile phones, even when driving can not stop.
The Road Traffic Safety Act prohibits driving and mobile phones, and defines it as “an impediment to safe driving.”
Unfortunately, due to the illegal people, difficult evidence and other reasons, this phenomenon has not been duly punished, the law has almost become a decoration.
If the traffic control department can make up its mind to "declare war" on the act of driving a mobile phone and normalize this measure, this illegal behavior will be curbed.

In the collective greenhouse of Donglin Village in Taicang City, 48-year-old Wang Xuefen is taking workers to spray pesticides on pear trees.
The village has 150 acres of orchards and more than 10 tree species, only 12 workers and one technical engineer.
Last year, 50,000 yuan, like my age, if you work in the factory will not get this money.
Last year, the village-level income of Donglin Village reached 22 million yuan, of which the total agricultural income accounted for nearly half.
Village Secretary Su Qifang: The per capita land planting area is increasing every year, starting with 50 mu, and now it is more than 100 mu; the average efficiency of mu is increasing every year, and the income of professional farmers is also growing every year.
Quantified to each villager, the biggest highlight of the rural collective economic reform in southern China is to clarify the property rights of rural collective operating assets and explore the separation of politics and economy.
In July 2015, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations in Anzhen Street, Xishan District, Wuxi City, and the village committee "sub-account management", the village committee performed the management of rural public affairs, and the cooperative organization was mainly engaged in business.
The two accounts of the two institutions do not "share the boundary" to prevent village cadres from participating in the management of collective assets from corruption.
Zhu Baoping, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Committee, said that Jiangsu will continue to promote the reform of the community joint-stock cooperation system in the next step, encourage the joint development of farmers, and establish a democratic power operation mechanism at the village level.

Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: "Beautiful hand" began to shoot career several times "reverse"
Zhang Donghong of Dongyuan Village in Xiamen Xiang'an District just changed his 29-inch old TV to a 65-inch TV a few days ago.
The daughter of this ordinary farmer is Zhang Binbin, who won the silver medal in the women's 50-meter rifle final for China at the Rio Olympics on the evening of the 11th.
On the night of the 11th, just before this new TV, Zhang Donghong and dozens of relatives and friends witnessed the magical process of her daughter rising up and chasing, from the almost preliminaries to the almost reversal.
In the game on the same day, Zhang Binbin once ranked in the middle and lower reaches, and it seems to be very far from the final.
But parents and relatives and friends did not give up, constantly brushing the text live, see with the completion of the competition with other players, Zhang Binbin all the way up, and finally locked the final seat, his home suddenly broke out from a cheer.
In the final, Zhang Binbin was in the case of a ranking lower, and the last few shots hit more and more steadily, only winning the silver medal with a score of 0.2 rings behind the champion.
Zhang Binbin, who is 27 years old this year, in his 16-year shooting career, has almost passed this hard-won silver medal several times.
His mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told reporters that when they hesitated, Zhang Binbin came to several "novel guests" in the same village.
These "novels" were the same village children who were recommended to participate in the training at the same time, including Zhang Binbin's cousin.
Shortly after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again took the initiative to return to Xiang'an's school for reasons such as family difficulties.
But after his enlightenment coach Zhang Yajie repeatedly did his work, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once returned home again because he was late to enter the national team because he could not see hope.
This time, not only Coach Zhang Yajie, Xiamen Shooting Archery Sports Center and the leaders and coaches of the Fujian Provincial Team came to their homes, and finally persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team.
Just like yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl's persistence achieved a reversal on the road of shooting.
"Every coach's way of selecting players is different, when I saw that the hand was very beautiful, and I was in the same place at once."
Zhang Donghong also recalled that in the training test, although the daughter's performance is not the best, but the number of rings played is very stable, which is also an important reason for Zhang Binbin to attract coaches.
In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie was most impressed by the investment of the farm girl.
He recalled that Zhang Binbin entered the Xiamen shooting team more than a year later, and the team conducted sustained gun training for standing shooting, requiring the team members to be unable to move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well-behaved child, and has loved drawing and homemade handmade toys since childhood.
"It turns out that I will make clothes at home, sew and make up, and I will pick up some corners to make my own dolls."
She said that her daughter often sews handmade toys on her own, and she is good at drawing, from the doll's five senses to the clothes, can always do life.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and his family gathered less and more, only on holidays can go home, usually rely on the phone contact.
Parents said that whether it is meeting or calling, Zhang Binbin rarely said his hard work, more is to talk to his parents about some happy things.
Usually can not see the daughter, the parents at home the daughter's childhood paintings and the honors of the past years are carefully stored.
Zhang Xiaolong showed his daughter's anime paintings to reporters, "If you are not a shooter, she should continue to paint."
In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's family, there is a cabinet filled with medals, medals and certificates she has received.
Zhang Donghong put medals and medals neatly placed, and the certificate was uniformly put into the folder to save, "These are the honors of more than ten years of hard work, we all cherish."

China's Mars Project is Coming
China's Mars exploration mission to achieve a circumnavigation, landing, tour, this form has never been in a foreign country.
China's Mars exploration and launch target is to turn around, land and patrol one step at a time, which is quite difficult.
Because it will take 26 months for Mars exploration to meet a time window, experts are working closely on a project plan to launch China's first Mars probe in 2020.
According to Xu Dazhe, although China's spacecraft has entered deep space, but the completion of the Mars exploration mission is still indispensable, the exploration of Mars means that China in the true sense into the era of deep space exploration.
“Every two or three years there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth, and launching a Mars rover at this point in time is the most energy-efficient for a launch vehicle.”
“Taking into account the quality of the Mars probe, the launch mission will be completed by China's Long March 5 launch vehicle.”
China's Mars exploration mission to achieve a circumnavigation, landing, patrol, this form has never been in foreign countries, foreign countries have planned to achieve a circumstance and landing, but the landing failed.
Mars exploration involves a lot of technical fields, especially in the fact that although the rover is a space probe, it has distinct characteristics compared with general space probes.
In other words, the Mars rover must have the ability to determine the route of travel and find the danger of obstacles.
Pang Zhihao, a researcher at the Fifth Academy of China Aerospace Science and Technology Group, said that the reason why human beings are so favored for Mars exploration is that the exploration of Mars has important scientific and technological significance, and even related to the future of mankind.
At present, Mars has become the most highly studied planet outside of Earth, and the history of human exploration using space probes has almost penetrated the entire history of human spaceflight.
Therefore, human beings hope to one day establish a residential base on Mars, and eventually migrate to Mars, turning it into a second home for humanity.
A large number of signs also show that Mars is likely to be like the current Earth, only after billions of years of evolution to become the atmosphere thin, low temperature, water depletion and so on.
Therefore, the exploration or manned landing on Mars for research can be put forward to prevent the earth from becoming a second Mars that is difficult for humans to survive.
As of June 2016, there were 114 lunar explorations and 43 Mars explorations worldwide.
However, since the 1990s, humans have conducted 18 Mars explorations, while lunar exploration has only carried out 14.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rovers at work, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are working.
The world's space powers have all developed exploration plans aimed at the Mars system, which shows that today's Mars exploration is hotter than lunar exploration.
On November 5, 2013, India launched its first Mars probe, Mangarian, becoming the first country in Asia to successfully explore Mars.
Mangarian is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars and to find out whether there are signs of methane and life on Mars.
The most difficult part of this mission is that the probe has only one chance to slow down after entering the Martian atmosphere with a pneumous appearance and a parachute.
According to Sun Zezhou, chief designer of the Mars probe of the general department of the Fifth Academy of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Mars exploration mission faces many technical challenges.
The atmospheric pressure on Mars is very low, only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on the Earth's surface, which is highly uncertain.
Scientists have not yet learned about factors such as its changes and the characteristics of the storm.
Mars often forms dust storms similar to Earth’s dusty weather in the summer, which will cause the solar energy received by the rover to drop sharply, and must design a “sleeping” mode for the rover to wait patiently for the dust storm to pass.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reduced effect on solar light, which brings problems for the energy supply of Mars exploration.
This requires the probe's solar wing area to be larger, and it needs to be constantly adjusted to focus on the direction of the sun.
Also, the surface gravity of Mars is only 38% of that of Earth, but it is much more than the gravity of the lunar surface, so the probe needs more power.
“The most important and difficult part of this Mars exploration mission is the process of the probe's aprodynamic appearance and parachute reduction after entering the Martian atmosphere, and there is only one chance to ensure success."
Sun Zezhou said that because the Earth is far away from Mars, the whole process cannot be controlled by the ground in real time, so it must be completed by relying on the probe.
Since there are not as many propellants to offset that high speed, the deceleration depends on the role of the Martian atmosphere when landing on Mars, but the Martian atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground.
Pang said that in general, the way to explore Mars is similar to the way of exploring the moon, but also "around, fall, patrol, return", and finally achieve the goal of manned landing on Mars.
Because Mars is much farther from Earth than the Moon, exploring Mars requires overcoming a series of more complex technological difficulties.
According to Taiwanese media reports, Taiwan's "Administrative Dean" Lin Quan announced yesterday morning that the "Regulations on improper acquisition of property by political parties and their affiliated organizations" will come into effect from today.
Zhan Qixian, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, said, "A more than 100-year-old Kuomintang has the commitment and responsibility of society, and it will not fail in this way."
Lin Quan stressed that if a political party, affiliated organization or trustee violates the prohibitions stipulated in the regulations, the Committee will investigate and punish and punish according to law.
Lin Quan also announced that the deputy chairman of the party property committee will be elected by Hong Bacon, deputy director of the CCAC.
He said that Gu Lixiong is the main committee of the improper party committee, and borrowing the experience of Hong Bacon to investigate relevant major cases in the past will serve as the basis for the committee to inventory the relevant improper party property cases.
Zhan Qixian believes that as long as there is party property today, no one will give you social donations, if the party property system is confiscated, the Kuomintang can just request social support and sponsorship, "today really no longer have the opportunity to go."
Zhan Qixian also stressed that even if the party's property regulations are not on the road, the Kuomintang party property is not completely confiscated and confiscated, and the rest will still be donated according to the promise, so that the party's property is zero, and the party wants everything to start from scratch.
Original title: "Conord Doctor" Lan Yuefeng v. CCTV host Wang Zhian's reputation infringement lost the first instance
Legal Evening News News because CCTV host Wang Zhi'an published remarks on the "corrordial doctor" incident on Sina Weibo, Lan Yuefeng brought Wang Zhi'an and Beijing Weimenchuang Technology Co., Ltd. to the court.
Yesterday afternoon, the Haidian court issued a judgment on the case, and the judgment found that Wang Zhian and Wei Meng did not constitute infringement, and rejected all the litigation requests of Lan Yuefeng.
At the beginning of 2014, CCTV reporter Wang Zhian found that although Lan Yuefeng, who has sat in the hospital corridor for more than 600 days, was portrayed by the media as a tragic hero suppressed by the system, there was a lot of false information about these reports.
On March 29, 2014, the "Dr. Corridor Doctor" program produced by CCTV News Investigation was broadcast.
The various so-called excessive medical information reported by Lan Yuefeng to the media is not supported by evidence.
Wang Zhian also described in the micro-blog of the real name certification, describing that "the reason why Lan Yuefeng came to this step is the personality of the persona, which has obvious paranoid personality."
Lan Yuefeng asked Wang Zhian to delete the micro-blog, apologize to him and compensate for the moral damage soothing 100,000 yuan.
During the trial at that time, the two sides debated whether Wang Zhian violated Lan Yuefeng's reputation rights.
12th to see: track and field start Chinese team is very busy women's football four bicycles looking forward to breaking through
Bicycles are expected to achieve the Olympic gold medal "zero breakthrough", and the women's football girl will challenge the two world champion German team, looking forward to the cold rush into the top four.
Wang Zhen has outstanding status in the past two seasons, and last year's Beijing Athletics World Championships won silver medals, and in May this year, the team walked the world championships and upgraded individual project champions.
According to foreign media reports, Zhang Huizhen, a 27-year-old South Korean archery player, won the gold medal in the women's archery individual competition, and won the Olympic gold medal after the team competition and became the double crown.
Zhang Huizhen is considered to be a late-stated player, she regretted not being admitted to the last London Olympic Games ticket, but now proudly stood on the highest podium of the Rio Olympic Games.
Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in the final of the women's archery individual competition held at the Samba Arena in Rio, Brazil, with a total score of 6-2 against Germany's Lisa Wonru.
She shot her first time in the fourth grade of primary school, and did not win her first individual gold medal in the World Cup until the age of 27 in 2014, a late player.
Zhang Huizhen recalled, "There was no level before going to high school, so that he could not participate in the national competition.
Zhang Huizhen only won the fourth place in the selection of London Olympic athletes four years ago, regretting the Olympic ticket, and could only sit back on his colleague and friend Qi Fu double to win two gold medals.
Zhang Huizhen talked about his gold medal after the award ceremony of the women's archery individual competition, "until finally, it was all as hard as possible to shoot arrows, which may have brought good results and satisfied."
The 28-year-old South Korean archery "one sister" and the gold medal winner of the London Olympic archery individual competition Qi Fu doubled won the bronze medal.
Chi Fu doubled in the semi-finals lost to Zhang Huizhen, with Mexico's Alijandra Valencia to compete for the bronze medal.
Qi Fu doubled in to ensure that the bronze medal after tears in the field, during which the silently bear the burden of gold can be imagined.
The first is the coaching staff to accumulate rich experience in continuous research, and second, the scientific training method, which needs to be accumulated in the long run.
The archery team uses military training, night crossing the cemetery and other methods to help the team to pay attention and maintain a sense of common sense.
Although it has not been confirmed, many sources have said that Apple's autumn 2016 conference will be held in September, and the iPhone 7 is really coming.
Although Apple did not respond, but about the new iPhone's features, configuration has been released, and even the iPhone 7 "real model" pictures have been available online.
The new generation of iPhone can be described as "everything eye-catching", hot, tight, rich and unstocked... If you want to buy the original in the first place, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suning.
This has exacerbated people's disappointment with the new phone, "it has lengthened, but can't project holographic images at all!
The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, was accompanied by countless secrets before birth.
In addition, there are several sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will cancel the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of Bluetooth connection and charging interface, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker.
Another evidence that can support this news is that as early as 2014, Apple allowed headset manufacturers to produce headphone products connected by charging interfaces.
The news is true or false, and the answer will not be revealed until Apple's autumn 2016 event.
But that doesn’t stop industry insiders from bullishing on the iPhone 7’s prospects — many believe that the iPhone 7 will likely be Apple’s last big upgrade to the iPhone series.
Although from the data released by the market research firm IDC not long ago, the market share of the iPhone has declined.
Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained Apple's stock with a "buy" rating, while BMO analysts believe that the iPhone 7 will achieve a historic sales result.
At the same time, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple's future revenue increase will likely exceed 20%, which is entirely due to the launch of the iPhone 7.
Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to buy an iPhone 7, compared with just 4 percent of those who planned to buy the iPhone 6 two years ago.
It is understood that 20% of the user groups currently holding the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to buy the iPhone 7, which is a fairly high proportion.
Secondly, some experts have analyzed that most fruit powder likes to replace their iPhones in the generation.
According to statistics, about 26% of all iPhone users have not replaced their phones in two years, that is, almost 120 million users have used iPhones for 2 years.
Some media said that during the production of the iPhone 7, Taiwan suffered several earthquakes, "the damage to TSMC production facilities is beyond imagination, and it may have an impact on the initial iPhone 7 supply."
The contradiction between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time to start the original iPhone7.
According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning executives and Apple frequently meet, the purpose is to prepare sufficient sources.
The operator has negotiated with Suning, and it is foreseeable that with the in-depth cooperation between the two sides, it will inevitably bring lower prices and more intimate services to users.
"At the lowest price, consumers may be able to buy an iPhone 7 for just $7 a day."
Adequate supply and a variety of offers, so that the purchase of iPhone7 is no longer "pressure mountain", and Suning's logistics, but will turn this beauty into a more intuitive experience.
Perhaps, you will get a call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Suning Tesco, your iPhone 7 has arrived."
The organizers hope to let the local people learn more about the long-established Chinese culture through cultural relics exhibitions, so as to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
Barcelona’s “Ming Dynasty Heritage Exhibition” is part of a European tour that will run until early October.

During the match between Australia and the Japanese team, the environmental conditions of the pool gradually deteriorated, but the official stressed that they would restore the water quality of the two swimming pools to their original color on the 11th.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Olympics, said: “The degree of water in the diving pool became weaker in the first place yesterday afternoon.”
“We understand a range of causes that may cause discoloration of pool water and the alkalinity of water quality.”
The water quality of the water sports center has been tested in a series, and hundreds of divers and swimmers have used the pool to determine the water quality conditions.
“We’ve been going through normal procedures these days, but we may have overlooked the impact more athletes can have on water quality.”
“But changes in the color of the water certainly have no effect on health, especially for athletes.”
“This independent team confirmed our assessment and the measures taken to restore the pool to its normal colour and normal chemical condition.”
“We had hoped that the pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by the rain.”

Regarding the operation of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow from the words of the Prime Minister that "there are fluctuations, the situation is still good", which can better summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July.
He explained that "shape volatility" means that the growth rate of some economic indicators in July did fall.
Because the domestic and foreign economies were still in the process of deep adjustment in July, the international situation was complex and changeable, and the recovery of the world economy was less than expected, so the export pressure was still relatively large.
From the domestic situation, the entire economy is still in the critical stage of adjustment, the pain of adjustment is released, and the economy is facing no small downward pressure, so some indicators fluctuate.
Sheng Laiyun pointed out that there is a special situation in July, the flood disaster is more serious, and the hot and hot weather has brought some impact on the production and operation of some areas.
According to the recent situation released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people across the country have been affected, and the direct economic losses have exceeded 200 billion yuan.
From the perspective of industrial, investment and transportation-related indicators, these areas are affected to varying degrees.
The growth rate of goods weekly transit in July fell by 3.6 percentage points from the previous month, and the flood disaster had a certain impact on traffic in these areas.
From the perspective of these factors, the fluctuations in some indicators in July are also normal and are also expected.
He said that "the situation is still good" refers to the fact that although the economic growth rate has fallen back, the overall economic operation is stable, and the general trend of steady progress and steady improvement has not changed.
In July, the CPI rose by 1.8%, up 0.2% month-on-month; in January-July, the CPI rose by 2.1%, so the price situation was generally stable.
According to the statistics of the portal network of the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau on the high temperature weather in various districts and counties, except for Yuyang, the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance.
At present, at least 28 provinces in the country have clarified the criteria for the payment of allowances, but the standards issued by the provinces and cities are not the same, and Chongqing is receiving high temperature allowance according to the high temperature workday allowance.
If it is below 37 °C above 35 °C, it shall be issued according to the standard of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; at more than 37 °C, it shall be issued according to the standard of not less than 15 yuan per person per day.
High temperature staff above 40 °C can receive a maximum allowance of 20 yuan / day per month (except for workers who have already enjoyed the allowance for high-temperature work positions according to law).
According to this standard, the state with the most high temperature weather days last month can receive 330 yuan, and the lowest number of days is 80 yuan, and the highest temperature in Yuyang is not high temperature standard, so there is no high temperature allowance.
In the past, many units will use cool drinks to offset the high temperature allowance, and the Municipal Safety Supervision Bureau said that this behavior is not in line with the current method.
If the work is stopped and the working hours are shortened due to the high temperature, the employer shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the workers.
The Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau said that if an employee encounters a high temperature operation but does not receive a high temperature allowance, he can fight for the legitimate rights and interests through the labor dispute mediation agency where the enterprise is located, or call 12333 to complain.
Where a useful unit refuses to pay a high-temperature allowance, the worker may complain to the competent department of human resources and social security at or above the county level where the employment is located.
At the same time, because the high temperature allowance is part of the salary, not the benefit, it should be included in the total salary and the tax deduction.
Therefore, the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage and must be paid in cash and cannot be replaced by in kind such as beverages.
The newly built Urumqi station is located in the high-speed rail area of Urumqi City, with an entire construction area of about 100,000 square meters.
The above-ground floors 1 and 2 are pit stops, waiting halls, offices, and commercial rooms, and the first floor above ground is the outbound layer.
At present, Urumqi Station is the largest integrated transportation hub in Xinjiang, integrating high-speed rail, rail transit, public transport, and rental, which can realize a variety of transfer methods and seamless docking.
There are three ticket halls on the north and south sides of the platform and on the north side of the outbound layer, with 39 artificial ticket windows and 34 automatic ticketing machines.
In terms of ticketing, there are 30 channels on both sides of the waiting hall, and passengers can carry out rapid inspection and waiting according to the ticket number on the ticket.
If you need help, you can choose the 41 call buttons set up in the nearby press station, and you can get timely service.
From July 1, the passenger train from the old passenger station, that is, Urumqi South Station, will travel to Urumqi Station step by step.
In other words, all trains and 30 pairs of trains can be stopped at Urumqi Station.
Now both stations can buy tickets for the ride, the train travel time between them is about 10 minutes, passengers need to pay attention to the ticket starting and the specific name of the terminal.
The official opening and operation of the new passenger station in Urumqi will become an important platform for Xinjiang to build a national integrated transportation city and promote the construction of the "Silk Road Economic Belt" and the new area.
Gracia is a budding female toucan, covered in the atmosphere of the rainforest.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan, Gracia, and her story are well known.
At a press conference on August 10, Gracia, who recovered after surgery, was finally unveiled to show people its new 3D printed plastic bird beak.
The toucan, which was broken a year and a half ago, is now finally reborn.
This day not only announced that it has been 100% healthy, but also the day that it has moved into the luxurious birdhouse and met with human friends who care about it.
Gracia, who had entered her new home, was a little shy, but became lively a little, frolicking in the basin and eating grapes with a new beak.
To remind people of the damage it once suffered, the technician did not color its new beak, but instead kept the original white of the 3D printing material.
Outside the beak is a thin horny sheath, which is hollow, with only some fine bone support rods interleaving.
Although there is this internal reinforcement, the beak of the toucan is still fragile and will break when it is hurt.
Animal rescue centers, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company have worked together to create several “experimental beaks” for Gracia, finally creating the “perfect beak” that best suits it.
Now Gracia is proficient in drinking water, eating, and even pecking tiny grains.
“The design of the final product took about two months and took only four or five hours to print.”
“3D printing is not a technology of the future, it has really entered your life,” Thomas Lange, chairman of SG3D Printing in the United States, said in an interview with Xinhua International.
In January 2015, a blood-stained toucan, Gracia, was found on a farm in Grecia, in the central province of Alajuela, Costa Rica.
At that time, its beak was cruelly broken by a group of young people, it was completely unable to eat, and its life was in danger.
Gracea's tragedy, after media reports, caused a wave of opposition to animal cruelty in and out of Costa Rica.
People are demanding stricter animal protection laws and increased penalties for abusers.
People came spontaneously and did their best to help Gracia recover as much as possible from life before she was injured.
Even the inventor of 3D printing technology, Chuck Hull, was involved in the design of the beak of Gracia.
“Grecia's situation is very special, its upper beak is less than 1 cm left, so it brings many difficulties to the installation of the new beak.”
“We scanned Gracia first, then designed and produced an extended prosthesis that was slightly longer than the rest of its beak, fixed to its upper beak with sticky glue.”
“This could reduce further intrusive harm to Gracia,” Lange told Xinhua International.
Before installing the prosthesis, the staff had to clear the beak for Gracia every day to prevent infection.
Thousands of miles away, the story of the toucan, Gracea, touched the famous documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and the explorer news channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded the little bits of Gracia’s installation of the new beak, and recorded a documentary, The Toucan Nation, which was broadcast on the Animal Planet Channel this month.
The documentary "The Country of Toucans" shows how a small toucan can make a country change and how to involve its citizens in opposing animal cruelty.
Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of China’s small independent refineries, known as “teapots.”
Reference News Network reported on August 12 that Japanese media said that JX Energy, Japan's largest oil company, believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the downturn in the market."
Japanese oil companies in particular are wary of the rise of China’s small independent refineries, known as “teapots.”
The quality of China's petroleum products is gradually approaching Japan's oil products as the Chinese government strengthens environmental regulations.
Before obtaining the crude oil import license, the "teapot refinery" generally imported heavy oil with high sulfur content from Russia and other places for refining.
The high content of sulfur produced petroleum products and poor oil products have become one of the reasons for environmental pollution.
After obtaining the crude oil import license, the "teapot refinery" can import low sulfur-producing Omani crude oil and Russian crude oil, and the quality of its petroleum products has also increased.
Dongfang General Petroleum said, "With the continuous improvement of the quality standards of petroleum products in China, the ability of refining equipment has also increased."
As a result, the quality of petroleum products exported by China has gradually reached the same level as Japan, the highest quality in the world.”
JX Energy said that after the end of 2015, China began to export high-quality light oil to Australia, competing with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Although "Japan's high-quality oil" is facing a crisis, the response strategy adopted by Japanese oil companies is only "to pay attention to the market while exporting to profitable regions."
Due to the huge impact of China's exports of petroleum products on the Asian market, the attention to teapot refineries is also increasing.
In 2016, the Yangtze Evening News Sunshine Student Aid Initiative was launched on May 26, and after two months of registration, the total number of poor students applying for grants reached more than 800.
In the course of the student aid, it has received more than 1.2 million yuan of social donations (publicized in five batches), which can help at least 240 cold students to dream university.
At present, the donation continues, and this newspaper calls on the society to continue to lend a hand so that more children with family difficulties can get financial support and social care.
In order to ensure that the student's action is fair, open and transparent, this newspaper has announced the basic information of students in batches from today, and today announced the first to 100th, and accepted the supervision of readers.
Liqun Sunshine Aid Action is a well-known charity brand in China, and the Yangzi Evening News Sunshine Aid Action has been carried out in Jiangsu since 2003, subsidizing more than 4,000 poor students.
The scope of the activity is the college entrance examination undergraduate admission of freshmen, excluding tuition-free majors; excellent quality, family poverty.
New Zealand’s population growth was previously more than 2 percent at peak births of the “baby boom” population in the 1974s and early 1960s, the Bureau of Statistics said.
As of June this year, New Zealand's net inflow of immigrants in 12 months was 69,100, making it the main driver of New Zealand's population growth in recent years.
In addition, at the same time, New Zealand's population grew naturally by 28,20 people.
According to the data, the average annual net inflow of immigrants in New Zealand in the past 10 years was 21,800, and the average annual population growth was 32,300.
In terms of demographics, the influx of immigrants means that the proportion of the “working-age population” between the ages of 15 and 39 has gradually increased.
In the 12 months to June 2016, New Zealand’s working-age population grew by 3.6 per cent, to 1.58 million.
At the same time, the increase in the elderly population over 65 years of age was also 3.6 per cent, reaching 700,000.
At about 10 a.m. yesterday, the X9003 international freight train left Xi'an Xinji Station and went to Almaty, Kazakhstan.
The opening of the train marks that the Xi'an Railway Bureau has successfully exceeded 10,000 vehicles since the opening of the Central Asian International Freight train in 2013.
It is understood that the freight train transport of goods category covers industrial raw materials, machinery and equipment, industrial spare parts, building materials, food, light products six categories, a total of 206 varieties.

As of the end of July, the number of containers in the Central Asian train exceeded 64,000 TEU, an increase of 8% over the same period in 2015.
With the opening of the central Asia train, the freight volume of the new station of the Xi'an Railway Bureau has increased year by year.
In 2015, the annual freight throughput of the new station was 2.477 million tons, and as of August 10, 2016, the freight delivery volume had reached 1.531 million tons, an increase of 6.7% over the same period last year.
In order to meet the needs of future development, the Xi'an Railway Bureau has been introduced to build a new railway integrated logistics center centered on the new station, and has made every effort to build a modern new railway integrated logistics park.
An Indian uncle experienced a plane’s abdominal landing at Dubai International Airport last week, and this week won a $1 million jackpot at the same airport.
Indian Muhammad al-Bashir Abdul Khdal, a long-time native of Dubai, has the habit of buying lottery tickets every time he returns home.
His 21-year-old son was paralyzed by an unexpected fall when he was born 13 days ago, and he has been working hard to pay off his son's medical expenses loan.
“Escape from the air crash was when God gave me a second life and gave me the money to do good,” Hedal said.
Although it is now autumn, the power of the "autumn tiger" seems to be no worse than that of summer.
Ultraviolet rays not only make the students' skin dark, but also sunburn the skin, how to make the skin can successfully through military training, not sunburn?
Sunscreen packaging is generally marked with SPF and PA, SPF refers to the sun protection index, is for UVB ultraviolet, our common SPF index has 15, 30, 50 and so on.
The product marked with PA is for UVA, so that the sunscreen products will play a more effective role, under normal circumstances, the strength of PA is expressed in +, and one more + indicates the extended effective protection time.
Oily skin should choose water-based sunscreens with strong permeability, and sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
Dry skin should choose frost-like sunscreen products; neutral skin generally has no strict regulations, sensitive skin wipes on any maintenance products are a burden, it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products.
Remember to apply sunscreen half an hour in advance, as it takes time for sunscreen products to fully penetrate into the skin.
Military training sunning time is longer, sunscreen every two hours to rub to have a lasting effect, do not be lazy.
Because the skin has just been irritated by the sun, the military training should not be used immediately with whitening products.
After the military training exposure, if you can use a conditional towel wrapped in ice to burn the skin to slow down the local dry heat.
Farmers who buy agricultural machinery during the exhibition continue to implement a cumulative subsidy policy, and farmers can get up to 40% of the subsidy for purchasing agricultural machinery.
The exhibition is open to global investment promotion, especially to increase the invitation to countries along the "Belt and Road" and target market countries.
The exhibition strives to complete 60 investment-contracted projects, introduce 22 billion yuan of funds, and sign more than 160 trade contracts with a contract amount of 3.2 billion yuan.
It is reported that the reason why the "Xiangbo" has been settled in Loudi for seven consecutive years, due to the strong manufacturing industry base in Loudi City, Hunan Province, and the history of industrial development is long.
As the host of the "Xiangbo", Loudi has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
"Xiangbo" has become an important platform for local cultivation of characteristic industries and promote characteristic industries to go abroad.
On some nights, the ionosphere is filled with free electrons, which means that radio signals can go further.
According to the US "Popular Science" monthly website reported on August 11, the U.S. Air Force is interested in replicating this effect.
While a stable, large-size free-electronic ionosphere can help people listen to it at the edge of a university radio station, this may not be an interest in the U.S. Air Force.
The electronic-filled ionosphere means that the radio used by the military has a greater range of broadcasts, and it may provide some protection for Global Positioning System (GPS) signals from solar storms.
The ultimate goal might be to build a series of cubesats on demand that can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first, these teams that contract with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles work.
Industry data show that in 2015, the total coal production capacity was close to 6 billion tons, and the national coal overcapacity was 1.8 billion tons.
In the past ten years, the State Council has issued five notifications on the elimination of excess and backward production capacity.
Although the first four times were not aimed at the coal industry, the target industry is directly related to the coal industry.
From November last year to January this year, the price of 5,500 kcal thermal coal in Qinhuangdao hovered at a low of 370 yuan / ton for a long time, and 90% of coal companies fell into losses.
Since February, coal prices have gradually rebounded, and the price of Qinhuangdao thermal coal has risen for four consecutive weeks, rising to a high of 16 months, once climbing to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan from the beginning of the year.
With the recovery of prices, all walks of life are worried about the occurrence: will a number of small coal mines return to work?
In this regard, the director of the Economic Research Institute of China (Hainan) Reform and Development Research Institute has carried out analysis and interpretation.
Qian Xianming: to the production capacity caused by all parties to pay great attention, today's announcement of the coal industry to production capacity report card also really let everyone feel more worried.
These three factors reflect the relative lag in our growth-oriented approach in the past, namely, that the government-led growth mode has not yet received a fundamental shift.
Second, this is also directly related to the promotion of local governments, in the process of de-production, funds and corresponding supporting measures should be in place, from this point of view, the differences between different regions are indeed relatively large.
Third, if some provinces with relatively slow progress are to catch up in the second half of the year, they may face greater risks.
In this case, relying on the central award to supplement funds to promote the process of de-capacity may have a certain negative impact.
First of all, the production capacity is not a simple total control.
Our purpose is to reverse the backward production capacity, promote the optimization of the structure, and reconstruct the new format of the entire coal industry.
In the process of deploying production capacity, local governments must combine the transformation and upgrading of production capacity and coal industry to vigorously develop related service industries.
Second, in order to complete this year's production capacity task this year, we must give full play to the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision.
Finally, we need to strengthen the role of social security.
Because the market is directly related to the issue of employment, we must strengthen the training of employees and employees in employment skills.
“The decline in the ranking is due to the deterioration of foreign investment's expectations for the development of Brazil's GDP in the medium term."
In 2015, Brazil’s participation in global direct investment was 3.7 percent, down from 5.7 percent in 2014.
The Credit Suisse International Investment Attractiveness Index includes four sub-indics: Infrastructure, Economic Prospects, Business Environment and Direct Investment.
In 2015, Brazil’s international direct investment was $64.6 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year, the “greenfield investment” in Brazil (the investment model for foreign investment in factories) was $17.9 billion, a decrease of 2.1% year-on-year.
“There are 288 ‘greenfield investments’ in Brazil, compared to an average of 314 per year from 2003 to 2014.
However, in the first half of 2016, international direct investment in Brazil reached $33.8 billion, an increase of almost 10% compared with the same period last year.
Original title: Canadian police killed IS supporters: homemade bomb attack city preparations near the end
The taxi company said the taxi was dispatched to Dreyver's home before police arrived.
Canadian police said at a news conference on Wednesday that the information they received included a "martyry video" provided by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation about the young man who was about to carry out the attack.
According to Deutsche Welle, a man wearing a black balakar lafa hat in the video is reading the Qur'an, mentioning crimes against Muslims and vowing to launch an attack on a city in Canada soon.
He said in the video that the attack will take place within 72 hours, and it is during peak hours.
The incident is the first time since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office last year that police killed a terror suspect before the incident.
After the upgrading and transformation of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal branch channel old Wanfu River, the North Great Slide channel on September 1st to collect tolls.
These two tributary waterways adopt social financing methods for renovation and construction, and the fees have been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.
The old Wanfu River channel flows through Jinxiang and fish platforms, and through Nanyang Lake, it enters the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, with a total length of 32.5 kilometers.
According to the needs of navigation, the old Wanfu River channel adopts the way of maintenance and transformation, the local water depth is deep, the local sharp bend is cut straight, etc., and the navigation conditions are improved.
The channel flows through Jinxiang County and Rencheng District, and through Nanyang Lake, it enters the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, with a total length of 19 kilometers.
The renovation project of the two waterways started construction in February 2011, completed the acceptance in January 2015, and the main investment and construction was the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center in Jining City.
In accordance with the principle of "loan construction, fee repayment", Jining Anping Canal Logistics Service Center in accordance with the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau approved the charging standard to collect the toll.
Among them, the basic toll is calculated at 1.75 yuan / dwt, and the mileage toll is calculated at 0.05 yuan / kilometer of load tonnage.
The toll collection period is from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019.
The reporter learned from the Jining Port and Navigation Bureau that at present, there are four toll shipping lanes in Jining, namely, the Shui River channel, the Baima River channel, the North Great Slide Channel, and the Lao Wanfu River channel.
The four channels are the tributaries of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, all of which are upgraded by means of social financing.
The Songshui River channel upgrade project is the first to adopt the "government + market" model, which is used for the construction of inland port and aviation infrastructure in Shandong Province, the government accounts for the main investment, and the social funds supplement the funding gap.
The Baima River, the Old Wanfu River, the Beida River and other branch channels adopt a pure market-oriented operation.
The funds allocated by the state finance cannot meet the needs of the construction of the project and restrict the progress of the upgrading of the channel.
The use of social funds for the construction of public infrastructure meets the requirements of national policies and has also become a way to crack the bottleneck of funds.
Ning Zetao's performance in the 100-meter freestyle semi-finals has left many Chinese spectators speechless.
But in the 50-meter freestyle preliminaries, Ning Zetao once again refreshed people's "bottom line".
In fact, the 50-meter freestyle is not the main item of Ning Zetao, his performance and best results in the Kazan World Championships, but also determined that he is unlikely to make a breakthrough in this project.
Sure enough, Hong Kong's authoritative media "Grand Gazette" revealed that the biggest reason for Ning Zetao's loss is that he has lost his interest in swimming.
Many of the factors off the field may have had a big impact on his ideas for the future, and he may now be more interested in entering the entertainment industry.
After the Kazan World Championships, Ning Zetao instantly became a net red with its ultra-high face value and good results.
As a result, "national husband", "small fresh meat", "stupid man" and other names have also become the label on his body.
All kinds of business activities to find the door, a beautiful road of money, become a golden road.
In this case, Ning Zetao even if he chooses to retire to join the entertainment industry at this time, it is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly feasible path.
After all, he is only 23 years old, after a certain degree of learning, can be used to play one or two TV series with his popularity.
But Ning Zetao needs to see if he has enough qualifications compared with these predecessors?
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the 21-year-old Liu Xuan has reached the end of his athlete's career.
Liu Yanli's appearance quickly made her remembered by people, and also laid the foundation for her future entry into the entertainment industry.
After retiring, Liu Xuan starred in several TV series and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang participated in the single-double ten-meter stage competition of the two Olympic Games and won 2 gold and 2 silver.
However, after losing to teammate Hu Jia in the 2004 Olympics single ten-meter competition, Tian Liang's competitive status declined and was expelled by the diving team.
And he and his daughter participated in variety shows such as "Where Dad Goes", which made him earn his eyeballs.
The former gymnastics golden generation Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing have participated in various variety shows.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei Li Xiaopeng led China to win the 2008 Olympic Men's Team championship, and Yang Wei won the personal all-around gold medal twice, known as the all-around king.
Chen Yibing also became the king of the ring while leading China to win the 2012 Olympic team championship.
After suffering a misjudgment of losing the gold medal at the London Olympic Games, Chen Yibing's great action also made him countless fans.
But the main energy of these athletes is still on the field, and for the variety show, it is just like a dragonfly - touch it and go.
However, whether it is retired or active athletes, it is necessary to be able to get the favor of the entertainment industry.
After all, athletes enter a new field, whether it is ability or network, are a blank state.
Even Tian Liang and Liu Xuan, such as the "old man" of the entertainment circle for many years, the general audience mentioned them, and more still think of their performance in the Olympic Games.
And Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and other newcomers, introduced when they appeared in the variety show, without exception, are "Olympic champions".
Compared with the above few people, Ning Zetao is still a slightly thin head of a swimming world champion.
What's more, compared with Tian Liang, Liu Xuan, Yang Wei and others who have retreated, Ning Zetao will retreat in a rapid run if he is 23 years old and a little setback in his sports career, and the negative impact on his image is probably immeasurable.
After all, when it comes to athletes, people's demands are "not to fight a hundred wins, but not to be afraid of hardships", Ning Zetao is still a lot away from this point.
Ten thousand steps back said that Ning Zetao is handsome and can rely on the value of the face to get the support of thousands of brain powder.
No bit of power, only rely on the appearance, want to mix well in the entertainment circle, this is no more difficult than good training to find the state it should be difficult.
The choice of the road of life is all based on personal will, but in the end how to choose, Ning Zetao should have a number in his heart.
On the surface, the online social platform has expanded the social circle and reduced people's loneliness.
The influence of online socialization is becoming more and more extensive, not only gradually replacing the traditional telephone contact, but even infiltrating the real life circle offline, quietly changing the social life of the current people.
The benefits of online socialization are obvious, such as convenience and quickness, so they are particularly vulnerable to the favor of young people.
A survey of college students' social habits shows that 57% of college students spend more than 5 hours a day using their mobile phones, and their daily life is basically "not leaving their hands."
"Social networks have the characteristics of low cost, fast transmission speed, and simultaneous communication of many people, which meet the needs of contemporary college students."
Expanding the circle of interpersonal relationships, more equal dialogue, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love online chat more and more.
Newcomers who have just entered the company love to communicate with their colleagues online, "because they enter the unit that everyone is not familiar with, and through the likes and comments of social platforms, the relationship is much closer than before."
Love friends also often use online communication, "before with friends because of some misunderstandings for some time did not contact, and then in a large group of first dialogue a few words and hot up."
IT engineer Wu Yan is a deep network social enthusiast, most of his social life occurs online, the network contact is several times the number of offline friends.
Wu Yan himself also admitted that it is more "like a fish getting water" on the Internet.
“You can reply to your friends when you are convenient and willing, because there are a lot of time to think about words, and the expression can be clearer.”
“You, who are hiding under your ID, avoid face-to-face interpersonal collisions, not only have room for manoeuvre, but even give each other more time and space to think about words and deeds.”
“People of different identities have the same right and efficiency to speak, and all the social concerns of real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace.”
However, Wu Yan's friend Xiao Peng felt that Wu Yan in his life was a "bearrible house man."
Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a large group, because they were both active speakers and soon became familiar with each other.
Xiao Peng felt that Wu Yan and the Internet judged two people, the words are boring, do not take the initiative to express their opinions, turn over and over is a few words "Oh, oh, okay, is it", or "this I want to check the Internet."
Lingshui police have now intervened in the investigation, and the Lingshui traffic department will also strengthen efforts to rectify illegal operating vehicles.
“The police did not have the results of the clashes on 4 August, and at about 0:00 on 11 August, two other drivers' taxis were smashed at their residences.”
“The current tricycles are mostly operating illegally at night, and I hope that the competent authorities can also increase their efforts to rectify them.”
The reporter of Nanhai Network learned from the Lingshui Li Autonomous County Public Security Bureau that the police have now accepted the reports of these two cases, and the causes of the two cases, who committed them, and whether they are related are in further investigation.
Wang Wenyi, director of the traffic management station of Lingshui Transport Bureau, said that the Lingshui Traffic Department began to rectify the illegal operation of passenger tricycles at the beginning of this year, and banned a total of 613 illegal operation passenger tricycles.
In the next step, the transportation department will apply to the county government to strengthen the remediation of illegal operating vehicles such as three-wheelers, motorcycles and black cars in the county.
At 8 a.m. on August 11, the reporter of Qilu Evening News followed the "Healthy China Tour" clinic service group to Hegou Village, Xihu Town, Donggang District.
The village is located in a remote area, about 24 kilometers from the urban area, more than 200 residents in the village, due to economic, transportation and physical limitations, to many middle-aged and elderly patients to go out to see a doctor.
The project of this clinic is relatively comprehensive, internal medicine, surgery, respiratory, psychiatric, dermatology, pediatrics.
Many villagers heard that the experts of the clinic were coming, and had already been waiting in the small square of the village.
67-year-old Xue suffers from congenital scoliosis, and in recent years she has been deeply troubled by "asthma", so that even walking the last slope will be breathless and breathless.
The doctor told Mrs. Xue that it is unlikely that chronic bronchitis wants to be fundamentally cured, and usually insisting on medication can be alleviated.
At the dermatologist's consultation desk, an elderly man in his 60s came to consult with her grandson.

On August 11, when the reporter's telephone interview returned to her home in Mianyang, Sichuan Province, Huang Yilin said: "At that time, the situation was too urgent, I had only one thought in my heart to save people!"
Huang Yilin is a 2015 student of the Central South Linke University of Landscape Architecture.
Huang Yilin, who studied urban and rural planning, wanted to visit and study local architectural design in Sichuan, so the family went to travel.
At about 10 a.m. on August 8, Huang Yilin's father rested in the hotel, and the mother and daughter came out to visit the ancient city of Yanzhong.
Just walked not far, suddenly saw a group of people shouting, out of curiosity, they went forward.
Seeing "the little boy has disappeared, the little girl is desperately popping in the water, only her little head is exposed on the river, and from time to time, she sinks", Huang Yilin, who learned to swim as a child, jumped down to save people.
After the water, the height of 165 cm Huang Yilin found that he could not step on the end!
Before looking calm water, but down there is a torrent!
But she was still desperate to swim to the little girl.
Huang Yilin said that the river is turbid and urbid, less than 5 meters away, and almost all her strength is exhausted.
She did her best to push the little girl to the edge of the riverbank, "the slope is particularly slippery, I am afraid that I have no strength to sink."
Therefore, Huang Yilin asked her mother for help, heard her daughter's call for help, and Ms. Yin, who was not well-watered, was ready to go into the water to rescue and was stopped by the tourists next to her.
On August 10, after Huang Yilin jumped to save people, Ms. Yin received many condolences from relatives and friends, praise, and was also "accountable" for many relatives and friends.
To tell you the truth, when the child could not hold on to the riverbank and asked for help, my heart was about to break."
Ms. Yin said with a pity that, although it is very dangerous, if she is in such a scene again, she will still support her daughter's choice, she is proud of her daughter!
Because of the forced, Huang Yilin after learning to swim rarely take the initiative to go into the water, "I did not expect this skill is really useful."
According to Chen Yichang, the head of Huang Yilin's class, Huang Yilin is a recognized "student hegemony" in the class, and he is helpful.

The Northeast Tiger is currently listed as an endangered (EN) species by the Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, in 1998, the joint monitoring data of China, the United States, Russia and other countries showed that only 4 to 6 wild Northeast tigers and 3 to 5 leopards in Jilin Province.
According to Yu Changchun, director of the protection department of the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, in recent years, Jilin Province has continuously increased the protection of wild animals, and the population of Northeast tigers and northeast leopards in China is growing significantly, and the distribution area is expanding.
The latest monitoring data in 2015 showed that only 27 wild northeast tigers and 42 northeast leopards were monitored in Jilin Province alone.
As the world's flagship species of wildlife protection distributed in the China-Russia border region, the cooperation between China and Russia is of great significance for the recovery and reproduction of the population of wild northeast tigers and leopards.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, Jilin Province has established a long-term and stable cooperation and exchange mechanism with Russia.
At the 2016 China Haochun Tiger and Leopard Protection International Forum, the forestry departments and animal protection organizations of China and Russia once again reached a number of consensuses.
The Forestry Department of Jilin Province said that strengthening cooperation in the protection of tigers and leopards between China and Russia is not only a very urgent task facing the protection of tigers and leopards in northeast China, but also a top priority for maintaining the health of Russian tigers and leopard populations.
As a leading cadre of party members, Sun Fujian lost his ideal belief, seriously violated the party's discipline, and did not converge after the 18th National Congress of the Party, did not stop, and did not violate discipline, which was of a bad nature and serious circumstances.
After the case occurred, after a number of media reports, it became the focus of the case, and the social impact was extremely bad.
After the case, the leaders of the criminal police detachment of Haikou Public Security Bureau attached great importance to it, and immediately organized a large team of competent police forces to take the initiative to launch investigations.
The police immediately carried out the suspect's online pursuit, took a variety of measures to control, and contacted the foreign police to investigate the whereabouts of a country.
Because the suspect is a repeat offender of theft, has been repeatedly hit by the public security organs, has strong anti-reconnaissance ability, coupled with his long-term drug use, interrogation of addiction often, interrogation work is very difficult.
Greenland sharks, also known as small-headed sleeping sharks, are widely distributed in the North Atlantic Ocean around Greenland and Iceland, and reach a body length of 4 to 5 meters in adulthood.
But they grow very slowly, sometimes only about 1 centimeter long for a year, suggesting that Greenland sharks may have a life span for their prime minister.
Traditional dating methods typically use animal calcified tissue, and some sharks can use fin ridges, but this calcification is rare in Greenland sharks.
The new study, led by Julius Nelson of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, turned to the use of the Greenland shark’s eye lens for radiocarbon dating.
This method was previously used to determine the age of whales, but it was the first time it had been used to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis showed that the largest shark had an estimated lifespan of 392 years, with an error of 120 years.
That is to say, the shark is at least 272 years old and is likely to reach 512 years old.
In addition, the female Greenland shark is said to be able to mature sexually at a length of about 4 meters, which is the age of at least 156 years old.
The researchers wrote in the paper that the Greenland shark is the most long-lived vertebrate known on Earth, surpassing the previous longevity champion right whale (211 years old).
In the past year, the exchange rate has achieved remarkable results, and the RMB exchange rate has remained basically stable, which has also laid the foundation for promoting the internationalization of the RMB.
From the perspective of market performance, in the past year, the two-way floating characteristics of the RMB exchange rate have been obvious, the exchange rate flexibility has increased, and the exchange rate is expected to be generally stable.
Since the exchange rate reform, the up and down fluctuations of the RMB against the middle price of the US dollar have repeatedly appeared, but the process has alternated.
The last exchange-reform measure before the “8.11” exchange reform last year was implemented in 2005, and the renminbi appreciated significantly against the dollar over a decade.
Since the implementation of the new exchange rate reform, the RMB has changed its previous appreciation state, and the middle price of the RMB exchange rate has depreciated by about 8% in a year.
On October 1 this year, the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the RMB as the weighted currency of the SDR (Special Drawing Rights).
This week, the statistics released by the General Administration of Customs of China show that in the first seven months of this year, the total value of China's imports and exports was 13.21 trillion yuan, down 3% from the same period last year.
In the same month of July, China's total import and export value fell by only 0.9% year-on-year, especially the export growth rate of 2.9%.
Relevant experts believe that although there are signs of stabilization in imports and exports in July, there should be no high expectations.
In July, China's total import and export value was 2.09 trillion yuan, down 0.9% year-on-year.
Among them, exports 1.22 trillion yuan, an increase of 2.9%; imports of 873 billion yuan, down 5.7%; trade surplus of 342.8 billion yuan, an increase of 34%.
Although the total value of imports and exports still fell year-on-year, there was an increase in export data, which is the fifth consecutive month of growth since March this year.
Shanghai police caught more than 3,400 thieves in 4 months to crack down on 157 "stealing and cheating" gangs
While cracking the case, the police also recovered a total of more than 33 million yuan of stolen goods.
According to the confessions of the members of the theft gang, they entered Shanghai from the field by means of a black car, and then got off the car to commit crimes, and a few hours later they would hint the car and leave Shanghai together.
In the course of the crime, the suspects often use a building as a unit, using the external wall to climb, and break the way of the anti-theft window fence from top to bottom.
A few days ago, the suspect in the case has been transferred by the Xuhui Public Security Bureau to the Xuhui District Procuratorate for review and prosecution.
The police remind the general public that when going out, they must lock the doors and windows at home, and for the choice of anti-theft windows, it is recommended that the public should choose steel with a harder material.
According to the Voice of China's "News Evening Summit" report, in late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will go to Kenya to attend the sixth African Development Conference.
The African Development Conference is led by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, so this meeting will also be the first time to move to Africa.
Japanese foreign ministry officials said that holding a meeting in Africa will help draw the attention of African and European countries to Japan.
In order to cooperate with Abe's visit, according to Kyodo News Agency, the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan will send a delegation of parliamentarians to relevant countries.
It is no coincidence that Japan's "entrance" road began in the early 1990s, and the African Development Conference initiated by Japan also began in 1993, which is not a coincidence!
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations, which is an important ticket warehouse for the United Nations, and if Japan wants to "enter the ordinary", how can it abandon Africa?
It will also exchange views with relevant people from all countries on the extremist organization "Islamic State" and the countermeasures of terrorist activities.
The Western Group will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida recently outlined his intentions for the African Development Conference at the UN Security Council.
Abe has announced that he will provide 100 billion yen (about 6.1 billion yuan) in aid over five years for the stability of sub-Saharan African countries.
Observers generally believe that Japan's generosity to Africa has always been for two main purposes: one is to increase Japan's presence in Africa; the other is to win the support of African countries on the issue of entry.
Yang Bojiang, an expert on Japan, said: "From a political point of view, although Africa is lagging behind in relative development, the number of countries is relatively large, so Japan has always regarded it as the so-called 'big ticket field'."
Japan will not give up in the future, and the work for Africa will not end there, and it will continue to strengthen.
Economically, because Japan's production capacity is relatively strong, but the domestic market is relatively limited, especially in the context of the aging of less children, domestic demand is relatively low.
However, from Junichiro Koizumi 10 years ago to Abe 10 years later, during which Japan has repeatedly launched a "sprint", but they have returned.
Yang Bojiang, an expert on Japan, believes that Japan's intention to enter is clear at a glance, but the road to normal is bound to be difficult.
To achieve its goal, Japan must first have good relations with its neighboring countries, of which Japan needs to have a correct attitude on both geopolitical competition and national disputes and historical understanding.

Traditional practices introduce new highlights "2016 Olan Culture Festival" Hong Kong Victoria Park Opening
The music of beating gongs, traditional snacks, fancy decorations, and crowded scenes.

In addition to continuing the existing "snap competition", it also adds the "parent-child basin for the baseball game" that the whole family can participate in.
Not only the introduction of the cultural history of Yilan in the form of comics, but also the scene also has a 3D selfie area, a traditional small food area and a traditional handicraft mobile classroom, attracting many children and overseas people to experience and visit.
A couple from France stayed at the event for nearly three hours and experienced it in a mini-flower mobile classroom.
“I found this special holiday online, so I decided to take a look and feel very fresh.”
They said that although France also has a similar festival to commemorate the ancestors, but the atmosphere is very heavy, unlike here, there is music, there is food can also learn traditional crafts.
“In such a busy financial metropolis in Hong Kong, you can also see such a large-scale and organized ceremony of worshipping ancestors,” she said.
“This not only reflects the diversity of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to understand these traditional craftsmanship and pass it on.”
President Hu Yansong said, “We do not want to make the festival of ylangi culture very scary, so that people dare not approach, especially children.”
"We hope that through the activities and arrangements of the scene, young people will know that behind the culture of the festival, we want to express filial piety and gratitude."
He also said that a total of 24 teams participated in the "snap competition", which not only had community organizations, but also cooperated with some schools to allow students to participate.

The enthusiasm of the Mexican audience left a deep impression on the white lady's actor and the young actor Fu Jia.
“I didn’t expect the Mexican audience to be so enthusiastic, I was a little worried about whether they could understand the story, but it was unexpected to see them catch the storyline and a lot of laughs today.”

Liu Yigui went to Sanya to investigate the "double repair, double city" to improve the level of urban construction management
On the morning of the 12th, Liu Yigui presided over the symposium and listened to the report on the promotion of the pilot work of "double repair" and "two cities" in Sanya and the opinions and suggestions of relevant departments.
Liu Yigui fully affirmed the phased results achieved in the pilot work and the good experiences and good practices created.
Liu Yigui stressed that Sanya should seize the opportunity of historical development, take the pilot work of "double repair" and "two cities" as an important starting point, and give full play to the leading role of demonstration in the province's economic and social development.
It is necessary to play a leading role in improving the internationalization level of international tourism islands, start from the details, enrich international elements, and create international boutiques.
It is necessary to play a leading role in urban and rural integration and global tourism, accelerate the construction of characteristic towns, integrate tourism elements into each project, and build every village and town in Sanya into a tourist attraction.
It is necessary to play a leading role in the "100-day action of serving social investment", promote the construction of a number of major projects and parks, ensure the landing of high-quality projects, and implement the requirements of the big action.
Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee, Secretary of the Sanya Municipal Party Committee Zhang Qi, Vice Governor Wang Lu, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government Lu Zhiyuan participated in the research discussion.
In his 14-year career, Deng Yaping won a total of 18 world championships, becoming the first person in the history of the Chinese Olympic Games to win four Olympic gold medals.
She has maintained the world's first for eight consecutive years in the table tennis rankings, and is the longest female athlete in the history of table tennis.
On September 26, 2010, he was deputy secretary-general of the People's Daily and general manager of the People's Search Network Joint Stock Company, and a cadre at the head office level.
A few days ago, she and Yu Minhong will join hands to build the first sports industry innovation and entrepreneurship platform in China.
There are also such a group of star coaches in the Chinese sports world: they have unlimited scenery in the era of athletes and won countless honors for the country; after retiring, they will teach them to the latecomers for many years and cultivate the championship.
As the first world champion of Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yubin chose to pick up the teaching whip after retiring.
From the women's team coach to the men's team coach, and then to the head coach, Huang Yubin created an "Olympic Gold League", and led the team to achieve a mythical record of 9 gold, 1 silver and 4 copper at the Beijing Olympic Games.
Since then, Tian Liang has been advertising endorsements, and has played an important role in "cow Lang" and "Lei Feng" in recent years.
A lot of NBA players have proven their strength. But some people are improving and some are in decline.
Whether it is due to the increase in age or the time to play is limited, there are some players' performance every season.
Of course, some "regressions" may only be a decline in data, and the strength of these players may not decline.
Even though Wade is still one of the best point guards in the league, his performance in the Bulls should not be as good as the Heat.
He and Rhondo's rear-court range is limited, and the three-point shooting rate of the star Butler is only 32.8%, which makes their offensive next season will be crowded.
Coming to the Wind City, the Flash is bound to give more of the ball to Butler and Rondo, who are likely to choose a health game in the regular season.
Ocafor’s situation was more embarrassing, as the first choice for the 76ers last season, he had to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball in the new season.
The competition may not come soon, Simmons still needs to adapt to the NBA arena, and Embid will have to fully recover from the injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafo can have a place in the 76ers is still a problem.
Last season, Okafo scored 32 percent from a low offense, higher than that of Cousins, Vucevic and Brook López, while his usage was also in the league’s top 40.
With Simmons has shown excellent ball-rights potential, and Embiid also has a more suitable stature for NBA games, and Ocafo's status is difficult to be so solid.
Thompson’s usage has been stable in the top 20 of the league in the past two seasons, and it’s been his best two seasons.
The problem, though, is that with Durant’s arrival, Thompson’s usage will certainly go down, which is bound to affect his play.
This impact will not only affect the number of shots, Tang God's ball attack will certainly be greatly reduced next season, which in some ways will also reduce the opponent's defense.
Durant’s arrival will certainly shrink the numbers of the Warriors’ players, but the most serious of these is probably Thompson.
But that doesn’t mean Tang’s level is regressing, which is more like the sacrifice he made for the team as a whole.
Parker was better than the data last season, not only because his under-the-football efficiency came to his career high, but also the chemistry he and Aldridge had benefited from the Spurs.
Duncan retired, Ginobili announced another year of fighting, and the combination of GDP finally came to an end, as the youngest of three people, there was not much oil in the fuel tank of the French sports car.
After getting the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular-season MVPs than James, while Jordan was the only one with more FMVP than James.
Oh yeah, James just brought Cleveland the first professional sports championship trophy of the last 52 years.
James, who came to his 14th season of his career, needed to be better assured of physical strength and prepare for the playoffs.
So in the regular season, James’s numbers are likely to decline further, and he will give more of the burden to Owen, but he will still easily become the top three players in the league.
“We must develop the talents learned from the country in Russia.”
On the 12th local time, Huang Jing, president of the Moscow Overseas Chinese Federation, said excitedly when he saw the reporter of Sino-Singapore Network.
Not long ago, she participated in the "Overseas Chinese Cultural Society Chinese Talents (Calligraphy, Painting) Training Course" sponsored by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council of China and hosted by Jinan University.
Just participated in the training course, I did not know where to start the calligraphy and painting, and as a result, after the training course, I was able to draw and write my own work.
After returning to Moscow, we must use the knowledge and skills you have learned to make our own contribution to the dissemination and promotion of Chinese culture.
At the same time, the Secretary-General of the Russian Chinese Culture Promotion Association, who participated in this training course, Na Yanwei, also felt the same way.
She said that she made great progress with the help of the teachers of the training course, and also felt the heavy responsibility of being an "overseas communicator of Chinese culture".
Na Yanwei said that after returning to Russia, he will definitely spread and promote Chinese traditional culture among Chinese and Russians who love Chinese culture.

The British team won the silver medal in the seven-a-side rugby game, and Fiji won the gold medal.
In the qualifier final on Thursday night, the British team failed to continue their previous outstanding performance in front of Fiji, who were defeated 43-7 at Rio Tiodoro Stadium.
Fiji won the gold medal with its unassailable performance in possession, steal, avoidance, cooperation, running and strength, which is also the country's first Olympic medal ever.
The silver medal is also a great comfort to the defeated British team, the third silver medal won by the British delegation on the day. That was enough to make the British rugby team proud: they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa all the way to the seven-a-side rugby game that entered the Olympic Games for the first time.
Earlier in the day, the British team narrowly defeated South Africa 7-5, which may have affected their status in the final.
But in any case, the Fiji team is now enough to beat a full-spirited 15-man team.
Tomorrow, at least one Briton will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort to the British team, but it may not be. The Englishman is Fiji coach Ben Ryan from Wimbledon, who has served as the head coach of the English team.
It is not easy for the British team to achieve today's results.
Eight years ago, under Ryan’s administration, they didn’t win at the Adelaide International Sevens rugby game.
Now they are just one step away from the championship.
Although they have been hit hard, they have also made amazing progress.
Fiji's opening advantage has made the British team unstrikeless.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it's like hitting a series of running buses. When Aussy Collinsous stormed the corner area, the world series champion team was already far ahead with a 5-0 run.
It was just four minutes after the game, and Jerry Tuhua scored again on the right-wing touchdown.
12 to 0, the British team barely hit the ball.
Mitchell's strong interception left Giants-Lion Nacarava without a third score, but that only slowed Fiji's scoring speed.
At seven minutes, Asa Weilemaru was in the right corner of the tentacle. 17-0, the British team made it worse.
Nacarava scored another point, and the game ... had one minute left in the first half.
Then, Vatmo Lavovo broke through the British team’s defense and went straight to the scoring line.
At half-time, the score was already 29-0.
Fijians are like being born playing seven-a-side rugby, while the British team is still in the beginning.
This is the case.
The British team made a huge change in the second half and hit the Fijian's line of defense for a full four minutes, which was already good in the first half. But then Fiji played a good match, with Joshua Tuesova scoring again.
Dan Norton created the opportunity to score for the British team, he touched the ground in the left corner, changed the score to 36-7, but the game has long been in the control of the South China Sea island countries, their fans on the platform singing loudly, waving flags, singing and dancing.
Fiji's excellent performance makes it necessary to clap its hands quickly.
Matta William stopped an indifferent Fijian attack in the last minute.
The final whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged together, and the defeated British team could only regret leaving.
Earlier in the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, while Britain narrowly defeated South Africa in an intense semi-final match.
Kyle Brown helped South Africa take the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with a good footing.
After that, England Anthony's brother Marcus Watson secured the team's victory with a wonderful interception, and the British team won the silver medal.
Helen Graff and Heather Steinen were inspired by a cancer-related coach to win a rowing gold medal.
It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most exciting gold medal.
From the first paddle to the present, Helen Grave and Heather Steinen have received 220 punitive pull trainings, and the gold medal they won at Estacio da Lagoa has even more extraordinary significance.
Although the paddle was only two of them, there was another person on board - coach Robin Williams - who had been playing with them to impact the second consecutive women's double oars Olympic gold medal, the first pair of rowing women's group in Britain to reach this height.
They have maintained an unbeaten record of 39 games and have an absolute advantage.
What we’re seeing is that these two talented athletes are moving gracefully on the water, but that’s not all about this victory.
Behind every rowing gold medal there are many people who volunteer to help, and it is their constant dedication that creates a difference, and the biggest help is a coach who learned 30 months ago that he had cancer and didn’t know if he could live to see the day.
As he said, death can come at any time.
I had bladder cancer and they operated on me.
If no surgery is done, the cancer cells will spread throughout the body.
In this way, the situation will be much worse.
This will slightly change your mind.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he started treatment in early 2014 and minimized the impact, although it might not be appropriate to say so in this case.
I need to get paid, so I have to get better.
This is an incentive for me.
I was in the hospital, and although they said a few steps was enough, I walked around the ward at 20, 30, 50 feet every time.
This is the starting point of everything.
The rowing itself is a journey, and it makes the journey a little longer.
The first thing they thought of was Williams, who was a little bit more timid than usual this morning, to overcome his anxiety.
Steinin, who was the former captain of the Royal Artillery team, will travel to Afghanistan, saying: "I'm in a very bad mood this week, maybe a little extreme, but this gold medal is really meaningful."
It repeatedly told me how important it was to me, how hard I, Helen and Robin worked.
It was Helen, Robin, and I who worked hard for three years in return.
Without Robin, we would be just a no-name, thank you very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have found a better trainer and coach than him.
Helen Graff and Heather Steinin did not lose in five years.
The punishment set by the combination is unmatched by their opponents.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the New Zealand team and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Graff still have a lot of physical reserves.
It was really scary then.
Helen said, “Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm.”
Not being influenced by the opponent is very important.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn’t expect anything to be earth-shattering.
We didn’t think about today’s glory, we just wanted to draw every paddle and win the game, and we did.
It took a year for the group to decide their future.
Graff will marry TV explorer Steve Buckshal next month.
But now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don’t want to say this is my last game.
This will put too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a whole new experience, and I was very nervous.
It has now been about 4 minutes.
She said, "I feel better."

Compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015), the average annual inflation rate (measured by the consumer price index) for the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) was -0.8%.
Compared to June 2016, the consumer price index for July 2016 was 101.0%, that is, the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.

Snapchat’s ‘Anime’ Effect Accused of Ironying Asians
Snapchat says the filter is inspired by anime, but some observers think it’s racially charged.
Snapchat’s 150 million everyday users can change reality and make portraits comical through its filter tools.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
These lenses have the effect of passivation and bending characteristics, and generate more than 30 million modified selfies every day.
Any mistakes will be immediately noticed by the public.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized for encouraging black people or white skin.
So when the app this week provided some users with a filter that could create oblique, weird teeth, and powdery-face effects, some critics called it racial satire on Asian “yellow people.”
They even see whether these recurring questions mean the company has a big problem with diversity.
After Snapchat said it removed the feature, a report on The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday sparked outrage.
The company’s explanation: The filter is a tribute to anime characters, not satirized Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the harmful stereotypes of reality.
Others also strongly opposed these anime images.
A Korean-American art student who tweeted and was widely shared about the photos said in an email that the filters were “at least distressing and uncomfortable.”
She added: “It is difficult to distinguish between the extremely disgusting Asian satirical image and the effect of the filter.”
Although the filter is not only yellow, but the yellow people are extremely demeaning.
Snapchat isn’t the only company that touches the bottom line of these cultures.
From the company’s board of directors to the devices we carry in Hollywood, American culture seems to have been advocating for diversity and inclusion.
Snapchat’s large young population may be sensitive because it is more racially diverse than the older generation.
When one of Snapchat’s filters produced an image of insulting users, 25-year-old Judy said in an interview on Thursday: “It’s harder to escape the sight than before.”
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and a phone interview, she said she believes the race controversy reflects Snapchat’s lack of racial diversity in hiring.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company’s employees as mostly white, with leadership all male and adding a hashtag at the end of the article: #Delete Snapchat.
As a Chinese-American, Ms. Zhu said, “Either their employees don’t have all kinds of people, so they can make that decision, or there are people of color in their employees, but their positions don’t make them speak freely.”
Other observers shared complaints that she did not respond to by Snapchat.
The company did not release data on employee diversity and said it was a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial context of its employees, but a spokesperson said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on a lower percentage of the population internally and to promote internal inclusion.
Ms. Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account: “I wonder if they need more users who oppose this behavior as we do.”
Congressional panel says military officials have distorted ISIS intelligence
A congressional panel said in a report released Thursday that U.S. Central Command officials have changed their intelligence reports to describe the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than it actually is.
The interim report comes from a special working group formed by Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the House Appropriations Committee's Defense subcommittee. The report said there was "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts who said their superiors were tampering with their assessment of the U.S.-ISIS war.
Central Command (Centcom) in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a report on the report, “intelligence reviewed by the senior leaders of Central Command is more optimistic about U.S. counterterrorism operations than it really is, and is always more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies.”
A representative of the Republican Party of California said: "Central Command's behavior is unacceptable. On one side, our fighters are suffering from war, and on the other, senior policymakers receive the wrong analysis."
The leadership issue of CENTCOM has been extended to the highest level of the agency.
The report details the long-standing problems of Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analyzing U.S. training for Iraqi forces.
While there is no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be changed, according to the report’s description, the analysts felt themselves under pressure from Central Command leaders to express more optimistic views about the threat from the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
The report said that “in the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimony were much more optimistic than they were.”
For example, a Central Command official publicly said that a major military operation to retake Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, is still under Islamic State control.
Mike Pompeo, a Republican representative in Kansas, said in a statement: “After months of investigation, this result is already clear.”
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most of the top intelligence officials at U.S. Central Command manipulated the command’s intelligence products to conceal the Islamic State threat from Iraq.
After the Republican Party learned from analysts that intelligence about the Islamic State was manipulated, it set up a special working group.
As the investigation continues, more will be made after the report, which was released on Thursday.
The Attorney General of the Department of Defense also conducted a long-term investigation of the Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their findings on Thursday, in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
In a statement, the committee’s Democratic leader, She Anda, said in a statement that Central Command’s intelligence assessments of Islamic State and Iraqi peacekeepers between 2014 and 2015 had developed an overly narrow process.
Mr. Sheanda said the process “inhibited the release of intelligence”, reduced the morale of analysts and “unacceptable for different opinions”.
But Mr. Sheanda and Democrats also said they had found no evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on Central Command analysts to make their conclusions “presupposed or politically narrative.”
The Daily Beast reported preliminary results from the congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon attorney general began investigating after receiving a complaint from a Central Command analyst.
Pentagon spokesman Navy Maj. Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Defense Department did not comment on the congressional report until the end of the attorney general’s investigation.
But he said: “Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security topics.”
The impact of the investigation has outpaced the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria was successful, as increasingly claimed by Defense Department officials.
But last year, those claims raised questions about the extent to which President Obama could trust Central Command’s assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of controversy more than a decade ago, when Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Hook wrote a research article in which George W. Bush’s administration, despite the opposition of many analysts, insisted on sending small-scale troops to Iraq and gave little consideration to the post-2003 invasion.
Mr Hook played a key role in this campaign against Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr Hooke’s team’s conclusions that the airstrikes against the Islamic State refinery did not drastically reduce the terrorist group’s economic income because the group built temporary refineries to continue selling oil on the black market, which is very different from the statements made.
According to a September report by Time magazine, Central Command did not release the discovery.
When multiple lawyers reviewed Senate testimony about an overly optimistic assessment of the war, Central Command commander Lloyd Austin III was criticized last year.
General Austin retired in April and is currently replaced by Joseph Wotl in his position at Central Command.
The United States has won four straight in the women's hockey game and will win the win with the UK.
Katie Bam, who was single in a 6-1 win over Japan, took the lead for the U.S. women's hockey team twice on Thursday, helping the U.S. beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games were four, but the 27-year-old said she didn’t know she had such a good performance.
She said, "I don't know anything about it."
I’m not the kind of person who remembers getting myself into a few goals.
What she knows is that the U.S. team has won four straight at the Olympics and will compete with the group in the group for the first group without a losing record after a 2-0 win over Japan on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States met narrowly in the final race of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams advanced to the quarter-finals, which will determine who will appear as the first in the group.
The team that finished first in the group will avoid encountering a strong Dutch team, which will be able to go further. The Netherlands are out of the line as the first in another group.
On Saturday's game, the U.S. team performed a miracle with an amazing performance. Be aware that at the London Olympics four years ago, the U.S. team was at the bottom of 12 teams.
Bam was also on that team at the time.
Bam, who grew up in Brubel, Pennsylvania, first picked up a hockey stick at the age of three (her twin sister was in the sport in Drexel) and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team to date.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she failed to make the final list.
In 2012, she and her teammates were not well-received.
The following year, the Englishman Craig Panam was the head coach and everything started to change.
“This is a cultural, mental and substantive change,” Bam said.
We were not at our current level in London.
We came here for a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam took the lead in the first half with a close-range backhand shot.
India has not yet tasted the results in this game, but the team has shown amazing tenacity and kept the score of 1-0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam broke out.
She took the ball long-distance attack along the left side of the court, and then cut in-hone to the middle road, pumping into the net, the United States team led 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The United States against goalkeeper Jackie Bridges in this game for the first time zero-sealed opponent, in the first three wins, the opponent each scored a goal.
This time she played very often.
Bam as well.
Panam said: "We're in good shape right now." But how good it is depends on the result of Saturday's game.
The Great Meal in the Great Depression.
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had just been elected president, sat in the office of the president for lunch.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt liked the cuisine of Fifth Avenue, such as foie gras and Maryland stew.
On that day, his menu was very simple: ketchup devil eggs, mashed potatoes, and fruit pudding as a snack.
Jane Ziegman said, “This is to share the pain in food with those who are suffering.”
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It also reflects the way Americans eat.”
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Mr. Coe’s last book, “Frying the Scorched Vegetables,” was about Chinese food in the United States, and Ms. Ziegman told the story of the lives of ghetto tenants through food in her book 97 Orchard.
Their new book, The Meritable Meal, will be published Tuesday by Harper Press, about the history of food in the United States during the Great Depression.
After showing some common insights on food, they met a reporter at the sandwich shop in Eisenberg. The simple lunch counter in the iron zone has been in business since 1929.
Ms. Ziegman, 54, ordered a cream cheese with a broken olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable platter.
The reporter ordered a baked meat roll, which the couple thought was suitable for discussing the Great Depression-era diet.
Ms. Ziegman said, “Bread was very popular at the time.”
At that time, there were peanut bread, liver bread, and soy bread.
They are all made with a raw material and a cheap topping head that can be poured on the raw material.
Imagine that your dinner is all peanuts.
Mr. Ke dressed up as a strange man.
He said, "They must be like lead in your stomach."
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, Americans were all buffets, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cook for male farm workers, and there are just-examined pies for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who gave food to hungry Europeans during World War I. The Great Meal chronicles how the country suddenly ceased to be a place of abundance.
Mr. Coe explained why he and his wife wrote the book: “Food had become a major topic of displeasure for Americans at the time.”
Another unpleasant topic is the shabby new food: “fussed food” such as bread and stew becomes the main dish, and stew is the “best way to cook leftovers,” Ms. Ziegman said, because chefs can use the cream in the sauce to cover up the hard-to-eat ingredients.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat that has been starring in the American table for years has become a rare luxury.
The strange hodgepods only consider calories, and the first thing people think about is nutrition than taste, even basic cooking common sense.
In the course of studying the book, including various recipes, Ms. Ziegman made a roasted onion stuffed with peanut oil.
Mr. Ko said, "This is not common at dinner tables."
Ms. Ziegman said: “It’s also very strange.
Peanut oil and roasted onions can not be matched.
This is the characteristic of many family economic meals.
Family economists influence the country’s eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who was head chef of the Federal Bureau of Family Economics from 1923 to 1943, which has historically been unique.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to “fine money” and the courage to turn creamy pasta with bad food like carrots into food.
The Great Meal is a hearty “historical treasure.”
Particularly interesting is the government’s response to the hungry, such as Herbert Hoover, the president’s citizen, who “can’t handle other people’s business.”
While he publicly praised his childhood simple Iowa farmhouse, his diet was as delicate as a millionaire.
Mr. Coe said: “He likes to eat European-style Western food, such as fish with cucumber sauce.”
He was wearing an evening gown and dining in a gilded restaurant.
He was clearly out of the people.
If his wife, Eleanor, hadn’t encouraged him to set an example in his diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As the book says, Ms. Roosevelt hired housekeepers who had no interest in taste, so the White House “food is not only the hardest food in Washington, but also the worst food to cook.”
As soon as the United States returned to normal, many of the Great Depression-era cooking methods were abandoned.
Ms. Ziegman said what left was our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they learned more about Ms. Ziegman’s mother’s eating habits, such as how she did not throw away food.
Mr. Coe said, “She’s very afraid of wasting food.”
Ms. Ziegman recalled: “She actually made many people sick in their lives.”
For example, there has been a "cream puff" incident.
After removing the plate, she and Mr. Coe took out a dessert they had prepared at home: the fruit pudding that President Roosevelt had at lunch.
Ms. Ziegman said: "This is called cream fruit", and added that the name of a new trend for an ordinary dish is "the usual trick."
There is no whipped cream in this dessert, only fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly removes the styling into the sticky brown paste.
Surprisingly, the dessert tasted good.
Mr. Koe ate the second and third spoons.
He felt that it was an acceptable and affordable dessert, so he told his wife: "Add a little broken walnuts to eat."
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, and Saudi Arabia's production reached a new high.
The report does not ban the market to cast doubt on OPEC's credibility, and the road to recovery in oil prices is likely to remain thorny.
On Monday, Qatar’s energy minister, Saada, OPEC’s rotating chairman, said OPEC would hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on Sept. 26-28.
OPEC's monthly report on Wednesday showed that the entire Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), including Gabon, rose by 46,000 bpd in July to 33.11 million bpd.
OPEC also said in its monthly report that the low price of crude oil has prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil products, which has increased the degree of oversupply in the market.
Affected by this news, coupled with the increase in U.S. crude oil production expectations and the unexpected increase in crude oil inventories, international oil prices have fallen for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday's close, the price of light crude oil futures for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 2.48%, and the price of London Brent crude futures for October delivery fell by 2.07%.
Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of oil-producing countries is unlikely to significantly tighten supply, and the data released by the US Energy Information Administration also suppressed market sentiment.
Iran's official news agency, Fars, quoted Iranian oil minister Zangane as saying on Wednesday that Iran's crude oil production was at 3.85 million barrels per day, the highest level since 2008.
As soon as the meeting broke, Russian Energy Minister Novak said that there was no need for a new round of frozen production negotiations under the current oil price.
The last meeting was in April, and OPEC members failed to reach an agreement on any measures.
Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMI Research, said markets and media outlets could overreact to the upcoming meeting of OPEC.
Helima Croft, head of commodities strategy at the Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC had changed market sentiment by sending signals that they would broker the deal.
This means is like a smoke and a mirror that opens people’s eyes (deliberately giving the wrong impression).
Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank, said the chances of OPEC trying to stabilize the market through the September meeting were low.
This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, after all, the organization staged a "wolf."
All localities should focus on spot checks on medical institutions that have illegally issued medical advertisements, concentrated complaints and reports, and have been punished many times before.

According to media disclosure, due to the large-scale influx of capital into Internet medicine, resulting in the current problem of homogenization of products is serious, the investment boom is gradually retreating, and capital enters the wait-and-see period.
According to the data of the Hong Kong Alipi Hospital Management Research Center, the Internet medical company died a large number of deaths within a year of entrepreneurship, and about 20% of the start-up Internet medical enterprises no longer exist.
However, just as most Internet medical companies are struggling with round A or B round of financing, there are still several leading companies in the subdivision area that can still gain capital.
It seems that the Internet medical entrepreneurship can not be "a bee", but to look at the market demand, sink to do special, do deep.
Yu Yue invested 12.00.00 million yuan, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, and Kyushu Tong Instrument Company invested 18.00.00 million yuan, accounting for 60% of the registered capital.
In recent years, with the country's policy support in medical informatization, electronic and integrated supply chain management systems have gradually entered hospitals at all levels.
The cooperation between Yu Yu and Kyushu Tong is aimed at the needs of the market, helping hospitals to build advanced supply chain management systems, and taking this opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet medical companies, iBaby has focused on the vertical field of Internet obstetrics since the beginning, and has cultivated both the sides of pregnant mothers and doctors.
The pregnant mother can not only consult with the competent doctor for free 24 hours and one-on-one, but also pay for targeted medical consultation.
On the doctor's side, iBaby breaks down geographical restrictions by organizing experts to give grass-roots doctors online lectures, peer exchanges, case discussions and other micro-lectures.
At present, the doctor's side has opened three sections, namely, the doctor's continuing education, the doctor's social interaction and the doctor's help.
Provides services including online learning, case discussion, academic exchange; social platforms with hospitals and doctors in the same department; legal assistance, entrepreneurial support and other services required for doctor-patient relations or personal life.
According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently said that Ali Health is "willing to sink his heart" to win health big data.
Internet companies and data companies lack professionalism, and the writing methods on the same term cannot be unified.
Ali's current layout in the field of medical health is divided into three parts, namely Ali Health, Tmall Medical Museum and Alipay Future Hospital.
Wang Lei admitted that medical health entrepreneurship will be more difficult than other industries, "this is not just a matter of how much money, but also to sink heart, can withstand loneliness slowly to do."
Staying up late to see the Olympic Games is easy to damage the heart
The Brazilian Olympic Games are in full swing, and even if the event is broadcast in the middle of the night, many citizens will stay up late to watch.
In this regard, the doctor especially reminded that there are health risks when staying up late to see the game, which may cause cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up late for a long time, the hormone will still be secreted in large quantities, the human body will continue to be in a state of tension and excitement, can not get a normal recovery, easy to cause vasocal contraction, blood pressure rise, thus causing cardiovascular disease.
In particular, Han Zhiyuan reminded that groups with cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipids, smoking habits, and family history will be more likely to cause cardiovascular disease if they stay up late.
If you stay up late for a long time, not only the cardiovascular function is affected, but also the gastrointestinal function, the immune system, the neuroendocrine system will be affected, and even the risk of tumor will increase.
For elderly friends, Han Zhiyuan suggested that try not to stay up late in order to watch Olympic competitions, especially groups with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last "World Cup" football game, Han Zhiyuan had treated a patient in his 60s who was triggered by a myocardial infarction or related to staying up late to watch the game.
Han Zhiyuan introduced that since the beginning of this year, his department has received some patients with heart muscle infarction or stroke around the age of 25, which is largely caused by the patient's long-term stay-up lifestyle.
Do not stay up late every day, occasionally stay up late to watch your favorite sports, other projects may wish to wait for the next day to watch the replay of the event.
When staying up late, add water and eat more fruits, which can prevent blood vessel blockage and enhance the body's immunity.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union brought missiles into Cuba, almost leading to a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.
This event is regarded as the peak of the Cold War, known as the "Cuban Missile Crisis".
What is less well known is that during the Cold War, a powerful solar storm nearly led to a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was not first announced by researchers until August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a powerful solar storm caused strong interference with U.S. military radar and radio communications in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the U.S. ballistic missile early warning system, which is used to monitor Soviet missiles.
The paper, completed by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed U.S. military personnel who were involved in forecasting and analyzing solar activities at the time, and consulted non-confidential literature.
In the 1960s, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly launching a nuclear war, the U.S. Air Force always had some warplanes with nuclear warheads flying in the sky.
U.S. military commanders did not know that the main culprit of the interference was the solar storm, not the Soviet Union, and ordered the aircraft to enter a state of combat readiness.
Fortunately, solar activity by the U.S. military since the late 1950s and its study of electromagnetic interference with Earth have ultimately prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he compiled the information provided by the Air Force Aviation Weather Service and submitted a detailed report.
As a direct result of the solar storm, the U.S. military has since dismissed space weather as a combat concern and has built a more robust space weather forecasting system.
In the daily travel, the public found that the car was hindered by unfamiliar vehicles, and in the case of not contacting the driver of the unfamiliar vehicle, the "WeChat Removal" function can be used to solve this problem.
Since August 11, Xi'an Traffic Police WeChat service number "Xi'an Traffic Police" has launched a "WeChat Releasing Car" service.
After the launch of this service, in daily life, when unfamiliar vehicles are hindered by the driver's driving in the presence of the driver, they can solve such problems by using the "WeChat mobile" function.
The first function of this new service is fast and saves administrative costs; the second is to respect and protect the privacy of citizens; the third is all-weather and full-time service.
As long as the public has WeChat, you can operate it very easily, which can be relatively convenient to "meet" between both sides of the car, alleviate the difficulty of parking, and reduce the occurrence of car-related public security cases.
On the other hand, for owners who refuse to move cars, illegally park or obstruct traffic, the Xi'an Traffic Management Department said that the traffic police will take different disposal measures according to the actual situation and deal with them according to the situation.

On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly released a new version of the "U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation Guide" in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role in the world.
This is the day the United States Secretary of Defense Carter, U.S. Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Kishida Wenxiong and Japanese Defense Minister Nakata attended a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth time that a Chinese private think tank has published an assessment report on Japan's military strength, and it is also the fourth time that the English version has been
The report is divided into nine chapters, including overall policy adjustments, military strength, defense budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, institutional reform, military training exercises, foreign military security cooperation, and military security relations with China.
The report said that 2015 was the year of the Abe government's phased closing of major policy adjustments in the security sector for several consecutive years.
Since then, Japan's measures in the field of security will mainly be in the operational aspects of the application of the rule of law, strategic implementation, policy implementation, etc., rather than the substantial adjustment and change of frameworks, mechanisms and policies.
The report stressed that the Abe cabinet tried to achieve the multiple purposes of promoting Japan's "normal nationalization", the self-defense force to go out and intervene in international security affairs, strengthen the Japan-US alliance, and prevent China from China.
Previously, the China Strategic Culture Promotion Association released the evaluation report of Japan's military strength on June 5, 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014, and June 30, 2015.
The Financial Times released a collection of U.S. ambassadors to China on August 12.
In contrast, the U.S. ambassador’s residence is, in terms of appearance, can be used as a safe house in the next film adaptation of the John Le Carre Cold War spy novel.
The residence is gray and is closely guarded by perimeter guard bars, a second inner wall, barbed wire and vehicle barricades.
Complementing the Shortcomings of Public Sports Facilities
The black coal farm warehouse has become a "green grass" football field; the red brick spire factory has become a modern sports hall.
On the National Fitness Day, the South-Leading Horse Camp Sports and Culture Park outside the Wangjiang Gate in Hangzhou unveiled the mysterious veil.
It was once a coal farm, which has been idle after closing more than a decade ago, leaving a lot of illegal buildings and household waste.
After the rectification, it has become a sports and cultural park, and will be officially opened to the public in November, providing free sports venues to the public, which will undoubtedly open up a new fertile land for all sports.
This can not help but remind people of Hangzhou Chen Jinglong Sports School, the Chinese swimming world champion "Wangpu Military School" swimming out of a number of world champions.
The name of the swimming world will continue to emerge, vividly interpreting the relationship between competitive sports and national sports - the rich mass base provides good conditions for the selection of professional players.
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the basis of national sports, and competitive sports depend on national sports in a certain sense, and national sports depend on the conditions of the venue.
According to reports, as of 2015, China's per capita stadium area has been 150 times that of the founding of New China, but still far behind the sports power.
In June this year, the State Council issued the "National Fitness Plan (2016-2020)", which will focus on the development of mass sports.
In order to make up for this short board, on the one hand, the relevant departments should fully consider the layout of the stadium when carrying out urban planning.
On the other hand, the public sports venues that have been built, including those in schools and other units, should expand the scope of opening up as much as possible and improve the efficiency of use as much as possible.
At present, the Rio Olympic Games, which are in full swing, stimulate people's enthusiasm for sports and awaken everyone's sense of participation.
Gilead gets attorney's fee in battle with Merck's hepatitis C patent
According to a U.S. District Judge’s decision, Gileed Science is entitled to attorney fees arising from patent litigation against pharmaceutical company Merck Group of the United States.
In June, after a U.S. judge discovered an illegal act by Merck, including perjury and other unethical behavior, Gilled was exempted from $200 million in damages for Gilead’s best-selling drugs, Sofsubwe and Harwney, who infringed two of Merck’s patents.
In Thursday’s lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Beth Lamberson Freeman said Gilead did not have to bear the costs incurred in his defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilled, who dominates the new-generation hepatitis C drug market. Gilled's drug can cure more than 90 percent of hepatitis patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, both claiming to be the owners of the lab work in Gilead’s drug, the lab work of Sofsbuvir.
U.S.-backed forces announce they have retaked Manbij from Islamic State
A troop spokesman said Friday that all the remaining Islamic State soldiers in the city have left, and U.S.-backed forces have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border.
After the militants who hid in the city left, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping the city.
Sharan Darwish of the Syrian Democratic Forces Alliance's Manbij Military Commission told Reuters they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians abducted by militants.
He told Reuters: "Manbij is now under our control, but we are still doing a sweep."
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax.
Hillary Clinton released her 2,105 tax return on Friday, showing the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earning $10.75 million in 2015 and paying 34.2 percent of federal taxes.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable donations, most of which went to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton’s speech bill was nearly $5.3 million, while the former secretary of state received $3 million from publishers Simon and Schuster with a book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton’s running mate, Virginia State Senator Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holden, released their 10-year tax return.
The two paid 20.3 percent of the federal tax in 2015.
Clinton's campaign aide, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement: "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine will continue to be benchmarks for financial transparency."
In stark contrast, Donald Trump used false reasons to cover up and retract his previous promise to publish his tax returns.
Although the law does not require it, as is customary, U.S. presidential candidates should make their tax returns public.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyers used the IRS audit as a reason to refuse to release a tax return.
Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams tweeted that you were in charge and attached a link to the tax returns of the Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Trump’s special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release his tax returns until the audit was completed.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns raised questions about his net worth of capital, charitable donations, business deals and various other relationships, including his relationship with Russia.
Clinton seized on the issue and lashed out, releasing an online video on Friday that highlighted high-profile Democrats urging Trump to release his tax status.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in her economic policy speech in Michigan.
She told the crowd that “for decades he refused to publish his tax returns, as other presidential candidates do.”
According to Politico News, Trump paid almost no penny in taxes in the 1990s for two years, and the New York Times business columnist on Friday cited a number of tax lawyers and accountants who said the situation may still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a major issue in the presidential race.
Clinton named Warren Buffett after billionaire investor Warren Buffett gave a rule that guaranteed people earning more than $1 million a year to pay at least 30 percent in taxes.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire Hathaway is based, where Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also being audited by the IRS, and that Trump was “afraid” not of the tax authorities but of voters.
The earliest tax returns released by the Clinton campaign were in 2007.
The Clintons, who currently reside in Chabak, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and a combined rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, they earn just $100 in wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons had a dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Jewish filmmakers criticise Berlin hotel for removing Israeli phone code in response to Arab customers' "requests" - Reuters News
A French filmmaker of Jewish descent told the media that the Kempinski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli phone codes, and that the hotel staff said it was in accordance with the "demands" of Arab customers, which triggered an uproar in public opinion.
Claude Lantzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary The Hob, expressed his disappointment at the Kempinski Hotel and published an open letter in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in Germany.
During his recent stay, Lantzman wanted to find Israel on the list of phone codes at the hotel.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can speak directly from the room.
Did Israel disappear in 2016 in Berlin?
Lantzmann wrote.
Instead, guests can make calls to Israel through the Kempinski Hotel’s call center.
In search of an explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel’s front desk.
In the letter, Longzman said the answer he received at the front desk "shocked him."
Hotel officials said it was a “deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski Hotel.”
The reason for this is that the filmmaker is even more angry.
Longzman quoted the employee's original words: Most of our guests are Arabs, who are demanding the removal of the Israeli code."
According to the Südde Zeitung, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas Handassmann, called the incident a “shameful disgrace.”
We were surprised to learn of this incident.
That in itself is a great shame.
And what happened in Germany and the hotel chain is even more embarrassing.
This matter does not require any explanation.
“We hope the hotel will come to the right conclusion,” the official said.
The incident sparked a heated debate online, and everyone thought it was a scandal.
Some people think that the Kempinski Hotel is simply "groveling" to meet the requirements of Arab customers.
Another post pointed to the hotel as “unfathomasy” and pointed out that the street on the famous Kudam Street was near a synagogue.
According to Der Spiegel, the hotel quickly clarified all the allegations, claiming that everything was “negligent” and “apologies” to Longzman.
The Südde Zeitung quoted a representative of Kempinski as saying: “Never gave a direct order to remove Israel from the Quick Dial list.”
The newspaper also said the Israel code had been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to expel Brazilian students protesting
On Thursday, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with police in protests of reforms to the government’s public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to evict protesters.
The incident was caused by law enforcement officials trying to disperse the students, so police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the march to express their dissatisfaction with the programs.
To save money, Sao Paulo Gov. Okmin plans to close 100 public schools and transfer 300,000 students.
Some of the students who participated in the protest expressed their dissatisfaction with interim President Michel Temer through the graffiti on the wall.
Just days before the most recent protest, protesters took to the streets collectively in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the national Senate.
Scottish cyclist Karm Skinner returns after winning the gold medal in cycling
Scottish cyclist Karm Skinner last night in the Rio cycling arena men's team racing helped the British trio successfully defend the Olympic gold medal after the 2012 London Olympics.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist took the place of his fellow Scottish compatriot, Sir Chris Hoey, as the centre of the team. Even the legendary cyclist was proud when the young Skiner beat the favourites to win the title and return to his reputation.
Four years ago, the British team was amazing, and Hoy won the fifth of the six Olympic gold medals.
The British team finished sixth at the World Cycling Field Championships in London in March, and Hoy retired from the time. Then, the British team made another streak.
During the Beijing Olympics to the London Olympics, the problem for the British team was to replace the "first round of expert" Jamie Staff.
It was only when the team showed up that the team did.
Hoy’s retirement also left a gap, and both Cheyn Imadi and Matt Crampton wanted to fill that gap.
After seeing the potential of Skinner, the British men's coaching staff insisted on his selection to the national team, and Skiner finally lived up to expectations.
Skinner's partner was Hinds and Kenny, who won the gold medal with Hoy four years ago. The three set a new Olympic record in the qualifying round, but this result was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
The three British cycling races eventually defeated their opponents and won the gold medal.
Although Hindes was slightly behind, Kenny took the lead for the team, and Skinner held that lead to the end.
The change in strategy was key to this reversal, with Hindes choosing larger flywheels, which were slower, allowing Kenny, and in particular Skinner, to keep their pace.
Hoy watched the game as a BBC commentator. Skinner, Kenny and Hindes saw him on the podium.
Skinner, a 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist, said: "It flatters me."
I just do my best to make myself famous.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champion.
This is unbelievable.
There is nothing better than this victory.
After winning gold with Kenny and Hoy at the 2012 London Olympics, Hinds admitted to deliberately falling on the track in a poor start.
Later, he withdrew the comments, and the British opponents were unable to appeal.
This victory has no such problems.
Hinds said: "It's like in London, the platforms are all British flags."
We just formed the team three months ago.
We’ve lost a lot of world championships, so it’s amazing to be able to defend the Olympic champion.
This is just a game and a gold medal for the British team, which won seven of the 10 venue cycling gold medals at the Beijing Olympic and London Olympic Games.
If this symbolizes the progress we have made over the past five months, we will continue to succeed in the cycling hall for the next five days.
According to Kenny's performance, he is not impossible to reproduce Hoy's feat of winning three gold medals at an Olympic Games.
If that were the case, Bhoey was 12 years younger and also on March 23 (a day that seemed like the sacred day of British sports, when Steve Redgrave, Mo Fara, and Roger Bannister were born on that day) Kenny, who was born, would have had six gold and one silver medal.
This achievement is in line with Hoy.
Kenny will play today for three days of racing.
The 28-year-old Bolton said: “I will be focused on this game for the time being.
Team racing is always the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
Frankly speaking, it is a little lonely for one to win.
Hindes said: “If he can win two other gold medals, he should be awarded the Jazz title”.
It was the only match that produced a medal that day, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Dürry advanced to the four-kilometre team chase with the fastest score.
Their score was 351.943.
The world record for the 2012 London Olympic gold medalist is 351.659.
The first round and the final (10:42 p.m.) will be held today for the second match, and Wiggins will undoubtedly be the focus of attention.
Yesterday he had an argument with the match officials before qualifying, when the tournament officers asked him to measure his height.
In the women’s group match, which will end tomorrow, Laura Trotter, Joanna Rosell Sunder, Eleanor Buck and Kate Archibald from Milgay advance to a new world record of 413.260.
The British team relied on the powerful field cycling team to take the initiative in the middle of the Olympic Games and won a number of medals.
After showing its absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympic Games, the British cycling team was slightly disappointed in their trip to Rio.
There were many setbacks during this period, including the resignation of April technical director Sean Sutton on sexist and bullying allegations and the retirement of legends such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first race night at the bike hall is enough to prove that the British team will once again stage the legend that the key moment has reached its peak.

Even through decentralized, modular time to learn and work, she can basically complete the task and achieve good results.
But when the task was heavy and time was tight, Amy felt very pain and torture.

Some behavioral psychologists also understand impedance as an individual’s disobedience to their behavior.
I tried to get Amy to do an exercise that allowed her to calm herself down and feel the suffering by breathing and relaxing.
Once she left the trapped situation, she felt relaxed and regained her freedom.

Uber’s entry into the Taiwanese market for four years has had a significant impact on the local traditional taxi industry.
Taiwan's "United Daily News" said on August 12 that more than 100 taxis bypassed Taiwan's "Executive Yuan" on the morning of the 12th to protest, resulting in severe traffic paralysis around the area.
Zheng Lijia, chairman of the Taipei City Drivers' Union, said that Uber had been in Taiwan for four years, and Taiwan authorities had only held a meeting at the end of this month, and the drivers could no longer wait.
However, the government is untrustworthy and delayed.
Law-abiding taxi drivers who belong to the bottom of the workforce, but want to compete with the illegal but unrestricted Uber, feel cheated by the authorities.
Original title: 2000 chickens of a farm in Jiangsu were sold to the court without authorization
After the judgment came into effect, because Li did not automatically fulfill the obligations determined by the judgment, Wang applied to the Shuyang court for enforcement.
On October 16, 2014, the Shuyang court made a civil ruling, ruling that all of Li's farms were detained for 2,000 laying hens, and they could not be transferred or sold without permission.
After receiving the detention ruling, Li sold some of the laying hens that had been detained on the farm without the permission of the Shuyang court.
When the public security bureau of Shuyang County investigated on March 8, 2015, there were only 142 laying hens left in the farm.
The reporter was informed on August 12 that the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games Organizing Committee issued a notice indicating that the Beijing Winter Olympic Organizing Committee inherited intellectual property rights such as the emblem and logo of the Beijing Winter Olympic Winter Games.
Without the permission of the Beijing Winter Olympic Organizing Committee, no one may use the emblem and logo of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games for commercial purposes.
The person in charge of the Industrial Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out here today that excess steel capacity is a global issue.
In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate is higher than the global average, and it is also higher than that of the United States and Europe and other countries and regions.
China has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess capacity, and the results are gradually showing.
The person in charge pointed out that the Party Central Committee and State Council attach great importance to the global issue of excess steel production capacity.
All departments and regions have actively implemented the deployment of the State Council and worked hard to reduce crude steel production capacity by about 45 million tons this year.
From the perspective of China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports, on the contrary, it also takes a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The person in charge stressed that the international trade of steel products is essentially a market behavior, which is an independent choice after the demand of the importing country and the comprehensive consideration of product cost performance by consumers.
The implementation of trade protection measures will not help to fundamentally solve the development problems of the global steel industry, but on the contrary, it will only have a further impact on the international trade order.
When talking about debt, the person in charge stressed that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly handled in the process of resolving excess capacity.
Due to the large-scale assets of steel enterprises, involving a wide range of debt, some enterprises have complex debt relations, and if they are not disposed of properly, they may cause regional risks.
According to the person in charge, in recent years, with the increase of downward pressure on the economy, the overall demand of society has gradually weakened, the capacity utilization rate of some industries has declined, and the production and operation difficulties of enterprises have increased.
Some enterprises do not adapt to the changes in the market environment, production and operation is unsustainable or even close to bankruptcy, but subject to some institutional and institutional factors, there are more obstacles to exit in a market-oriented way, becoming a "zombie enterprise".
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of the use of factor resources, increases the cost of social management, and hinders the establishment of a fair competition market environment.
The main cause of the loss is the same as the difficulties faced by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low capacity utilization.
China mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic means and rule of law methods, and the government is mainly to do a good job of working hard and social stability to ensure a fair and just market order.
The person in charge stressed that the next step is to unswervingly continue to do a good job in production capacity and ensure the completion of the target task of resolving 100 million to 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity in five years.
On the afternoon of the 10th, the Chinese tourist police immediately attracted people's attention when they made their debut in Moscow's Red Square, and Chinese tourists waved with surprise, and locals and foreign tourists could not help but stop and look back.
On the same day, members of China's first professional tourism police team, the Tourism Police Detachment of the Public Security Bureau of Sanya City, Hainan Province, came to Moscow Red Square to exchange and study with the local tourist police on duty.
The Moscow tourist police were divided into three groups of patrols in Red Square, Nikolisky Pedestrian Street, Gum Department Store and other places, and the Chinese tourist police studied together with the post, which lasted for more than an hour.
Liu Shine, a police officer in her 20s and fluent in English and Spanish, has just joined the tourist police last year.
Along the way, he carefully observed a word and line from his Russian counterparts and communicated with her from time to time.
When encountering Spanish tourists to come to consult, the Moscow tourist police explained patiently to each other in fluent Spanish, which impressed Wang Bing.
“Everyone in Moscow’s tourist police knows a foreign language, and some have more than two doors, which is a very big touch for us.”
"Hainan, as an international tourist island, is gradually attaching importance to attracting international tourists, and we hope to improve our ability to match the status of international tourism islands."
On the same day, before studying with the post, the Chinese tourist police also went to the Moscow City Tourism Police Brigade to communicate with their Russian counterparts.
“I often deal with Chinese tourists and it’s great to see them traveling to Russia.”
“The questions they usually ask for are: how to go, where is a monument, how to rent, how to get back to the hotel.”
Moscow City Tourism Police Brigade leader Resakov said that in recent years, Moscow's urban environment and tourism atmosphere have become better and better, and the attraction for foreign tourists is increasing.
In order to meet the needs of tourism development, a tourism police force was established in July 2014 to patrol and defend major attractions and help and guide tourists.
At present, all Moscow tourist police are proficient in English, and some also speak Spanish and German.
The police brigade divided them into nine groups based on their foreign language level and took two lessons a week to learn self-defense, laws and regulations and foreign languages.
“There are currently two tourist police officers who have started learning Chinese, and we are already saying it well, and we have to continue to improve their Chinese language,” Resakov said.
Resakov told reporters that since the establishment of the Moscow tourism police, it has accumulated a certain experience and hopes to inspire the Sanya counterparts.
He believes that the cooperation between the police departments of Russia and China will enhance the security of their citizens to travel to each other's countries.
“The recruitment of Moscow tourist police personnel, the police mode, the equipment, and the good interaction with tourists have brought us a lot of inspiration,” Chen said.
Reporters combed and found that at least nine provinces and cities, such as Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian and Beijing, have issued implementation rules for residence permits.
For the conditions for applying for a residence permit, the above-mentioned areas generally propose that they need to live for more than half a year, and meet one of the conditions for legal and stable employment, legal stable residence, and continuous study.
China News Network reporter noted that in terms of the treatment provided by the residence permit, the "gold content" varies from place to place, and the scope of public services and convenience provided in some regions has been expanded compared with the provisions of the national version.
These areas have increased the convenience for children to participate in the local college entrance examination under the relevant conditions.
In addition, Beijing and other places have also explicitly requested that the scope of providing public services and facilities be gradually expanded, and that they be regularly announced to the public.
For example, Fujian proposed that the scope of public services and conveniences enjoyed by holders of residence permits should be announced to the public at least once every three years.
The Provisional Regulations on Residence Permits stipulate that if they meet the conditions for handling residence permits, the public security organ shall, within 15 days from the date of acceptance, make and issue residence permits.
For the time limit for issuing certificates, most areas are in line with the national version of the opinion, that is, within 15 days.
Hebei made it clear that for those who meet the requirements and complete materials, the public security police station of residence shall issue a residence permit within 3 working days from the date of acceptance.
Jiangxi stipulates that if the conditions for applying for a residence permit and the certification materials are complete, the public security organ shall, within 5 working days from the date of acceptance, make and issue a residence permit.
In accordance with the provisions of the Interim Regulations on Residence Permits, the above-mentioned areas are clear, apply for a residence permit for the first time, and are exempt from the cost of the certificate worker.
For example, Sichuan requires that local public security police stations or commissioned community service agencies strictly implement the approved charging items and charging standards, and resolutely prohibit exceeding the scope, exceeding the standard charge or ride-sharing charges.
After investigation, on July 27, 2016, Chen Yangxia, the former secretary of the Dingnan County Party Committee of Ganzhou City, reported to work in the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission and served as the director of the party style and political style supervision office (deputy director level, trial period of one year).
The red wine consumed that night was provided by Li Youcai personally, and the other expenses were borne by Liu.
The Jiangxi Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission reported that Chen Yangxia, Cheng Ziliang and others organized and accepted food invitations in private clubs, violating the spirit of the eight regulations of the Central Committee and violating the party's discipline.
Pogba ate two yellow cards in the Coppa Italia last season and will be automatically banned under the rules.
Although he has returned to the Premier League, the FA still extended its cumulative ban to the Premier League.
As a result, in the August 14th away against Bournemouth game, Pogba will be on the wall, his return to Manchester United debut will be extended to the 20th home game with Southampton.
As the first round of the No. 12 rookie in 2014, Saric will officially land in the NBA next season and join the Philadelphia 76ers.
As a young European player, many fans do not know him very well, but through this Olympic Games, I believe that Saric's performance has left a deep impression.
In the last Croatia win against Spain, Saric managed to cap Paul Gasol in the final moments to try to drag the game into the basket of overtime.
Recently, the 76ers coach Brett-Brown gave Sarwich a high rating, the Spurs manager thought he saw the young Manu Ginobili shadow of Saric.
It’s clear that Saric has shown his talent and has kept the 76ers looking forward to him.
In Croatia's first two games at the Olympic Games, Saric scored 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Saric showed his ability to pull space on the pitch, and after blocking off his teammates, he was able to shoot outside the three-point line.
Although the 76ers currently have a lot of talented young players hoarding the inside, they do not have Saric's external ability.
From the cap to launch a long-distance fast attack and complete the assist, there are only a handful of insiders who can do this in the NBA today.
Since the start of the Olympic Games, Saric has averaged 13 points, eight rebounds and five assists in three games, and his performance has been comprehensive.
Since his decision to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014, James has signed two successive 1+1 contracts.
As the NBA’s current collective bargaining agreement enters its final year, as vice president of the NBA Players Union, James will be at the forefront of the negotiation of the collective bargaining agreement.
Given the sharp rise in league revenue, thanks to the new TV deal and the fight between bosses and players over how to handle the money, there are fears the NBA will be shut down next summer.
But for James, he won’t have to worry about becoming a free agent next summer because he has renewed a three-year contract with the Cavaliers.
No matter when the 2017-18 season officially began, James is within his contract.
Since the stunning appearance of the iPhoneSE, the mobile phone market has also ushered in the boom of small screens.
Not long ago, Nubia also launched the first work of its Z11 series: nubia Z11mini.
The nubiaZ11mini continues its consistent remarkable photo-taking gene and is equipped with a one-handed, easier-to-hold 5.0-inch screen, and easy-to-use rear fingerprint recognition, making it a great experience.
Nubia's just-listed small-screen camera phone Z11mini reduced by 200 yuan, that is, from the original 1499 yuan to 1299 yuan.
In terms of appearance, the Nubia Z11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen, and the bottom of the front is still the classic "Little Red Circle" design.
The midbox is metal material, and the bottom is symmetrically designed and configured with a Type-C data interface.
The future of the Portland smelter is uncertain due to the cancellation of the power supply contract.
With the company that revealed that a plant owner would terminate a supply contract, leaving all supply contracts invalid, the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria and hundreds of workers at the plant are currently facing an uncertain future.
The move comes after the Victorian government decided not to continue issuing subsidies to guarantee the operation of the plant.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will end in November.
The 2,000 workers at the Alcoa Portland plant could face job losses.
Once the plant closes, up to 2,000 people may lose their jobs directly or indirectly.
And because the plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity output, there may also be a chain reaction.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Hanry Point smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesey power plant last year.
Alcoa’s Portland smelter is currently losing money and is at risk of closing.
The move came after forecasting the plant in the coming years, initially due to a strength of the Australian dollar, and more recently because of the price of the factory’s products.
AGL provides electricity to the large aluminum smelter through the Latrob Valley Old Ey Young Power Plant. The company predicts that three other plant owners will also terminate their agreement.
The largest shareholder of the plant is a joint venture between Aluminium and Aluminium, while China's CITIC Group and Japan's Maruben Co., Ltd. also hold a small stake.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand,” the joint venture said.
AGL said the contracts were “hedging contracts” that should have been in effect since November 2016.
The contract is terminated for 12 months, so they will be terminated in 2017.
“As a result, AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in fiscal 2017,” the company said.
Any revenue impact that could occur on AGL since fiscal 2018 is currently subject to an optimistic outlook on wholesale electricity prices in the futures market.
AGL said it had written down $187 million in contract value in the “Expectations for Termination Activities.”
Aluminium said its decision to terminate the contracts “will not affect the ability of Aluminium to operate the smelter or guarantee the power supply of the smelter.”
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with Ey Young in 2010 that would have taken effect in November, but the company did not explain why it pulled out of the contract.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant, near Newcastle, will be closed because of the industry’s poor economic situation.
In response to comments made by analysts earlier this week, AGL operations chief Steven Mickelson said Portland’s annual electricity consumption reached about 600 megawatts and the Tomargo plant reached about 900 megawatts.
If the two factories close, the demand in the electricity market will be greatly reduced.
“As a power company, this is not good news for us.”
Community Law Center shuts out 160,000 people every year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centers each year. Funding for the service is already stretched, and further funding cuts are now being faced.
In Queensland, three out of every five people are denied access to free legal advice and agency services, mostly seniors, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the resources to fight unfair evictions.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limit and is now facing further funding cuts.
From June next year, the federal government’s funding for these legal centers will be reduced by another 30 percent.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Centre, said thousands of people were turned away each year, according to the latest National Community Association Law Centre survey.
Mr Farrell said the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change the existing decision.
“The long-standing underfunding of Queensland’s Community Law Centre means that thousands of people will not be able to access the vital services they need,” he said.
People who need to be far from violence, people with huge debts that cannot be repaid, families facing disintegration, crushed workers, are facing legal problems, and the report shows that they do not get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by another 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We call on Attorney General and Queensland MP George Brandeis to immediately reverse these decisions to cut funding so that people can get the help they need in the face of legal issues.
Last year, the state government pledged to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
Attention must now be paid to community legal centres and their needs for the communities in which they correspond, and the Baileqi government must also be engaged in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign indicted for staff pulling gun
NEW YORK: Trump’s campaign was indicted for inaction by the head of Northern California who pulled his gun at a staff member while driving a Jeep in February.
Vincent Bodini, a former software trainer for the state’s campaign, described the incident in a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bodini said he had hoped the matter would be resolved internally, but after months of waiting, he realized “it couldn’t happen.”
According to Bodini's description, the head, named Earl Philippe, "pull out a pistol, put his right index finger on the board, and pointed the muzzle at Vincent's knee."
After complaining to the leadership of local and regional campaigns, Bodini learned from the dossier that at least four others had experienced the same thing.
Bodini said in the complaint: "No shooting does not mean that there will be no harm."
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential candidate in North Carolina told the crowd that if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was elected and picked the judge she loved, then “the people who support the Second Amendment,” that gun owners and gun enthusiasts, could take action, sparking outrage.
Trump's campaign said the media took his words out of context and he did not advocate violence.
In his complaint, Bodini asked the campaign to compensate for its neglect, while also asking Philip to pay for his assault, assault and mental injury.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the news.
I can't get in touch with Philip.
According to a local news agency in Charlotte, WCCB, Philip recently left the campaign.
His consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, did not respond to calls right away.
The Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has been controversial.
Both sides in the case are Bodini and President Trump Campaign Company, 16-CS-14300, General Court of the High Court of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must pass on the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our community, London and the country as a whole.
For me, this is the charm of Heathrow, and as we did at the 2012 London Olympics, we did everything we could to ensure that our countries and regions could benefit from these events.
The Olympics have benefited Stratford and the East.
And we will benefit the region again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
In our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and lift the young people around the airport out of the jobless situation.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, some people thought the Heathrow expansion was too large.
I was told that the UK would not be ready for the Olympics and that we would be disgraced in front of the world.
The skeptics are wrong about the 2012 Olympics, and their skepticism about the Heathrow project will also be proven wrong.
While there will always be obstacles to overcome, Heathrow is solving every problem.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not a few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs and bring economic growth of £211 billion, leaving a fortune in technology and jobs around the airport and across the UK.
We have a fantastic Heathrow project team. The team has completed a £11 billion infrastructure investment project on time and within budget, including Terminal T5, which has been elected as the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years, and Terminal T2, located between two of the world's busiest runways.
Now they are preparing to build a third runway with £16 billion in private investment.
The UK has successfully hosted the London 2012 Olympic Games, and I am confident that the Heathrow expansion project will also be a huge success.
It is time for us to deliver the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow so that we can protect our future and create a wealth of technology and jobs that make the whole of the UK proud.
Lord Paul Dayton is Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Heathrow Airport and former Commercial Counsellor of the United Kingdom Treasury
A woman commits suicide on a Swiss motorway and has been killed.
The victim lay on the highway at midnight.
The woman, who tried to kill herself, was tossed by a number of vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning. Police are currently searching for witnesses.
The accident happened on the A1 motorway near Morges, Vau, in the early hours of Thursday.
Police in the canton of Vaud said a woman was “desperate” lying on the road late at night and had been tossed by multiple cars.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who had apparently suicidal intentions. She was slapped by a number of vehicles, including a van.
The woman died instantly.
Police said several of the drivers involved had been investigated, but some of them had not been identified. Police were calling on them and witnesses to the accident to come to the investigation.
Lawyer Giles Hofsteter told the Geneva Tribune that a criminal investigation had been initiated, which was the usual process for such incidents.
However, it is not known if the driver will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofsteter said: "It will be determined by the prosecutor."
Based on the results of two other similar cases over the past five years, the driver will not be liable.
According to the newspaper, both cases were caused by someone walking onto the highway late at night. The final verdict was that it was impossible for the driver to expect that a pedestrian would cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with negligence causing death, including in August 2014, when she hit a man and killed him on the A1 motorway near Payne.
The court was informed that the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking alcohol.
After the investigation, the judge said that the female police officer was completely legal in her driving behavior at the time, and that the man's appearance on the road was "completely unexpected and unpredictable", and that the female police officer later called the emergency call.
Anyone who can provide information about the incident near Morge on Thursday should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once suitable for human habitation
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was once suitable for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Research have developed a model that explores the past of Venus, which uses tools and algorithms that are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, with high surface temperatures, waterlessness and a carbon dioxide atmosphere, has ever had an environment similar to Earth.
Previously, scientists believed that Venus's rotation rate was slower because its atmosphere was thicker.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus may once had a thinner, Earth-like atmosphere at a slower rate of rotation.
The model also shows the early terrain of Venus.
Venus may have more dry regions than Earth, but there were once enough water and geographical changes to nurture life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the sunlight shining on Venus was 30% brighter than Earth’s.
Anthony Del Genio, a scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Research, explained at a press conference: “In the model simulation of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Venus’s slow rotation takes nearly two months to make its side of the day.”
This warms the surface and produces rain that can form thick clouds, which, like an umbrella, block most of the sun’s heat to the ground.
The result of the simulation is that the average climate temperature of Venus is actually a few degrees lower than that of Earth today.
The model simulates the evolution of Venus similar to previously speculated by planetary scientists.
Although life may have existed on Venus, Venus has been exposed to excessive temperatures and ultraviolet rays over the course of billions of years.
The oceans on the planet evaporated, and water vapor was also burned out by ultraviolet light.
With the escape of hydrogen, only the thicker atmosphere of carbon dioxide and the deadly greenhouse gas effect are left, thus forming the Venus we know today.
The researchers published simulations of new Venus climate models in the journal Geophysical Research Newsletter.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche manager
Patrick Roy, who stepped down as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche Ice Hockeys on Thursday, said he had no say in the team’s decision-making level.
Colorado executive vice president Joe Sachis confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new manager.
In a statement, the 50-year-old Roy said, “For the past three years, it has been with energy, passion and determination that I have fulfilled the duties of Colorado Avalanche head coach and vice president.”
I’ve been thinking hard all summer about how to improve this team and take it to the next level.
To that end, the goal of the manager and vice president must be in line with the club’s goals.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team’s performance.
However, these conditions have not yet been met.
Sachis hired Roy on May 23, 2013, and he thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sachis said: "Patrick told me about his decision today."
We are grateful for his contribution to the club and hope he will be successful in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach in the first season of the 2013-14 Avalanche team.
He helped the club score 112 points, numbering in the central division. But Colorado was eliminated by the Minnesota team in the first round of the playoffs, missing from the playoffs in the last two years.
In the 2015-16 season, the Avalanche team scored 39 wins, 39 draws and 4 losses, and finally lost the second wild card qualification in the Western Conference League area by 5 points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups, each winning two for the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanches.
North Sea oil field workers stop strike, continue negotiations
The chief negotiator said workers in the North Sea oil field had halted the strike on pay, and the parties to the dispute had begun a new round of negotiations.
There have been several strikes on oilfield services company Wood Group on the North Sea oil platform operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement, “Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of resolving the current dispute.”
We will start early next week and hold multiple full-day meetings in the coming weeks to revisit these issues.
The union said its recent action was aimed at protesting a pay cut that could reach a maximum of 30 percent, the first in 25 years.
Wood Group has reduced North Sea contractors by about 9 percent this year due to market pressures.
Prior to the pay cut, the company reduced its compensation for offshore contractors by 10 percent in 2014.
The company said that another pay cut will help the company through the market depression.
Shell has laid off thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries as a result of the company’s merger with British Energy, British Gas Group, needed to streamline its operations.
Energy companies are facing pressure from falling crude prices and Britain’s June Brexit decision.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute of the North Sea generation.
He said the North Sea is crucial for the regional economy.
In a statement, Dave said: “In the North Sea and in the country as a whole, we need an economy that serves the majority, not the minority.”
In 2016, spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to not exceed $1.4 billion, compared with an average project expenditure of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation velocity of the star of the Aung Su cluster
The Kepler space telescope's latest mission has helped astronomers collect the most complete rotation velocity of the star cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the star cluster has different rotation velocity and the association of the rotation period with the planet.
Lusa Reeble, a research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said in a press release: "We hope to further understand the relationship between the mass, age, and even the history of the solar system by comparing our results with other clusters of stars."
The Aung Su cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in this cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are still just reaching adulthood.
They reach the highest rotation speed in their lifetime.
At the maximum rotational velocity, these mature stars eject a large number of stellar winds.
When these stellar winds pass through the star’s magnetic field, they brake on the star.
As the star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measured the rotation velocity of each star by tracking the time of the appearance of the recognizable stellar sunspots (like the sunspots).
The latest velocity datasets show that the larger stars are moving at slower than the lower-mass stars.
Reeble compares the stars to dancers, who spin more slowly than smaller dancers.
“In the ‘ballet show’ of the Aung Sue Star, we found that stars with slower rotations tend to be of large mass, while the stars with the fastest rotation rate are often the lightest stars,” Reebble said.
Because the cluster is relatively close, it can be used as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing the mass and rotation velocity of stars.
According to Reebble, “The Aung Sue cluster laid the foundation for a two-way rotation theory of young and old stars.”
We still have a lot to know about how, when, and why stars slow down their rotation and “putting away their own dancing shoes.”
In three new papers, Reeble and her colleagues detail their latest analysis of the rotation speed of the Aung Sue cluster. The three papers will soon be published in the journal Astronomy.
Zheng Jianjun, chief of the water management section of Nanhu Park, said that the deepest depth of the water bottom of the South Lake is more than 10 meters, and those who do not understand the water under the circumstances are likely to be in danger.
"Although the South Lake rescue team is very professional, it is still hoped that the majority of boating tourists can put on life jackets, do not do illegal actions on the lake, and play safely," Zheng Jianjun said.
The village has a unique marine environment, with two major leisure tourism resources: natural ecology and human ecology.
“But the individual owners who bought the parking spaces in the community, for fear of doing so, would affect the rental price of their parking spaces, and they suspected that others had selfish interests, so they had been behind the destruction, resulting in the renovation of the parking spaces being put on hold.”
The academic statement of when the sweet potato was introduced by who, there are still many different statements.
In the current mainstream view, the introduction of sweet potatoes mainly has three lines.
Among the three lines introduced by sweet potatoes, the most influential and widely spread is that Chen Zhenlong was introduced to Fuzhou by the Philippines.
The Beijing Municipal Office of Social Group Management will carry out special inspections on the use of unified receipts for social group dues.
The inspection is divided into two types of unit self-examination and key spot check.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Municipal Association Office, the scope of this inspection includes the social groups that have obtained the unified receipt of social group membership fees in the municipal associations from 2013 to 2015.
In its 2012 strategy for the dissemination of the Olympic Games, the Rio Organizing Committee said: “The success of the Olympic Games is defined by those who share stories on social media.”
From the report of this Olympic Games, various media have made great changes in communication mode, product form, language style, news perspective and many other aspects than in the past.
The IOC and media practitioners around the world seem to be facing this round of challenges.
On August 11, the public offering of H shares of Everbright Securities entered its final day. It was reported that the market reaction was flat two days before the prospectus. According to the plan, it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18.
A domestic brokerage analyst said that the foundation of Oriental Securities in Hong Kong is not good, and its asset management business is the director of Dongshang. Compared with BOC International, CITIC Securities and other banking brokerages, it is innately insufficient.
Experts pointed out that since this year, with the return of the securities market, many brokerage performance has declined, but after the company's listing, it is necessary to look more at the development of the company's own business, and cannot be generalized.
After the introduction of this new regulation and control policy, Suzhou will become the first second-tier city in the country to restart the purchase restriction.
The second-tier cities that have introduced or will soon introduce property market regulation and control policies are not only Suzhou, but also Hefei, Nanjing and other cities.
Previously, Hefei has taken the lead in issuing a limited loan policy, and for buyers who have two homes in Hefei's name and have a set of housing loans that have not been settled, the bank will refuse to provide mortgage services.
