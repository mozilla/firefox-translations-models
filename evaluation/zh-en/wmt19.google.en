According to British media, Adm. William Moran, the U.S. Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, said that even as the U.S. Navy is revitalizing its strength to deal with increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States continues to focus on the Asia-Pacific region - the Pentagon is focusing on the region The scope is expanded to include the Indo-Asia-Pacific -- as the Navy&#39;s focus.
According to a report on the British &quot;Jane&#39;s Defense Weekly&quot; website on September 24, the United States listed China and Russia as strategic competitors in the new national defense strategy announced at the beginning of the year.
The U.S. Navy has since reinstated its Second Fleet to more directly counter Russian activities.
According to reports, these moves have caused some doubts and concerns among allies and analysts, who worry that the U.S. Navy may move away from the &quot;Rebalancing to Asia-Pacific&quot; strategy that marked the Obama administration.
But Admiral Moran said the U.S. Navy&#39;s focus remains on the Western Pacific.
&quot;For us, there have been no significant changes,&quot; he said at a roundtable discussion titled &quot;Responding to the Challenge of the High Seas&quot; hosted by the National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington on January 24, 2018.
&quot;The emphasis remains on rebalancing, shifting focus or however you want to describe it,&quot; Moran said.
However, he acknowledged that the United States has close relations with Europe.
&quot;We&#39;re going to continue to focus on growth on the West Coast and balance what we can do,&quot; he said.
While Moran noted that overall policy regarding Russia falls within the purview of the U.S. secretary of defense, he warned: &quot;The Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has proven that if we conflict with them, they will be very tough. &quot;
Admiral Moran said that as part of the U.S. comeback campaign against Russia, China and other competitors, the U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying forces into a &quot;new operating model&quot; that will help adversaries fight U.S. aircraft carriers. Unprepared for where swarms or other assets will be deployed at any given time and place.
&quot;We in the Navy and Marine Corps support it -- the concept of operational unpredictability, not being in the same place over and over again, almost like clockwork -- that&#39;s our approach,&quot; he said.
According to reports, the first to try this new approach was the &quot;Harry Truman&quot; aircraft carrier strike group. The early deployment of the strike group included working visits to ports and patrols in areas that were usually only passed through.
Moran said the Navy is currently working to ensure allies know the ships will still patrol traditional areas and is also working out logistics and family liaison issues for the new deployment process.
Vice Admiral Michael Noonan, commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also spoke at the event, saying that the Australian military can cooperate seamlessly with the US aircraft carrier battle group.
He said this would continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to acquire nine more frigates equipped with the Aegis combat system.

Japan&#39;s Itochu Corporation recognized an impairment loss of US$1.3 billion on its investment in China&#39;s CITIC Holdings on Friday, writing down its largest corporate investment transaction due to the impact of trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, a man walked past the headquarters of Marubeni Corporation in Tokyo, Japan.
Marubeni said that the trade war has impacted its U.S. grain unit, Koh Hung, and it has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies, etc. have previously warned about the impact of Sino-US trade friction when announcing their latest results. Now these Japanese trading companies have also joined the ranks.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other&#39;s goods, and U.S. President Trump has threatened to expand the scope of the tariffs to all more than $500 billion of Chinese goods exported to the United States if the dispute cannot be resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Chief Financial Officer of Itochu Corporation, said that the impact of the trade dispute on the Chinese economy may be greater next year.
Itochu Corporation and Thailand&#39;s Charoen Pokphand Group invested US$10 billion in CITIC in 2015, acquiring 20% of its equity.
Hachimura said Itochu had booked a 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) loss on this part of the holding because it believed CITIC&#39;s share price would not rebound in the near future.
Itochu Corporation maintained its profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 at 500 billion yen.
China imposed a 25% import tariff on U.S. soybeans in July in retaliation for Washington&#39;s moves in trade friction.
&quot;Our grain business has been hit by the U.S.-China trade friction,&quot; said Marubeni Chief Financial Officer Nobuhiro Yabe.
He said that Gao Hong has stopped financial transactions in his account since September.
Gaohong spokesman Pat Burke said in a statement on Friday that the company&#39;s move was &quot;in accordance with internal policy restrictions and due to a lack of market opportunity.&quot;
He also said the suspension of financial transactions would not result in a loss of jobs.
Marubeni kept its annual profit forecast of 230 billion yen unchanged, helped by its pulp and paper and power generation businesses.
Sumitomo Corporation on Thursday reported a 16% profit increase from April to September, emphasizing that &quot;the trade issues between the United States and China have led to an uncertain outlook.&quot;
Mitsubishi Corp on Friday raised its annual profit forecast to a record level, citing rising coking coal production and rising commodity prices such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Corporation also announced a new business plan, striving to increase profits to 900 billion yen (US$7.98 billion) in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, from this year&#39;s estimated 640 billion yen.
China News Service, November 5, reported comprehensively that the countdown to voting in the U.S. midterm elections has entered.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic opponents actively &quot;drove votes&quot; from their core voters.
Both major parties pointed out that voter turnout will be the key to the election.
According to reports, 48 hours before the American people voted, Trump was busy attending rally events for Republican candidates, while former President Obama went to Indiana to campaign for the critical Democratic Senate candidate Joe Donnelly. He stood on the platform and shouted his final demands to the crowd before the election.
On November 4, Trump went to Maycomb, Georgia, to support Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp. He said: &quot;You have to go to the polls on Tuesday, and you have to vote. &quot;
&quot;The contrasts in this election could not be clearer. &quot;
Voters&#39; political enthusiasm has reached a rare peak, with early voting in some states far exceeding usual levels.
When every U.S. president faces his first midterm election, his party&#39;s number of seats in Congress often decreases.
According to a new poll released by the Washington Post and ABC News on the 4th, although the Democrats still maintain an advantage in the House of Representatives, Republicans can benefit from economic assessment and Trump’s views on border security. benefit from rigorous attention.
Polls show that registered voters prefer Democratic House candidates to Republicans, 50% to 43%, but this is still down from a 14-point lead in August.
Another poll conducted by NBC and the Wall Street Journal also showed that Democrats still lead Republicans by 7 percentage points.
It is reported that Obama told the crowd at Senator Donnelly&#39;s rally: &quot;When people don&#39;t tell the truth, when words no longer mean anything, there are bound to be consequences.
Democracy doesn&#39;t work when people can only lie to themselves. &quot;
&quot;The only way to stop these Republicans right now is you and your vote.&quot;
The Democratic Party faces its most difficult election in the Senate in decades, with Republicans currently holding a majority of 51 seats.
However, the situation in the House of Representatives is more favorable. The Democrats need to win 23 more seats to control the 435-seat House of Representatives.
According to analysts at FiveThirtyEight.com, an election prediction website, the Democrats have an 85% chance of winning the House of Representatives.

People&#39;s Daily Online, Beijing, November 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) Under the current wave of &quot;mass entrepreneurship and innovation&quot;, more and more technology companies have begun to pay attention to patent research and development and related protection work, deeply explore the potential value of patents, and occupy the market. Dominance.
Similarly, many technology companies have encountered considerable infringement incidents in terms of patent technology licensing and patent technology use.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong, and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province filed a lawsuit against Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiaoju Technology), the developer of the &quot;Didi Chuxing&quot; APP, and Didi Chuxing, the operator, on the grounds of patent infringement. Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Chuxing) and the seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) sued the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order the three defendants to immediately stop manufacturing, selling, offering to sell, and using the plaintiff&#39;s patent.
On October 30, 2018, the China Judgment Documents Network published the &quot;First-instance Civil Ruling on the Invention Patent Infringement Dispute between Tan Wei, He Zhanghong, et al. and Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.&quot;, which disclosed the parts of the Didi Chuxing APP that were accused of patent infringement. Case details.
The three plaintiffs believe that the patentee and inventor of the &quot;mobile terminal-based carpooling service system and method&quot; patent, and that the entire operation process of the &quot;Hitchhiking&quot; application in the &quot;Didi Chuxing&quot; APP corresponds to the technical solution protected by the patent involved, constitutes patent infringement.
However, during the court ruling, Xiaoju Technology believed that Guangdong Pacific was not a qualified defendant. It only provided free downloads of the involved APP &quot;Didi Chuxing&quot; on the Internet and did not implement the patent method involved. There was no direct or indirect infringement. behavior and should not be named as a defendant in this case.
Secondly, the place of infringement in this case is not in Guangdong.
According to legal provisions, the place of infringement of the patent involved in the case should be the place where the patented method involved in the case is completely implemented. Therefore, the court raised an objection to the jurisdiction and requested that the case be transferred to the court where the defendant is domiciled, that is, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the allegedly infringing Didi Chuxing APP product on its online platform, and it was not inappropriate for the plaintiff to name the defendant Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
Moreover, the defendant Guangdong Pacific&#39;s domicile is in Guangzhou City, which is within the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. advocated that the case be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial. However, due to insufficient basis, the defendant Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. rejected the objection to the jurisdiction of the case and bore the costs of accepting the jurisdiction objection case.
At present, other trial status of the case has not been announced, and reporters will also pay close attention to the subsequent details of Didi Chuxing’s patent infringement case.
Exclusive interview with the CEO of the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization: Australia-China scientific and technological cooperation has achieved remarkable results
&quot;China&#39;s science and technology have developed rapidly in the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve fruitful results by working together in the scientific field. &quot;
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, said in an exclusive interview with a reporter from China News Service in Beijing that from addressing climate change to cooperation on the &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot; project, Australia-China cooperation in the field of science and technology is showing great vitality.
As the largest national scientific research institution in the Australian Commonwealth, CSIRO has achieved many innovative research results that have attracted world attention in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials, astronomy and other fields.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperative relations with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
&quot;This is an enduring friendship that embodies trust in partners and a tradition of long-term cooperation,&quot; Marshall said.
In May this year, China&#39;s 500-meter spherical radio telescope - &quot;China Sky Eye&quot; installed the world&#39;s first 19-beam L-band receiver.
This 19-beam feed receiver, currently the most advanced in the world, was jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on CSIRO’s years of technological accumulation. After its launch, the FAST survey speed will be increased by 5 to 6 times, and at the same time, it will also expand more scientific observation targets.
&quot;This is CSIRO&#39;s contribution to FAST. &quot;
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO also has close cooperation with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of square kilometer array radio telescopes, research and development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.
&quot;Previous scientific research often focused on problems hundreds of years in the future, but now more scientific research power is needed to solve the problems in front of us. &quot;
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and at the same time, both countries face a series of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather occurs frequently around the world. Droughts and floods have led to reduced food production. Food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, issues such as population explosion, aging, and chronic diseases are also serious challenges we are currently facing.
&quot;The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has mainly focused on solving these current problems. &quot;
Marshall said that the International Southern Hemisphere Ocean Research Center, jointly established by CSIRO and the Qingdao National Laboratory of Marine Science and Technology, focuses on observing the El Niño and La Niña phenomena, studying the relationship between them and extreme weather, and establishing the basis for extreme weather Early warning facilities; new cereal varieties jointly developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to overcome extreme weather can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
&quot;In the current environment, technological innovation is difficult to complete alone, requires extremely high costs, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today. &quot;
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it is to achieve breakthrough progress, which is also the significance of Australia and China strengthening cooperation under the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; framework.
&quot;Strengthening bilateral cooperation, for us, is mainly cooperation in science and technology. &quot;
For example, Marshall said that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide. Because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a gold purification method that causes less environmental pollution.
&quot;We are very willing to introduce this technology to China. This is one of the results of our participation in the &#39;Belt and Road&#39; cooperation. &quot;

North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued implementation of sanctions is deepening North Korea&#39;s distrust of the United States and that North Korea cannot unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea has adopted &quot;very friendly practices&quot; in the past year, including stopping missile and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
&quot;But we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States,&quot; he said.
&quot;If we don&#39;t trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security. Under such circumstances, we cannot give up our weapons unilaterally first. &quot;
Although Ri Yong Ho repeated North Korea&#39;s complaints about the United States&#39; opposition to &quot;phased&quot; denuclearization, his speech was significant because it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization as North Korea had done before.
Ri Yong Ho mentioned the joint statement between Kim Jong Un and Trump on June 12. At that time, Kim Jong Un agreed to work towards the &quot;denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula&quot; and Trump promised to protect North Korea&#39;s security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says it must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
&quot;The United States insists on &#39;denuclearization first,&#39; and increases sanctions and pressure to achieve its goals in a high-pressure manner, even refusing to issue a &#39;declaration of the end of the war,&#39;&quot; Ri Yong-ho said.
“The idea that sanctions will bring us to our knees and beg for mercy is a pipe dream for people who don’t understand us.
But the problem is that this continued sanction is deepening our distrust. &quot;
Ri Yong Ho did not mention plans for a second Trump-Kim summit that the U.S. president mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he highlighted the three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months, saying: &quot;If the other party to denuclearization was South Korea instead of North Korea, denuclearization on the Korean peninsula would not have become so stalemate. . ”
China announced that it will reduce import tariffs on 1,585 tax items starting from November 1, 2018.
Since the beginning of this year, China has successively taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1st this year, a comprehensive tax reduction on drugs was implemented, and the import tariffs for a total of 28 tax items, including anti-cancer drugs, all common drugs, alkaloid drugs with anti-cancer effects, and actually imported Chinese patent medicines, were adjusted to zero.
At the same time, the value-added tax burden on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs has been significantly reduced.
On July 1, taxes will be reduced on 218 tax items of automobiles and parts.
After the tax reduction, China&#39;s vehicle tax rate has been lower than the average level of developing countries, which is in line with the reality of China&#39;s automobile industry.
This tax reduction will promote industry structural adjustment and optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the survival of the fittest, and help improve the quality of products and services. It is expected to promote automobile price adjustments to a certain extent and provide consumers with more benefits.
On July 1, taxes will be reduced on 1,449 tax items for daily consumer goods.
Tax reductions on daily consumer goods are closely related to people&#39;s needs for a better life.
This tax reduction is not only large in quantity but also powerful, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
Tax reductions on daily consumer goods will directly benefit consumers and help domestic industries improve their competitiveness.
On November 1, tax reductions will be implemented on 1,585 tax items of mechanical and electrical equipment, parts and components, raw materials and other industrial products.
Appropriately reducing import tariffs on some urgently needed domestic industrial products can attract more foreign investment, help increase domestic effective supply, and help industrial upgrading. It will also help companies allocate resources globally and reduce production costs. It will also help Reduce the pressure on the domestic environment.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Tariff Commission Office of the State Council of China, the above four independent tax reductions, as well as the third step tax reduction implemented on July 1 this year based on the results of the negotiations to expand the scope of the information technology agreement, will make China’s overall tariff level drop from the previous year. of 9.8% dropped to 7.5%.
The adjusted overall tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than that of most developing countries, and is at a moderately low level, basically matching China&#39;s developing country status and development stage.
According to the person in charge, the overall level of tariffs, as one of the important indicators of the degree of openness of China’s goods trade, should be adapted to China’s economic development stage and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China ranks first in the world in terms of trade in goods and has the economic foundation to further open up. However, the quality and efficiency of trade development still lag behind those of developed economies. Therefore, the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately reduced.
Tariffs are a means of protection for compliance. Tariff levels should be compatible with industrial competitiveness and healthy competition should be encouraged. Over-protection is not conducive to industrial development and quality improvement.
The adjustment of tariff rates must take into account both production needs and consumer needs.
Focus on reducing tax rates on commodities with large domestic demand that are conducive to industrial transformation and upgrading, and strive to increase the import of specialty and advantageous products for which the people&#39;s needs are relatively concentrated, continuously enhance the sense of gain for enterprises and the public, and meet the needs of upgrading the industrial structure and consumption structure.
Tax reduction efforts must take into account the affordability of fiscal revenue and industrial development.
In the selection of specific tax reduction products and tax reduction ranges, it is necessary to coordinate the domestic and foreign markets, the upstream and downstream aspects, and the relationship between production and consumption to maintain the stable and positive development momentum of China&#39;s economy.
The person in charge emphasized that this year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. China&#39;s initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure based on China&#39;s own needs to achieve high-quality development. It is conducive to the coordinated use of both international and foreign resources, promoting the improvement of the quality of the domestic supply system, and meeting the needs of the country. The consumption upgrade needs of the people.
This action and measure shows that China will unswervingly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win opening strategy, firmly support economic globalization, resolutely safeguard the principles of free trade and the multilateral trading system with the WTO as the core, and continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the world. It also allows China’s development to better benefit the world.
Serbia has announced that it has entered the highest state of combat readiness. The President of Serbia and Russia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo.
Nantong News Agency quoted the Serbian Presidential Office as saying that Serbian President Vucic ordered the country&#39;s armed forces to enter the highest state of combat readiness in view of the Kosovo Special Forces occupying the access to the Gazivoda Hydropower Station Reservoir Lake controlled by Belgrade in northern Kosovo. .
On September 29, Serbian Defense Minister Vulin declared that the Serbian army has entered a state of full combat readiness.
Vulin emphasized that as long as the order issued by Vucic remains valid, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo, and no matter which direction the situation develops, the Serbian army will respond.
According to the Russian TASS news agency, on September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he had informed the United States, Russia and Europe of the current situation and would go to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on October 2 to discuss the Kosovo issue. to seek Putin’s support.
When asked whether Serbia needs military support from Russia like Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: &quot;I don&#39;t want a major military conflict on our territory. &quot;
Vucic also said that the Serbian army entered a state of full combat readiness only to form a deterrent to prevent conflicts from occurring, but it was also a clear warning: Any violence in Kosovo will never be tolerated.
The reason why the Serbian army has improved its combat readiness is related to two major actions taken by Kosovo.
According to Serbia, in recent days, Albanians have been arresting Serbs who have lived there for generations in northern Kosovo, and these arrested Serbs have not violated any laws.
Vucic said that since Marko Juric, the head of the Serbian government’s Kosovo and Metohija office, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo Albanian army on March 26 this year, the Albanians have continued to escalate the situation in the region and carried out inhumane acts against the Serbs. arrests and deportations.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the ROSU special forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, armed police and snipers, which were recently self-declared, occupied positions near the storage lake of the Gazivoda Hydropower Station and entered the ecological and ecological environment near the embankment in the northern part of Kosovo. Sports Center and blocked all nearby roads in areas originally controlled by Serbia.
Vucic pointed out that Kosovo’s military adventure was instigated by Western countries. The Kosovo army’s actions were not notified to Serbia in advance, which violated paragraph 1 of Chapter 9 of the Brussels Agreement and also violated adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military-technical agreement between Seko.
Vucic has already called out NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg, criticizing Western countries&#39; hypocritical rhetoric on the Kosovo issue.
The root cause of the current conflict is still the centuries-old historical grudge between the Serbian and Albanian communities in Kosovo.
Regarding the ownership of Kosovo, the Serbs and Albanians each have their own opinions.
Serbia regards Kosovo as the birthplace of the nation and the cradle of culture, because Serbia established its most powerful country here in the 12th century, and ethnic Albanians only immigrated in large numbers after the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the defeat of the Serbian army in the north.
The Albanian people insist that the Illyrians, the primitive tribe who lived in Kosovo in the 4th and 5th centuries BC, are the ancestors of the Albanian people. Therefore, Kosovo has been the territory of the Albanian people since ancient times.
Subjective political divisions have resulted in fierce conflicts between different ethnic groups, religions and cultures, and fierce confrontation between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo.
In 1912, Kosovo Albanians first declared Albania&#39;s independence.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanians living in the Balkan Peninsula moved to Turkey, and the proportion of Serbs increased relatively. In the eyes of the Serbs, the practice of &quot;just taking back their own land&quot; was regarded by the Albanians as &quot;a big deal&quot;. The plunder of Serbianism&quot; intensified the conflicts between the two ethnic groups.
Kosovo has become the &quot;powder keg&quot; of the Balkans.
In 1999, armed conflicts broke out between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police, which led to NATO forces bombing the Yugoslavia Federation composed of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Kosovo War broke out.
On February 17, 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.
Although there was news that Serbia would normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, due to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints, the agreement was not able to be signed due to the constraints of the United States, Europe, Russia and other parties. .
Just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he advocated the separation of Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo, once again making the conflict between the two communities public.
Power and communication are still interrupted, Indonesia&#39;s strong earthquake and tsunami make rescue difficult
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early morning of the 30th, a strong earthquake and resulting tsunami in Donggala County, Central Sulawesi Province, the country on the 28th, has killed 420 people.
Wilem Rampangliei, head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, said that this number is only a preliminary statistics from Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi, about 80 kilometers away from the epicenter. Due to the lack of large-scale search and rescue machinery, many hotels, shopping malls, shopping malls, etc. in the city collapsed and were damaged by the earthquake. Warehouses and other densely populated buildings have not yet been searched and rescued.
On September 29, 2018 local time, in Palu, Indonesia, a bridge damaged by an earthquake and tsunami collapsed and broke into several sections.
Due to severe damage to power and communication facilities, the epicenter of the earthquake, Donggala County and the adjacent Xiji area are still &quot;isolated islands&quot; that cannot be contacted, and the number of victims cannot be counted.
According to media reports here, Indonesian Vice President Kalla said the death toll may reach thousands.
Power interruption, communication interruption, road blockage, airport damage... Rescue work after strong earthquakes and tsunamis is full of difficulties.
Due to power outages, some hospitals and relief sites in Palu rely on fuel to generate electricity.
The roads in and out of the city were blocked by landslides, making it impossible for large transport vehicles including oil tankers to enter, making fuel supply very tight.
Indonesian Social Minister Agus said that due to road damage, the ministry mobilized emergency relief materials such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food, and household kits from South Sulawesi and Gorontalo provinces adjacent to the earthquake area. It has not yet arrived in the disaster area.
Disaster relief materials deployed from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster area via air force transport planes.
In view of the damage to the Palu Airport control tower and runway in the earthquake, in order to ensure safety and ensure rescue, all commercial flights have been grounded, and only military aircraft transporting relief supplies and personnel can take off and land.
Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs Wiranto, who is directing the rescue in the earthquake area, requested that power supply and airport commercial flight services be restored as soon as possible to ensure the operation of hospitals and other rescue institutions, so that more rescue workers, volunteers, and aid supplies can be transported Arrive at the disaster area.

China News Service, Beijing, October 1 (Reporter Yin Li) The sky is clear and blue, the sky is clear, and the sky is full of colorful clouds... Recently, Beijing has continued to turn on the most beautiful blue sky mode, attracting thousands of Beijing residents to show off pictures on social platforms. He continued to express his happiness on the screen, saying, &quot;Under the blue sky and white clouds, the &#39;drunk&#39; skyline is the best business card of Beijing.&quot;
Since August, Beijing has welcomed the “bluest sky”.
Within the capital, people can be seen taking photos anytime, anywhere, with smartphones or SLR cameras.
On social platforms such as Weibo and WeChat Moments, you can see the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, Bird&#39;s Nest, Hutongs, etc. in the lenses of netizens everywhere... Various buildings show different beauties against the blue sky.
Some netizens said that such &quot;scenery blockbusters&quot; are the best city promotional videos in Beijing; some netizens joked that if such blue skies flooded the screen for a long time, people with cervical spondylosis would be cured; some netizens hoped that &quot; This touch of blue can survive winter and welcome spring and summer, making the sky of the capital blue all year round.&quot;
Why do people in Beijing love to bask in the blue sky so much?
Just because people living in this city suffered from smog in the past, they were particularly eager for blue skies. However, after the &quot;Blue Sky Defense War&quot; was launched in Beijing and the air quality was continuously improved, the smog became less and the blue skies became more. The joy in my eyes is in my heart, and the happiness I get is particularly weighty.
On National Day, the weather was fine in Beijing.
At 8 a.m., the vast majority of the city&#39;s 35 air quality monitoring stations showed &quot;first-class excellent&quot; green.
The &quot;Bluest Sky&quot; themed photo contest initiated by the public on social platforms is still ongoing.
Why is the sky in Beijing so blue recently?
According to the relevant person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, in August this year, the average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 micrograms/cubic meter, setting the best record for the same period in the past five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 in September frequently reached single digits.
A major factor in the emergence of the &quot;bluest sky&quot; is that the meteorological conditions have been generally favorable in recent times. More importantly, Beijing has continued to carry out air pollution control. In the past five years, it has vigorously promoted the clean air action plan and continued to release environmental benefits, making the region The total amount of pollutant emissions has been reduced, which has laid the foundation for continued improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially released and implemented the &quot;Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017&quot; in 2013.
According to the plan, officials continue to guide the decentralization of non-capital functions, promote clean energy substitution and pollution reduction, and eliminate a total of 4,923 coal-fired boilers.
Beijing has thus become the first major city in mainland China to realize natural gas supply throughout the entire network.
Data show that between 2013 and 2017, Beijing’s average annual concentration of PM2.5 dropped by 35.6%; the number of days with air quality standards increased by 50; the number of days with first-class quality increased by 25; and the number of days with heavy pollution decreased by 35 days. The incidence of pollution is significantly reduced.
While air quality continues to improve, Beijing officials released the &quot;Beijing Three-Year Action Plan to Win the Blue Sky Defense War&quot; in September this year based on a new round of PM2.5 source analysis. In view of the current treatment stage and pollution characteristics, the focus is on diesel Trucks, dust, volatile organic compound control and other key prevention and control areas, optimize and adjust the transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land use structure, strengthen regional joint prevention and control, strive to strengthen urban refined management, comprehensively promote green development, and strive to make the &quot;bluest bluest&quot; &quot;Sky&quot; is permanently stationed in the capital, no longer &quot;things are rare but valuable&quot;, allowing it to return to being the background in people&#39;s photo albums rather than the protagonist.
During this year&#39;s National Day Golden Week, the Municipal Tourism Commission, Industry and Commerce, Urban Management, Public Security and other relevant departments will strengthen law enforcement inspections of the &quot;one-day tour&quot; market, focusing on the &quot;six illegal&quot; tourism chaos. Once the violations are verified, severe punishment will be given in accordance with the law. Strict and superimposed penalties.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a special meeting on cracking down on illegal &quot;one-day tours&quot; and made arrangements for special actions to further crack down on illegal &quot;one-day tours&quot;.

However, illegal &quot;one-day tours&quot; still continue to be attacked and often rebound, forming a The &quot;six black&quot; chaos is the intertwined interest chains of black ticket collection, black directors, black societies, black cars, black shops, and black networks.
Specifically, people who illegally solicit tourists on the streets are called &quot;black ticket collectors&quot;, illegal websites that publish false travel information are called &quot;blacknets&quot;, travel agencies that engage in illegal &quot;one-day tours&quot; or institutions or individuals without travel agency qualifications are called &quot;blacknets&quot; Tour guides hired by &quot;triad organizations&quot; without tour guide certificates or practicing illegally are &quot;black guides&quot;, and they use vehicles without tourist passenger transport qualifications or vehicles with tourist passenger transport qualifications that provide passenger transport services for illegal &quot;one-day tours&quot; That is, the &quot;black car&quot;, and the designated tourist shopping store where they finally take tourists is the &quot;black store&quot;.
In this special operation, the city continued to increase fixed inspections and mobile inspections of illegal &quot;one-day tours&quot;.

After discovering evidence of violations, they were investigated and dealt with strictly in accordance with the law.
Among them, &quot;black cars&quot; and &quot;black shops&quot; have become the two focuses of the special operation.
According to reports, illegal &quot;one-day trips&quot; would not be possible without black cars. Black cars are easy to discover, remember and investigate, and are also fixed assets with high individual value.
Relevant departments use road traffic monitoring probes to increase supervision of tourist buses on key &quot;one-day tour&quot; routes, and use technological and physical defense and other scientific and intelligent means to promptly detect and investigate &quot;illegal buses&quot;.
Tourism shopping &quot;black stores&quot; have also become the focus of strict crackdowns due to their small number and local operation.
In order to strengthen the deterrence and crackdown on illegal &quot;one-day tours&quot;, all functional departments will impose severe and severe penalties in accordance with the law once violations of laws and regulations are confirmed during the special operation.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to cracking down on illegal &quot;one-day tours&quot; to discuss methods and measures that combine administrative penalties with criminal convictions.
The Municipal Tourism Commission stated that in the future, it will encourage more formal travel agencies to carry out &quot;one-day tours&quot; in Beijing and increase the supply of formal &quot;one-day tours&quot; to further squeeze out the living space of illegal &quot;one-day tours&quot;. Specific plans are still being studied. middle.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission continues to improve the electronic itinerary information system for tourist groups to ensure that each group is included in the supervision of the electronic itinerary platform.
From a tourism symbol to a digital economic symbol, what has Wuzhen experienced in these years?
As the permanent site of the World Internet Conference, how Wuzhen can successfully undertake the dividends of the summit has attracted much attention.
In the five years since the first World Internet Conference, Wuzhen’s changes have been obvious to all.
In 2014, there were only 12 companies related to the digital economy and the Internet in the town. By the third quarter of this year, there were more than 500 companies.
This is a microcosm of Wuzhen’s development of digital economy.
The convening of the Internet Conference allows local companies to receive inspiration from the digital economy and the wave of digitization at a close distance. The desire of enterprises to transform and upgrade is very strong. Traditional manufacturing companies have increased investment and research and development in aspects such as machine replacement and intelligent management.
Jiang Wei, Secretary of the Wuzhen Town Party Committee, said that Wuzhen will build a new economic empowerment center in the future.
The development of the digital economy cannot be separated from the support of infrastructure.
This year, Wuzhen launched 5G pilot work on the basis of achieving full coverage of 4G communication networks and free WiFi.
At the same time, Tongxiang City, where Wuzhen is located, is the first county-level city in the country to build a dedicated international Internet data channel, and has also become a hot spot for the development of the Internet industry.
Since the first World Internet Conference, Tongxiang has introduced a total of 565 digital economy projects with a total planned investment of 37.725 billion yuan. In the first three quarters of this year, the core manufacturing industry of the digital economy achieved a total output value of 8.73 billion yuan, with an added value that increased by 13% year-on-year.
&quot;Wuzhen was a tourism symbol before, but later it became a drama and cultural symbol. Because of the Internet Conference, it has now become a symbol of the Internet and digital economy. &quot;
Sheng Yongjun, Secretary of the Tongxiang Municipal Party Committee, believes that the dividends of the World Internet Conference have accumulated over time. Therefore, it is more necessary to build a platform to undertake the overlapping introduction of talents, projects, technologies and other elements from all parties.
Shen Yi, a native of Tongxiang, has been working outside the country for 20 years. Because of her connection with the Internet Conference, she returned to her hometown to start a business.
On December 2 last year, he entered the 4th Internet Light Expo with a high-capacity tamper-proof digital technology solution, which was favored by many customers.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in Wuzhen not only because of her hometown complex, &quot;In Wuzhen, recruiting people is easier than I thought, and our applications are also implemented quickly. Our applications are included in the Wuzhen smart parking project. &quot;
A Wuzhen Avenue shows the spillover effect of the Internet Conference.
This avenue running through the north and south of Tongxiang not only connects tourist attractions, but is also an industrial avenue.
Relying on it, Wuzhen Avenue Science and Technology Innovation Cluster came into being.
The reporter learned that in the future, Wuzhen Avenue will become the main front for Tongxiang’s industrial development, taking the lead in applying a large number of achievements such as smart medical care, smart elderly care, and smart government affairs, and gathering industries that account for 80% of the city’s GDP and many high-level talents.
Strong earthquake in Indonesia triggers tsunami, killing at least 410 people
According to the director of the Public Information Bureau of the Jakarta Police in Indonesia on the evening of the 29th, the earthquake in Central Sulawesi Province has killed 410 people, of whom 97 identities have been confirmed.
Another 29 people were missing and 540 people were injured.
Palu Airport remains closed.
With active treatment, the survival rate of premature infants aged 29 weeks and above in China reaches 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries.
China News Service, Shanghai, September 30 (Chen Jing, Luo Yanqian) The National Children&#39;s Medical Center and the Children&#39;s Hospital of Fudan University disclosed on the 30th that they have introduced Canada&#39;s advanced methods in the &quot;China NICU Hospitalized Premature Infant Outcome Quality Improvement Project&quot;.
Project results show that with active treatment, the survival rate of premature infants aged 29 weeks and above in China reaches 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries. However, there is still much room for improvement in the complication-free survival rate of extremely small gestational age premature infants and premature infants.
In the past 20 years, the Chinese government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71 ‰, which is significantly lower than the national average and has reached the advanced level of developed countries.
Through four years of unremitting efforts, the &quot;China NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants Prognosis Quality Improvement Project&quot; has greatly improved the quality of life of premature infants.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the Children&#39;s Hospital of Fudan University, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature infants, attention should be paid to reducing the survival quality of premature infants, reducing the incidence of complications, improving neurodevelopmental prognosis, and improving patient outcomes. The overall outcome of infants is of great significance to improving the overall quality of life and population quality of premature infants. It is an important issue of concern to the pediatric and neonatology circles at home and abroad, and is also a key issue of this project.
Through four years of unremitting efforts, the &quot;China NICU Hospitalized Premature Infant Outcomes Quality Improvement Project&quot; has included tens of thousands of premature infants with a gestational age of 33 weeks and below across the country, reducing the domestic mortality rate of premature infants with small gestational age and small birth weight by one-third. At the same time, the incidence of serious complications in premature infants has dropped significantly, greatly improving the quality of life of premature infants.
By establishing a national neonatal quality improvement collaboration network and introducing the concept of collaborative quality improvement, the project has radiated 25 collaborating hospitals across China and established a complete set of collaborative methods suitable for domestic conditions to improve the prognosis of premature infants and improve the level of neonatal care. Systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement approach.
The Children&#39;s Hospital of Fudan University is joining forces with neonatology departments across the country to formulate guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the experience accumulated through the project, providing reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in the &quot;China Preterm Infant Prognosis Quality Improvement Project&quot;, the pediatric hospital has introduced the EPIQ method into 25 large-scale NICUs in 19 provinces across the country, aiming to solve the problem of premature infant infections that plagues China&#39;s neonatal intensive care units.
After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, the complication-free survival rate of premature infants in Canada has increased by about one-third. Canada is now among the countries with the best prognosis for premature infants in the world.
The EPIQ method is now used in all NICUs across Canada and has been adopted by 6 countries.
The pediatric hospital revealed that research results showed that after two years of EPIQ intervention, infections in premature infants dropped by 35%, while the use of antibiotics dropped by 20%.
In the future, the Children&#39;s Hospital of Fudan University will continue to promote and implement this method nationwide, aiming to comprehensively reduce the incidence of all complications in premature infants and improve the quality of neonatal care nationwide.
At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are differences and inhomogeneities in the treatment levels in various regions in China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important construction unit of the National Children&#39;s Medical Center, the Children&#39;s Hospital will play a leading role. This research covers Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and other western provinces, with a view to gradually promoting neonatal treatment nationwide. of homogenization and standardization.
It is understood that the Children&#39;s Hospital of Fudan University is joining forces with neonatology departments across the country to formulate guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on accumulated experience from the project, to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
According to reports, in 2019, the China Neonatal Collaboration Network, whose coordination center is located at the Children&#39;s Hospital of Fudan University, will unite 63 hospitals across the country to carry out the next stage of national quality improvement, with a view to promoting the uniform development of China&#39;s neonatal care levels.
Wu Jinglei, director of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission, said that Shanghai&#39;s ability to become a central city in the center of Asia is not only reflected in research, but also in the construction of the entire service system. Service quality and service results should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China&#39;s medical level. .
Xin Shiping: Build a &quot;hero monument&quot; in your heart - written on the fifth Martyrs&#39; Day.
On September 30, the eve of the 69th birthday of the Republic, we ushered in the fifth Martyrs&#39; Day. Xi Jinping and other party and state leaders came to Tiananmen Square to attend a ceremony of laying flower baskets to the people&#39;s heroes.
At this moment, no matter where you are, please pay tribute to the heroes.
An anniversary is a time to relive and wake up.
Looking through the rich history, behind the name of every martyr is a living life.
They also have passionate youth, sincere love, and caring family members.
However, because they firmly believe that &quot;the doctrine we believe in is the truth of the universe&quot; and in order to &quot;avoid the suffering of the next generation&quot;, they are willing to sacrifice everything they have.
&quot;Every day I live, I have to shout for China.&quot;
Traveling through time and space, the heroes set up spiritual road signs to guide the way forward.
&quot;Where do you come from, where do you go?&quot; &quot;What kind of person do you want to be?&quot; It is not difficult to get the answers by understanding the heroes.
To commemorate the heroes, the most important thing is to build a &quot;hero monument&quot; in our hearts.
According to incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary war years, approximately 20 million martyrs have heroically sacrificed their lives for national independence, people&#39;s liberation, and national prosperity.
Due to various reasons, many martyrs did not even leave their names.
Countless heroes have watered their ideals with their blood and practiced their beliefs with their lives. Remembering their heroic names and passing on their spirit are to protect the roots and soul of the nation.
This &quot;hero monument&quot; cannot be defaced or damaged in any way.
For some time, undercurrents such as historical nihilism and pan-entertainment have been surging.
Various practices that distort history and belittle heroes and martyrs challenge justice and conscience, confuse value judgments, and arouse public indignation and vigilance across society.
Heroes cannot be desecrated, and heroes cannot be forgotten.
Behaviors that touch the bottom line cannot be left unchecked. We must dare to use the sword to defend the dignity of heroes and martyrs with the rule of law and justice.
On May 1 this year, the Law on the Protection of Heroes and Martyrs was officially implemented.
From the perspective of judicial practice, the judgments in some cases are very popular, which not only effectively safeguard the glorious image of heroes and martyrs in accordance with the law, but also release the positive energy of advocating heroes and admiring martyrs.
A nation with aspirations cannot be without heroes, and a country with ideals cannot be without pioneers.
Remembering the martyrs and calling for heroes has become a common social consensus.
Currently, there are millions of memorial facilities of various types across the country, and more than 100 million people visit the Martyrs Cemetery every year.
The human heart is the strongest foundation.
Let advocating, defending, learning and caring for heroes become a common practice, let the heroic spirit be integrated into the national blood, and &quot;hero monuments&quot; will stand majestically between heaven and earth and deep in the hearts of the people.
BRUSSELS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The European Union took a non-confrontational stance on Italy on Friday after Italy defied EU demands and surprised markets with plans for a massive budget deficit, but could take action if Italy insists on too ambitious targets. A more radical position.
Italy&#39;s eurosceptic government is targeting a budget deficit of 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) over the next three years, indicating that debt reduction has not been achieved despite demands for deficit reduction.
&quot;We have no interest in a crisis between the Commission and Italy,&quot; Moscovici, the European Commission&#39;s economic affairs commissioner, said on Friday, taking a cautious approach as EU recommendations and sanctions may have little impact on Italy. respond.
EU officials and diplomats remain hopeful that market forces will persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before it is formally submitted to the European Commission in mid-October.
The euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday and Italian bond yields hit their highest in three weeks after the government announced its plan.
If the deficit target remains unchanged by the October deadline, the European Commission may veto Italy&#39;s draft budget, something it has never done with any country.
European Commission Vice President Dombrowski later told a conference in the Latvian capital Riga on Friday that Italy&#39;s current fiscal plan &quot;seems inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Pact,&quot; referring to the EU&#39;s fiscal rules.
But he did not say how this would trigger an EU response.
Bidders can submit applications to participate in this public bidding before October 26 this year.

Experts from the national membraneless cotton on-site observation and seminar exchange activities walked into the test field and listened to the introduction by representatives of the team of Academician Yu Shuxun of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
China News Service, Xinjiang Shaya, September 30 (Geng Dandan and Wang Xiaojun) At the film-free cotton planting experimental base in Shaya County, Xinjiang, the growth of film-free cotton is gratifying, and it is &quot;not inferior&quot; to the mulched cotton next to it. Clusters of Snow-white cotton competes to &quot;open&quot; and hang all over the branches.
From September 27th to 28th, the national filmless cotton on-site observation and seminar exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
The reporter learned at the observation meeting that the film-free cotton technology system based on &quot;China Cotton 619&quot; and its supporting cultivation measures has initially achieved the goal of film-free planting in cotton fields and reduced the impact of residual film in Xinjiang cotton fields on the ecological environment and raw cotton. pollution, the research and demonstration of membraneless cotton comprehensive technology have made significant progress.
Academician Yu Shuxun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, famous cotton genetic breeder, and chief scientist of the cotton system of the National Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System, introduced the growth of film-free cotton to Zhou Guomo, secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang A&amp;F University.
&quot;The film-free cotton comprehensive technology we developed can completely realize cotton planting without mulching film, and can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and realize green cotton planting. &quot;
Yu Shuxun, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced.
Xinjiang is China&#39;s most important cotton-producing area. According to statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics, Xinjiang&#39;s cotton planting area was 35 million acres in 2017, accounting for 61% of the country&#39;s cotton area.
Since the introduction of mulch film into China in 1982, the area covered with various crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million acres, and the annual use of mulch film is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, the cotton mulching film coverage rate reaches 100%, and cotton field mulching accounts for about 60% of the mulching film usage in Xinjiang.
The film-free cotton production was measured and the cotton output can completely achieve a yield of 320 kilograms to 350 kilograms per mu.
As the input of mulch film in Xinjiang continues to increase, the recovery rate of residual mulch film is low, the amount of residual mulch film in the soil gradually increases, and the residual mulch film causes a series of problems such as soil structural damage, which seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great impact on the quality of cotton fiber.
At present, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, the area of machine-picked cotton in Xinjiang was approximately 14 million acres.
During the harvesting process of machine-picked cotton, a large amount of crumbs are collected on the surface and on the cotton plants. The crumbs mixed in the raw cotton are difficult to remove during the raw cotton processing, and cannot be completely removed during the subsequent textile processing, seriously affecting the quality of textile products. .
On September 28, the national film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange event was held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
In order to solve the problem of mulching film pollution in cotton fields, simplify cotton planting technology, and improve cotton field efficiency, Yu Shuxun led his team to implement the &quot;China Cotton 619&quot; film-free cotton technology planting for 8 years, &quot;adding wings&quot; to the green development of Xinjiang agriculture.
Yu Shuxun introduced that through innovative new breeding ideas, a new upland cotton strain &quot;Zhongmian 619&quot; was developed that is extremely early-maturing, salt-alkali tolerant, low-temperature tolerant, and high-yielding.
&quot;&#39;Zhongmian 619&#39;, under the film-free cultivation conditions in southern Xinjiang, has achieved a series of supporting facilities such as film-free sowing machinery, improvement of sowing depth, shallow burial of dropper belts under film-free conditions, selection of suitable seeding density, and rational chemical control. measure. &quot;
At present, film-free cotton demonstration bases have been established in Aksu, Korla, Alar and other places, with a yield of 4,800 kilograms per hectare.
Growing cotton without film has achieved high yield, cost saving, environmental protection, and improved overall benefits.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at the Institute of Agricultural Sciences of the Third Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through the research and demonstration of film-free cotton cultivation technology in the past six years, the production of film-free cotton seed cotton can fully achieve a yield of 320 kilograms to 350 kilograms per mu, or even higher.
&quot;The promotion of film-free cotton cultivation technology has great prospects. &quot;
Zhang Donghai believes that currently, film-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but the current economic benefits are still far behind compared with film cultivation.
&quot;The support for cotton purchase price will be conducive to future promotion. &quot;
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and large-scale promotion and application of film-free cotton, make the film-free cotton industry bigger and stronger, and completely solve the soil pollution problem caused by mulch films.

Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi delivered a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations on Friday, saying that currently, Sino-US relations have once again reached a crossroads. If the two sides can view each other actively and inclusively, expand and deepen positive cooperation, and properly manage differences and conflicts, they can open up new opportunities. Bright future.
&quot;China-US relations are our common assets and need to be taken care of by us together. &quot;
He expressed the hope that people of insight from all walks of life in both countries would take practical actions to maintain the healthy and stable development of Sino-US relations and jointly push Sino-US relations forward in the right direction.
Wang Yi also emphasized again that China will definitely embark on a development path that is different from that of traditional major powers.
This path with Chinese characteristics determines that China will not and cannot repeat the mistakes of a strong country that must seek hegemony. It also determines that China will neither become the United States, challenge the United States, nor replace the United States.
When Wang Yi delivered a speech titled &quot;Opportunity or Challenge, Partner or Rival&quot;, he said that the deep-rooted crux of the current problem is that some American friends believe that China will also become hegemonic when it becomes strong, and will even challenge and replace the United States&#39; role in the world. leadership.
&quot;This is obviously a major strategic misjudgment. &quot;
He said that this kind of self-imagined suspicion is spreading, amplifying existing contradictions, giving birth to new doubts, and making it more difficult for China and the United States to solve specific problems and encountering more resistance.
Wang Yi pointed out that China is following a path of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had the gene for external expansion.
We believe that countries can coexist harmoniously, communicate and learn from each other.
No matter in the past, present or future, China will neither copy foreign models nor ask other countries to copy China&#39;s practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with former U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger in New York, he said that cooperation between China and the U.S. would be a win-win situation, while confrontation would inevitably lead to a lose-lose situation.
China has always been committed to developing long-term, healthy and stable Sino-US relations and achieving non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.
China&#39;s State Council Information Office held a press conference on Tuesday to introduce and interpret the white paper &quot;The Facts and China&#39;s Position on Sino-US Economic and Trade Frictions.&quot;

He appealed to the victims to be patient and stay where they were to wait for rescue.
Search and rescue personnel in Palu said they heard cries for help coming from a collapsed hotel in the city, but they were helpless because there were no heavy machines to remove the rubble, and some people had to save people with their bare hands.

We want to go to Golden Bauhinia Square to watch the National Day flag-raising ceremony! &quot;
The Song couple, who specially flew from Ningxia to Shenzhen and transferred to the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link National Day train in Shenzhen, asked reporters this question when they were interviewed by a China News Service reporter at Hong Kong West Kowloon Station on the morning of October 1.
On the morning of October 1, to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government held a grand flag-raising ceremony at Golden Bauhinia Square.
According to immigration control point statistics, as of September 30, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via the West Kowloon Station of the High Speed Rail has exceeded 300,000.
Coinciding with the 69th anniversary of the motherland, the West Kowloon Border Checkpoint predicts that there will be a peak number of tourists visiting Hong Kong on October 1st and 2nd.
The reporter saw at the arrivals hall at around 7 a.m. on the 1st that many mainland tourists took advantage of the National Day Golden Week to take the high-speed rail and visit Hong Kong.
The brisk Mrs. Song told reporters that the National Day holiday is a rare long holiday in the year. It has always been her wish to come to the Golden Bauhinia Square in Hong Kong to watch the flag raising. She felt particularly happy and excited to be able to achieve this wish on National Day.
However, flights from Ningxia to Hong Kong are currently inconvenient. Fortunately, the Hong Kong section of the high-speed rail is open to traffic. After checking the train timetable, Mr. Song found that the first train can arrive at 7:30 in the morning, connecting the city&#39;s transportation to the Golden Bauhinia Square. The time is just right. .
He lamented to reporters: &quot;The high-speed rail is so convenient, fast and punctual!&quot;
There are 70 one-hour short-distance trains running between Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North, Futian and West Kowloon every day, which greatly facilitates residents in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to come to Hong Kong.
After arriving in Hong Kong, Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, was preparing to go to the Peak in Central to meet up with his Hong Kong friends who were hiking.
Mr. Liu said: &quot;Both Mainland China and Hong Kong are on holiday during the National Day. We plan to challenge ourselves and see if we can complete the 50-kilometer Hong Kong Island Trail! &quot;
He explained that without the opening of the high-speed rail, which provides convenient travel and sufficient time, they would not dare to attempt such a long-distance hiking activity.
Mrs. Yang from Dongguan took the high-speed train to Hong Kong with her 10-year-old son to participate in the piano competition. She proudly told reporters that her son had been learning piano for three years and it was very meaningful to spend the National Day in this way.
She had always taken the bus to Hong Kong before, but it was time-consuming and labor-intensive. She was worried about affecting her son&#39;s condition. This time she took the high-speed rail via Shenzhen. Customs clearance was convenient and the time was halved. The Hong Kong leg of the trip impressed her even more, she told reporters. : &quot;It&#39;s like taking the subway, it&#39;s so fast, I didn&#39;t even have time to take a photo!&quot;
At 6:44 on September 23, the G5711 &quot;Harmony&quot; high-speed rail train departed from Shenzhen North Railway Station and rushed all the way. A few minutes later, the train entered the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong high-speed rail. This was the first official operation of the Hong Kong section. High speed train.
The Hong Kong section of the high-speed rail, which is integrated into the country&#39;s 25,000-kilometer high-speed rail network and reaches 38 long-distance stations across the country, also welcomes mainland tourists from different provinces across the country.
Mr. Gao, who came to Hong Kong from Changsha to visit relatives during the short holiday, told reporters that before, the high-speed train could only go as far as Shenzhen North, and then take the subway to cross the border in Hong Kong and then transfer to city transportation. Transferring is cumbersome and time-consuming. Now, he can take the high-speed train directly to the center of Kowloon and get home. I feel very happy to be able to eat lunch made by my children.
He said that the convenience of the customs clearance procedure of &quot;one place and two inspections&quot; was beyond imagination. &quot;It took less than 10 minutes to pass both customs.&quot;
West Kowloon Station, which is close to the Airport Express and connects land and air transportation, has also become the first choice for many transit passengers.
Ms. Wu from Fujian was preparing to travel from Hong Kong to the Philippines with her best friends to spend the Golden Week. She pushed her luggage out of the West Kowloon gate on time and told reporters in a leisurely manner: &quot;I was worried that I would not be able to catch the plane, but I didn&#39;t expect it to be so soon. , more than enough time! ”
The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will preserve U.S. President Donald Trump&#39;s ability to implement his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imported cars, while at the same time reducing passenger car imports from Canada and Mexico, according to ancillary arrangements announced on Monday. Cars, pickup trucks and auto parts are largely exempt from tariffs.
If Trump imposes so-called &quot;Chapter 232&quot; tariffs on cars for national security reasons, Mexico and Canada would each have a quota of 2.6 million duty-free passenger cars exported to the United States each year.
Under the subsidiary arrangement, pickup trucks produced in both countries will be fully exempted from tariffs.
If Trump imposes additional auto tariffs, Mexico will receive an annual tax exemption quota of US$108 billion in auto parts, and Canada will receive a quota of US$32.4 billion.
Both quotas are much higher than the existing production levels of both countries, providing room for growth in exports from both countries.
WASHINGTON/MEXICO, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Mexico said on Friday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and Canada were making real efforts to resolve differences on trade policy after days of wrangling, raising hopes for a new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). ) is expected to maintain the form of a tripartite agreement.
Although details are lacking, the apparent progress is enough to prompt the Mexican and U.S. governments to abruptly halt plans to publish the text of their trade agreement, giving Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government has made new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and said he would continue to urge all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said the submission of the text of the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement to Mexican and U.S. legislation has been delayed because the Canadian and U.S. governments are &quot;very serious&quot; in trying to reach an agreement.
Guajardo said, &quot;In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a three-party agreement text or whether we have to publish the text of a two-party agreement. &quot;
Guajardo said his U.S. and Canadian counterparts &quot;specifically requested&quot; that the release of the text be delayed.
A spokesman for the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the trade agreement between the United States and Mexico and the negotiations between the United States and Canada.
Officials in the Canadian Prime Minister&#39;s Office and the Office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
According to foreign media reports, in a conservation center on the outskirts of Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, two little lions were playing together. It was difficult to see anything unusual, but they were actually unique.
The University of Pretoria announced: &quot;This is the first time ever that a lion cub has been born through artificial insemination - the first pair in the world. &quot;
Scientists on campus are working on studying the reproductive system of female African lions.
Gans Winter, director of the Institute of Mammology at the University of Pretoria, said that the two lion cubs, one female and one male, born on August 25, are quite healthy and normal.
His team finally achieved this breakthrough after 18 months of intensive testing.
Ganswindt said in an interview with the media: &quot;We collected sperm from a healthy male lion. &quot;
Next, the researchers waited for the hormone levels in the lioness to reach the appropriate level before artificial insemination.
&quot;Fortunately, it worked out,&quot; Ganswindt said.
The researchers &quot;tried several times, but surprisingly, they didn&#39;t put in much effort,&quot; he said.
He said that the aforementioned research breakthrough can be verified repeatedly, and scientists hope to use this technology to save endangered big cats.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature points out that lions have become extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of surviving wild lions has dropped sharply by 43% in the past 20 years, with only about 20,000 remaining.
African lions are classified as vulnerable by this organization.
&quot;If we don&#39;t do something for this animal, they will become extinct,&quot; Ganswindt said.
He said the new technology does not require the lions to be bred, but simply injects sperm into fertile lionesses, as is done with captive elephants in North America and Europe.
South Korea&#39;s exports fell the most in more than two years in September, but analysts blamed the decline on fewer working days and said global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
Indeed, South Korea&#39;s average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, preliminary data released earlier showed double-digit growth in exports in the first weeks of September before the long holiday.
South Korea&#39;s September exports fell the most year-on-year since July 2016, which was greater than the 5.7% decline expected by 11 analysts polled by Reuters.
Preliminary figures released on Monday showed exports in September at $50.6 billion, down from $51.2 billion in August.
South Korea&#39;s exports to China rose 7.8% in September, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month, despite concerns that the intensifying U.S.-China trade dispute could also harm China&#39;s other export-reliant neighbors.
South Korea&#39;s exports to the United States fell 11.8% due to lower sales of petroleum products.
Overseas sales of South Korea&#39;s memory chips and petroleum products increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively, despite market concerns that the so-called chip &quot;super cycle&quot; may have peaked.
&quot;However, the impact of the trade conflict will be difficult to avoid because South Korea&#39;s exports rely heavily on the U.S. and Chinese markets. &quot;
Imports fell 2.1% to US$40.8 billion, which was not as good as the 3.1% growth expected in a Reuters survey.
The preliminary trade surplus in September was US$9.7 billion, up from US$6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry and Commerce said that thanks to the United States and European Union countries, the global manufacturing industry will remain strong, which is a favorable factor for South Korea&#39;s exports.
The statement pointed out, &quot;The increase in export prices caused by rising oil prices will also be beneficial to exports in the second half of this year. &quot;
&quot;However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with the intensification of market volatility after the United States raised interest rates, are all negative pressures faced by exports. &quot;
Exports per working day on average rose to $2.6 billion in September from $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea’s Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26 this year, so there are only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.
South Korea&#39;s exports from January to September increased by 4.7% compared with the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers&#39; Index, South Korea&#39;s manufacturing activity rebounded in September, but it was supported by domestic orders as orders from China and Japan fell, which may cast a shadow on the export outlook.
North Korean media criticizes US for not relaxing sanctions on North Korea
North Korea&#39;s &quot;Rodong Sinmun&quot; published a signed commentary on September 30, criticizing the United States for not relaxing sanctions on North Korea while seeking dialogue with North Korea, calling this a &quot;self-contradictory&quot; approach.
The article stated that US Secretary of State Pompeo said on the 14th that &quot;the key to achieving denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is to implement sanctions against North Korea,&quot; emphasizing that the United States&#39; position on continuing to implement United Nations sanctions resolutions remains unchanged.
In the Singapore-North Korea-U.S. Joint Statement, the two sides committed to establishing a new North Korea-U.S. relationship that is consistent with the aspirations of the people of the two countries for peace and prosperity.
The United States is intensifying sanctions and pressure while demanding dialogue. This approach is undoubtedly self-contradictory.
The article said that if we want to establish a new relationship between North Korea and the United States, build a permanent and consolidated peace system on the Korean Peninsula, and achieve complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, we should give top priority to building trust, start with what can be done, and solve it in stages one by one.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions and suppression will not work against North Korea.
The article said that even the &quot;Severodvinsk&quot; before the &quot;Kazan&quot; impressed the US military.
&quot;The National Interest&quot; magazine quoted the US Navy&#39;s view as saying: &quot;We will encounter powerful potential opponents. Just look at the submarine &#39;Severodvinsk&#39;. &quot;
Fogo, the current commander-in-chief of the US Navy in Europe, also praised the &quot;Severodvinsk&quot; submarine.
He said: &quot;This submarine is very impressive. If you look at the development of the Russian Navy and how it uses its resources, you will know that its main efforts in research and development are first and foremost strengthening the submarine fleet. &quot;
However, &quot;The National Interest&quot; magazine still believes that the United States maintains its advantage over Russia in this area.
Fogo said: &quot;I believe that Western countries still have asymmetric advantages. &quot;
It was previously reported that the Russian Navy will install the &quot;Kazan&quot; submarine in 2019.
The multi-purpose submarines &quot;Kazan&quot;, &quot;Novosibirsk&quot;, &quot;Krasnoyarsk&quot; and &quot;Arkhangelsk&quot; are all improved models of the &quot;Ash-M&quot;, with a displacement of 13,800 tons and a lower It has a diving depth of 520 meters, a crew of 64, and an underwater speed of 31 knots. It will carry mines, torpedoes and &quot;Caliber&quot; and &quot;Onyx&quot; cruise missiles.

EU may reach crude oil purchase agreement with Iran
The U.S. government recently announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November and even urges other countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil.
However, U.S. allies don&#39;t seem to be listening.
According to the New York Times, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif revealed in an interview on the 29th that despite the U.S. threat to impose sanctions on any country that does business with Iran, Tehran is close to reaching an agreement on crude oil sales with the European Union.
The core purpose of this agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, that is, to replace U.S. dollar transactions with barter or local currency pricing.
The purpose of this approach is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from impeding financial transfers.
At the same time, although the EU is committed to promoting the agreement, some French and British officials are also worried that if the agreement is realized, this will be the most public confrontation between the EU and the United States, which opposes the United States&#39; withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement.
US media said that in an hour-long interview, Zarif sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because this agreement has the ability to &quot;strip&quot; the United States&#39; traditional allies and effectively break the United States&#39; attempt to reduce Iran&#39;s income.
&quot;This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit.&quot; Zarif believes that according to the agreement reached in 2015, countries have the legal right to trade with Iran.
Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief, also said recently, &quot;No sovereign country or organization can accept other people deciding with whom it can trade. &quot;
However, she also predicted that before the U.S. government launches the next step of sanctions in November, U.S. leaders are likely to adopt a series of financial measures aimed at targeting banks, businessmen and countries that do business with Tehran.
In May this year, the U.S. government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that the agreement was flawed, saying that the agreement could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The United States subsequently threatened to ban companies that purchase Iranian oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.
The threat caused some companies to leave Tehran and the Iranian currency plummeted.
Companies including Airbus and French oil giant Total have canceled billions of dollars in investments in Iran.
British and French officials have said the US government may &quot;prevail&quot;.
Sure enough, according to a recent Turkish media report, US sanctions do not seem to have a great impact on Iran&#39;s oil exports.
Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh recently revealed that no other country except South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani believe that the purpose of a series of US actions is to &quot;tempt&quot; Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif also dismissed the series of verbal attacks from the United States. When asked whether the United States would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, &quot;It is a regime change.&quot; Strategy, this is the real purpose of the United States. &quot;

The reporter learned from the National Health Commission that compared with a few decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in my country has decreased, but the incidence of overweight and obesity has increased significantly.
Experts point out that the most important concept in maintaining a healthy weight is to &quot;treat the disease before it&#39;s too late&quot; and vigorously promote scientific fitness and reasonable diet.
According to the &quot;Core Information and Interpretation of Health Education for Chinese Adolescents (2018 Edition)&quot; recently released by the National Health Commission, the key to maintaining a healthy weight is a reasonable diet and scientific exercise.
Being overweight, obese and blindly losing weight are all bad for your health.
The health risks behind &quot;little chubby&quot; cannot be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, director of the Institute of Nutrition and Health at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight and obesity harm the normal growth and development of adolescents, have adverse effects on their psychology, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and can even lead to high blood pressure, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia in children.

A very important part of this is to provide comprehensive science education to schools, parents and students, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity, and improve prevention among teenagers. consciousness.
Adolescents should have regular physical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight, and detect early and scientifically determine whether overweight and obesity problems occur so that timely intervention measures can be taken.
For teenagers who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gangqiang suggested that in addition to actively and scientifically arranging meals and exercise, teenagers are in a special physiological stage and should avoid using starvation or semi-starvation therapy to control and lose weight, and must not blindly take weight loss drugs.

With the approval of Premier Li Keqiang, the State Council recently issued the &quot;Decision on Further Reducing the Catalog of Industrial Product Production License Management and Simplifying the Approval Procedures.&quot;
The &quot;Decision&quot; proposes to further reduce the management catalog of industrial product production licenses, cancel the management of production licenses for 14 categories of industrial products, and delegate the management authority of production licenses for four categories of industrial products to the quality and technical supervision departments of provincial people&#39;s governments.
After this reform, the products subject to industrial product production license management will be reduced from 38 categories last year to the current 24 categories.
The &quot;Decision&quot; clearly states that simplified approval procedures will be implemented for products in the catalog.
The first is to change the pre-certification product inspection organized by the licensing authority to a product inspection report issued by a qualified inspection and testing agency when the enterprise applies.
Second, in addition to hazardous chemicals, post-on-site review will be implemented for products licensed by the quality and technical supervision department (market supervision and management department) of the provincial people&#39;s government. After the enterprise submits the application and product inspection report and makes a commitment to ensure product quality and safety , you can receive a production license after passing the formal examination, and then undergo on-site inspection within the specified time.
Third, if an enterprise produces products of different categories in its business catalog, in accordance with the principle of &quot;one enterprise, one license&quot;, when applying for a new license or applying for a license renewal, one license will be reviewed and issued together.
The &quot;Decision&quot; requires that all regions and relevant departments must solidly advance the work of reducing the catalog and simplifying the approval procedures.
Strengthen the disclosure of enterprise commitments and post-on-site inspections, strengthen credit supervision and restraint measures, implement the main responsibility of enterprise quality, and revoke production licenses for false promises and non-compliance with requirements.
For products whose industrial product production license management has been cancelled, it is necessary to effectively strengthen interim and ex-post supervision. Products involving public health and safety, environmental protection and other products can be converted to compulsory certification. A positive list should be made public and disclosed to the public. Certification standards should be unified and reasonable. Certification and testing projects will be reduced and merged, and compulsory certification fees will in principle be borne by finance at all levels according to the system.
Take support measures to encourage enterprises to carry out voluntary certification, promote brand building and expand markets.
It is necessary to benchmark against advanced international standards and promote the improvement of industrial product quality.
Give full play to the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality and safety of industrial products.
For products that retain industrial product production license management, it is necessary to improve the standard system, give full play to the advantages of industry supervision, strengthen the responsibility of &quot;whoever approves, who supervises&quot;, dynamically assess product quality and safety risks, reduce the catalog, delegate approval authority, or convert to certification in a timely manner. manage.
In September, China&#39;s comprehensive PMI increased month-on-month and the manufacturing PMI fell month-on-month.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China on the 30th showed that in September, China&#39;s comprehensive PMI output index was 54.1%, which was 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points higher than the previous month and the annual average, indicating that the production and operation activities of Chinese enterprises have generally remained stable.
In that month, the manufacturing production index and non-manufacturing business activity index, which constitute the comprehensive PMI output index, were 53.0% and 54.9% respectively, falling and rising month-on-month.
Among them, China&#39;s manufacturing PMI was 50.8%, down 0.5 percentage points from the previous month.
Zhao Qinghe said that this month’s manufacturing PMI has five main characteristics:
First, the fundamentals of the manufacturing industry are generally stable.
Among the 21 industries surveyed, the PMI of 14 industries is in the expansion range. Among them, the PMI of manufacturing industries such as medicine, special equipment, and electrical machinery and equipment are all at a relatively high operating level of above 53.5%, with rapid growth.
Second, supply and demand fluctuated slightly.
The production index and new order index were 53.0% and 52.0%, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points respectively from the previous month. Supply and demand continued to remain prosperous, but the expansion slowed down slightly.
The new export order index and import index were 48.0% and 48.5%, 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points lower than last month respectively, and the prosperity level both fell to the low of the year.
Fourth, the cost of purchasing raw materials for enterprises has increased.
The purchase price index of main raw materials was 59.8%, an increase of 1.1 percentage points from the previous month, and the ex-factory price index was 54.3%, the same as the previous month, both of which were highs during the year.
Fifth, large enterprises are operating steadily, and the operating conditions of small enterprises continue to improve.
The PMI of large enterprises was 52.1%, the same as last month. Since the beginning of this year, the index has always been in the expansion range of 52.0% and above, and the production index and new orders index have increased month-on-month this month, which is the main driving force for the manufacturing industry to maintain expansion; The PMI of medium-sized enterprises was 48.7%, 1.7 percentage points lower than the previous month, and was in the contraction range; the PMI of small enterprises was 50.4%, 0.4 percentage points higher than the previous month, rising for two consecutive months.
That month, China&#39;s non-manufacturing business activity index was 54.9%, an increase of 0.7 percentage points from the previous month and rising for two consecutive months.
Zhao Qinghe believes that the non-manufacturing industry as a whole continues to maintain a steady and positive development momentum.
The business activity index of road transportation, securities, real estate and other industries continues to be below the critical point, and the total business volume has decreased.
NAGOYA, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday that the central bank is aware that long-term implementation of ultra-loose monetary policy could squeeze the profit margins of financial institutions and potentially destabilize the country&#39;s banking system.
But he said the BOJ needed to maintain its massive stimulus program while keeping a close eye on the pros and cons of its policies, given sluggish inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies.
&quot;The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under continued monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected,&quot; Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions take on risks more actively to make up for the impact of narrow profit margins caused by low interest rates for many years, the banking system may be destabilized in the event of a serious negative shock.
&quot;Although these risks are not significant at present, the central bank will pay close attention to the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take necessary measures,&quot; he said.
Minutes of the Bank of Japan meeting released earlier on Monday showed that at the September interest rate meeting, the Bank of Japan&#39;s policy committee discussed the rising costs of long-term easing policy.
Minutes of the meeting showed that one member said that if the economy continues to expand, &quot;the Bank of Japan will have more room for flexibility in policy in the future.&quot;
Minutes of the meeting showed another member said the committee should discuss how long the BOJ can maintain its stimulus policy, given that there are limits to the duration of the policy.
Haruhiko Kuroda said that the Bank of Japan will evaluate the financial risks caused by its loose policy and also need to consider the uncertainty surrounding Japan&#39;s economic outlook, as Sino-US trade friction and rising protectionism may affect global demand.
&quot;The impact of such problems on Japan&#39;s economy is limited for the time being,&quot; Kuroda said.
&quot;But if the problem persists, the impact on Japan&#39;s economy may become greater,&quot; he added.
&quot;There is a need to continue strong monetary easing while taking into account the positive and negative impacts in a balanced way,&quot; Kuroda said.
Although the disadvantages of the aggressive stimulus plan have increased, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, low inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Bank of Japan maintained its monetary policy last month; facing risks from a global trade war, Haruhiko Kuroda ruled out the possibility of raising interest rates in the near future.
June 1, 2018, Cardiff, USA, the corporate logo on a Tesla electric vehicle.
According to a settlement agreement, Tesla Motors and its CEO Musk have each agreed to pay a $20 million fine to financial regulators. Musk will also resign as chairman of the company but remains CEO.
The settlement would cap two months of turmoil at Tesla.
The settlement of securities fraud charges disclosed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday will bring relief to investors.
Investors had worried that a protracted legal battle would only further damage the electric car company, which still loses money.
The SEC sued Musk for fraud on Thursday, saying his August 7 tweets misled investors.
He tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 per share and had received financing.
The SEC said these tweets were actually unfounded and the market turmoil they caused harmed investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts said the agreement could strengthen Tesla, which has been hit hard by Musk&#39;s recent behavior.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common Asset Management, said the settlement should bring more oversight to Musk without taking &quot;devastating&quot; steps to oust him from Tesla.
The asset manager owns shares of Tesla&#39;s battery maker Panasonic.
Under the proposed deal, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board committee to develop controls over Musk&#39;s external communications.
&quot;It is in the best interest of our markets and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, that this matter be resolved expeditiously and on the terms agreed upon,&quot; SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday&#39;s accusations wiped about $7 billion from Tesla&#39;s market value, which was valued at $45.2 billion on Friday, below General Motors&#39; $47.5 billion.
In the settlement agreement, the SEC withdrew its request to oust Musk from the company&#39;s leadership.
Many investors said the penalty would be catastrophic.
&quot;I think this is the best possible outcome for everyone involved,&quot; said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a &quot;neutral&quot; rating and called the SEC&#39;s penalty &quot;a significant step forward for Musk.&quot; Light punishment&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s important to Tesla that he remains CEO. &quot;
Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the SEC&#39;s allegations in the settlement and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The settlement still requires court approval.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private enterprise symposium, injecting firm confidence in the private economy to move to a broader stage.
General Secretary Xi Jinping’s emphasis on “letting entrepreneurs take off their ideological burdens and move forward with ease” has aroused strong resonance among entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes from people, especially entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship.
In the magnificent 40 years of reform and opening up, there are thousands of entrepreneurial and innovative stories of entrepreneurs. The growth and expansion of the entrepreneurial group has continuously pushed the Chinese economy forward.
For some time, some people in society have made some remarks that deny and doubt the private economy.
The so-called &quot;private economic exit theory&quot; and &quot;new public-private partnership theory&quot; and other erroneous statements have caused doubts and worries among some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export companies; rapid adjustments in demand structure have brought pressure for transformation and upgrading; some policies are not coordinated with each other, the policy effects are superimposed in the same direction, or the working methods are simple, leading to the emergence of some policies with good intentions. The opposite effect, etc.
Various factors are intertwined, the private economy is encountering difficulties, some private enterprises are facing operational difficulties, and entrepreneurs are showing a lot of anxiety.
In this context, correcting misunderstandings, unloading the ideological burden of entrepreneurs, allowing enterprises to focus on development, and the government to promote development, are related to market confidence and development expectations, and have particularly profound practical significance.
This symposium once again emphasized the important conclusion of &quot;Three things have not changed&quot;: &quot;The status and role of the non-public economy in my country&#39;s economic and social development has not changed!&quot;
From deepening the streamlining of administration and decentralizing power, establishing a power list system to creating a legal environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, creating a market environment for fair competition, and shaping an atmosphere where the whole society respects entrepreneurs, in recent years, the Party Central Committee has attached great importance to entrepreneurs. Institutional guarantees are unprecedentedly strong.
This symposium clearly proposed policies and measures to strongly support the development and growth of private enterprises in six aspects, and launched a series of pragmatic actions dedicated to the &quot;light progress&quot; of private enterprises.
These have greatly encouraged the entrepreneurial community and given more expectations to all sectors of society.
The fog has been lifted, the policy has been set, the key lies in implementation.
We must continue to create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve difficulties in development, and help realize China&#39;s economic transformation and upgrading; we must make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legal operations, and feel safe in social life. Respect, stimulate innovation vitality and creative potential.
China&#39;s economy has entered the process of moving towards high-quality development, which requires more entrepreneurs to display their ambitions and provides greater space and stage for entrepreneurs to display their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with further deepening of reforms and removal of obstacles, the private economy will usher in better development prospects and opportunities and move to a broader stage.

A flag-raising ceremony was held at the Hekou Port on the China-Vietnam border to celebrate the National Day
&quot;I never expected that there would be such a majestic and spectacular flag-raising ceremony in the border area. It is even more shocking than watching the flag-raising ceremony in the mainland. &quot;
On the morning of the 1st, Mr. Zhang, who came from Sichuan to travel to the Yunnan Hekou port on the China-Vietnam border, watched the flag-raising ceremony at the National Gate with more than 500 army officers and soldiers, local residents, and Chinese and foreign tourists to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China.
Hekou Port is the largest port in the Yunnan section of the China-Vietnam border. It is located in Hekou County, Honghe Prefecture, Yunnan Province, across the river from Lao Cai City, Vietnam. It is a national first-class port.
With the continuous deepening of the country&#39;s &quot;Belt and Road&quot; construction, as one of the most convenient channels for China to connect to Southeast Asia, the inbound and outbound traffic at Hekou Port has grown steadily.
At 7:30 in the morning that day, the sun had just peeked out, and local people from Hekou and Chinese and foreign tourists gathered early in the restricted area of Hekou Port to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 7:45, the flag-raising ceremony started on time. The members of the honor guard at the national gate of Hekou Border Inspection Station were in high spirits and escorted the national flag to the flag-raising platform with vigorous steps.
After the commander gave the flag-raising instruction, the flag-raiser waved his arms vigorously to draw an arc. The bright five-star red flag stretched out like an &quot;eagle spreading its wings&quot; and slowly rose to the passionate and majestic melody of the national anthem.
&quot;Holding the National Day flag-raising ceremony at every New Year&#39;s Day, Spring Festival, National Day and other significant time points not only shows the image of China, but also inspires the patriotic feelings of people of all ethnic groups in the border areas. &quot;
The officers and soldiers of the honor guard who participated in the flag-raising ceremony said so.
It is reported that the National Gate Honor Guard responsible for the flag-raising ceremony at Hekou Port is composed of more than 40 officers and soldiers from various positions at the Hekou Border Inspection Station. From a flag-raising team of three to a large-scale honor guard, this team has experienced more than 60 years of history and has been established since Since then, it has carried out more than 70 state-level military service tasks for foreign affairs activities.
The newly revised Personal Income Tax Law adjusts the criterion for determining a resident taxpayer of China&#39;s personal income tax from one year to 183 days.
Relevant officials from the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation stated on the 30th that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for overseas persons, including persons from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, when implementing the new personal income tax law.

During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, all parties released some positive messages on the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in relayed North Korea&#39;s &quot;irreversible&quot; determination to denuclearize and said that US President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of this year.
The U.S. State Department subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompeo will visit North Korea in October to promote the implementation of the commitments of the Singapore meeting between the leaders of the United States and North Korea.
Since the beginning of this year, North Korea and South Korea have broken the ice and opened up the path to dialogue. Leaders of North Korea, South Korea, and the United States have held meetings. The general trend of easing the situation on the peninsula has continued, and the principle of resolving peninsula issues through dialogue has also been adhered to.
First of all, &quot;the essence of the peninsula issue is a security issue&quot; has not changed. The key to achieving peace on the peninsula is to properly and balancedly resolve the reasonable security concerns of all parties, rather than blindly putting pressure on the other side and blindly emphasizing one&#39;s own demands.
Secondly, in the dialogue to achieve denuclearization of the peninsula, the relevant parties still have differences on the steps and methods to achieve denuclearization of the peninsula. Due to the long-term lack of political trust between North Korea and the United States, the game mentality of &quot;who comes first and who comes last&quot; is still strong.
At the Security Council&#39;s public meeting on the Korean Peninsula issue held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York a few days ago, the different voices from all parties around the issue of sanctions against North Korea once again highlighted that these two points on the Peninsula issue have &quot;not changed.&quot;
U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo insists that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean peninsula is completely denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov emphasized the principle of &quot;responding to action with action.&quot; He pointed out: &quot;The weakening trend of sanctions should be in sync with North Korea&#39;s steps on the road to gradually denuclearization.&quot;
There is no doubt that relevant parties should continue to fully, completely and accurately implement the Security Council&#39;s resolutions related to North Korea, but pressure is not the purpose. Implementing sanctions and promoting political settlement are both requirements of the Security Council resolutions. One cannot be partial to the other, and one cannot choose only one. .
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive progress in relations between North Korea, South Korea and the United States, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider activating reversible provisions at an appropriate time, thereby encouraging North Korea and relevant parties to take greater steps in the direction of denuclearization. pace of.
Looking back on the past, every progress in the denuclearization and peace process of the peninsula required sufficient political courage from all parties.
At present, in the face of the international community&#39;s increasing expectations for the political settlement of the Peninsula issue, relevant parties should especially demonstrate political courage, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve problems, continue to take steps toward each other, and advance the Peninsula issue in parallel. The denuclearization process and the establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula will jointly create permanent peace on the peninsula.

TOKYO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Confidence among Japan&#39;s largest manufacturers hit its lowest level in more than a year in the September quarter, the Bank of Japan&#39;s quarterly Tankan survey showed on Monday, as rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affected production. Businesses are feeling the pinch.
The survey showed little evidence that escalating global trade frictions have dampened confidence among large manufacturers.
However, the risk of a full-scale trade war has hit corporate business prospects and may threaten corporate capital expenditures.
Buoyant capital spending is a bright spot in Japan&#39;s economy.
The survey casts doubt on the Bank of Japan&#39;s view that solid economic expansion will help accelerate inflation towards its 2% target, despite signs that companies are gradually passing costs on to customers.
&quot;Confidence among manufacturers has stagnated due to slowing exports and weak factory production amid concerns over the global trade war,&quot; said Takeshi Minami, chief researcher at Norinchukin Research Institute.
&quot;Confidence remains high. And because corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don&#39;t think confidence will continue to decline. &quot;
The Tankan survey showed that the judgment index on the prosperity of large-scale manufacturing industries fell to positive 19 in September from positive 21 three months ago, which was the third consecutive quarter of deterioration.
The market&#39;s median estimate was positive 22.
The sentiment judgment index for the large non-manufacturing industry fell to positive 22 in September from positive 24 in the June survey, the first deterioration in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey was positive at 22.
The survey shows that both the large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing business climate judgment indexes are expected to remain unchanged in December.
Investors were unfazed by the decline in the Tankan&#39;s business sentiment index, with Japan&#39;s Nikkei index rising to a 27-year high on Monday as the yen&#39;s continued depreciation helped improve Japanese companies&#39; export profit prospects.
Capital expenditures are solid.
Although business confidence fell, the latest Tankan highlighted solid corporate capital spending plans, helped by renewed capacity and increased investment in robots and automation to cope with labor shortages caused by an aging population.
The central bank&#39;s Tankan survey shows that large companies plan to increase capital expenditures by 13.4% in the current fiscal year ending in March 2019.
It was 13.6% in the previous Tankan survey.
Minami Takeshi said that capital expenditures of all enterprises this fiscal year are planned to increase by 8.5%, which is close to the pace of Japan&#39;s bubble economy era.
&quot;With small businesses raising their profit forecasts from now on, there is still room for further growth in capital spending, but much depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence,&quot; he said.
The Tankan survey showed that companies&#39; ability to pass on costs has increased. The output price index of large companies was positive 7, the highest point in ten years. This is an encouraging sign and reflects the progress made in Japan&#39;s efforts to fight deflation.
The index measuring the employment status of large enterprises hit minus 23, the tightest level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
Japan&#39;s economy rebounded in the second quarter from a contraction in January-March this year, thanks to strong business spending.
However, trade frictions escalated in the summer and supply chains were disrupted by natural disasters, clouding the outlook for Japan&#39;s export-reliant economy.
If measured in US dollars, the growth rate of service import and export was 16.4%.
A press release on the website of the Ministry of Commerce quoted the person in charge of the Department of Trade in Services as saying that the total import and export volume of emerging services exceeded 1 trillion yuan from January to August, and the growth rate was faster than the overall rate.
Among them, the total import and export of emerging services was 1,138.39 billion yuan, an increase of 20.9%, which was 10.4 percentage points higher than the overall growth rate of service imports and exports, driving the proportion of emerging services to increase by nearly 3 percentage points.
In terms of service exports, from January to August, service exports continued the rapid growth momentum this year, and the export growth rate was 5.7 percentage points higher than the import growth rate.
Among them, the top three growth areas are telecommunications, computer and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, and insurance services, with growth rates of 61.1%, 38.8%, and 26.5% respectively.
The person in charge of the Department of Trade in Services also pointed out that the proportion of emerging service imports also gradually increased from January to August.
From January to August, imports of emerging services grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6% of service imports, an increase of 1.6 percentage points compared with the same period last year.
Among them, the import growth rates of financial services, intellectual property royalties, telecommunications computers and information services all exceeded 20%, which were 47.1%, 23.3% and 23.2% respectively.
La Liga: Messi came off the bench to assist and equalize Barcelona&#39;s three-game winless run in the league.

Oil prices may usher in a &quot;three consecutive rises&quot;. Self-driving trips during the National Day can fill up with oil in advance.
China News Service, Beijing, September 30 (Reporter Qiu Yu) At 24:00 on September 30, a new round of refined oil price adjustment window will open simultaneously with the National Day holiday.
Many institutions predict that oil prices will rise significantly, achieving &quot;three consecutive increases.&quot;
Car owners who plan to travel by car can fill up their cars with gas before the price increases.
According to data calculated by Longzhong Information, the corresponding increase in domestic refined oil products is expected to be about 190 yuan/ton; Zhuochuang Information estimates that the increase is 220 yuan/ton.
In September, oil prices have been raised twice: on September 3, gasoline and diesel prices were raised by 180 yuan/ton and 170 yuan/ton respectively; on September 17, gasoline and diesel prices were raised by 145 yuan/ton and 145 yuan/ton respectively.
Domestic oil prices are linked to international oil prices. Since this pricing cycle, international oil prices have fluctuated and risen. After Brent crude oil broke through the $80 mark, it continued to rise.
As of the close on September 28, U.S. WTI crude oil futures closed up $1.13 at $73.25 per barrel.
Brent crude oil futures closed up $1.0 at $82.72 per barrel.
&quot;From the perspective of the international situation, tensions such as U.S. sanctions on Iran have piled up, and the overall trend of oil prices has been strong. Subsequently, the OPEC production reduction meeting clearly refused to increase production, giving the market confidence, and oil prices have steadily risen.&quot;
Zang Wengang, refined oil analyst at Zhuochuang Information, said.

Beijing, November 5 (Reuters) - A press release issued by the China Foreign Trade Center on Sunday stated that the Canton Fair showed that China&#39;s foreign trade situation remains complex and severe, with 80.6% of companies expecting exports in 2018 to be better than the previous year or remain the same.
However, considering the external environment in which the cost of domestic raw materials, labor and other comprehensive factors continues to rise, and the impact of Sino-US trade friction is increasing, exhibitors also believe that the export situation next year is not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, Deputy Secretary-General, Spokesperson and Deputy Director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers attending this Canton Fair and the export transactions both decreased slightly year-on-year.
There were 189,812 buyers attending the conference this year, coming from 215 countries and regions, a year-on-year decrease of 1.11%.
Export transactions were RMB 206.494 billion (equivalent to US$29.86 billion), a year-on-year decrease of 1%.
From a market perspective, transactions with Japan, the ten ASEAN countries, the BRIC countries, and South Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2%, and 2.5% respectively, while transactions with traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada, and the European Union decreased by 30.3%, and 8.9% respectively. %, 7.3%, 0.8%.
From an industry perspective, transportation, machinery and equipment, construction and decoration materials, consumer electronics and information products, and bathroom equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1%, and 7.6% respectively, while textiles and clothing, and household appliances decreased by 13.0% respectively. , 6.7%.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer and weather vane of China&#39;s foreign trade, the buyer attendance situation and export transaction data of this Canton Fair show that China&#39;s foreign trade development next year will still face many uncertain and unstable factors.
However, with the deepening of supply-side structural reform, and the recent national and local policies and measures on &quot;six stability&quot; and other aspects, China&#39;s foreign trade development is accelerating the accumulation of new momentum, and corporate market diversification continues to make new progress. These They are all important foundations and powerful conditions for the development of foreign trade.
&quot;Taking all factors into consideration, it is expected that China&#39;s foreign trade import and export will maintain steady growth throughout the year, with quality and efficiency further improved.&quot; Xu Bing said.
The General Administration of Customs of China announced that exports in US dollar terms increased by 14.5% year-on-year in September, and imports increased by 14.3% year-on-year. The trade surplus in September was US$31.69 billion. Both the export growth rate and the trade surplus in September were the highest since February this year.
Despite the escalating trade friction between China and the United States, China&#39;s export performance in September still significantly exceeded expectations. Strong external demand, companies rushing to export before the United States imposes additional tariffs, and the depreciation of the RMB exchange rate are the main supporting factors, which also show the resilience of China&#39;s foreign trade to a certain extent. , but the impact of the Sino-US trade war on confidence and the industrial chain cannot be underestimated. Analysts believe that the challenges of China&#39;s foreign trade may appear in the fourth quarter or next year.
A Reuters survey showed that U.S. fund managers recommended increasing their cash holdings in September and continued to maintain a cautious stance as the United States and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs and the dispute showed no signs of easing.
However, according to the recommendations of the 12 fund managers who participated in this survey, asset allocation in North America increased to the highest level since June 2017, while positions in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, and especially emerging markets declined.
The global stock allocation averaged 56.6% and bonds accounted for 35.5%, basically consistent with last month&#39;s survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash ratio increased to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager from a large fund company said, &quot;Some economic data has brought confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so it is best to be prepared to enter when the market falls back. &quot;
But fund managers still favored stocks in September, especially U.S. stocks, even though U.S. stocks are considered expensive.
Today, in Shanghai, the landmark of China&#39;s openness, the world&#39;s first large-scale national exhibition with the theme of import - China International Import Expo, officially opened with much anticipation.
An exhibition is like a &quot;window&quot; that allows the world to better understand a city and a country.
Through the &quot;window&quot; of the CIIE, people can see &quot;opening up China&quot; moving towards a higher level; with the help of the &quot;window&quot; of the CIIE, people welcome the world to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results with China, which is &quot;restarting from reform and opening up&quot;.
&quot;For a country, opening up is like emerging from a cocoon as a butterfly. Although it will experience temporary pain, it will be reborn. &quot;
General Secretary Xi Jinping’s summary of the road to opening up revealed an important reason for “why China can do it.”
Looking back on the 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which has dared to plunge into the vast ocean of the world market, has encountered whirlpools and storms, but has always faced all risks and challenges with an open attitude, constantly releasing endogenous power and constantly improving its competitiveness.
It can be said that China has used its own solid achievements to effectively explain the value and significance of openness.
Standing at a new historical starting point, holding an import-themed expo is a major decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core to promote a new round of high-level opening up to the outside world. It is also a major step for China to proactively open its market to the world. These measures are China&#39;s practical actions to support economic globalization and trade liberalization, demonstrating the strong and clear will of &quot;China&#39;s door of opening up will not close, but will only open wider and wider.&quot;
The enthusiastic registration of exhibitors from all over the world and the &quot;hard to find&quot; booth space are the greatest affirmation and the best response to China&#39;s development of an open economy on a larger scale, in a wider field, and at a deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have built high walls of trade protectionism and retreated to the old path of unilateralism, which has increased the international community&#39;s concerns about the prospects of free trade and added many uncertainties to the recovering world economy.
Against this background, this grand event on the banks of the Huangpu River reflects China&#39;s defense of free trade and allows the world to see China&#39;s confidence and responsibility in opening its market and sharing the future.
Traveling alone is fast, traveling together is far.
China opens its mind and embraces the world, which not only effectively promotes its own development, but also brings surging &quot;China opportunities&quot; to other countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the joint construction of the &quot;Belt and Road&quot;, initiated the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and established the Silk Road Fund... China has provided a series of international public goods and provided real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, allowing all countries to Enterprises take a &quot;free ride&quot; on the &quot;express train&quot; of China&#39;s development.
The CIIE is also such a public product and a large platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 companies from more than 130 countries and regions have debuted with unique high-quality products and services, taking a new step in the Chinese market.
In addition to companies from various countries, domestic consumers are also the real beneficiaries.
By building this &quot;best-in-class&quot; platform, we provide multiple channels of high-quality supply for consumption upgrades to meet the people&#39;s personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs.
As China opens its door wider and wider, goods flow smoothly and materials are put to best use, the steps towards a better life will become more solid.
From a more macro perspective, the significance of the CIIE has gone beyond the scope of economics and trade. Instead, it focuses on the future, conveys the concepts of openness, inclusiveness, universal benefit, balance, and win-win, and forms a consensus to jointly respond to today&#39;s challenges.
Only when the world is good can China do well; only when China is good can the world be better.
We expect that the CIIE will bring excitement and perfection to the world; we also look forward to moving towards a higher level of &quot;open China&quot; and joining hands with the world to build a glorious future of a community with a shared future for mankind.
Foreign media: The United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[Abstract] The agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and the United States temporarily not imposing tariffs on Canadian-produced cars.
According to foreign media reports, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of September 30, local time, that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
According to reports, the agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and the United States temporarily not imposing tariffs on Canadian-produced cars.
On the 27th of last month, the United States and Mexico announced that they had reached a preliminary agreement in principle on updating the North American Free Trade Agreement. However, the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement before the August 31 deadline set by the United States and extended the negotiation period to September 30. .
Previously, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said that Canada would only sign beneficial agreements, &quot;The focus is on the substance, not the timetable. We will continue to negotiate and hope to reach an agreement that is in Canada&#39;s national interests. &quot;
More than 90% of Brazilian female voters said that presidential candidates did not consider the needs of women.
According to the South American Overseas Chinese News Network, data recently released by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) shows that more than 90% of Brazilian women do not believe that presidential candidates consider the needs of women.
According to the report, currently, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million. If all the women in Brazil were gathered together to form a country, the country&#39;s population would rank 13th in the world, with a population that is more than twice the population of Spain.
In Brazil, female voters account for 52% of the total voters, and men account for 48%. Although the proportion of women among voters is very high, in Brazil&#39;s Congress, women only account for 10%.
Among 193 countries in the world, Brazilian women&#39;s participation in politics ranks only 154th, higher than Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women still have not succeeded in obtaining the rights they deserve.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori pointed out that the reason for this phenomenon is the result of the interaction of ancient patriarchal society, racism and capitalist values.
&quot;Politics should be about citizens claiming civil rights, identity, access to public goods, and multiple social groups forming the same society. But politics in Brazil is a monopoly of one group, and the majority of the population is not represented. &quot;
A previous study conducted by the Brazilian Motorcycle Research Institute (Locomotiva) also pointed out that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that elected politicians can represent their rights, and 90% of Brazilian women disagree with the decisions made by politicians. , 93% of women disagree with the current government policies.
&quot;We need to reverse the underrepresentation of women in parliament. Brazil&#39;s political system is still affected by inequality. So far, there are still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in Brazilian politics.&quot; Natalia・Morrie said.
Despite women&#39;s lack of rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey shows that 76% of women believe that they can make a difference in democratic elections, and 72% of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to make women suffer less prejudice.

With growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets mostly uninspiring, the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine of global economic growth.
On September 23, 2018, a container ship was parked in the port of New Jersey, USA.
However, because the current growth in the United States benefits from the time bought by the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts, the country&#39;s economy has also been closely watched by the outside world.
&quot;As the United States returns to full employment, an economic downturn is inevitable. &quot;
He said the only question was when it would happen, and in his opinion, it would probably be sooner rather than later.
While Barclays is optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy through the end of the year, the bank acknowledges that forecasts further out are more difficult.
&quot;In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost economic growth potential, the current growth spurred by fiscal policy will be unsustainable,&quot; Barclays economists said in a research note.
&quot;In the absence of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing for the economy in 2020 will rise,&quot; they said.
A series of business surveys will roughly show the stage of the economic cycle that major economies are in at the end of the third quarter.
Euro zone and U.S. manufacturing surveys due to be released next Monday will be watched, followed by a services survey on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week&#39;s data will inevitably be the U.S. non-farm payrolls data to be released next Friday, which will provide clues as to whether the tight job market is driving significant wage growth.
It&#39;s important not only because of its importance to corporate profitability and consumers&#39; purchasing power, but also because a jump in wages could trigger a rise in overall inflation, potentially unnerving officials at the Federal Reserve.
“Salaries will be of great concern as they are likely to rise sharply again compared to the previous month.
The year-on-year increase in September may not exceed 3%, but we can fully expect it to break through next month,&quot; economists at ING wrote in a research note.
European politics could be a source of market volatility as holidays in China and other parts of Asia lead to thin data from the region next week.
The Italian government has ignored its previous financial commitments to the EU, and other EU member states will have to quickly determine whether to firmly oppose Italy&#39;s decision. Tria did not support the decision and wanted to abide by EU rules.
Sparks are also likely to fly at the Conservative Party&#39;s annual conference in Birmingham as Brexit negotiations enter a critical stage.
Meanwhile, concerns surrounding emerging markets are unlikely to abate as Brazil holds its much-anticipated presidential election next weekend.
[Abstract] After the ship is completed, it will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China for use. Chen Zhi, director of the Observation Division of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship will be put into use and will contribute to the development of China’s offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global Ocean observation is of great significance.
On September 29, China&#39;s first 3,000-ton large-scale buoy ship &quot;Xiangyanghong 22&quot; was launched by China Wuchang Shipbuilding Corporation.
After completion, the ship will break China&#39;s current equipment bottleneck in support work such as the deployment, recovery, and emergency repair of large buoys and submersible buoys.
The &quot;Xiangyanghong 22&quot; ship is mainly used for regular inspection and maintenance, regular deployment, and recovery of buoys/submersible buoys, emergency deployment, recovery, and emergency repair of buoys/submersible buoys. It also has the ability to perform comprehensive oceanographic survey tasks such as cross-sectional surveys. .
The new ship has a total length of 89 meters, a molded width of 18 meters, a molded depth of 7.2 meters, and a endurance of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Weiling, deputy general manager of Wuchang Shipbuilding Group, said: &quot;The Xiangyanghong 22 ship is my country&#39;s first large-scale buoy operation ship and the only domestic work ship capable of lifting ten-meter large buoy operations. It will further enhance my country&#39;s large-scale buoy support capabilities. &quot;
It is understood that after the ship is completed, it will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China for use. Chen Zhi, director of the Observation Division of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship will be put into use and will contribute to the development of China&#39;s offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global Ocean observation is of great significance.
“This ship is capable of both large-scale buoy deployment and maintenance operations, as well as comprehensive ocean survey capabilities. It is my country’s first comprehensive ship specifically used for buoy operations and comprehensive ocean surveys in the far-reaching sea.
With such a buoy operation vessel, we will have a powerful tool for ocean observation and ocean survey in the future. &quot;
China News Service, Qingdao, October 1st. Affected by the impact of Typhoon &quot;Tami&quot;, the 2018 International Extreme Sailing Series Qingdao Station &quot;Mazarin Cup&quot; originally scheduled to start on September 30 has postponed the first competition day to October. It was held on the 1st, and a pre-match meeting was held at the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center before the game. The captains of 12 hydrofoil catamaran sailing teams from 6 countries and regions all appeared.
Affected by Typhoon &quot;Tami&quot;, strong winds continued in the harbor, with the maximum wind speed even reaching 24 knots. The sailing signal was delayed for nearly 90 minutes from 1:00 pm on the 30th, and the wind speed still did not decrease. The chief referee of the event, Anne Muldran It has been announced that the first day of competition will be canceled and postponed to the afternoon of October 1st.
&quot;The strong winds blowing from the shore continue, and the sea conditions are really violent. &quot;
Mdrant explained: “In this case, no one knows when and with what force the gust will hit the racing boat.
For a venue close to a city, given the current wind conditions, canceling the race is the wisest choice. &quot;
The crew, who had everything ready, were still a little disappointed.
&quot;The boat is ready and we are in good shape. &quot;
Max Richardson, the helmsman of the Qingdao team, said frankly: &quot;But I know that rescheduling the race is the right choice, and I hope the wind will be lighter today and we can show off our skills. &quot;
Omika Wilkinson, known as the &quot;hope star&quot; of the New Zealand team for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, said: &quot;Losing a day makes the game more interesting.

Although the global financial market continues to be turbulent, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the Exchange Fund&#39;s investment income in the third quarter of this year fell 97% year-on-year but was better than the previous quarter&#39;s performance, as overseas stocks rose under the Sino-US trade war. Foreign exchange losses also narrowed significantly.
According to the latest data from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$1.6 billion from July to September 2018, significantly lower than the HK$61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Chan Delin, President of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said at the Legislative Council that at the beginning of the Sino-U.S. trade war, Hong Kong and emerging market stock indexes ran counter to the U.S. stock index. It was not until the end of September and early October that the U.S. stock market indexes peaked, and market sentiment began to reverse, as investors Gradually, we realize that the trade war is also detrimental to the United States itself.
&quot;It is a good thing that market sentiment changes. If the trade war only has a unilateral impact, it will not help much to solve the problem. &quot;
But he also pointed out, &quot;If the Sino-US trade war cannot be resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise. &quot;
In the third quarter of this year, the Exchange Fund&#39;s stock investment losses in Hong Kong narrowed 8% from the previous quarter to HK$4.7 billion, while overseas stock investment income surged 172% to HK$12.8 billion; foreign exchange losses were HK$16.2 billion, and bond income was HK$9.7 billion. , decreased by 24% and 31% respectively quarter-on-quarter, mainly reflecting the general rise of the US dollar against major currencies during the quarter and the rise of US interest rates above the 3% level in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Hong Kong has implemented a linked exchange rate system in which the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1983.
Regarding Hong Kong&#39;s current financial situation, Chen Delin said that economic and asset market uncertainties have increased, and downside risks have increased. However, Hong Kong&#39;s financial system is stable, well defensive, and has sufficient earthquake resistance.
&quot;Hong Kong&#39;s international investment position is ample, with a net external asset value of US$1.4 trillion, equivalent to 4 times GDP, higher than Singapore&#39;s 2.5 times and Japan&#39;s 0.6 times. It is more than enough to cope with the economic downturn or reversal. &quot;
Recently, the Hong Kong dollar offered interest rate has continued to fall and the interest rate gap between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar has widened. Chen Delin pointed out that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate once rose by more than 400 basis points on September 21. The market generally believed that it was mainly related to the increase in the Hong Kong dollar offered interest rate. Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar was around 7.80-7.84. HIBOR has continued to fall recently, and the interest rate differential with the U.S. dollar has widened, which may attract an increase in arbitrage activities of selling Hong Kong dollars and buying U.S. dollars, making the chance of Hong Kong dollars triggering the weak-side convertibility guarantee greater than before.
However, he believes that as the interest rate hike cycle of Hong Kong banks begins and the normalization of Hong Kong dollar interest rates is in progress, the situation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates being lower than US dollar interest rates will change in the future.
&quot;The trend of Hong Kong dollar interest rates and US dollar interest rates will become more consistent. Everyone must manage risks more carefully and be prepared to cope with market fluctuations. &quot;
As Hong Kong dollar funds are abundant, Hong Kong dollar interest rates fell further. The three-month interest rate fell 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, and the interest rate difference with the U.S. dollar widened from 46 basis points to 51 basis points. The one-month interest rate hit a five-month low, with the U.S. dollar interest rate widening to 51 basis points. The difference widened from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the spot exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar was close to 7.85 per US dollar most of the time.
During this period, due to factors such as interest arbitrage activities and the outflow of some proceeds from the IPO into Hong Kong dollars after the completion of large-scale IPOs, the weak-side convertibility guarantee was triggered multiple times in May and August after being triggered for the first time in April.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority purchases Hong Kong dollars and sells U.S. dollars at the level of 7.85 in accordance with the linked exchange rate system to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
The HKMA purchased a total of approximately HK$52.1 billion under the weak-side convertibility guarantee mechanism in May and August.

There is no &quot;threshold&quot; for confinement centers: quality certification promotes quality improvement.
With the boost of the &quot;two-child economy&quot; and the prosperity of the maternal and infant market, confinement centers of various grades have emerged in various places from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to third- and fourth-tier cities.
The currently popular postpartum care centers meet the consumer needs of the masses, with fees ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan. However, they are also in an embarrassing situation. So far, this institution has no threshold and there is still a gap in supervision.
The State Administration for Market Regulation recently launched a series of national &quot;Quality Month&quot; activities in 2018. The reporter came to a five-star confinement center in Tianjin to explore the maternal and infant care service certification experience.
General confinement centers provide services such as newborn care, nutritious meals, and postpartum repair and shaping.
In this confinement center, the reporter saw that nurses checked the breastfeeding status of newborns every day, and professional nurses provided detailed care services such as bathing and touching newborns.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, we provide services such as wound care in the early stage of confinement, body care in the middle and late stages of confinement, and TCM treatment and beauty care programs to help mothers regain their slim figure.
A new mother who lives there told reporters that she only booked this confinement center eight months in advance.
The services of confinement clubs directly affect the comfort level and physical recovery of mothers during confinement. Some small confinement clubs can only provide some simple confinement services, with non-standard disinfection and hygiene, easy cross-infection, and single diet. Unscientific and other hidden dangers.
The person in charge of this confinement center said that they are the only five-star confinement center in Tianjin that has obtained B-level service certification.
&quot;Although some customers did not understand the meaning of B-level certification at first, passing the certification forces companies to strictly standardize process management, which benefits customers and is of great significance to the long-term development of the company.&quot; He said.
Pan Lifen, deputy director of the Certification and Supervision Department of the State Administration for Market Regulation, said that service certification is a new certification system based on customer perception, focusing on organizational quality management and satisfaction of service characteristics. It is an important part of the national quality infrastructure and plays an important role in improving quality services. It plays a positive role in increasing the proportion of supply and enhancing the international competitiveness of China&#39;s services.
Our country started in 2004. After more than 10 years of development, service certification projects have experienced a process of gradual development from scratch, such as financial services certification, maternal and infant care service certification, commodity after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification, etc. A number of influential service certifications such as health care service certification.
According to statistics from the State Administration for Market Regulation, there are currently more than 130 service certification institutions in my country, with more than 2,000 service certification personnel and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.
Pan Lifen said that it is necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually expand the coverage of service certification in health, education, sports, finance, e-commerce and other fields, and promote supply-side reform and quality improvement in the service industry.
Reuters Hong Kong, November 5 - Hong Kong property prices have fallen for two consecutive months after peaking. Hong Kong Monetary Authority President Delin Chan said on Monday that it still takes time to observe whether the property market has entered a downward cycle. If confirmed, it can be considered to gradually relax at an appropriate time. Tightening policy with countercyclical measures.
Chen Delin also pointed out that if property prices fall back, the first people to be affected will be those who bought properties during the peak period of the property market. However, it is expected that the chance of property prices falling sharply and people selling their properties at significant price cuts like the one experienced during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 is much lower. .
When Chan Delin led a number of senior HKMA officials to attend a briefing at the Legislative Council, he said that if it is confirmed that the property market has entered a downward cycle, measures can be relaxed one after another as appropriate.
&quot;But we have only seen a few weeks of data now, so it is still too early to relax. We still need more time to see whether the property market has entered a downward cycle. &quot;
Since October 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has launched eight rounds of countercyclical measures to significantly tighten mortgages for various properties, including lowering mortgage ratios and requiring mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests, in order to improve bank risk management and Earthquake resistance.
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest rate hike cycle, the private residential property price index in Hong Kong peaked and fell for two consecutive months from August to September. The monthly decline in September expanded to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year still reached 10.2%.
According to data from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, household financial conditions, which measure Hong Kong&#39;s resilience to financial risks, remain healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of owner-occupied households in Hong Kong without mortgages reached 66%, compared with the 2009-11 average of 60%. High; the average loan-to-value ratio of newly approved mortgages and the payment-to-income ratio of newly approved mortgages were 47% and 34% respectively, which were significantly improved from 64% and 41% respectively in 2009-11.
However, Chen Delin said that high earthquake resistance does not mean that people who have purchased homes will not be harmed by the economic downturn, because property valuations will fall, and those who buy properties during the peak period will bear the brunt.
Although the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has tightened bank lending to mortgage lenders, homebuyers can also obtain high-percentage mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Chen Delin said that currently, together with the mortgage loans provided to developers, the borrower&#39;s mortgage ratio can reach 85-90%. If the property price drops by 10%, negative equity will appear (that is, the market value of the property drops below the total outstanding mortgage loan). s level) .
However, Ruan Guoheng, deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, pointed out that the authority estimates that the total number of high-factor mortgages provided by developers only accounts for 2-2.5% of the total bank mortgages, which is still a low proportion.
At the peak of negative equity in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative equity cases exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of the proportion of mortgage holders.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong has recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive quarters.

China News Service, Shenzhen, October 1st (Zheng Xiaohong, Xu Dianwei, Liu Shumeng) October 1st is the first day of the &quot;Golden Week&quot; of the Mainland&#39;s National Day, and it is also the last day of the National Day public holiday in Hong Kong. Many mainland residents use the holiday to travel abroad and shop, and many Hong Kong residents who came to Shenzhen returned to Hong Kong on the same day, and Shenzhen&#39;s ports experienced &quot;overflow&quot; passenger flow. Luohu and Shenzhen Bay ports opened 22 new self-service lanes to improve port customs clearance efficiency and facilitate efficient and fast customs clearance for passengers.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic and difficult disease that affects multiple organs throughout the body. It was once considered an &quot;incurable disease&quot;.
Because its pathogenesis is unclear, diagnosis and treatment are difficult, and effective treatments are lacking, it cannot be cured.
Recently, a team led by Liu Wanli, a researcher at the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University, and Li Zhangguo, director of the Rheumatology and Immunology Center at Peking University People&#39;s Hospital, discovered that human immunoglobulins have molecular variations that increase susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus, and that this variation is involved in the regulation of immune B cells. .
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors of the article and Peking University People&#39;s Hospital, Li Zhanguo&#39;s team collected nearly 2,000 large samples of systemic lupus erythematosus patients and conducted research. They found that patients with immunoglobulin mutations produced pathogenic cells in a wide variety and quantity. With more autoantibodies, the incidence and severity of inflammation such as nephritis, arthritis, serositis, and vasculitis are significantly increased.
Through various research methods such as immune cell tracing, animal experiments, and sequencing, Liu Wanli&#39;s team discovered the immune signaling pathway activated by this immune molecule mutation and the pathogenic mechanism that promotes B cells to secrete a variety of autoantibodies.
The reporter learned that the two teams have joined forces to give full play to their respective advantages and achieve a close integration of basic research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli&#39;s team is committed to research on B lymphocyte immune recognition and immune activation, while Li Zhanguo&#39;s team has been engaged in clinical research on systemic lupus erythematosus for a long time.
&quot;This study is one of the results of many years of cooperation between the two teams. It is also the first time that the academic community has recognized that immunoglobulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus on a mechanistic basis, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted therapy. Base. &quot;
This is not to protect one&#39;s shortcomings, but to act in accordance with the law.
Lawyers carry an ax to court?
The news was indeed exciting at first glance, and it also caused a stir in legal circles.
Fujian Quanzhou Sino-French Law Firm subsequently fined the lawyer involved 500 yuan and recommended in writing that the Quanzhou Lawyers Association conduct an investigation.
According to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association recently issued an official notice stating that the actions of the two lawyers did not involve any violation of laws or regulations and would not be punished in accordance with the law.
According to various reports, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association’s handling was not to defend shortcomings or engage in confrontation, but was approved by the Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court.
An incident that might have caused tension within the legal community was finally resolved appropriately.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete restoration of the truth: the ax carried by the lawyer involved was of the same style and model as the defendant&#39;s murder weapon, but it was not sharpened. It was only used as auxiliary evidence in the process of evidence and cross-examination, and there was no intimidation or &quot;endangerment&quot;. court security&quot; subjective intention.
There are four very important details that need to be paid attention to when judging whether the behavior of the lawyer involved is illegal: First, the local court only showed photos of the ax in two previous sessions. From a defense perspective, it is necessary to show the original ax; Secondly, the ax was purchased only one hour before the trial. It was not because the lawyer was unwilling to seek the judge’s consent, but objectively he was unable to contact the judge; thirdly, the entire ax was not used excessively or improperly; fourthly, the incident involved The lawyer immediately publicly admitted his mistake and expressed his apology to the court.
Based on these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer involved &quot;bringing an ax to court&quot; has nothing to do with evil, but just to defend himself.
After clarifying the entire facts, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association did not go along with the situation, but withstood the pressure and made a decision not to impose punishment.
And this decision can also stand the test of facts and law.
As for bringing an ax, which is a regulated knife, to the court without the court&#39;s permission, it is indeed easy to cause uneasiness and misunderstanding.
Out of safety and prudence considerations, the Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court’s previous fines and judicial recommendations are understandable.
In order to maintain the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from making things difficult for lawyers, the Supreme Court issued the &quot;People&#39;s Court Judicial Police Safety Inspection Rules&quot; in 2014, establishing the principle that lawyers do not need to undergo personal safety inspections when appearing in court.
Since the promulgation of the rules, lawyers have set an example and few incidents have occurred that endanger court safety due to security loopholes.
In rare cases like Quanzhou, misunderstandings are not difficult to eliminate as long as communication is conducted in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
As the self-regulatory organization of the lawyer profession, the Lawyers Association has the dual mission of punishing illegal acts and ensuring legality.
In the past, individual bar associations were criticized for focusing on punishment and failing to provide protection.
The decision of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is worthy of praise in terms of both process and results, and has set an example for more lawyers associations to correctly perform their duties.

The gap has narrowed, while the gap between the three higher tax brackets of 30%, 35% and 45% remains unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law also adjusts the tax rates for various levels of income from production and operations, with the lower limit of the highest 35% tax rate raised from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan.
This means that individual businesses and sole proprietorships and partnerships will benefit from the tax reform.
&quot;Judging from the previous calculations of personal tax reductions for Shanghai taxpayers, the majority of taxpayers will fully feel the dividends of the personal tax reform, especially the tax reductions for middle- and low-income groups. &quot;
Lan Min, head of the Personal Income Tax Division of the Shanghai Taxation Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation, said.
Benefit 3: Tax services are more convenient and optimized
Since the promulgation of the new personal income tax law, the Shanghai tax department has launched a series of comprehensive and extensive tax publicity actions.
On the one hand, &quot;one-on-one, point-to-point&quot; policy guidance is provided to key tax sources and key enterprises.
The Pudong New Area Taxation Bureau has successively visited large enterprises such as Apple Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Alipay (China) Network Technology Co., Ltd., and Red Star Macalline Home Furnishing Group Co., Ltd. These enterprises have a large number of employees and a heavy workload of withholding and payment. , the tax amount is large, the tax department takes the initiative to provide guidance and answer questions; the Xuhui District Taxation Bureau visited the large-scale labor service companies in the region, such as Zhongzhi Financial Consulting Co., Ltd. and Zhongzhi Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Company, to promptly collect concerns from enterprises and respond to their demands. , to solve corporate difficulties.
On the other hand, we will promote “all-round, multi-dimensional and three-dimensional” tax policies to the general public taxpayers.
Use the Shanghai Taxation official website, WeChat public accounts, Weibo and other channels to push policy hot spots in a timely manner to ensure that policy publicity is in place.
At the same time, starting from September 28, the Shanghai Taxation WeChat public account has been launched on the 12366 intelligent consulting platform to carry out &quot;targeted&quot; intelligent integrated individual tax reform publicity services through &quot;artificial + intelligent&quot; tax service consultation.

Since the mid-2000s, North Dakota farmer Paul Thomas has been planting more and more soybeans on his land as China&#39;s demand for the oilseed grows.
This transformation reached its peak this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans on 5,000 acres, reaching an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch to corn and wheat in 2019, which have been staple crops in America’s agricultural regions.
U.S. farmers planted more soybeans than corn this year for the first time in 35 years.
The plan to switch to other food crops is because U.S. farmers are facing difficulties selling soybeans in the context of U.S. President Trump&#39;s trade war with China.
China normally buys about 60% of U.S. soybean exports, but has purchased almost zero U.S. soybeans in recent months because of the trade war, sending soybean prices to a decade low.
Thomas plans to grow more wheat next year, hoping to make more money by reducing his reliance on crops that depend on demand from China.
Thomas said soybean prices &quot;hit us hard.&quot;
He said that without Chinese buying demand, the spot price of soybeans near his farm is US$7.10 per bushel, and the price necessary to cover costs is US$8.50.
U.S. farmers have planted soybean acreage at a record high this year, and the harvest is also expected to hit a record high.
At such a vulnerable moment, they were hit by the trade war.
In response to Trump&#39;s tariffs on imported Chinese goods, China imposed import tariffs on U.S. soybeans in July.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its first estimate of planted acreage next year, which is expected to include consideration of the impact of tariffs.
The forecast is expected to confirm private sector expectations that soybean acreage will decrease.
Informa Economics forecast on Oct. 19 that the area planted to corn will increase 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019, while the area planted to soybeans will decrease 7% to 83 million acres, according to a report seen by Reuters.
Informa also expects U.S. wheat acreage to increase by 4%.
The area of soybeans planted before the retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres more than a decade ago.
Corn acreage has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008 to 89.1 million acres, and wheat acreage this year is 47.8 million acres, close to the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Growers Association, has a total planting area of 3,600 acres. This year, he planted nearly half of soybeans, but plans to cut back in the future.
He said he might increase corn acreage by up to 20% on his farm in northern Illinois, the largest soybean-growing state in the United States.
Soybeans yield less per acre than corn, but they also require less fertilizer, making soybeans less expensive to grow overall.
If farmers switch to final-value corn, it could raise costs but benefit some companies, including fertilizer seller Andersons Inc.
Andersons chief executive Pat Bowe told Reuters he expected the switch to corn would benefit fertilizer use.
Bayer also expects to benefit from farmers switching to corn.

Xinhua International Commentary: Defend multilateralism and unite China’s knowledge and action.
At a time when unilateralism is countercurrent, international rules and multilateral order are under attack.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible major country, China has adopted the concept of following the general trend and taking solid and powerful actions to work with the international community to safeguard multilateralism and promote the continuous advancement of multilateralism.
In the face of new situations and new challenges, China has made a loud voice on the development direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in his speech at the general debate of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to the goal of win-win cooperation, be based on rules and order, have fairness and justice as its purpose, and be effective. Action oriented.
At the same time, China calls for the establishment of a global development cooperation pattern with the United Nations as the core, North-South cooperation as the main channel, and South-South cooperation as the supplement, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind.
China&#39;s thoughts and voices reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As Espinosa, President of the 73rd UN General Assembly, said, under the current situation, &quot;the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and maintain the rules-based international system more than ever.&quot;
Christine Lagarde, President of the International Monetary Fund, said that the international community should continue to firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules, and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the balance of global economic and political power, some emerging markets and developing country groups have emerged to play a greater role in major international multilateral mechanisms, providing new development impetus for multilateralism that has encountered headwinds.
Considered from this perspective, the multilateral concepts advocated by China, such as building a big family instead of cobbling together small circles, adhering to consultation and joint construction instead of winner-take-all, follow the trend of the times and are the inevitable choice to respond to global challenges and solve world problems. , representing the common aspirations of most countries in the world.
There are advanced ideas and solid actions.
The “One Belt, One Road” initiative proposed by China has become the largest international cooperation platform.
International and regional cooperation initiatives initiated by China such as the &quot;Belt and Road Initiative&quot;, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the &quot;16+1 Cooperation&quot; promote international and regional cooperation, improve and supplement the existing international system and order, and bring innovative vitality to multilateral cooperation. Contribute to promoting the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.
As a defender of the international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China is taking increasingly powerful actions on the multilateral stage of the United Nations.
Mediate in international hot spots, respond to climate change, participate in peacekeeping operations, vigorously reduce poverty and alleviate poverty, and help other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As United Nations Secretary-General Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the &quot;trust deficit&quot; faced by the world intensifies, and when populism and polarization tend to rise, it is the moment when the world needs multilateral cooperation most urgently.
At such a historical juncture, the international community needs to join hands to turn consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

The fifth &quot;Disability Voice Month&quot; has arrived to focus on the issue of sex education for disabled teenagers-China News
In recent years, the topic of sex education for Chinese teenagers has been widely discussed, but the challenge of sex education for teenagers with disabilities is still arduous.
Recently, a seminar on challenges and practical strategies for comprehensive sexuality education for people with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to provide sex education to children and young people with disabilities has become an important topic in this seminar.
The &quot;Report on Sex-Related Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviors of China&#39;s Disabled Children and Youth&quot; released at the meeting showed that the proportion of disabled children experiencing sexual harassment and sexual assault is higher than that of healthy children.
For children and teenagers with disabilities, the society pays more attention to &quot;sexual protection&quot;.
This seminar aims to discuss the promotion of comprehensive sex education for children and adolescents with disabilities in China from three aspects: family support, school education, and institutional services, and provide support for children and adolescents with disabilities from the source, so that they can enjoy love freely like others. s right.

Affected by traditional concepts and other factors, China&#39;s comprehensive sex education for people with disabilities, especially children and adolescents with disabilities, is not in-depth enough.
However, in recent years, with the support of UNESCO and public welfare individuals, the practice and implementation of sexual and reproductive health education for the full-cycle comprehensive development of people with disabilities in China have made gratifying developments.
The &quot;Report&quot; shows that although children and young people with visual impairments, hearing impairments, intellectual disabilities, and physical disabilities have more difficulties than the average person in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding intimate relationships, they have generally become more convenient and enriched.
The &quot;Seminar on Comprehensive Sexuality Education Challenges and Practical Strategies for People with Disabilities&quot; was hosted by the Shanghai Humane Charity Foundation and jointly supported by the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the Beijing Representative Office of the International Alliance for Disabled Persons (France), and the United Nations Population Fund Representative Office in China.

Reuters Beijing, September 30 - The People&#39;s Bank of China released data on scheduled short-term net outflows of foreign currency assets on Sunday, which showed that as of the end of August this year, the central bank&#39;s short positions in foreign currency forward contracts and futures contracts against local currencies had been zero for 12 consecutive months, and there were still no long positions that month. position.
Previous data from the central bank showed that as of the end of August last year, the central bank held a total of US$6.044 billion in short positions in forward and futures contracts of foreign currencies against local currencies, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; short positions denominated in SDR (Special Drawing Rights) The scale is 4.276 billion SDR.
Since then, the central bank’s short forward FX position has been at zero.
The central bank first released this data at the end of March 2016; the data showed that at the end of February 2016, the central bank&#39;s long positions in foreign currency forward contracts and futures contracts against local currencies were US$2.438 billion and short positions were US$28.9 billion.

On the evening of September 20 this year, Qiao, a junior student in Zhengzhou, took the K158 train to Hebi.
An old man on the train bought a ticket without a seat, but took her seat: &quot;Shoot, snap, snap.&quot;
After a two-hour journey, the train conductor tried to persuade him for an hour, but it still had no effect.
Finally, a male passenger in the same carriage couldn&#39;t stand it anymore and pulled the uncle up.
Judging from public opinion, although most of the final results are that the seat tyrants are condemned by the public, administratively punished by the public security department, or even included in the integrity blacklist, the public still feels that there is no &quot;relief of hatred&quot;: Why can&#39;t the seat tyrants be punished on the spot?
Why can&#39;t their immoral or even illegal behavior be stopped on the spot, but punished after the fact?
As for the unreasonable behavior of the &quot;big man in the seat&quot;, why was it just a male passenger who dragged him up because he saw an injustice on the road?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police officers, and short-distance trains generally do not have police officers. Even if there are police officers, the police are more concerned about the possible rogue reaction of the person occupying the seat and do not take measures to forcibly remove the passengers.
Frequent seat tying incidents have made people realize that the tyrants must be forcibly removed on the spot or even punished in order to have a deterrent effect.
This requires that our train police officers must dare to take strong and timely measures, and trains without police officers should be equipped with police officers as soon as possible to prevent and crack down on illegal activities in a timely manner.
On October 1, the first day of the National Day holiday, there was a sharp increase in traffic heading toward Songpan, Mao County, via Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County, Sichuan.
At about 13:00, the Beichuan traffic police received a call for help, saying that his family had a traffic accident in Songpan and was urgently sent to Mianyang for treatment due to limited local medical conditions.
It happens that one-way traffic control is implemented on Huanhu Road in Tangjiashan Barrier Lake, Beichuan, and I would like to ask the traffic police to allow the 120 ambulance to pass.
After receiving the call for help, the police on duty quickly reported the situation to the brigade. After briefly understanding the situation, the brigade captain Huang Xuemin immediately arranged for the police on duty at the control point to contact the caller and requested that all efforts be made to escort him.
&quot;There were more than a thousand vehicles entering the controlled road section at that time. After contacting the 120 ambulance, the estimated arrival time in Beichuan was around 15:00, and we immediately made arrangements and deployments. &quot;
Da Wei, leader of the Yuli Squadron of the Beichuan Traffic Police, said that the ambulance needed to detour from the Tangjiashan Barrier Lake Huanhu Road, and the road was steep and narrow. In order to prevent vehicles that had entered this section of the road from driving in double rows, the traffic police arrived an hour in advance. Sectional control is implemented for vehicles at the beginning, middle and end of the road, and all passing drivers are reminded to move to one side of the road to avoid missing vehicles for emergency vehicles.
Subsequently, the police from the Leigu Squadron also temporarily stopped vehicles from entering the controlled road section and lined up to give way to the approaching 120 ambulance.
At about 15:00, an ambulance with a Sichuan U license plate drove into Beichuan. The Beichuan traffic police sent a police car to clear the way and escort the ambulance into the controlled road section in the opposite direction.
It is understood that there are places on Huanhu Road that only one vehicle can pass through. The police temporarily controlled these places in advance to ensure that the 120 ambulance passed smoothly.
When arriving at Shilibei Village in Xuanping Township, there was a section of road that could not be given way, so the traffic police contacted the two village committees in advance, borrowed the village road to detour, and prohibited the entry of public vehicles.
&quot;It only took 40 minutes from the time Beichuan traffic police received the 120 ambulance to the time it entered the normal road of Provincial Highway 302. &quot;
Dawei said that under normal circumstances, the entire passage would take 4 hours.
&quot;This arrangement successfully bought valuable treatment time for the patient. &quot;
It is reported that at 17:20, critically ill patients were promptly sent to Mianyang for treatment.

Reuters, November 4 - The British Daily Telegraph reported on Sunday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has privately requested the UK&#39;s right to leave the Irish border &quot;backstop&quot; arrangement in three months.
According to reports, Raab made the request to Irish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney at a private meeting in London last Tuesday.

Yesterday morning at 8:05, two pickpocket suspects were caught while stealing from Yongdingmen Station to Zhushikou Station on the No. 20 bus.
Two pickpocketing men cut open the passenger&#39;s coat pockets and stole 800 yuan in cash, which was caught by the police who were already waiting nearby.
This is the first pickpocketing case cracked by Beijing police during the National Day holiday.
At around 5 o&#39;clock yesterday morning, anti-pocket investigators from the Beijing Public Security Mobile Investigation Corps arrived at their predetermined location.
According to past experience, places with concentrated crowds, bus hubs, bus and subway lines, including people watching the flag-raising in Tiananmen Square, are the key areas for their work.
In the crowd, plainclothes police officers calmly observed the passing crowds.
At around 7 a.m., investigators who were on guard at the bus station discovered two suspicious men following a male passenger onto the No. 20 bus from Yongdingmen Station.
In the car, two suspicious men, one on the left and one on the right, sandwiched the male passenger. One of them tried to cover the other.
But they didn&#39;t know that their every move had already fallen into the eyes of the plainclothes policemen who were observing.
&quot;Catch thieves and seize stolen goods&quot;, plainclothes policemen pay attention to the heat when arresting people. While waiting for the men to start stealing, the policemen stared intently at the men who were about to pickpocket. They were caught by investigators after they succeeded in pickpocketing.
A Beijing Morning News reporter saw that the police seized 800 yuan in cash from the theft suspect.
&quot;They took the money from the passengers&#39; clothes pockets. &quot;
The policeman pointed to a torn coat pocket and said: &quot;They cut this open and stole 800 yuan from a visitor to Beijing. When we caught them, the money had just been put into their own pockets. &quot;
The reporter learned that in order to catch the two men, the plainclothes police followed them for an hour and finally captured them while committing the crime.
Two suspects are currently under police review.
The plainclothes policeman told reporters that the question of who is suspicious in the crowd is very simple for the policeman.
&quot;If you catch a lot of thieves, you will find that their eyes and demeanor are different from ordinary passengers. In addition to staring at people&#39;s pockets and backpacks, they also like to sneak into the crowd instead of avoiding people. &quot;
The police also told reporters that suspects often have no purpose in waiting for the bus. They like to wander around the station and only follow the target of pickpocketing and get on the bus.
&quot;These are all words of experience. If you work in plain clothes for a long time, you will naturally know. &quot;
In addition, the police also reminded that &quot;the pockets of outerwear are the most convenient for storing things and are also the most likely to be stolen.&quot;
Please pay attention to your belongings while traveling and riding to prevent them from being stolen.

British Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday called on her party to unite behind her plans to leave the European Union, directly appealing to critics for their support, saying their desire for a free trade deal was at the heart of her plans to leave the European Union.
On September 30, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England.
At the start of the Conservative Party&#39;s passionate annual conference, Theresa May&#39;s plan was once again criticized by two former cabinet ministers, including former Foreign Secretary Johnson who called Theresa May&#39;s plan &quot;disordered&quot;.

Former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called Theresa May&#39;s plans &quot;disordered&quot; and blasted her for not having confidence in Brexit.
He and former Brexit Secretary Davis are pushing for a Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU.
Theresa May said that this proposal would allow Northern Ireland to implement different tariff regulations, which would be equivalent to Northern Ireland&#39;s separation from the United Kingdom.

According to our newspaper (intern reporter Li Qiyao), in recent years, incidents of substandard plastic runways on campuses have occurred in many places.
To this end, the Ministry of Education issued a notice requiring primary and secondary school synthetic surface sports venues delivered for use after November 1 this year to comply with the new national standards.
The mandatory national standard &quot;Synthetic Material Surface Sports Grounds for Primary and Secondary Schools&quot; was organized by the Ministry of Education, and 26 scientific research institutes and testing institutions participated in the drafting. It has been revised for more than two years, during which more than 100 expert meetings were organized for demonstration, and Nationwide on-site inspections and sampling inspections have collected countless verification experiments on the products of hundreds of companies on the market.
The reporter compared the old national standard in 2005 and found that the new national standard not only changed from &quot;national recommended standard&quot; to &quot;national mandatory standard&quot;, but also added many contents, including thickness requirements, physical properties, aging resistance, inorganic filler content requirements, anti-skid glue Requirements for polymer content in granules, limits of harmful substances in finished surface layers, limits of harmful substances in non-solid and solid raw materials, etc.
It is particularly worth mentioning that the new national standard limits the harmful substances that may be produced during the construction of campus plastic runways, increasing from the original 7 items to 18 items, and sets limits for volatile organic compounds on the completed runways in accordance with home decoration standards. stipulated.
For example, the &quot;Limits and Odor Requirements for Hazardous Substances in Cast-in-Situ and Prefabricated Surface Finished Products&quot; clearly stipulates the release amount of hazardous substances, requiring that total volatile organic compounds shall not be higher than 5 mg/cubic meter, and formaldehyde shall not be higher than 0.4 mg. / cubic meter, carbon disulfide shall not be higher than 7 mg/cubic meter, benzene shall not be higher than 0.1 mg/cubic meter, and the odor level shall not be higher than level 3.

To activate rural consumption, we must rely on normalized mechanisms to purify the market, guide healthy consumption needs, and enhance farmers&#39; sense of gain in consumption.
Data show that the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released. In the first half of this year, retail sales of consumer goods in rural areas increased by 10.5%, and the growth rate was 1.3 percentage points higher than that in urban areas.
I visited a poor village in a county in the west. There was only one convenience store in the whole village. When I walked into the store, some of the products seemed familiar. &quot;Golden Arowana&quot; was labeled as &quot;Golden Dragon Oil&quot;, &quot;Wangzi&quot; became &quot;Wangdai&quot;, and &quot;Shanzhai&quot; There are many products.
Over the years, similar phenomena have been exposed frequently. Some fake and shoddy goods in rural areas are similar to famous brands, with similar names and similar packaging. They are fake and real, making it difficult to guard against.
A consumer survey report released by a city in the west shows that the problem of counterfeit goods in rural supermarkets is serious. 66% of users have bought counterfeit goods in offline supermarkets in townships, of which more than half are food products.
Relevant departments are rectifying rural markets and calling for beatings every year. Why do &quot;Li Gui&quot; still keep beating them?
Unlike the urban market, farmers have relatively low awareness of rights protection. In addition, many rural areas are located in remote locations and are in blind spots beyond the reach of regulatory forces, which creates breeding ground for fake and inferior goods.
A commodity is managed by multiple departments. Some departments are in charge of price, some are in charge of production, and some are in charge of market. Their functions are overlapping. Counterfeiting is cracked down every year. There is a centralized management. Counterfeit goods escape the limelight and slowly reappear. Just after the crackdown on old fakes , new fakes pop up again.
The lack of a long-term supervision mechanism makes it difficult to purify the rural market, and the cost of breaking the law is low and the profits are huge. This has led some unscrupulous traders to have the crooked idea of &quot;going to the mountains and rural areas&quot;, and some rural areas have become &quot;waste markets.&quot;
From having enough food and clothing to becoming well-off, the majority of farmers are moving towards development-oriented consumption.
Recently, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the &quot;Several Opinions on Improving Consumption Promotion Systems and Mechanisms to Further Stimulate Residents&#39; Consumption Potential&quot;, which proposed to promote the upgrading of rural residents&#39; consumption, with the purpose of making the majority of farmers &quot;able to consume&quot;, &quot;willing to consume&quot; and &quot;dare to consume&quot; , Let rural consumption really flourish.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen reforms, eliminate the shortcomings of multiple departments and multi-headed management of market supervision, adapt measures to local conditions, improve food safety and product quality supervision networks, and continuously reduce the space for counterfeiting and selling in rural areas.
On the other hand, we must intensify law enforcement efforts, open up regulatory &quot;capillaries&quot;, and never allow counterfeit goods to breed and spread in rural areas.
Strict punishment for cheating farmers is the only way to protect farmers. No matter how concealed the counterfeiters are, it should not be a reason for the proliferation of fake and shoddy goods. Relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, lower the level of supervision at the grassroots level, and hold accountable any link that goes wrong. Give counterfeiters and sellers nowhere to hide.
Strictly control market access, implement strict qualification examinations for producers and operators, control market circulation, ensure that products come in the right way and go out clearly, and find ways from the source and root to allow legal dealers to operate with peace of mind and farmers to buy affordable products rest assured.
To activate rural consumption, we must guide healthy consumption demand.
With the upgrading of consumption, many farmers not only pursue full and good food, but also pursue high-quality life such as culture and health. The rural market cannot be equated with &quot;low quality&quot; and &quot;cheap&quot;.
This requires promoting the extension of e-commerce coverage to rural areas, unblocking two-way linked sales channels between urban and rural areas, promoting the integration of offline industry development platforms and online e-commerce trading platforms, supporting the expansion of new consumption formats and models into rural markets; promoting qualified towns and villages to Organically combine commercial logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc.; improve the modern rural circulation network system, optimize and integrate existing facility resources, and effectively reduce rural circulation costs.
Only by creating a clear and reassuring market environment for rural areas, so that farmers do not worry about consumption, can rural consumption become more and more prosperous, and only then can farmers&#39; sense of gain and happiness in consumption be enhanced.
Starting from November 1, my country will reduce the most-favored-nation tax rate for some commodities, and the overall tariff level will be reduced to 7.5%.
According to the decision of the 26th Executive Meeting of the State Council, the Tariff Commission of the State Council issued an announcement on the 30th to reduce the most-favored-nation tax rate for some commodities starting from November 1, 2018.
According to the &quot;Announcement of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council on Reducing Import Tariffs on Certain Commodities&quot;, in order to adapt to industrial upgrading, reduce corporate costs and meet the needs of the public for multi-level consumption, the most-favored-nation tax rate for some industrial products and other commodities will be reduced starting from November 1 this year. .
There are a total of 1,585 tax items on tax-reduced goods, accounting for about 19% of the total tax items in my country. The average tax rate has dropped from 10.5% to 7.8%, with an average decrease of 26%.
This tax reduction mainly involves textiles; stone, ceramics, glass products; some steel and base metal products; mechanical and electrical equipment and parts, such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, power transmission and transformation equipment, electrical equipment, instrumentation, etc. ; Resource commodities and primary processed products, such as non-metallic minerals, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, gems and jade, etc.
At the same time, with the reduction of the overall tariff level, especially the reduction of import tariffs on medicines and daily consumer goods, the tax item rates of import taxes on imported items will be reduced accordingly.
In order to implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, my country has implemented zero tariffs on most imported drugs from May 1 this year, and has reduced import tariffs on automobiles and parts, and some daily consumer goods since July 1. , implemented the third step of tax reduction for products expanded under the information technology agreement.
The reporter learned from the Tariff Commission of the State Council that since the beginning of this year, after several consecutive independent adjustments, my country&#39;s overall tariff level will be reduced from 9.8% last year to 7.5%, with an average decrease of 23%.
Appropriately reducing tariffs will help promote the balanced development of foreign trade and promote a higher level of opening up to the outside world. It will also help to coordinate the utilization of both international and domestic resources and promote domestic supply-side structural reform.
The relevant person in charge of the committee said that this year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. Taking the initiative to reduce the overall level of tariffs is a practical action to implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech at the Boao Forum for Asia. It is also a step for my country to further expand opening up and actively expand imports in accordance with its own high-quality development needs. This important measure shows that China will unswervingly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win opening strategy. While enhancing its own development momentum, it will also allow China&#39;s development to better benefit the world.
On September 29, the regional public brand launch conference of &quot;Huanxiangren&quot; agricultural products in Huan County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District, Tianjin.
Red Army millet, black adzuki beans, mountain boy pastoral black goat, hardcover tartary buckwheat tea, paper-cut shadow puppet album, handmade slippers... Pieces of beautifully packaged agricultural products were neatly placed on the stand. They all have a common brand name called &quot; Huanxiangren&quot;.

Huan County is located at the junction of the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia. As an &quot;advanced county in grain production in the country&quot;, &quot;the hometown of small cereals in China&quot; and &quot;the hometown of shadow puppets in China&quot;, it has a long history and rich resources.
Local snacks such as lamb meat, yellow rice wine, buckwheat noodles, and soft swallow noodles are the flavors that travelers in foreign lands often think of.
As China&#39;s urbanization level continues to improve and the urban population increases rapidly, a large number of rural young people leave their hometowns and start living in cities.
Yang Qiaojia, a research expert on Chinese agricultural brands, said: &quot;Nowadays, urban life is fast-paced and stressful. More and more people are beginning to miss the rural life of their childhood. However, &#39;what you can&#39;t go back to is called hometown, and the most beautiful memory is the countryside.&#39; Xiangren&#39;s brand design is named after the nostalgia and nostalgia of people wandering around the county. &quot;
Huanxian County has special climatic conditions, long sunshine hours, and large temperature differences between day and night, which provide unique conditions for growing characteristic small grains.
The territory is rich in more than 20 kinds of small grains. It is the hometown of small grains in China. Its output ranks first in Gansu and its quality is among the best in the country.
Wang Xiaoli is a girl from Huanxian County who goes to school in Tianjin. She participated in the promotion meeting as a volunteer. She said: &quot;The people in my hometown are the closest and the taste of my hometown is the most beautiful. The &#39;Huanxiangren&#39; brand evokes so much nostalgia and memories for us.&quot; , what I will never forget is the delicious food there. I hope that the &#39;Huanxiangren&#39; brand will go further and become bigger and bigger. &quot;
Dr. Tan Bin, a researcher at the Academy of Sciences of the State Administration of Grain and Material Reserves, said that through testing more than 900 sets of indicator data, the testing data of agricultural products such as buckwheat, tartary buckwheat, and black beans in Huan County have outstanding advantages. Many cereals contain high levels of physiologically active substances. Based on standard data, &quot;Huanxiangren&quot; has the inherent advantage to seize the domestic high-end grains market.
Chai Chun, Secretary of the Huanxian County Party Committee, said that through the launch of the &quot;Huanxiangren&quot; brand, it can further enhance the quality, standardization, and large-scale innovative development of Huanxian&#39;s high-quality agricultural products, which is conducive to shaping a good overall image of Huanxian&#39;s agricultural products and quickly increasing its popularity and popularity. competitiveness and added value.
Canada&#39;s gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 0.2% in July from the previous month, a higher-than-expected increase, raising market expectations that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If it does raise interest rates, it would be the fifth time the central bank has raised interest rates in a little more than a year.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast growth of 0.1%.
Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 out of 20 industries experienced growth.
The data is noteworthy because the central bank earlier this month predicted temporary factors could weigh on third-quarter GDP data.
Bank of Canada President Poloz promised on Thursday that the central bank will continue to gradually raise interest rates and will pay close attention to economic data.
The Bank of Canada&#39;s next interest rate decision will be on October 24.
With Canada&#39;s economy strengthening and unemployment near record lows, the Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017.
Stephen Brown, senior Canadian economist at Capital Economics, said the country&#39;s economy is expected to grow at an annualized rate of about 2% in the third quarter.
&quot;This would be higher than the Bank of Canada&#39;s forecast of 1.5% and would be another reason to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month,&quot; he said in a note.
Overnight index swaps showed that the market&#39;s estimate of the Bank of Canada&#39;s probability of raising interest rates in October rose from 76.46% to 78.27%.
