Where to find people?
The excellent returning migrant workers are an indispensable force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26th: The excellent returning migrant workers into a rural revitalization force
Zhang Xiongjia, 34, is in the orchard village of Meishan City, Sichuan Province, and in 2010 he quit his job with a monthly salary of tens of thousands of yuan in Beijing to start a business.
After several years of hard work, he now runs a grape growing family farm with an annual income of more than one million yuan, becoming a well-known leader of wealth, and has also been selected to enter the village "two committees" team.
In recent years, under the inspiration of a series of national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization policies, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home and start a business, which has activated a spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a large population province in western China and a large labor export province, has implemented the "Excellent Migrant Workers Revitalization Training Project" due to snobbish guidance, and in 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were generated from the outstanding migrant workers, cultivated 61,000 village reserve forces, and developed more than 20,000 party members, providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
The key is not well-off, the key is to look at the fellow countrymen.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged workers in China's rural areas have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively, it has also led to the emergence of "hollowing out" in rural areas to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations, and the village party branch secretaries and party members have shown the characteristics of "one old and one low", that is, aging age, low education, and the village party organization leaders are not strong, and the problem of not connecting.
If elements such as rural talents have been flowing to the city in one direction, the countryside has long been in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia", and revitalization is an empty phrase.
Attracting those migrant workers who have the ability, awareness and ambition to serve their hometowns, and guide them to return home to become rich leaders, train them into party members and rural cadres, and enrich the grassroots cadres from them, which is the solution to the fundamentals of rural party members and grass-roots party organizations.
Good migrant workers can be brought back, but also let them stay and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan has begun to pay close attention to the construction of the peasant labor force, and on the basis of strict selection criteria, it has established institutional mechanisms such as targeted return, service guarantee, training, and selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their ability, work, and have hope in life.
This year is the end of the decisive battle against poverty, and talents are the key factor in connecting poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, they should be built into a task force and a living force that can stay, fight and take away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are a very special session, on the evening of July 11, bilibili summer graduation song will bring a special online live performance for graduates, old wolf, Park Shu, Li Yuchun, Mao Wu and other musicians for the new graduates to send songs and blessings.
The well-known up master Seal Wu Wu also brought a song "Weeds", which is a rap song based on Lu Xun's collection of prose poems of the same name, which is extremely popular among young people.
Due to the relationship between the epidemic, many graduates have not been able to experience the ceremonial sense of on-site dialing and degree certificates, and they have transferred the sense of ceremony to the online.
According to the data, the 2.5-hour concert, the peak of live popularity exceeded 35 million.
“Follow your heart, seize the opportunity, regardless of the consequences, sometimes there will be unexpected gains.”
Although it is a graduation song club, many songs also make non-graduates moved.
"The whole scene really want to cry, who's youth are full of beauty and regret, but they are worth remembering, we must bravely go on."
Beijing's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting more than 500 kinds of wildlife cities "settled"

The natural ecology of the capital continues to improve, attracting the "settlement" of wildlife cities
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing.
Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned from the Municipal Landscaping Bureau that in recent years, with the continuous improvement of the natural ecological environment of the capital, the types and number of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife living in Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including national-level protected animals such as brown horse chicken and black stork, as well as secondary protected animals such as wildebeest, large swans, gray cranes and emu.
Whether it is planting a city forest in the second ring, or embedded in the small micro-wetland between the buildings, it not only brings the wild fun of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settlement" in the city.
In the mid-summer season, it is located in Songshan National Nature Reserve in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District.
One of them played quietly by the side of the mountain, and the two dogs fought each other.
In the back, a wild boar can't help but "stitch" on his body and is tucking on the bark. Hu Qiaoli, director of Songshan National Nature Reserve Management Department, said that as of the end of 2019, in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, there are 178 kinds of wild animals, including national-level protection animal spoon chickens and wildebeest, and nearly one-third of the city's wildlife species can be seen here.
"In Songshan, wild animals are the real 'owners', and our staff can only be regarded as the 'guards' of the family."
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the situation of wild animals and plants in the protected area on the ground, more than 30 professional patrolmen every day, along 16 carefully formulated protection routes, and there will be a "turning circle" every month, and almost all the entire protected area is used for a whole day.
“In the inspection, not only to check and record biodiversity, but also to inspect the installation of artificial nests, to rescue injured wild animals, to install infrared cameras in the field, etc.”
Songshan National Nature Reserve has now installed more than 200 infrared cameras to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that with the continuous enrichment of the biodiversity of the protected area in recent years, more and more wild animals appear in the camera, and the leopard cats, sturgeons and pig badxes have become "resident guests", and the "appearance rate" of the national second-class protected animal antelope is also getting higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, director of the wildlife and wetland protection department of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscaping, said that Beijing's terrestrial vertebrate wildlife has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 now, and the variety and number of wild animals in Beijing has continued to increase in recent years.
The presence of wild animals in cities is becoming more and more common, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of urban greening in the capital in recent years
In particular, a new round of afforestation and greening construction of millions of acres began in 2018, proposing to reshape the urban ecological environment, improve the ecological function of forest green land, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
The plan strives to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green space, so that wild animals can "go to relatives and friends", and the trees planted are also honey sources and food-based plants that animals love.
Black land "plants" agricultural modernization - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26th: Black land "plants" agricultural modernization
In the summer, two spraying pharmaceutical aircraft passed from the 10,000 mu high-yield demonstration field of the second working station of the fifth management area of the Friendship Farm, forming two white lines, and the "first in the world" in the green field with black rice seedlings was particularly eye-catching.
Kong Lingqiang, the station manager of this operation station, said that this aircraft can spray more than 6,000 acres of arable land a day, which is about eight times more efficient than drones and hundreds of times that of artificial labor.
This farm is located in the territory of Heilongjiang Province, China's first grain-producing province, from the past "snap" rice cutting sound through to today's "rumbling" motor sound, Chinese traditional farming and farms in this black soil belt to achieve metabolism.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farms.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve accurate fertilization, reduce agricultural input, and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the level of standardized operation of agricultural machinery in the field.
In this year's rice production process, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation unmanned cutting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology makes the planting of seedlings more uniform, which can maximize the use of sunlight and cultivated land resources, and save 16 yuan per acre in labor costs.
The farm tries new technologies such as informationization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of farm machinery is 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate of the field is 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations achieve 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision seeding in dry fields, and 100% of dryfield high-power locomotives.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture, and digital agriculture are the path of agricultural modernization."
Liu Hualian, director of Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization is scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, Heilongjiang agricultural reclamation, represented by farms, has played a leading role in modern large-scale agricultural "carrier" demonstration and leading, and has initially established a modern agricultural industry system led by large-scale planting, standardized production and industrialization.
On the outskirts of Friendship County, there is an agricultural machinery Expo Park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
Here, more than 140 agricultural tools (pieces) have been introduced and used by Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation for many years.
These agricultural tools and farms have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.

Church fire in Nantes, France: Parish volunteers admit to arson
According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the religious historical building treasures of Nantes, France, and the famous St. Peter and St. Paul's Cathedral were severely damaged in a fire, and the big organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, Nantes prosecutors announced that a parish volunteer in charge of defending the cathedral had been charged with "arsoning and destruction".
He admitted that he was igniting in the church.
Senas, the local prosecutor, said the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted to setting fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
The man’s lawyer said the arsonists now regretted doing it.
This man entered France a few years ago by taking refuge, was sheltered in the parish where the fire broke out and was taken in the church.
The prosecution pointed out that he had recently tried to renew his visa and was in dialogue with the police department.
But the church still can't believe that this usually very kind, smiling believer, who does not talk much, will destroy the church he loves so much.
On the day of the July 18 fire, the volunteer was questioned by the police for the logical problems in the narrative, but he was later released.
Firefighters are on the scene to rescue.
On the evening of the 25th, because the professional engineers of the laboratory of the Central Police Department in Paris obtained new evidence, this person was once again communicated.
This time, the man confessed to his act of arson.
According to reports, if convicted of intentional arson and destruction, the suspect could face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
Reported that the fire caused serious damage to St. Pierre and St. Paul's Cathedral, the church's organ was completely burned, the stained glass window behind the organ was also seriously damaged.
Brune, chief architect of the French historic preservation building, believes that it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: US unilateralism undermines bilateral relations International public opinion supports China's counter-measure against the United States
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the permission to establish and operate the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious problems in bilateral relations between China and the United States, and it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to unreasonable provocations by the United States and take countermeasures.
Andrés Bolkes, director of the China Studies Center at the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures of the United States have undermined the bridge of understanding between the two peoples and put the relationship between the two countries in crisis.
China's notification of the U.S. closure of its consulate in Chengdu is a counter to U.S. unilateral measures and in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Justo, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Center for Arab-Chinese Studies, believes that China's decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure against the United States' previous provocations, and is not aimed at ordinary Americans.
The United States is trying to divert the attention of the American people by pressuring China to cover up its weak response to the new crown epidemic.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Indonesian think tank Asian Innovation Research Center, said that the provocative diplomatic posture of the United States has caused serious problems for the relations between China and the United States, and the relations between the two countries are facing serious challenges.
China's notification of the closure of the US Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal counter-measure, which is in line with diplomatic practice, which reflects China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests and reflects the rational and favorable nature of China's diplomacy.
Tanzanian current affairs commentator Francis Semwinza said that China's decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the US provocation.
If China-US relations should return to normal, the US should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve economic and political win-win results with China, and how to benefit the two peoples and the entire international community.
Ali Yusuf, executive director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab-China Friendship Associations, said that the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the United States, in line with international law and basic norms of international relations, and in line with diplomatic practice.
Earlier, the US request to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston seriously violated international law and basic norms governing international relations.
It is hoped that the US side will rescind the relevant previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the return of bilateral relations to normal.
Singapore's "Lianhe Zaobao" published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of the United States' efforts, although China is very reluctant to see the deterioration of China-US relations, it has to take countermeasures.

Poland withdraws from European treaty to prevent violence against women
Poland's justice ministry said Saturday it will take steps next week to withdraw from the European treaty to prevent violence against women.
Poland’s right-wing government cabinet says the treaty requires schools to teach students about gender issues and trample on the rights of their parents.
Polish Justice Minister Joobl said his Justice Ministry on Monday would ask the Ministry of Labor and Family to begin withdrawing from the treaty.
The treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
According to Joblow, “the treaty contains elements that we consider to be harmful morphological properties”.
Poland’s ruling Law and Justice Party and its governing coalition partners have close alliances with the Roman Catholic Church and promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda has made hostility to gay rights one of the main topics during this month's successful re-election campaign.
On Friday, tens of thousands of Poles, most of them women, protested against the withdrawal from the convention in Warsaw and other cities.
Lempat, one of the organizers of the protest, said at a protest march in Warsaw that "the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence".
Some protesters held banners that read “The Law and Justice Party is a hell for women.”
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland’s previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice government says the treaty does not respect religion and requires liberal social policy to be taught in schools.
So far, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

The engine may be turned off, the FAA has ordered the inspection of 2000 Boeing passenger aircraft.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring emergency inspections of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737 Classic aircraft registered in the United States, due to the corrosion of the air check valve of the aircraft, which may cause the engine to stop in the air after the corrosion.
The FAA said it has received four reports of air parking of 737NG and 737 Classic aircraft engines so far, resulting in emergency inspections of passenger aircraft that have been parked for seven days or more and aircraft that have flown less than 11 times so far after re-opening flights.
The Federal Aviation Administration warned that if the fifth-stage check valve for all two engines of the passenger aircraft was corroded, it may die in the open position, causing the passenger plane to lose power completely and unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that once the check valve is found to be corroded, the airline must replace the key component before the passenger plane is put into service again.
Boeing responded later in the day, the outbreak of the new crown epidemic led to lower travel demand, many passenger aircraft were sealed or less used, "return valve is more likely to be corroded."
Boeing also said that it has advised air operators to inspect the passenger aircraft involved in the instructions, and if problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in overhauling and replacing check valves.
The Associated Press reported that passenger aircraft of major U.S. airlines usually fly multiple times in a day, but after the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, a large number of passenger aircraft were grounded; with the recent slow growth in passenger travel demand, some passenger aircraft have been put back into operation.
The FAA did not release details of the four aerial parking reports.
Alaska Airlines later disclosed one of the incidents.
The airline said in a statement that a passenger plane was flying from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, on July 15, when an engine suddenly turned off, and the passenger plane finally made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the engine and had inspected the engines of six aircraft in accordance with FAA directives.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th that their passenger aircraft did not have the engine shutdown associated with the air check valve.
Four American Airlines planes will be inspected, and 28 United Airlines planes will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect its 20 aircraft, but did not say whether there had been an engine shutdown.
According to multiple media reports, the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive is another shock to Boeing.
A Boeing 737 MAX passenger aircraft from Lion Air Indonesia and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing 346 people.
The series of passenger aircraft was subsequently grounded worldwide, discontinued in January this year, and resumed production in May.
FAA Administrator Steve Dixon acknowledged in June that the FAA had “made a mistake” in its oversight of Boeing over the 737 MAX.

"Shangjiang South" in pursuit of poetic "Yellow River Dream"-Zhongxin.com
(China's poverty reduction story) "Shangjiang South" pursues the poetic "Yellow River Dream"
Xinhua News Agency Yinchuan July 26 (Yang Di) "Nine songs of the Yellow River, the waves of the wind from the end of the world."
The Yellow River, which aroused countless venerations and sons, gave birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain, now known as "Shangjiang South", Ningxia is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority and green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River Dream".
The “Dream of the River Clear Water Show”
"The world's Yellow River Funingxia", the Yellow River through Ningxia 397 km, is the "mother river" of the parenting side.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development and utilization of rivers and lakes and the protection of management are unbalanced, and the chaos of excessive sewage discharge, the construction of fields in the lake, and the encroachment of the waters have emerged, resulting in black and odorous water, excessive water quality, dirty environment and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of water ecological diversity and striving to return the Yellow River to clear the water show.
Water should be treated from the source.
In Ningxia Yinchuan, the local government adopts the method of "standardizing + pollution control + strict control", the sewage in the industrial park is all centralized treatment, the urban sewage treatment plant has all achieved the first level A standard discharge, and the black and odorous water body in the urban built-up area has been basically eliminated, and the third batch of China's black and odorous water demonstration cities has been successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake long system in 2017, and now it has achieved full coverage of the five-level river and lake long system of district, city and county, and the long river patrol has become the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, who lives in a village on the Yellow River, witnessed the change of the Yellow River: “The water smelled like before, and there was no smell after rectification.”
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is good, his life is more comfortable, and now he often goes to the Yellow River with his family for a walk and feels the blue sky.
The “Wetland Dream” of Sandgulls
Birds, green trees, stacks, turquoise water... Fan Zhongyan's beautiful scenery of "sand gulls" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River has formed a variety of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands and swamp wetlands along the way, which plays an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and the ecological balance of water resources, and has also become an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, the relevant departments of Ningxia have invested a total of about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects, at present, Yinchuan wetland area of 19,200 hectares, wetland protection rate of 78.5%, there are natural lakes, swamp wetlands nearly 200, with 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks, 8 municipal parks.
Lv Jinhu, deputy director of Yinchuan Wetland Conservation Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds, "the gull is an endangered bird, there are only more than 20,000 in the world, of which Yinchuan wetlands are inhabited by more than 2,000."
At the same time, Ningxia has delineated a red line of 500 meters for the wetland protection area on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, and stipulates that in addition to public welfare projects, no unit or individual may carry out development, construction and business activities within the scope of protection.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, introduced that through pollution source control, comprehensive remediation of river and lake ecology and end-to-end wetland construction, the water quality of Ningxia's 9 main into the yellow drain has reached 100% of the Class IV standard, "Now the water is also clear, the fish also swims, and the flowers are also opened."
The “drinking dream” of people’s livelihood
Ningxia Yinchuan City once had an "embarrassing" title: the only city in the yellow city that "guarded the Yellow River to water and drink".
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing the problem of water shortage at the peak of the summer, and the "pain of water shortage" in the past ten years has become the summer pain experience of many high-rise residents, but in the major water sources, the urban underground has formed a large area of groundwater over-harvesting funnel area, and the water shortage has become a problem that plagues Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, the water of the Yellow River after drinking purification has become a good way to solve the problem of drinking water for local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Municipal Water Bureau, introduced that in order to improve the domestic and rural production and water demand of Yinchuan urban and rural residents, Ningxia timely launched the Yinchuan metropolitan area urban and rural western water supply project, replacing the original groundwater source with high-quality Yellow River water.
"December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially to Yinchuan City, the three districts of water, in 2020, Minning Town, Helan County residents also drink the Yellow River water."
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan water conservancy department will consider the transformation of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply integration, "the next step, we will integrate the rural scattered water supply points into the western water supply project, is expected to basically achieve the integration of urban and rural water supply in Yinchuan by the end of this year."

For the first time, the United States launched a countervailing investigation on China with "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate"
In response to the recent announcement of the US Department of Commerce, it decided to launch an anti-dumping anti-subsidy investigation on belt (beam belt) products originating in China, and launched an investigation on the "RMB exchange rate undervaluation" project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has investigated the so-called "RMB exchange rate undervaluation" project in the countervailing case, and China firmly opposes it.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China implements a floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, with reference to a basket of currencies for adjustment, and the market plays a decisive role in the formation of exchange rates.
The press release stressed that in general, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable equilibrium level and is not undervalued.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to the data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the effective exchange rate of the RMB project appreciated by 38%, and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49%, which is the strongest currency in the G20 economy and one of the largest in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue exceeds the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization.
In February this year, the United States amended its regulations to conduct countervailing investigations on other countries' exchange rates, and has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
According to the press release, even in accordance with U.S. regulations, there are a large number of errors in the content of the applicant's complaint, and there are no necessary elements of countervailing subsidies such as financial support, benefit award and exportionism.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called “undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate”.
Affected by the further escalation of tensions between China and the United States, the exchange rate of the offshore and onshore RMB against the US dollar fell sharply on the 22nd, and both fell below the 7.0 yuan mark of 1 US dollar against the RMB.
Whether the US Department of Commerce is intended to force the rise of the yuan is worth paying attention to.
The RMB against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd and closed at 6.9961.
The middle price of the RMB against the US dollar, which is regulated by the official, was lowered by 17 basic points on the 24th, at 6.9938.

Lewis family: John Lewis is the fighter who 'fights the weakest'
U.S. Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights fighter, was remembered as a fighter for “fighting for the weakest” at a memorial service for him on Saturday.
Lewis' public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorials on the first day.
At a public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, five of Lewis’ siblings and a nephew spoke of him as a loving, timid, family-heavy man.
Lewis' youngest brother, Henry "Grant" Lewis, said at the meeting: "He has dedicated his life to helping others."
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John "not to get into trouble, not to get into trouble."
He added that John did not heed his mother’s warning, saying, “We all know that John always gets into trouble and always gets in trouble, but that’s because he sticks to the right thing, and that’s a good trouble.”
Lewis’s siblings reminded the people at the memorial service that John’s most famous argument was to create “good trouble,” that is, to avoid stirring up trouble for the sake of justice.
John applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but the all-white school at Troy University rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones, from Alabama, said the current protesters were “provocating peacefully, non-violently,” as Lewis did during the civil rights movement.
Jones said: “Even if President Trump overturned a boat man with a pole and told all the protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more equal country.”
A six-day series of events in honor of Lewis will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis' coffin was parked in public memorials at the University of Troy on Saturday, and people came to pay tribute to the civil rights movement pioneer.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony was held in a chapel in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators who demanded black voting rights were beaten by the Alabama police in front of the bridge, who also threw tear gas at demonstrators.
Lewis was nearly killed.
It was called Bloody Sunday.
Lewis' body will be transported to Montgomery, Alabama's capital.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk and finish the final journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials require the public to wear masks and maintain social distance when participating in the event.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey ordered the flag to be flown at half-time on Saturday and Sunday in honor of Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemoration, Lewis' body will be divided into the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., for public mourning.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could go to the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
Due to the coronavirus epidemic, public events to mourn Lewis will be held outdoors.

Adhering to the leadership of party building and implementing the party's leadership into all aspects of grass-roots governance is a fundamental requirement for the direction of grass-roots governance.
To improve the level of grass-roots governance, we must adhere to the leadership of party building, strengthen political leadership, build a fighting fortress, and unite red forces, promote the party's political advantages, organizational advantages and mass work advantages into governance advantages, and transmit the party's strength and proposition to the "nerve ending" and "last mile".
Focus on calcium casting soul, strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political guidance of grass-roots governance, we must implement the "calcium-filling soul" project.
It is necessary to learn to deeply understand Xi Jinping's socialist thought with Chinese characteristics in the new era as the primary task, take "do not forget the original intention and keep in mind the mission" as the eternal topic of party building and the lifelong topic of party members and cadres, strengthen the principle of reading the original text of the original book, and continue to promote the party's innovative theory and mind through special training, batch training, discussion and exchange, and hold a large lecture hall, and promote party members and cadres to further enhance the "four consciousness", "four self-confidence", and "two maintenance".
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, we will broaden the learning and education channels, and guide grass-roots party organizations and party members and cadres to truly integrate learning and education into daily life and grasp it regularly.
Focus on practical exercise, in the process of resolving the key and difficult problems in the field of grass-roots governance, solve the troubles and troubles that the masses pay attention to, and temper the party's nature and ability.
Strengthen the standard and build a battle fortress.
Grass-roots party organizations are both an important part of the grass-roots governance system and an important carrier for the demonstration of governance capabilities.
To promote the standardized construction of grass-roots party organizations, we must start from the work regulations of the party branch, focus on the problems of weakening and blurring the leadership of the party organization, and solidify the foundation, make up the shortcomings and promote development by establishing the upper and lower linkage mechanism, the innovative branch setting form, normalizing the weak and scattered, establishing a sound decision-making deliberative mechanism, and serving the masses.
In rural areas, strengthen the standardization and construction of party organizations at the village level, standardize the organizational form, learning activities, and management mechanisms against the standardized construction standards of party branches, and effectively promote the implementation of the "three sessions and one lesson" and the theme party day activities.
In the city, pay attention to street communities, explore the form of innovation branch settings, focus on weak areas, "blocking points" and "pain points", and actively build urban party building alliances, so that the party's work can be effectively covered.
At the same time, we will establish and improve the mechanism of grass-roots governance and governance, improve the decision-making and deliberation mechanism led by major events, practical work, important decisions, urgent consultation, difficult solutions, and grass-roots party organizations, improve the mechanism for party members and cadres to contact and serve the masses, gather people's hearts in service for the people, enhance the sense of gain, happiness, honor, and pride of party members, and make grass-roots governance more temperature.
Play a pioneering role and gather red power.
Grass-roots party members and cadres are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
Improve the governance ability at the grass-roots level, focus on improving the governance ability of grass-roots party members and cadres, pay attention to the demonstration and leading role of "red cells" in grass-roots governance, and unite the red forces at the forefront of contact and service to the masses.
It is necessary to make improving governance capabilities a compulsory course for grass-roots party members and cadres, continuously strengthen ideological hardening, professional training, and practical training, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in the current post and in the urgent and dangerous tasks, and lay a solid foundation for promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity.
It is necessary to carry out a wide range of "community whistle-blowing and party members report" activities, and participate in community construction, management and service by participating in the theme party day activities, contacting difficult people, determining service items, claiming micro-wishes, and making reasonable suggestions, so that party members can play a role in community governance.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of rural unemployed party members, and guide the majority of grass-roots party members to actively participate in poverty alleviation, ecological construction, letter and visit maintenance, straw and other tasks, better integrate red forces and serve the people by setting up vanguard posts and forming teams of unemployed party members.
The base solid building is strong.
The grassroots party organization is the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by insisting on close party-to-group relations and increasing people's well-being as the focus, and taking party building guidance as the fundamental way to promote the innovation and development of grass-roots governance can we build a solid foundation, so that grass-roots party organizations can pull out and stand up, and grassroots party members and cadres can catch up and rush up, and promote grass-roots governance to have a "soul", orderly, powerful and effective.

Cocosiri Tibetan antelope enters the return season - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the five beam protection stations of the Cocosiri Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration that the monitoring shows that the Tibetan antelopes that had migrated to the lake area in the hinterland of Cocosiri were ending the birth of the litter and began to return to their original habitat with the cubs.
Surveillance footage near the protection station of Wudao Liang shows that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led three Tibetan antelope cubs to pass the 3002 km of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the five-way girder North Bridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, and the Tibetan antelopes have begun to move back.
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the returning flock has accounted for one-fourth to one-fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope sheep.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Biology Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "In the early stage of the migration, the Tibetan antelope faces a higher risk of being eaten, so the number of cubs in the flock will be relatively small, and there may even be no cubs."
According to the statistics of the Cocosiri Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the overall number of Tibetan antelopes has been increasing year by year, and the number of Tibetan antelopes in 2019 was 4,860, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Lian Xinming said: "It is expected that the return of Tibetan antelopes will end in early September this year, and the number of returning Tibetan antelopes is still expected to continue to increase."
Tibetan antelopes are protected animals at the national level.
Every year at the end of May, Tibetan antelopes from the Sanjiangyuan of Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet, and Aljinshan in Xinjiang go to the Antelope Lake in the hinterland of Cocosiri.
Wu Xiaomin, a Tibetan antelope conservation expert in China and a researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Zoology (Northwest Endangered Animal Research Institute), said: "The return of the Tibetan antelope is the process of returning to the habitat with the cub after the end of the litter. At first, the return group that left the littering area is relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelope will return to their respective habitats according to different geographical populations and different paths."
In order to ensure the safe return of the Tibetan sheep, the reporter learned that the Cocosiri Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park has arranged for staff to continue to carry out video monitoring and district patrols in the main relocation area.
If it is found that the Tibetan Antelope sheep is trying to cross the road, the patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control in the first time, so that the sheep can pass through the wildlife passageway safely, so as to ensure that it is as little as possible disturbed by humans on the way back.

According to the temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day, and high-temperature workers drink 3 to 5 liters of water per day.
When sweating more, some salt water can be added appropriately to make up for the salt lost by the human body due to sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to lack of potassium in summer, making people feel tired and tired, and potassium tea is an excellent summer drink.
In the summer, eat fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, etc.; fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, etc., have a moisture content of 80% to 90%, which can be used to replenish water; dairy products can not only hydrate, but also meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high temperature environments should appropriately supplement drinks containing elements such as potassium and magnesium.
Summer day and night is short, the temperature is high, the human body metabolism is strong, the consumption is also large, and it is easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and body systems, which is conducive to work and study, and is also a measure to prevent heat stroke.

University of Australia to develop new drug is expected to be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by new crown
SYDNEY, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that could help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hopes that the drug could be used to treat blood vessel blockages caused by the new coronavirus.
The researchers found that before a heart attack or stroke, an enzyme in the platelets accelerated platelet clotting.
Therefore, they developed a drug that can temporarily suppress platelet clotting, thereby avoiding blood vessel blockage and preventing heart disease and stroke.
The researchers said the drug would only inhibit the clotting effect of platelets when signs of heart disease or stroke appeared.
Since studies have shown that similar vascular blockage is one of the leading causes of death in patients with new coronary diseases, the researchers hope that the drug can be used for the treatment of such severe patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing to conduct human clinical trials in the next stage.
The results of the study have been published in the American journal Science Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter after the CBA League rematch allowed the audience to watch the game live.
On the same day, in the second phase of the 2019-2020 Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) rematch (Laishan Division) held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers and public security front people entered the game after completing the relevant processes including nucleic acid testing through the official ticketing platform to watch the Shanghai Jiujie Team's match against the East and West Kings of the Mountain.
During the viewing, the spectator must wear a mask throughout the whole time, take a seat on the number, and strictly keep the seat at a distance of one meter.

China News Agency, Xinjiang Hami, July 26th: Xinjiang Deeply cultivates "Sunflower Fields" with clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal heliostats, each 48 square meters, arranged neatly in a circle, such as a silver "sunflower field", rotating with the sun, reflecting the sunlight to the center more than 200 meters high heat-absorbing tower to achieve power generation.
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the China Electric Power Project Hami Melting Salt Tower-type solar thermal power plant in Yiwu County, Hami County, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower solar-thermal power generation is to reflect sunlight through the mirror surface to the heat-absorbing tower to form thermal energy, and then through the traditional power generation technology to convert heat energy into electricity."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CZ Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd., said that its design principle is similar to the solar stove used in rural areas of northwest China, and the sun shines together.
The power plant started construction in October 2017, and was connected to the grid at the end of last year, covering an area of 660 acres, with a total plan to install 14,500 sets of sunrims.
“Compared to traditional solar power generation technology, the biggest advantage is that it can store aggregated heat energy and generate electricity at night.”
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured by the project can keep the generator set running continuously and steadily, not affected by changes in light; it can also quickly participate in grid peaking according to the peak and valley needs of the grid load.
After the project is fully completed, it can achieve an annual power generation of 198 million degrees, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce sulfur dioxide by more than 60 tons, nitrogen oxides by more than 60 tons, soot about 20 tons, carbon dioxide more than 150,000 tons, and provide a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "Sunflower field" in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
Hamifu solar photovoltaic power plant covers an area of more than 2,300 acres, and 714 power generation equipment that has been built also follow the rotation of the sun, always maintaining the sun's light and the concentrator surface at a 90-degree right angle.
“We use biaxial tracking concentrator power generation technology, and through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain the power generation efficiency.”
The station manager section Mengqi said that in the light of the weather conditions, the power generation technology can be more than the traditional photovoltaic power generation efficiency can be increased by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has achieved more than 7 million degrees of electricity generation, supplementing the local demand for electricity.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest single unit in Xinjiang, the most complete photovoltaic module type of a photovoltaic industry demonstration park, a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects, with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, the power generation capacity exceeded 110 million degrees, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted a good "sunflower field".
The scale of solar power generation with installed capacity of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been built, and the city's photovoltaic power generation in the first half of this year has exceeded 1.4 billion degrees, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power plants in Xinjiang, with an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
It is expected that the annual photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion degrees this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.

U.S. media uncover the truth about the U.S. unprovoked demand that China close the consulate in Houston

U.S. media uncover the truth about the U.S. unprovoked demand that China close its consulate in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the U.S. Embassy in China that China decided to revoke the permission to establish and operate the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all operations and activities, as a countermeasure for the US suddenly asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston on the 21st.
The US government's behavior has attracted many attention, and its political motivation has been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why did you ask the Chinese to close the Consulate General?
Several foreign media said that it is not clear why the United States will choose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, foreign media bluntly said: for the election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the US request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston has raised questions about its political motivation.
The article said that the US government's disastrous response to the new crown epidemic has caused President Trump's poll support to be relatively low before the election.
White House officials privately said that the tough strategy against China is to save Trump's approval rating, but also to shift the White House's responsibility for the failure of the epidemic.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a politically driven, very cautious target chosen by the United States, and the U.S. government has chosen it “to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of significant conflict.”
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that at a time when the US election season is approaching and the US economy has been severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that "playing the 'China card' has political advantages."
The current situation is “a spiraling, tit-for-tat struggle,” driven in part by the U.S. government from a domestic perspective, and will only worsen tensions between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump's re-election prospects are under pressure due to the outbreak, and he has repeatedly blamed China for the outbreak.
Almost every day, the United States has taken new actions against Trump’s absurd argument that China exploits the United States.
“The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries.”
The U.S. demand that China close its consulate in Houston has heightened tensions between the world’s two largest economies.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in the southern United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, and U.S. citizens seeking visas and other services also face difficulties.
A Houston business group expressed regret over the U.S. request that China close its consulate in Houston, saying it played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of the Chinese economy.
The U.S. Foreign Policy magazine website said the move was “part of a series of provocative moves that will only worsen U.S.-China relations.”
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, as saying that since the United States and China established full diplomatic relations in 1979, he could not think of any move that would be comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the US move is unprecedented in the more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe that this move may cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was built in 1979 and was the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
China currently has an embassy and five consulates-general in the United States.

Spokesperson of the Embassy in the UK: The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, on the 25th, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom answered reporters' questions on the wrong remarks about cyber attacks.
The spokesperson stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always firmly opposed and cracked down on any form of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
A reporter asked: According to the media, China-related hacking groups have interfered with the network system of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies with patent data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always firmly opposed and cracked down on any form of cyberattacks and cybercrime.
Cyberspace is highly virtual, difficult to trace, and diverse actors, and sufficient evidence should be provided when investigating and characterization of network events, and cannot be guessed for no reason.
The spokesman said that a series of events such as the "Prism Gate" in the past have proved that the United States has been carrying out the world's largest cyber-stealing operation.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace serves the common interests of all countries.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation are not stolen, not stolen, but through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China filed about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a major country in innovation and intellectual property rights.
According to the data of the central branch of the People's Bank of China in Urumqi, in the first half of the year, the new loans of agricultural and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the annual increase in 2019.

Most areas of free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi have basically completed secondary detection in high-risk areas
Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health and Health Commission, said on the 26th that most areas of free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi have been basically completed.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and the city of Urumqi are further evaluating the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The Information Office of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to inform Xinjiang about the epidemic and prevention and control situation.
According to him, from 0:00 to 24:00 on July 25, 22 new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Urumqi (of which 5 were reconfirmed cases of asymptomatic infection), and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infection were added.
As of 24:00 on July 25, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infected people in Urumqi.
The newly infected asymptomatic infected people on the 25th are basically free nucleic acid testing and active screening in the city.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health and Health Commission, said on the 26th that most of the free nucleic acid testing in the complete city of Urum has been basically completed.
He also said that from the experience of other parts of the country, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid detection, such as the sensitivity of the detection reagent, the infection time and detoxification time of the tested personnel, the cooperation of the tester when the specimen is taken (the degree of cooperation may not lead to the specimen is not in place), and the testing environment, the proficiency of the test personnel.
For various reasons, nucleic acid testing will also have false negative results.
The so-called false negative means that the person being tested is indeed an infected person, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, for people who have had close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to be ruled out.
For people who have been to the high-risk areas of the epidemic, if there are fever and respiratory symptoms, there is a possibility of false negative nucleic acid detection, so two nucleic acid tests are also required to be excluded.
He said that in view of the above situation, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, from today, Urumqi City will conduct secondary free nucleic acid testing in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shaybak District, and carry out "checking the gaps".
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shaybak District are high-risk areas of the epidemic.

White House outbreak expert Fauci: cautiously optimistic about the development of a vaccine in early 2021
Fauci made the remarks on an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He cautioned that it is not clear how the coronavirus outbreak will develop in the fall and winter, or how the ultimate impact of the outbreak will be, “and the only way to end this is that each of us choose to be part of the solution.”
According to the data of Johns Hopkins University in the United States, as of 21:00 on the 25th, the number of new crown confirmed cases in the United States has reached 4.176 million, and 146,000 people have died.
Fauci said some parts of the U.S. are struggling to combat the rebound.
Although the epidemic is different everywhere and needs to be adapted to local conditions, the diversified anti-epidemic strategy does not mean that there is no close connection between the regions.
Epidemic in one region will eventually affect other regions.
“This is not the time for complacency,” Fauci said, “our work is not done, we must step up our efforts, and we must be vigilant about the uncertainty of the future.”
He Dayi, a Chinese-American medical expert and founder of the "cocktail therapy" for the treatment of AIDS, pointed out at the meeting that the new crown epidemic in the United States has not yet reached its peak.
“Each of us must do our part to slow the spread of this virus.”
He called on the public to use their own practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up the development of new crown treatment drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting international exchange activities in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region, dedicated to enhancing the status of Asian-Pacific Americans and nurturing international young leaders.
On the same day, U.S. Transportation Secretary Zhao Xiaolan, U.S. Representative Meng Zhaowen and International Leadership Foundation Founding Association President Dong Jiling spoke at the meeting.
In particular, they paid tribute to the anti-epidemic medical workers and volunteers of Asian Pacific descent in the front line, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to epidemic prevention guidelines such as "social distance" to curb the spread of the epidemic.

U.S.-China trade talks delegates meet in August
Hong Kong's "South China Morning Post" quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter on the 25th, the head of the Chinese trade negotiation team, Vice Premier Liu He and the United States team co-leader, trade representative Lai Haizhe is expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the Sino-US trade agreement.
The report said that although China has significantly increased the amount of US agricultural products purchased in the past few months, due to factors such as the new coronavirus epidemic, China's purchases are still some way from the amount promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say the recent closure of each other's consulates, along with other disputes, could undermine any progress on trade.
The first phase of the U.S.-China trade deal, which comes into effect a month after it was signed on Jan. 15, stipulates that a high-level trade framework group should meet every six months.
The meeting will be “an important turning point” that will allow the two sides to assess progress on the agreement, the people said.
But the person also said that if the U.S.-China tensions lead to low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that Lai Haizhe and Liu He's conference call on May 8, that is, the terms of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement have been met.
Since the beginning of this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly, and disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of the new coronavirus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who boasted at the beginning of the year about his achievements in the first phase of the deal, has recently changed his attitude.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China recently purchased a record amount of U.S. corn in a single day, it also bought a lot of soybeans, "but this trade agreement now means less than when it was reached."
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that because of the poor U.S.-China relations, a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely, and "trade issues have lost weight in China-US relations."
But he revealed that China's economic and trade-related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "we have tried our best to buy, so any additional procurement will have difficulties."
Peng Jiening, vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said it was "more important than ever to maintain the momentum of the first phase of the agreement" and said China had made progress this year in further opening up its financial markets to U.S. companies.
Plenum, an independent research firm, said: “It’s better to talk than not to talk, although it may be just routine.”

Hao Yusheng, chief representative of Nasdaq China: Now is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States for IPO - Economic Watch - Professional financial news website
Economic Observer Network reporter Zhang Bin because of the Luckin coffee fraud incident, the U.S. market to implement more stringent supervision of the stock, coupled with the valuation of the long-term pressure, the United States listed in the stock market pressure, NetEase, Jingdong and other medium-sized stocks have recently opened the way back to Hong Kong listing.
Recently, Shell, Ideal Automobile and other companies have high enthusiasm for listing in the United States.
Under the epidemic and the crisis of medium-sized stocks, is now the best time for Chinese enterprises to go public in the United States?
"In terms of the recent IPO case and the next company to go public in the United States, the IPO to the United States has not been affected in nature, but now the market is very good, and even now this time is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States IPO in the past 10 years."
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange in China, said at the "2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit" hosted by Snowball.
In April, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for Public Company Accounting (PCAOB) released a Statement on the Important Role of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Auditing and Other International Information—Discussions on Current Information Acquisition Challenges for U.S. Public Companies with Large Business in China.
The statement said that although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, the US regulatory authorities still have problems with access to information, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; corresponding to the document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed companies that have encountered audit obstacles and their audit institutions, and a large number of companies are listed.
In addition, in May this year, the US Senate passed the Foreign Company Accountability Act, which put forward additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies to list in the United States.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the crisis has not affected the appetite of investors.
"When this news just came out, everyone panicked, everyone is asking whether we can go to the United States in the future, but then we found that these problems are not the same thing on the investor side, investors may ask these questions when they go to the IPO in the United States, and even become standardized problems, but this is not regarded by investors as an important factor in investing in and not investing in a Chinese company."
It is recommended that you take as much a sense of the peace of mind as possible about the current situation.
Of course, this may seem like the most serious situation in the past two years, but in terms of investors' appetite, it has not been affected.
So from now until the end of this year or before the U.S. election, the IPO boom in the U.S. will continue.”
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Cloud was officially listed on the NASDAQ in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to IPO in the United States after the epidemic.
"The listing of Jinshan Cloud gives great confidence to the Chinese companies that are preparing for the IPO."
Hao Yusheng said.
Snowball released the first half of 2020 stock data report shows that in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese companies went to the United States IPO, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year; from the total amount of initial fundraising, 20 companies raised a total of 2.725 billion yuan, compared with the same period last year, up more than 52.4%; in the industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health care industry in the first half of this year, an increase of 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the Chinese companies that went to the United States for IPO in the first half of this year have higher quality, and high-quality companies with strong fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng is optimistic that Ming Chinese companies will continue to be optimistic about the IPO of Ming Chinese companies in the United States.
"The short term is to go to the United States IPO boom is still continuing; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, U.S. stocks, we will be the U.S. election and Sino-US relations as a factor of market choice and time selection; in the long run, everything will return to normal, market fluctuations are cycles, both political cycles, and economic cycles, and eventually will return to normal, and the stock market has always been volatile."
Hao Yusheng also said, "this year there are more uncertainties, but for high-quality companies, no matter the good or bad market, as long as they are solid and have the growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively minor, and investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

People's Daily commentator: focus on doing their own thing to create new advantages for future development - On learning and implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Entrepreneurs Symposium - Xinhua.com
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily July 26 commentator article: Focus on doing your own thing to create new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic focus, enhancing confidence in victory, and focusing on doing our own thing well are the key to our ability to deal with various risks and challenges.
At the recent entrepreneur symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, sluggish world economy and shrinking global market, we must focus on doing our own thing well, give full play to the advantages of the domestic ultra-large-scale market, gradually form a new development pattern with domestic large-scale circulation as the main body and domestic and international double-cycle mutual promotion, enhance the modernization level of the industrial chain supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate key core technology research, and create new advantages for future development.
The wise man wins, the wise man wins.
In the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the "two ends of the market and resources" have played an important role in China's rapid development.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization has encountered headwinds and backlash.
Do a long time to deal with the changes in the external environment of the ideological preparation and work preparation, to promote China's economy to ride the wind and waves, a very important aspect is to expand and meet domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to their own advantages, through the prosperity of the domestic economy, unimpeded domestic circulation to add impetus to China's economic development, to drive the world economic recovery.
We must deeply understand that building a complete domestic demand system is related to the long-term development and long-term stability of our country.
The Party Central Committee reviewed the situation and clearly put forward the firm implementation of the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic, the need to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of our economy, and the need to meet the people's growing needs for a better life.
The advantage of a large economy is that it can be recycled internally.
China has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, perfect supporting capacity, with more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million highly educated or with all kinds of professional skills, as well as 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, the formation of a large-scale domestic demand market, is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informationization, urbanization, agricultural modernization, investment demand has great potential.
Public ownership is the main body, a variety of ownership economy common development, according to the distribution of labor as the main body, a variety of distribution methods coexist, the socialist market economy system and other socialist basic economic system, both can stimulate the vitality of all kinds of market entities, liberation and development of social productivity, but also can promote efficiency and fair organic unity, and continue to achieve common prosperity.
We must firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, so that all aspects of production, distribution and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance of total supply and demand at a higher level.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with domestic large-scale circulation as the main body and domestic and international double-cycle mutual promotion.
Openness brings progress, and closure is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's door of opening up will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider.
Taking the domestic cycle as the main body, it is not to close the door to close the operation, but to make the domestic market and the international market better connected, better use of the two international and domestic markets, two kinds of resources, to achieve more robust and sustainable development.
At the same time, expanding domestic demand and expanding opening-up are not contradictory, and the smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to build a new pattern of opening up, and the more conducive it is to form a new advantage of participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although the current international trend of protectionism is rising, we must stand on the right side of history, adhere to deepening reform, expanding opening up, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting the construction of an open world economy, and promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many ordeals in its history, but it has never been crushed, but it has become more and more courageous, and has continued to grow in the ordeal and rise from the ordeal.
On the way forward, with the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, with the significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization capabilities and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the whole Party and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, we will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the momentum of China's economic and social development, build a well-off society in an all-round way, and successfully start a new journey of building a socialist modern country in an all-round way!
The balance of treasure income down "90" but "revenge" savings?
With the decline of the balance treasure income, the "post-90s" not only did not escape the balance treasure, but began to "retaliate" to save money.
China New Economic Research Institute and Alipay recently released the "balance treasure 90 savings report" (2020 version) shows that in the first half of the year, the "post-90s" prefer to save money: the per capita savings amount increased by nearly 40% compared with 2019.
Interestingly, the "post-90s" prefer to save from a "small amount", with 60% of the average amount of money saved less than 20 yuan.
Saving money with the balance has also become a "post-90s" saving habit.
Data show that in the 700 million balance treasure users, 134 million users are "90".
China has 174 million "post-90s", that is to say, about three out of every four "post-90s" in the country are saving money.
At present, the 7-day annualized rate of return of monetary funds such as Balance Treasure has fallen from a level above 2% at the beginning of the year to about 1.5%.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of "post-90s" saving money.
Under the background of the improvement of the balance treasure "saving effect", many young people who are accustomed to using the balance treasure have also directly transformed into "ccigrants".
Alipay data show that as of July 13, the new "genre of the people" on Alipay in the past month increased more than twice year-on-year, and more and more young people realized "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the flow of funds from the balance treasure into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of the IMF in June.
The report also shows that "post-90s" girls are more inclined to save more money, an average of 20% higher than boys; among the users who hold funds on the Alipay platform, 60% are men, and women tend to choose a more stable financial management method than men.
What are the plans after the 90s?
Alipay data show that the "post-90s" have the habit of saving money for the goal, and the largest number of users who use travel as a target for saving money.
Affected by the epidemic, many "post-90s" saved money to prepare for post-epidemic travel; the resumption of cinemas also provided a new way to shift from saving money to consumption.

France to increase military investment in space - Xinhua
French Defense Minister Florence Parly said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to the space defense budget to develop space military forces to prevent other countries from making "unfriendly moves" in outer space.
Parly told the newspaper Provence on the same day that between 2019 and 2025, the budget for spending on France's space military program will increase from the previously proposed 3.6 billion euros (about 4.2 billion U.S. dollars) to 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update the existing observation satellites and communication satellites in the future, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites, and improve the modernization of space surveillance radars.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that a military command of space and an “aeronautical and space force” would be set up within the French Air Force.
Parly said she would formally announce the creation of the Space Force when she visits a military academy in Saron, Provence.
Parly said the space force is part of the Air Force and will have a capacity of 500 by 2025.
“There is no longer any time that people thought space served the common good of science. Now space is a place where nations compete for global hegemony,” she said.
Parly reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying that the French side has no intention of provoking an arms race.
“We are not in an arms race by any means. But I have a responsibility to fully recognize the threats we may face.”
Parly repeated the surveillance of a French-Ukrainian military satellite in 2017.
She said the peep was a Russian satellite.
The Russian side denies this claim.
Parly said France would soon have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and locking "those black hands behind unfriendly moves."
French media believe that the reason why France sought to establish a space force was due to US President Donald Trump's request in February last year to the US Department of Defense to draft a space force bill.
In December, Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act into law, approving the creation of the sixth largest U.S. military service, the Space Force.
Some experts worry that the US moves have accelerated the pace of U.S. space militarization and could trigger a new space arms race.

Experts say gathering immigration data through U.S. Census for House seat allocation is unconstitutional
Some civil rights groups and several U.S. cities and counties have sued the U.S. federal government, saying that Trump’s presidential office’s attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. Census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the distribution of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sarah Brannon, executive counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, told VOA, “It won’t work to do that.”
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of the person receiving the census in the census is difficult to achieve and is “not very reliable”.
Another civil liberties group, the Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump’s executive order.
Several cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit Friday.
Garvey, chairman of the management board of Arlington County, said, “The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County, and we must not let this illegal attempt to scare people and reduce the number of our immigrant communities.”
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump’s executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the order a “victory” for the state.
He said that “the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives of the Länder and the Electoral College must be based on the number of residents living in the states and the number of residents legally residing in the country”.
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including the citizenship issue in its 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to submit data on the undocumented population from the U.S. Census Bureau so that the administration can exclude those undocumented people from the state census numbers and determine whether each state is adding or reducing or keeping House members.
The United States redistributes House seats every 10 years based on demographic changes.

Respond to the momentum, promote the construction of industrial projects - see the headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
In the summer, the heat wave is on the rise.
The province's industrial project construction to promote the on-site observation will release the enthusiasm, covering the heat of the three volts, "to industry than strength, to the project hero" of the clear orientation of the promotion of Sanxiang four waters.
The development of Hunan has always depended on building projects and cultivating industries.
In the face of the very unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the province insisted on a game of chess, went all out to fight the two hard battles of epidemic prevention and flood control, and used the industrial project as the "first-hand chess" to implement the "six stable" and "six guarantees".
From a year-on-year decline in GDP of 1.9% in the first quarter to a 1.3% year-on-year increase in the first half of the year, it is self-evident that the difficulty and effort of the period is huge.
In this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery and develop and stabilize.
It is unreversible, irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the overall situation, both good at accumulating, gathering, and seeking momentum, and being good at recognizing, seeking change, and adapting.
In the context of the complex and severe international situation, in addition to the hard work of attracting investment, we need to quietly study the new characteristics of the current new situation, more grasp the law, more scientific and accurate, and better integrate into the new development pattern with domestic large-scale circulation as the main body and domestic and international double-cycle mutual promotion.
Pay more attention to improving the basic capabilities of the industry.
In the first half of the year, not only did our province have a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries to break ground and sow hope, but also traditional advantageous industrial enterprises accelerated the laying of points and fell on the ground in the industrial transformation of digitalization, intelligence and greening.
Yiyang Oscon Third Science Park project to transform the existing production line, high-end printed circuit board intelligent production line to seize the opportunity; Hunan Cigarette Factory new factory is committed to intelligent transformation, the construction of modern factory process, but also "old trees germinate" vivid portrayal ... ... ... around the national major strategy and "two new and one heavy", focus on consolidating and improving the advantages of the industry, actively cultivate the development of emerging industries, comprehensively increase scientific and technological innovation and localization of the alternative, in order to continuously consolidate the basic conditions.
Pay more attention to cultivating and developing new models of new economic formats.
The sudden new crown epidemic has brought the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial change: in the first half of the year, the province's computer and office equipment manufacturing industry, electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industry increased by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the quota increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal fee revenue of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
In the crisis to cultivate new opportunities, open a new situation in the change, actively promote digital industrialization, industrial digitization, and guide the integration of the digital economy and the real economy is the general trend.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still room and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen the thinking and grasping projects of the industrial chain, it is not only necessary for the head enterprises to continue to accumulate, but also to achieve technological breakthroughs in key links in the industrial chain; it is also necessary to cultivate the "chain" chain to stimulate the "chain" chain reaction with the strengthening of the chain, promote the coordinated layout of related supporting industries, and accelerate the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
Through the difficulties and the support of enterprises, Hunan is still a hot and happy land with a good business environment and market opportunities.
The province's frequent moves, new moves, practical moves, in order to promote the "burden reduction" of corporate bailouts to promote high-quality development "acceleration"; Shaoyang implements "shareholder-style" services, does not prevaricate for enterprises, policy implementation does not discount, problem solving does not overnight... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "every effort" to find out the pain points of short board, the achievement of the fresh story of the crisis.
A mind to study the industry, cultivate the industry, develop the industry, solidly optimize the business environment, will be able to win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves are still in the future, but the state of riding the wind and waves has become the norm for the province to seize the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
In this critical period, we must learn and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of important instructions and instructions, effectively respond to external uncertainties with the certainty of their own work, persistently promote the construction of industrial projects, and work together with enthusiasm and sweat to ensure the "Thirteenth Five-Year Plan" and the comprehensive completion of a well-off society.

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature"
Economic Daily · China Economic Net reporter Lin Fangcan
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, China coordinated the promotion of epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, the epidemic prevention and control situation continued to improve, the steady recovery of the economy was obvious, the employment and price performance closely related to people's livelihood were generally stable, and China's economy handed over a report card of economic operation with temperature.
In the first two months of this year, the survey unemployment rate increased.
Especially in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically in a state of shutdown, the demand for employment of enterprises was reduced, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the unemployment rate of urban surveys increased.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the production and life order of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The Party Central Committee adheres to the general tone of steady progress, further strengthens macro policy hedging, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes the assistance to stabilize the post and expand employment.
China has increased policy hedging and stable posts, played a combination of "relief and slow return" policy, phased relief of three social insurance units, allowing the extension of social insurance premiums, expanding the return of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises, benefiting from the policy of job training, and giving absorption subsidies and trainee subsidies to enterprises to absorb key groups of employment.
With the implementation of various stable employment policies, the demand for employment in enterprises has steadily rebounded, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the unemployment rate of urban surveys has gradually declined, and in June, the survey unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Population and Employment Statistics Division of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to be effective, and the labor force that had withdrawn due to the impact of the epidemic in the early part of the year returned one after another, and the urban labor force participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February, which was close to the level of the same period last year.
Data show that the total employment of cities and towns in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached the pre-epidemic level; the average weekly working time of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, an increase of 6.6 hours from February, and 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices are equally related to thousands of households.
In January this year, the CPI rose by 5.4% year-on-year, a new high in many years.
Entering February, although the year-on-year increase in CPI fell slightly, it was still in the "5 range".
The year-on-year increase in CPI is at a high level, both the factors driving consumer demand before the Spring Festival, and the factors that drive the wrong month and the low base year-on-year basis of the Spring Festival.
However, the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, in January and February, there were logistics delays, untimely supply of materials, and increased cost of material transportation throughout the country, and some citizens were hoarded and snapped up, and the prices of some necessities increased significantly.
In order to cope with the disturbance caused by the price situation caused by the epidemic prevention and control, the relevant departments have included important living materials in the scope of emergency transportation security to ensure the smooth transportation of materials.
Under the influence of a series of policy measures, the supply of vegetable melon and fruit market has been strongly guaranteed.
In order to cope with the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government introduced a policy to ensure stable supply and price, all regions and departments quickly implemented it, the supply of pork reserves was significantly improved, pig production capacity was restored in an orderly manner, and the order of production and marketing was gradually normal.
Since March, pork prices have declined continuously, driving the year-on-year increase in food prices to 10.6% in May; in June, pork prices rose slightly month-on-month due to factors such as the slowdown in pig exports, reduced imports and the rebound in group consumption demand.
The seasonal changes in fresh vegetable prices are obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the higher base of the same period last year, the price of fresh fruit continued to decline year-on-year, with an average decline of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic life of the masses has been effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation has remained stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation logistics, the supply and demand in various places have increased, and the supply and demand situation in the market has improved.
Since March, the CPI has declined for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase has also fallen from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June, and the overall price level has recovered steadily.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to maintain a moderate level, and the overall inflation pressure is not large, but it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and life order under the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in the main producing areas of food, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on the behavior of disrupting market order such as hoarding and raising prices.

This spring, due to the need to set up road traffic routes in various places due to the prevention and control of the epidemic, the road of bee farmers "chasing flowers and honey" was blocked, and many bees died due to missed flowering and lack of food, and the income of bee farmers was seriously affected.
"All year round, bee farmers followed the flowering period on a long journey, from Yunnan, Sichuan all the way to the northwest, they live in the wind, live in the rest, very hard."
As businesses, we have a responsibility to help them.”
Wu Na said.
"Little bees are 'environmental scouts', and bees in heavily polluted areas cannot survive," said Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of the China Bee Products Association. Bee pollination is an important part of the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the yield of crops, especially in a wide range of areas and poor management conditions, pollination is more meaningful.
Research data show that pollination can increase the yield of canola by 15%-30%.

Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Nowadays, the number of beekeepers is less and less, in addition to the bee farmers who are running all the year round, there are still many poor households with limited mobility who choose to participate in cooperatives with beehives.

White House adviser "anti-bite" states to resume work too early
White House adviser "reverse bites" states to resume work too early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of the global cases.
For several months, US President Trump repeatedly asked the states of the country to return to school, until recently to change their attitude and take the initiative to wear masks in public, and his advisers are "bite" that some state governments return to work prematurely.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some state governments did not comply with the return to work standards and restarted bars and other places prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that previous statements that the president has "absolute power" to decide on the return to work of the states are rumors.
“The president is a federalist and he believes that the states have autonomy.”
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumors" in Conway's mouth were Trump's own words at the White House epidemic briefing on April 13.
This self-shaping operation has been ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history".
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history, she’s a liar.
Trump called Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a shutdown.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so he can hold a rally.
This isn’t the first time Kellyanne Conway has been controversial.
In an interview with Fox News on April 15, Conway blurted out, “This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!”

Three-year-old children's college playground play was smashed, and it made sense to complain to the school after being compensated?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal Daily Author:Wang Sisuo Responsibility Editor:Wang Sisuo
The playground was smashed, and the child was compensated and then sued the school.
□ This reporter Zhao Yifan
When Xiao Wen, a 3-year-old playing in a university playground, he was accidentally hit by Chen of the softball team in the head while pitching.
After Chen's compensation, Mr. Wen, Xiao Wen's father, as Xiaowen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding apologizing from the school where the incident occurred, and paying medical expenses, moral damage soothing funds for a total of 20,000 yuan.
Recently, the Beijing Haidian District People's Court held that after the trial of the case, the school set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, had fulfilled its appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen had made compensation, according to which the judgment rejected the plaintiff's lawsuit.
Mr. Wen claimed that during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Xiaowen to play in the school playground, when the softball team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid the risks involved, Xiao Wen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents operate in the safe area designated by the softball team.
However, after the softball team player Chen Mou took off his hand while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the guard to the above-mentioned safe area and hit the back of the small Wen.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with a head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school stadium do not meet the relevant safety regulations and do not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The fault of the school led to the above-mentioned events, resulting in great physical and mental suffering, and also brought great pain to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In this regard, the school argued that the school has set up a protective net in the playground, and posted management regulations, training notices, told to enter the playground to maintain a safe distance from the training ground and remind themselves to be safe, and the plaintiff could not prove that the school "has not fulfilled its safety and security obligations", so it does not agree to compensation.
After the court hearing, it was found that the venue involved in the incident was a free venue for the public, and although the school had a security obligation for the management of the playground, this security obligation only needed to achieve the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground, and has fulfilled its appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen also compensated Xiao Wen for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan in accordance with the previous compensation agreement, and the two sides agreed to solve the dispute once and for all.
After the incident, Xiao Wen's parents once again claimed compensation from the school, and the court decided to reject all the plaintiff's application.
After the verdict, neither side appealed, and the sentence is now in force.
According to Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, the school, as a manager of a public place, has a security obligation; in the case of damage caused by the behavior of a third party, the third party bears the responsibility for tort, and the public place manager who fails to meet the safety and security obligations shall bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
The judge said that since, as the manager of a public place, it is most likely to understand the actual situation of the entire place, foresee the possible danger and damage, so that it is most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of loss or the degree of damage, and the lowest cost of avoiding and mitigating the damage, the law stipulates that it bears the corresponding guarantee obligation to engage in social activities.
In this case, for persons who do not have a specific access population in a playground free of charge to the public, the school's security obligations should be commensurate with the social activities they engage in, in particular, the basic security measures should be taken and the obligation to inform the hidden danger.
In judicial practice, it is also not advisable to impose excessive security obligations on public places.
If the school has adopted the protective net and fulfilled the obligation to inform, it can be determined that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for third-party infringement, even if the administrators of public places such as schools do not meet their safety and security obligations, their liability is also as a supplement to damages, according to the newly promulgated Civil Code, the manager can also recover from the third party after assuming supplementary responsibilities.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should no longer expand the scope of the claim after he has received compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed inter-provincial tourism business from July 21, and on the first weekend after opening, Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in a peak in passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are many tourists who arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers, and the airport passenger flow is mainly based on students, tourism and family visits.

Israel strengthens repeated prevention and control of epidemic

Israel strengthens repeated epidemic prevention and control
At the beginning of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, Israel's prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of prevention and control measures, the number of new crown pneumonia diagnoses in Israel has recently increased significantly, and the Israeli government has taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of new crown pneumonia was confirmed in Israel, in order to quickly close all entry and exit ports, suspend non-essential industries, change schools to online teaching, restrict public transportation and non-essential social activities, lock down cities with severe epidemics, and joint maintenance and control measures for military and police.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results, and by mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Israel fell to single digits in a single day.
With the control of the epidemic, Israel's prevention and control measures have been fully unsealed, and since June, the number of new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
Especially after entering July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, Israel has had more than 1,500 new cases per day for eight days, and as of July 25, there were 916 new cases on the same day.
As of July 25, there were 59745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment venues, and introduced a policy to restrict public transportation, stipulating that each bus can not exceed 20 passengers.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of the "closed city" on weekends, which stipulates that the "closed city" will be implemented from 17:00 every Friday to 5 o'clock every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barbershops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while supermarkets, pharmacies and other basic services will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited on all dates and periods, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes will be banned from eating, and only take-away services will be allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people have not paid enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and have not been able to form a joint effort with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After the outbreak of the epidemic in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest because the government's prevention and control measures affected their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, believing that the anti-epidemic policy will affect the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the official residence of Prime Minister Netanyahu in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's promulgation of preventive measures such as banning restaurants and cafes without corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people do not comply with the provisions of wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters when they are outdoors, and in order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chins or hang them on their wrists.
During the repeated period of the epidemic, the school is the hardest hit area for the spread of the new coronavirus, and according to the reporter's recent visit to the kindergarten, the kindergarten teachers and students did not wear masks according to government requirements, and did not maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other, laying a hidden danger for a large number of teachers and students infected with the virus.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the expert advisory team of the National Security Council to combat the epidemic, believes that Israel is moving towards a "dangerous situation", pointing out that the current epidemic prevention and control measures taken by Israel are not enough, and all leisure and entertainment venues and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to fight the epidemic, and the Knesset and government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, agree on the fight against the epidemic, and formulate clear steps including relevant restrictions in different departments.
TEL AVIV, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Our correspondent in Tel Aviv, Wang Jing
Ningxia Guyuan farmer Wu Fengfang but his wife Dai Tianfu, two people sitting in the car, from 20 miles away from home, rushed to the Liangyun Cultural Combine.
Despite the inconvenience of the legs and feet in the past two years, the 77-year-old Dai Tianfu is still counting on "coming here after three forks and five times, and having fun."
This is a humble courtyard in the original district of Guyuan City, unlike the general farmhouse, the yard often spread melodious Qin cavity, as well as wonderful shadow puppets, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavities, eyebrows opera and so on.
The owner of the compound was called Liang Yun, and he was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he began to plan the construction of a cultural compound, love shadow, singing.
With the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
The reporter has not yet entered the Liangyun Cultural Courtyard, and the tune of Qin Cavity has already passed out.
Singing the Qin cavity section for the villagers is the neighboring village villager Bai Lixiang.
She has loved Qin since childhood, and now has a small name in the local area, as long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound for the villagers to perform programs.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also played a live webcast.
Bai Lixiang said: "It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see their performances."
On the stage, the singer glanced at each other, the player played a song and a tune, although he was an amateur, but his enthusiasm was not diminished.
Just like the rustic style of the farmhouse, outside the Qin Cavity, the "grassroots" art and non-heritage culture in the Liangyun Cultural Comb.
The compound also has a collection of more than 300 pieces of agricultural utensils, traditional and handmade tiles, paper cuttings, embroidery, and shadowing in different ages.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which showed his collection of old objects, old wine pots, three strings, spinning wheels and so on.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
“The shadow play is my family art, and I’ve been learning it since I was 15 years old.”
Liangyun Cultural Comb was established in 2012 and became the first rural "Intangible Cultural Heritage Exhibition Hall" in Ningxia, and also a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to the Liangyun Cultural Comb, more than 120 cultural courtyards and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in the original district of Guyuan City, including more than 50 cultural courtyards of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Complents, Wang Yonghong Cultural Commemoration, Yanglang Cultural Commemorations, etc., covering the towns and streets of the original state, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the field, enriching the cultural life of the masses and satisfying their spiritual needs.
“As life gets better and better, traditional culture cannot be left behind like this.”
"Liu's spy war drama" returned again "the odds" to see Liu Yunlong Li Liqun opponent "stripping"-Xinhua.com
The 40-episode spy drama "The Chance of Winning" will land on Beijing Satellite TV on July 16.
"The Winning" is based on the real historical fact, based on the dusty Soviet military archives that have been published for the first time for many years.
Liu Yunlong, an actor known to the audience for the "spy war drama", broke through the image in the play, challenging a very happy "stuttering agent".
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as "pretender", "mask" and "Kite" has proved that spy war genre dramas have a strong vitality.
Unlike previous spying works, "The Winning" looks at the world and extends the story to the Far East battlefield of the Soviet Union.
Set in the final stage of the 1944 Anti-Japanese War, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of the secretary of the underground party Linhe Province and the director of the Soviet Far Eastern Intelligence Bureau, the "Mudan Ula" strategy of the Soviet Union's Far Eastern Intelligence Service.
In many spy dramas, the male protagonist, as a senior spy, is a handsome, highly intelligent, mature and perfect image.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable for spying, "spying should be the kind of people who can't find people at all, if the appearance is a very handsome image, I want everyone to pay attention to you, can still lurk? "Kiteg" has a line: "You don't come to arrest me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang", spies to elite."
Therefore, in "The Winning", Liu Yunlong inadvertently designed the protagonist Tang Fei, who played him, as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "The Chance of Winning" is jointly supported by Fukuhara, a Japanese man played by Li Guanhua, and Fang Shibao, who played by Li Liqun.
One south and one north, two strong drama bones, for the whole play to add a lot of mastery to the point of view.
Director Yin Fei used the word "snaprising drama" to describe the opposite play of Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play, "Absolutely the two of them are particularly tacit understanding, and their tacit understanding is very impactful to me. Many times their play is 'hanging', for example, we only wrote half a sheet of length, when I shoot, I don't shout, they can continue to play."
When the actors are in the role and ensure their character status, not only can be from the perspective of the characters to shape the characters, but also bring more possibilities to the audience, Yin Fei said that such a play is brilliant enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in the "Liu's spy war drama", the famous shock of "Kite", the mighty style of the "Mountain City F4", in the "opinion" also gathered three.
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiao'an and Zhao Jane, played Tang Fei's right arm again.
Director Yin Fei said, "These two people have no inferiority, they just went with the flow in that era and environment."
Liu Yunlong also took the initiative, "We want to have a human touch. This human touch means that the people around me must have good and bad, bad people are enemies, but we must also develop them, and our team will grow up."
The ending of the two people in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, and he believed that he would give the audience a satisfactory answer.

HONG KONG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary for Financial Affairs and Treasury of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Xu Zhengyu, said that Hong Kong's financial markets remain active and operating in an orderly manner.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong’s financial stability and economy.
Xu Zhengyu said at an online seminar co-organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canada Convention) on the 24th (Toronto Time) that Hong Kong is experiencing a difficult situation because of the "reform storm" and the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
The Hong Kong dollar pair is stable and favors the strong party exchange guarantee level.

The total amount of bank deposits has also continued to increase in the past few months, and the stock market has a series of public offering fund-raising activities, and market transactions have risen frequently.
Xu Zhengyu said that the new crown pneumonia epidemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.

He encouraged Canadian companies to take advantage of Hong Kong’s strengths and their position as an international financial centre, international asset and wealth management hub and global offshore RMB business hub for development and investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and nearby regions.
The Lancet article praises China's anti-epidemic efforts to encourage countries to learn from the experience
As a country with a population of 1.4 billion people and a similar size to Europe or the United States, China has been effectively controlled at this stage, and there is no large-scale transmission, which has largely controlled the epidemic in China.
In the past decade, China has made significant investments in domestic research and public health construction, which has made China’s preparedness for the new crown much better than that year’s severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The authors say that at the time of the SARS outbreak in 2002, China was initially ill-prepared, especially the pathogen could not be determined.
When the new coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the virus species and shared genomic sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus, warning the world of the threat of the new coronavirus through a research paper published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, under the state of emergency, through close domestic cooperation, such research is carried out very quickly and strictly, in May and July, respectively, in the Lancet announced the results of the progress of the early trials of the new crown vaccine developed in China.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capabilities.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are well worth learning from.
In addition, China's experience proves that on the basis of strong research, it is necessary to make correct decisions with scientific evidence at a strong high level, so that the new crown epidemic can be effectively controlled.
Governments and their leaders must respect science, understand its values, and act on it in the best way for society.
In the early days of the outbreak, China National Health Construction appointed three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new coronavirus, and their recommendations provided a basis for the decision of Wuhan to "close the city" on January 23; when some experts proposed the necessity and urgency of building a square cabin hospital, the government quickly made a decision and quickly implemented it; at the same time, the wide participation of the community and the masses also made the epidemic quickly and effectively controlled.
In response to a global health emergency, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response.

Bhutokang sentry, platoon leader Yu Wang and a soldier on duty.
In this place with an average temperature of minus ten degrees a year, a row of simple barracks stands at the mountain pass, a flag flies in the wind not far from the barracks, and soldiers stand guard in the wind every day, and need to patrol higher-altitude places regularly.
The soldiers climbed the steep slope of the rocky pile and needed hands and feet.
In late July, it was the time when the flowers and plants flourished at low altitude, and in Batang Zhuokang, only the ravine behind the barracks was relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a warrior who has been stationed at the post for six years, pointed to the ravine and said that this is their back garden, and only in July and August each year can we see the grass slowly growing, and soon after, it all turned yellow and covered with snow.
The patrol may take about 9 hours.
In the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snow-capped mountains and glaciers all year round, and they also regularly patrol the mountain pass at higher altitudes.
A few days ago, a patrol composed of eight soldiers once again took the patrol road under the leadership of instructor Liang Yixin.
Each soldier weighs about 30 pounds and goes to the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier is high, and the comrades are urgently rescued.
In addition to patrol missions, the soldiers at the Bajukang checkpoint conduct daily tactical and physical training.
Time passes by minute by minute, the altitude rises, the oxygen content is getting lower and lower, and the physical strength is constantly overdrawn, which tests the will of the patrol members.
They gritted their teeth and insisted on crossing several landslide points and crossing several dangerous beaches.
At 16 o'clock, it was lunchtime for the patrol members, and they took out their own dry food and sat on the ground at an altitude of more than 5700 meters, accompanied by sleet and snow, and supplemented their physical strength with food.
The soldiers at the Bata Zhuokang sentry position were trained in tactics and physical fitness.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the losers will do push-ups, both for entertainment and physical fitness.
After a short break in the cold wind, they climbed the target position of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass, and solemnly swore.
Behind them is the snow-capped mountains, and in front of them are dozens of kilometers of no-man's land, and they are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing consumption season restarts - Xinhua
Beijing restarts the activities of the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principle of "comprehensive restart, key planning, orderly promotion and strict organization".
On July 26, 1.5 million government and enterprise consumer vouchers were issued, including 1 million offline food and beverage shopping vouchers and 500,000 smart product vouchers, which consumers can receive in the Jingdong APP.
Liu Meiying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, introduced at the media briefing held on the 25th that the consumption season after the restart will further reduce the allocation of enterprises on the basis of maintaining the preferential subsidies of existing consumer voucher cards.
From the beginning of August, the government and enterprises will invest the current :1 allocation capital adjustment to 2:1, for example, if the original consumers receive a card package to the store after consumption can enjoy 120 yuan discount, of which the government subsidies 60 yuan, the enterprise's concession of 60 yuan; the adjustment of the government subsidies of 80 yuan, the enterprise concessions 40 yuan.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting Beijing's 5G new infrastructure and 5G new consumption.
Chen Maobo pointed out that Hong Kong's economy has been hit by the outbreak again, calling on all walks of life to spend time together
HONG KONG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Chen Maobo said on the 26th that Hong Kong's positive impact on the new wave of new crown pneumonia epidemic has also been hit by business exchanges and economic activities that were already showing signs of recovery.
The HKSAR Government once again calls on owners of large and small to reduce rents and to spend time with retail households, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Chen Maobo published an article entitled "The Road to Resurgence" on the Internet.
He said that the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Hong Kong is high in the near future, and the situation is grim, which has affected the people's livelihood and also plagued the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the first thing is to strictly prevent imported cases, and to deal with and interrupt the virus transmission chain as soon as possible; when the epidemic is under control, economic activities should be resumed in a timely and appropriate manner.
He pointed out that in the face of the impact of the new wave of epidemic, business exchanges and economic activities that had seen a slight recovery have also been hit.
For the business community, social responsibility is just as important as the spirit of the contract, especially those groups that receive large government subsidies in the employment guarantee scheme.
He mentioned that the economic situation in Hong Kong in the second quarter of this year is still very serious, but the contraction seems to be slightly slower.
In terms of exports, he believes that the external situation in Hong Kong is still grim.
Chen Maobo said that the development of Hong Kong in the past few decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities, and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
The largest earthquake in Taiwan this year in the eastern sea of Taiwan
TAIPEI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A 6.1-magnitude earthquake occurred on the Richter scale at 20:52 in the eastern waters of Taiwan on the 26th, with a maximum magnitude of 4, and the earthquake felt in Taiwan, which is the largest earthquake in Taiwan this year.

China Earthquake Network measured the earthquake to be 5.5 magnitude.
The largest earthquake in Taiwan is: Hualien County 4, Yilan County, Taitung County, Nantou County, Yunlin County 3, and other counties and cities measured 1 to 2 magnitude.
Taiwan's meteorological department pointed out that the earthquake is the largest in Taiwan this year, which is a hidden belt-type earthquake at the border of the plate, and its epicenter has often experienced earthquakes in the past, and it has been relatively active this year.
In the next week, it is still not ruled out that there are still aftershocks of magnitude 4 or higher.
Marinichev said that the change in value is affected by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic.
He said: “The cost of services is increasing.
Because of the epidemic, people are starting to spend more time on the Internet.”
Mr. Marinichev did not rule out a serious rise in internet prices, arguing that operators could offer customers higher speeds and more services to offset discontent over rising prices.
"Chinese Doctor" to pay tribute to anti-epidemic heroes - Xinhua
Recently, with the Chinese filmmakers' respect for the heroes of the epidemic, the chairman of Bona Film Group, Yu Dong, and the director Liu Weiqiang (pictured left) held a discussion and exchange with academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the filming and production of the anti-epidemic theme film "Chinese Doctor".
Bona Pictures hopes to pay tribute to all the medical and epidemic prevention workers who are fighting in the front line of epidemic prevention and control through "Chinese Doctors"!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a gift film celebrating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, Bona Film is under the arrangement and deployment of the Central Propaganda Department and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Provincial Film Bureau, the original class of the film "China captain" is organized to prepare for the film "Chinese Doctor", which is a film that is reflected in the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee and the people of the country unite to fight the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
The film focuses on the first line of Wuhan's anti-epidemic, and will use the Wuhan medical staff and the provincial and municipal medical teams as the background, from the perspective of human nature, using a unique narrative, as well as a very impactful lens language, the panorama shows the touching story of the Chinese medical staff who are full of dedication and sacrifice in the first line of anti-epidemic.
It is understood that the first time of the day of Wuhan's unsealing, Boa company will overcome many difficulties, sent a team to go deep into the front line of the epidemic, and hundreds of health care workers face-to-face communication, collection of information, has been interviewed including Zhong Nanshan academician himself, Guangzhou to assist Wuhan first person, Guangdong aid to the medical team, as well as Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan Central Hospital and other anti-epidemic front forefront of the white angel, took a lot of first-hand video.

Cultural travel "red fruit" Ju Shaoshan - Xiangtan first red bo meeting - Today's news - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily · New Hunan client reporter 蒋睿 correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing Red Boat Mould, Shaoshan Mao Zedong bronze statue, Yan'an cloth pile of flower crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun bacon... On July 25, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Red Culture Industry Expo in Xiangtan was held at the Shaoshan Global Tourism Consulting and Dissemination Center.
The exhibition area of red cultural products, the revolutionary old area of the local products and so on dazzling, attracted tourists from all over the world to buy.
"The Red Expo is not only a display of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths."
Xiangtan first Red Expo executive committee responsible person introduced, the Red Expo to "promote the red culture to help the growth of the tourism" as the theme, the exhibition area of nearly 3000 square meters, set up the atmosphere to create areas, scenic area exhibition area and red travel online shopping experience area.
Invite Zhejiang Jiaxing, Guizhou Zunyi, Shaanxi Yan'an and other eight provinces and cities, as well as our provincial governor Sha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang, Chenzhou and other places 137 enterprises, units to participate in the exhibition, a total of 768 exhibits, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourism routes, red training courses, red cultural products and so on.
The exhibition area will be open until July 29.
As the host of the Red Expo, the highlights of the Xiangtan exhibition area are numerous.
The person in charge of the exhibition area introduced that the Xiangtan exhibition is divided into two parts: red industry and red cultural industry development.
The red industrial exhibition area exhibited 31 exhibits of six enterprises such as Hualing Xianggang, Hualing Cable, and Xiangdian Power, and nearly 200 products of 27 units such as red series of books, red series of foods, and red series of cultural products were exhibited in the red culture industry development exhibition area.

Japan's new crown confirmed cases total more than 30,000 - Xinhua
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, and more than 200 new cases were added in a single day for six consecutive days, with a total of 11,214 cases.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka Prefecture and 80 new cases in Aichi Prefecture.
In the first half of the year, the number of telecommunications network fraud crimes increased by 70%, and the characteristics of the highest inspection summary were Sino-New Network.
According to the news of the highest inspection website, in the first half of this year, the national procuratorial organs prosecuted a total of 58,101 people for fraud, an increase of 35% year-on-year.
In particular, in the crime of obstructing the epidemic prevention and control, the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by procuratorial organs accounted for 43.4% of the total number of crimes of epidemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance, and the 10 batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control have been issued, involving a total of 9 cases of fraud.
From the perspective of the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many names involved in fraud crimes, from the national macro policies to the people's clothing, food and housing, including epidemic fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health care" fraud, "admission intermediary" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, defrauding state subsidy fraud, national assets thawing fraud, etc., and constantly "innovate", covering the economic benefits, including education, medical care, employment, social security, poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation.
In particular, some telecommunications network fraud breaks through the limitations of national borders, regions and personnel, and has the characteristics of stakeholders, cross-border, remote, and electronic payment, which is not specific to the victim group and is harmful.
For example, some set up special companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up a number of departments or positions, use the legitimate network platform to promote and recruit, train and evaluate recruiters, adopt enterprise operation mode management, and wear a "legal cloak", which is more confusing.
It is the duty of the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes according to law and issue early warning to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In the judicial case, the procuratorial organs earnestly perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high-pressure situation for fraud crimes, but also targetedly detailing various law enforcement measures, and promoting social governance through the issuance of procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly regard the facts, evidence, procedures and application of the law in cases of arrest and prosecution of fraud cases, and on the basis of facts and the law as the criterion, so as not to be in vain.
Especially for telecommunications network fraud, pay attention to the core role of electronic data in fact identification, and strive to build a chain of evidence between electronic data, speech evidence, and documentary evidence.
For example, the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, should handle an epidemic-related fraud case, the procuratorial organ intervened in advance in the first time, from the occurrence of the case to the completion of the case, only 5 days, reflecting the attitude and determination to deal with quickly and strictly and maintain the overall stability of the society.
In the review of arrests and prosecutions, attention is paid to the prosecution of leaky offenders in cases, 733 people have been missed by the public security organs, and 1,113 co-permitants have been examined and prosecuted by the public security organs.
In the first half of the year, the national procuratorial organs issued 298 procuratorial recommendations for fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting deep-seated governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes in the supervision of telecommunications networks such as communication enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations found in the case, the Guangzhou Procuratorate of Guangdong Province and the Procuratorate of Dongguan City promptly put forward procuratorial suggestions, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and promote the construction of long-term systems.
The fourth is to do a good job of chasing the loss of stolen goods.
Local procuratorial organs have seized important links such as intervention in investigation and guidance for evidence collection, review and prosecution, urged the investigation organs to actively recover stolen funds, cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job in recovering stolen money, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate handled a certain routine loan case, the case involves 22 suites waiting for the seizure, in the case of the property may be disposed of in advance of other cases, the first issued the Suspension of Execution Letter, timely service to the relevant court, it is recommended that the previous seizure court suspend the execution of the property involved, after the crime is found out unified, to recover the property involved, to recover the property involved, to recover the victims' losses to make the best efforts.
Prosecutors remind everyone that they should be very vigilant about fraud crimes, do not expect "the pie in the sky", and do not think that it is cheap to be credulous and keep their own "money bag".
Guizhou Province Weining County, Chenna Town: Short apple trees widen the way out of poverty

In the heat of the summer, the reporter of the Economic Daily-China Economic Net walked into Zhonghai Village, Guana Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
In the scorching sun, villagers Li Yuanzhong hoeed grass in the base, although his face was red, but his mouth hummed a few small songs from time to time.
Weining County, where the town is located, due to low latitude, high altitude, sufficient light, large temperature difference between day and night, the sugar content of the apples produced is high, good taste, and has a certain popularity in the surrounding areas, but also because of small size and many spots, it has not been able to sell a good price and has not been able to form an industrial scale.
Puna Town was once a poor township in the spring and autumn of Baogu onions, and the incidence of local poverty 10 years ago was as high as 25.8%.
In the critical period of poverty alleviation and decisive victory, it is urgent to change traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure, and increase farmers' income.
Chen Chao, secretary of the party committee of Chen Na Town, and a group of people in the town after many visits, believed that industrial development could no longer take the old road.
To this end, the town introduced leading enterprises and planted apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Qianna Town in 2015 from Shaanxi to investigate, and looked at the local planting conditions at a glance, and planted apple trees in the local area from 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land out to plant apple trees, and Li Yuanzhong and his wife grunted in their hearts: "I have planted apples for so many years, and I have not seen anyone in the village who planted apples to make a fortune."
"All grown apples are dwarfed apples, and they don't make the apple trees grow too high."
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that the apple planting took a new method, the irrigation water pipe was laid under each apple tree, water and fertilizer were poured together into the roots of the tree, and when the fruit was harvested in the autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard, and the fruit could be picked while standing.
At present, the apple base has gradually entered a period of abundant production, and the market is also as expected by Hou Jianwen, Apple is not worried about selling, and is loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has made Li Yuanzhong's life a new change, although it is still in the field, but the income has a new source.
Li Yuanzhong family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the apple base, every year in addition to the bottom of the land transfer fee, after the fruit there are profits, the husband and wife usually work in the base, "one person can get 80 yuan a day, all year round work."
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividend of more than 2,800 yuan, coupled with land transfer fees and the couple's work income, a family income of more than 80,000 yuan, "eat and wear, the well-off days have been lived."
"At present, the initial results are beginning to see results, and the annual output value of 1 mu of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that the whole town is currently planted with 20,000 acres of apples, only in Zhonghai Village has 6,000 acres, covering 4056 households and 17,200 people, of which 656 households and 2,952 people are covered by poor households, and the annual salary is more than 6 million yuan, which truly realizes the base's construction at the doorstep, and the work does not have to go out.
Li Yuanzhong, who was bulging, also began to realize his “wish”.
This year's Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle, and now drives a car to and from work every day, "there are still more than ten acres of land at home, and the next step of the apple base to expand the scale, all flow to them, the income is more."

Membrane separation technology helps to crack the "greenhouse effect"
Membrane separation technology helps to crack the "greenhouse effect"
New hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology diagram
Recently, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University made significant progress in the "membrane separation method capture carbon dioxide", and successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology to greatly improve the carbon dioxide capture performance of film materials.
The results have been published as a cover article in the international journal Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem plaguing human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the cause of the "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and utilize human emissions of carbon dioxide is the focus of scientists.
"Membrane separation method" is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology, which separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, and has the characteristics of high efficiency and simple operation.
How to make the membrane material "deep breath" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is a bottleneck in the use of membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide.
Tianjin University's scientific research team innovated ideas and explored the impact of different solvents on the separation performance of membrane gas through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that N-methylpyrrolidaneone as a preparation solvent, the carbon nanotubes in the resulting membrane material are more evenly distributed and "more breathable", which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the film material.
With this new technology, the mixed matrix membrane, the carbon dioxide separation performance is close to the theoretical separation limit of such membrane materials.
“New technologies provide new ideas for membrane separation to capture CO2.”
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team at Tianjin University, said: "We hope that this technology can provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies to deal with flue gas, and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions."
Before volunteering to fill in the report, first understand what is the professional grade difference - Sino-New Network
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning News Author: Yuxiao Responsibility Editor: Yuxiao
Before volunteering, you must first understand what is a professional grade difference.
Every year to fill in the college entrance examination volunteer, there are students or parents because of the lack of understanding of the noun involved in the voluntary filling, and thus affect the volunteer to fill in the report.
This year, five universities of Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing University of Chemical Technology jointly issued a 2020 admissions policy to cancel the professional grade difference.
What does it mean to have a professional grade difference, and what is the significance in voluntary reporting?
There are three ways of professional distribution rules.
Experts remind that before filling in the volunteer, we must read the admissions regulations of the school in detail and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the proportion of transfer and professional distribution rules.
Professional allocation rules refer to the three ways of professional priority, priority, and professional grade difference after the transfer of university files.
Which method of use of the university will be clear in the Admissions Charter.
However, there are also some colleges and universities that accept the principle of total score priority, and there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, the admission range of candidates in accordance with the total score line, when the score does not reach the first professional volunteer admission score line, it depends on whether the second professional volunteer admission score line, and so on until the admission to the last professional volunteer, there is no grade difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional grade difference" is that when the college arranges the candidate's major, according to one or several points published in the admissions charter to determine the admission of different professional candidates, this score value is "professional grade difference".
That is, the difference between the scores of the college in the admission of candidates for the first major and the non-first professional volunteer, and the difference between the volunteer grades of each professional, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 minute, etc.
For example.
Assume that students Xiaoming apply for A colleges and universities, the test has 560 points, and their professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, A college professional admission to implement the professional grade difference method, the grade difference is divided into 2 points, 1 minute, 1 minute, 0 points.
In the professional distribution, if Xiaoming's first professional volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the professional plan balance, then Xiaoming is admitted to the "computer" major; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be subtracted from 2 points, according to the 558 points and the first professional volunteer examination "international trade" candidates, to determine whether it meets the professional admission conditions; if it is still not satisfied, the score will be subtracted from 1 point (that is, 557 points).divided, and so on.
Different university professional grade settings are different
With the popularization of parallel volunteers, many colleges and universities have now canceled the professional grade difference, but this year there are still some universities still retain this method, from the school announced the "admission charter" point of view, this year, more than 20 universities have set up professional grade difference.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight College, etc.
In these colleges and universities, the professional grade difference set by each university is different.
Some colleges and universities in each major have grade difference, such as Ningxia University, the file has been sent to the school's candidates, according to the candidate to fill in the order of professional volunteers in order to reduce 1 point in order of admission.
Some universities have different professional grades between different majors.
For example, Jimei University, the total difference in professional volunteer grade difference is 4 points, that is, the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteer grade difference is 3 points, there is no grade difference between other professional volunteers, as parallel volunteers, other professional volunteers and transfer professional volunteer grade difference is 1 point.
When filling in the volunteer, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the school reported to be reported, to see if there is a professional grade difference, the form of grade difference is how, in the full consideration of the score at the same time, but also a reasonable analysis of the proposed school and professional, if the college in the admissions charter clearly adopts the grade difference method of admission, candidates in the choice of majors, pay attention to the gradient between the majors, improve the admission rate.
