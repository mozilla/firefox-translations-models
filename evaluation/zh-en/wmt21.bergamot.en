Where do people find?
Excellent returning migrant workers is an indispensable force.

Xinhua News Agency Chengdu July 26th Topic: Making excellent returning migrant workers into a rural revitalization force
This year's 34-year-old Zhang Xiong's family in the Orchard Village in Meishan City, Sichuan Province, he quit his job of quitting Beijing's monthly salary in 2010 to return home to start a business.
After several years of hard work, now he runs a grape growing family farm with annual income of more than one million yuan, becoming a small famous leader in the enrichment leader, and was also selected into the village "two committees" team.
In recent years, under the inspiration of a series of agricultural policies such as poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start a business, and activated the spring water of the countryside.
In 2019, it produced more than 8000 village secretaries of village-wide party branches from the western province of China and the largest labor export province of Sichuan, due to snobbery, providing more than 8000 village party branch secretaries from among the outstanding migrant workers, cultivating 6.1 million village reserve forces, and developing more than 20,000 party members, providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
Well-off, the key to look at the villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and young laborers in rural China have increased their income, and some have started their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively it has also led to the emergence of rural "hollowing" to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations, and the village party branch secretary and party members have shown the characteristics of "one old and one low", that is, the aging of age, low academic qualifications, the leader of the village party organization is not strong, and the problem of green and yellow is not connected.
If factors such as rural talents have been flowing in one direction to the city, the countryside has been in a state of "blood loss" and "eemic" for a long time, and revitalization is an empty word.
Bringing those capable, conscious, and aspiring to serve their hometown migrant workers, guiding them to return to their hometowns to become leaders who have become rich leaders, and to train them into party members and village cadres with merit, and enrich the cadres at the grass-roots level, which is the solution to the rural party members' ranks and grass-roots party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers can be brought back, but also let them stay and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan has begun to pay close attention to the construction of the farmers' labor party, on the basis of strict candidate standards, and establish a system mechanism for the targeted return of outstanding migrant workers, service guarantee, training and energy improvement, selection and use, so that they can improve their ability, work security, and have great expectations in life, and really put down roots in rural areas, and officers have a sense of accomplishment in entrepreneurship.
This year is the year of the decisive battle against poverty, and the connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization is a key factor.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, they can build a task force that can stay, fight, and take away, and provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are very special, July 11th night, bilibili summer graduation song will bring graduates a special live online performance, old wolf, simple tree, Li Yuchun, Mao and other musicians to send songs and blessings to recent graduates.
Well-known up master SealWu Wu Yifan also brought a song "Wildwe", which is a rap song created by this song based on Lu Xun's emoting poetry collection of the same name, which is very popular among young people.
Due to the relationship between the epidemic, many graduates failed to experience the ritual of the on-site earrings and awarding degree certificates, and they transferred the sense of ceremony to the line.
The data showed that the 2.5-hour-long song session, live-streamed the popularity peak of more than 35 million.
"Follow your own heart, seize the opportunity, do not count the consequences, sometimes there will be unexpected gains."
Although it is a graduation song party, many songs also make non-graduates moved.
"The whole scene to see and really want to cry, whose youth is full of beauty and regret, but all are worth remembering, have to go down bravely."

"In the inspection, not only to check the record of biodiversity, but also to check the installation of artificial nests, to rescue injured wildlife, the installation of field infrared cameras and so on."
The Songshan National Nature Reserve has now installed more than 200 infrared cameras to record the living conditions of the wildlife in the forest.
Hu Qioli introduced that with the continuous enrichment of the biodiversity of the protected area in recent years, more and more wild animals appear in the lens, leopard cats, raccoon and pig badgers have become "resident guests", and the "out of the film" of the national secondary protected animal antelope is also getting higher and higher.

Patricio Justo, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Arab-Chinese Studies Center, believes that the above-mentioned decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure against the United States' previous provocations, and is not aimed at ordinary Americans.
The United States has tried to divert the attention of the American people by pressuring China to cover up its lack of response to the coronavirus outbreak.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Center for Asian Innovation Studies, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic gesture of the United States has caused serious problems in the relations between China and the United States, and the relationship between the two countries faces severe challenges.

Earlier, the United States demanded the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston a serious violation of international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the US side will rescind its previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the return of bilateral relations to normal.
An editorial in Singapore's United Morning Post said the U.S.'s larger strategic intention was to contain China and prevent China from continuing its rise.
In the face of the US, although China is very reluctant to see China-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Engines may be out of stockpiling FAA emergency order to check 2000 Boeing passenger plane - Xinhua
The FAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of about 2000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic aircraft registered in the United States, because the air check valve of the above-mentioned aircraft may cause the engine to stop the engine after being corroded.
The FAA said that to date, four reports of air parking of the 737NG and 737Classic aircraft engines have been received, so there have been emergency inspection requirements for passenger aircraft that have been parked for seven consecutive days and above and have been re-entered for flights so far below 11 times.
The FAA has warned that if the 5th-stage check valve of all two engines of the airline is corroded, it may be stuck in the open position, causing the airline to lose power completely and unable to restart the engine.
The aviation watchdog ordered that once the restort valve is found to be corroded, the airliner must replace the key component before the passenger plane is put into service.
Boeing responded later in the day that the coronavirus outbreak led to a reduction in travel demand, and many passenger aircraft were sealed or used less, and "resistance valves are more susceptible to corrosion."
Boeing meanwhile said it had suggested that the airliner inspection instructions involved in the passenger jets, and if the problem was found, Boeing would provide help in overhauling and replacing the check valve.
The Associated Press reported that the major U.S. airliners typically fly multiple times in a day, but after the coronavirus outbreak, a large number of passenger aircraft were grounded; as passenger demand for travel has grown slowly recently, some passenger aircraft are back in operation.
The FAA did not release details of four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later in the day.
The airline said in a statement that a plane was on its way from Seattle, Washington, on July 15th to Austin, Texas, when an engine suddenly stalls and the airline plane made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines says it has replaced the engine of the airliner and has checked the engines of the six airliners in accordance with the FAA's directive.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest said on the 24th that their passenger aircraft did not appear to have engine flameout of the associated air check valve.
Four U.S. airlines will be inspected, and United Airlines' 28 aircraft will be inspected.
Delta said it would check its 20 passenger jets, but did not say whether there had been an engine flameout.
Multiple media reports said that the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive was another shock to Boeing.
Lion Air Indonesia and one of the Ethiopian Airlines each Boeing 737MAX airliner crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, killing a total of 346 people.
This series of passenger jets was subsequently grounded worldwide, discontinued in January this year and production resumed in May.
FAA Administrator Steve Dixon acknowledged in June that the FAA had "made a mistake" in the regulation of Boeing on the 737MAX passenger jet.

However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development and utilization of rivers and lakes is unbalanced, and the chaos of sewage discharge, lake-making fields, and encroachment waters has led to the black odor of the water body, the water quality is over-standard, the environment is dirty, and the ecological degradation is degraded.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of water ecology and striving to restore the Yellow River water show.
Water treatment should be done at the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local "standard + sewage control" method, industrial park sewage all achieve centralized treatment, urban sewage treatment plants all achieve first-level A standard discharge, urban built-up areas of black and smelly water body basic elimination, successfully declared the third batch of China's black and smelly water demonstration city.

The "Wetland Dream" of the gull collection
Birds, green trees, stacks, blue water... The beauty of the "salugull collection" under Fan Zhongzhong's pen has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
Through Ningxia, the Yellow River has formed a variety of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands, and swamp wetlands along the way, which plays an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and the ecological balance of water, and has also become an important bird migration channel in the world.
Since 2009, the relevant departments in Ningxia have invested about 34.5 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, the area of Yinchuan wetland is 1.92 million hectares, the wetland protection rate has reached 78.5%, there are nearly 200 natural lakes and swamp wetlands, and there are five national wetland parks, 1 national wetland parks, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks, and eight municipal parks.

Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing a continuous summer peak water shortage problem, and the "pain of water shortage" has become a summer pain experience for many high-rise residents, but in the major water sources are in the limit of over-harvesting, urban areas have formed a large area of groundwater over-harvesting disaster area under the status quo, water shortage has become a problem that plagues Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, the Yellow River water after drinking and purifying has become a good way to solve the drinking problem of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of the Yinchuan Municipal Water Bureau, introduced that in order to improve the domestic and rural production and water demand of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia will start the water supply project of the urban and rural western line of the Yinchuan metropolitan area in a timely manner, and replace the original groundwater source with high-quality Yellow River water.

For the first time, the United States launched a countervailing investigation into China with "reminbi exchange rate undervalued"
In response to the US Department of Commerce's recent announcement, it decided to launch an anti-dumping anti-subsidy investigation on straits (beads) products originating in China, and launch an investigation on the "LanMB Exchange Rate Undervaluation" project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has investigated the so-called "renminbi exchange rate undervaluation" project in the anti-subsidy case neutral case, and China firmly opposes this.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a press release on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China's floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, with reference to a basket of currencies for adjustment and management, the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that, in general, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable and balanced level and is not undervalued.
Since 2005, the renminbi has appreciated more than 17 percent against the dollar.
According to the data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the effective exchange rate of the RMB nominal has appreciated by 38%, and the actual effective exchange rate has appreciated by 49%, which is the strongest currency in the G20 economy and one of the currencies with the largest appreciation in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue exceeds the authority of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with World Trade Organization rules.
The United States in February to amend the regulations to conduct countervailing investigations into other countries' exchange rates has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
The press release said that even in accordance with U.S. regulations, there are a large number of errors in the content of the applicant's complaint, and there are no necessary elements for countervailing, such as financial support, benefit and specialization.
China urges the US side to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate."
Affected by the further increase in the tension between China and the United States, the offshore and on-shore RMB exchange rate against the US dollar was once significantly depreciated in the trading session of the US dollar, and both fell below the dollar against the RMB7.0 level.
Whether the U.S. Commerce Department ’ s move is intended to rise to the renminbi is worth paying attention
The yuan's share of the dollar-on-time exchange rate rose to 70.0 on the 23rd to close at 6.9961.
The median exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar, which was officially regulated, was lowered by 17 basic points on the 24th, reporting 6.9938.

Lewis family: John Lewis is the "fight for the weakest" fighter
U.S. Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights crusader, was remanded for a "fight for the weakest" at a memorial service for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis's public memorial service has been in Alabama since Saturday's classay.
There were two memorials on the first day.
At Saturday's Polio Memorial at the University of Troy in Alabama, Lewis's five siblings and a niece-surreptit spoke of him as a loving, 無曾, rousing 懼 man with a family weight.
Lewis' youngest brother, Henry "Grant" Lewis, said at the meeting: "He's devoted his life to helping others."
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John "not to get in trouble, don't get in trouble."
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning, saying, "We all know that John will always get in trouble, always in trouble, but that's because it's a good trouble for sticking to the right thing.
Lewis's brothers and sisters remind people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument is to create "good trouble", that is, just for the sake of justice, do not avoid the cause of the incident.
John applied for Troy University, in his birthplace, Troy University, in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, and at that time, the University of Troy, which was a white school, rejected his application for admission.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to his chicken on his farm as a child, eventually received a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Sen. Doug Jones, a member of Congress from Alabama, said the current protesters were "protesting peacefully, non-violently," just as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump beats a shipwreck and says all the protesting masses as a thug, he's wrong.
The protesting masses are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more equal country. ”
A series of events, which is held in memory of Lewis, will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis' coffin was parked Saturday at a public memorial event at the University of Troy, where people came to pay their respects to the civil rights pioneer.
Later Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him at a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial.
On Sunday, Lewis's remains will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators demanding the right to vote for blacks were beaten by Alabama police in front of the bridge, and police also fired tear gas at demonstrators.
Lewis was almost killed.
It will be called the Bloody Sunday.
Lewis' body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to be on the sidewalk and walk the last step with Lewis.
At the same time, officials are required to wear masks and maintain social distancing when they are involved.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey ordered the flag-laden to be lowered at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday to honor Lewis.
At the nearly week-long commemorations, Lewis's remains will be split 別 at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington for people's memory.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could come to the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay their respects to Lewis.

Adhering to party building as the lead and implementing the party's leadership into all aspects of grass-roots governance is a fundamental requirement for the direction of doing a good job in grass-roots governance.
To improve the level of grass-roots governance, we must adhere to the leadership of party building, and promote the party's political advantages, organizational advantages and the advantages of mass work to transform the party's political advantages, organizational advantages and the advantages of mass work through the "nerve ending" and "last mile"
Focus on calcium replanting the soul and strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grass-roots governance, we must implement the "calcium-making soul" project.
It is necessary to deeply understand Xi Jinping's socialist ideas with Chinese characteristics in the new era as the primary task, take "never forget the original intention and remember the mission" as the eternal topic of party construction and the lifelong topic of party members and cadres, strengthen the principle of reading the original book, and continue to promote the party's innovative theory and armed training through special training, batch training, discussion and exchange, and hold large lecture halls, etc., and promote party members and cadres to further enhance the "four consciousnesses", "four self-confidences", and achieve "two maintenances" through special training, batch training, discussion and exchange, and hold large lecture halls.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide grassroots party organizations and party members and cadres to truly integrate learning education into daily life and grasp it frequently.
Pay attention to practical exercise, in the process of resolving the key difficulties in the field of grass-roots governance, we will solve the troubles and troubles of the masses, and temper the party's ability and ability to refine.
Take the rule and build a battle fortress.
Grassroots party organizations are both an important part of the grass-roots governance system and an important carrier for the demonstration of governance capabilities.
To promote the standardization of grass-roots party organizations, starting from the regulations of the party branch, focusing on the weakening of party organization leadership and virtualization, through the establishment of up-and-or-chested linkage mechanism, innovative branch setting form, normalized rectification and weakness and fragmentation, the establishment of a sound decision-making mechanism, service to the masses mechanism, etc., to solidify the foundation, make up for the shortcomings, and promote development.
In rural areas, we will strengthen the standardization of party organizations at the village level, standardize the construction standards of the party branches, standardize the organizational form, learning activities, and management mechanisms, and effectively promote the implementation of the system of "three sessions and one lesson" and theme party day activities.
In the city, pay attention to street communities, explore innovative branch settings, focus on weak areas, "blocking points" and "pain points", and actively build urban party building alliances, so that the party's work can be effectively covered.
At the same time, we will establish and improve the grass-roots governance governance system and mechanism, improve the decision-making mechanism of major affairs, practical co-operation, urgent consultation, difficult consultation, and grassroots party organizations, improve the mechanism of decision-making and deliberative mechanism led by party members and cadres, gather people's hearts in the service of the people, enhance the sense of gain, happiness, honor, and pride of party members and the masses, and make grass-roots governance more temperature.

It is necessary to take the improvement of governance capabilities as a compulsory course for party members and cadres at the grass-roots level, continuously strengthen ideological hardening, professional training, and practical exercise, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in the posts and in urgent and dangerous tasks, and lay a solid foundation and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities.
It is necessary to widely carry out the activities of "community whistleblowing, party members reporting" activities, and participate in community construction, management and service, so that party members can play a role in community governance by participating in the theme party day activities, contacting the difficult masses, determining service projects, claiming micro-wish wishes, and making reasonable suggestions.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of rural unserviced party members, and guide the majority of grassroots party members to actively participate in the work of poverty alleviation, ecological construction, letter-visit maintenance, and straw-baning, and better integrate red forces and serve the people by setting up a task force for the unserviced.
The foundation is strong.
The grassroots party organization is the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by insisting on close party group relations and increasing the well-being of the people as a point of view, and taking the leadership of the party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovative development of grass-roots governance can we build a solid foundation, so that the grass-roots party organizations can pull out and peak, and the grassroots party members and cadres can catch up and rush to go, and promote grass-roots governance to have "souls", orderly, strong and effective.

The University of Australia's development of new drugs is expected to treat vascular blockages caused by new crowns - Xinhua
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that helps prevent heart disease and stroke, and hopes the drug will be used to treat vascular blockages triggered by the coronavirus.
The researchers found that an enzyme in platelets accelerated plateplate condensation before a heart attack or stroke.
As a result, they developed a drug that temporarily inhibits platelet clotting, thereby avoiding blood vessel blockage and preventing heart disease and stroke.
The researchers said the drug only inhibits the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since there are studies showing similar vascular blockages as one of the leading causes of death in patients with severe coronavirus, the researchers hope the drug could be used in the future for the treatment of such critically ill patients.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next stage of human clinical trials.
The results have been published in the American journal Science and Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter after the CBA League rematch allowed the audience to watch the game live.

The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the Sino-Power Project Hami Melting Salt Tower Photoelectric Power Generation Site in Iwu County, Hemi City, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower type of solar thermal power generation, is to reflect the sun through the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form thermal energy, and then through the traditional power generation technology will convert the heat energy into electricity."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of China Electric Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd., said that its design principle is similar to that of solar stoves used in rural areas in northwest China, and the sun must gather sunlight together.
The power plant began construction in October 2017, and was connected to the grid at the end of last year, covering 6600 acres, and a total of 14500 fixed-day mirrors were planned to be installed.
"Compared to traditional solar power generation technology, the biggest advantage is that the gathered heat energy can be stored, and it can also generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured by the project can make the generator set maintain continuous and stable operation, not affected by light changes; it can also be quickly involved in the peak power grid peaking according to the demand for peaks in the power grid.
After the project is fully completed, it can realize the annual power generation capacity of 1.98 billion degrees, which can save more than 6 million tons of standard coal per year, reduce sulfur dioxide by more than 60 tons, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot, and more than 15 million tons of carbon dioxide, providing a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver in the Stone City Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
Hamiffer solar photovoltaic power plant covers more than 2300 acres, has been built 714 power generation equipment also follow the sun rotation, always maintain the sun and the spotlight plate surface into a 90-degree right angle.
"We use dual-axis tracking concentrator power generation technology, through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle of gravity according to the solar height to maintain power generation efficiency."
The power station director Duan Mengqi said that in good light weather conditions, the power generation technology can be more than the traditional photovoltaic power generation efficiency can be improved by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has achieved more than seven million degrees of power generation, supplementing local electricity demand.
Shicheng Subphotovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest single-sized single-scale in Xinjiang, the most complete photovoltaic industry demonstration park with photovoltaic module type, which has a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects, and the total installed capacity of 82 million kilowatts.
The total power generation capacity was more than 1.1 billion degrees in the first half of this year, an increase of 6% compared to the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the best areas for solar energy resources in China.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6200 megajoules per square meter, and the sunshine hours are about 320 hours throughout the year.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted a good "Sunflower Field ..."
More than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power generation have been built, and the city's photovoltaic power generation capacity exceeded 14 billion degrees in the first half of this year, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
At present, there are more than 330 units of Xinjiang grid-connected photovoltaic power plant, with an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.

US media has revealed the truth about the unprovoked U.S. demand that China closes the Consulate General in Houston

US media has revealed the truth about the United States' unwarranted demand for China to close the Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China decided to revoke the establishment and operation permission of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu and make specific demands on the Consulate General to stop all operations and activities as a countermeasure to the United States on the 21st for the suspension of the Consulate General in Houston.
The U.S. government's behavior has attracted much attention, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is China asking the Chinese side to close the Consulate General?
A number of foreign media said that it is not clear why the United States will choose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, foreign media bluntly said: for the election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the US demand that China's closure of the Consulate General in Houston has raised questions about its political motives.
The U.S. government's disastrous response to the coronavirus outbreak has caused President Donald Trump's low-level poll approval ratings before the election.
White House officials privately say the tough strategy for China is to save Trump's approval rating, but also to deflect responsibility for the White House's response to the failure of the outbreak.
The article argues that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven, very cautious" goal chosen by the United States, and the U.S. government has chosen it as "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of causing a major conflict."
The BBC also believes that at a time when the US election season is approaching, the US economy has been hit hard by the epidemic, Trump believes that playing the 'China card' has a political advantage.
The current situation is "a spiraling, tit-for-tat struggle, which is partly driven by the U.S. government from a domestic perspective, and will only worsen tensions between China and the United States."
CBS News reported that Trump's re-election prospects were weighed down by the outbreak, and he has repeatedly blamed China for the outbreak.
The United States almost every day there are new actions against Trump ’ s absurd theory of “China ’ s exploitation of the United States ”.
“The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries. ”
The Associated Press review said U.S. demands on China to close the consulate in Houston have heightened tensions between the world's two largest economies.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in the southern United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, and U.S. citizens seeking visas and other services will also face difficulties.
A business group in Houston expressed regret over the U.S. demand that China close its consulate in Houston, saying the Consulate General has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The AP believes it reflects the importance of China's economy.
The U.S. Foreign Policy magazine website argues that the U.S. move "is part of a series of provocative initiatives that will only worsen U.S.-China relations."
Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, was quoted by Reuters as saying that since the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of any move comparable to the U.S. action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the US move is unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
Analysts believe the move could cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was built in 1979 and is the first consulate in China to open in the United States.
Currently, China has an embassy and five consulates in the United States.

According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, on the 25th, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom responded to reporters' questions on the wrong remarks about the cyber attack.
The spokesperson stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always firmly opposed and cracked down on any form of cyberattacks and cybercrimes.
Question: According to the media, China-linked hacker groups have interfered with a British company's network system, launched attacks on British-American technology companies with patent data, and hacked into the network of EU governments.
The spokesperson said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always firmly opposed and cracked down on any form of cyberattacks and cybercrime.
The virtuality of cyberspace is strong, the traceability is difficult, and the actors are diverse, and sufficient evidence should be presented in the investigation and qualitative network events.
A series of previous incidents such as the Prism Gate proves that the United States has been conducting the world's largest cyber-sto-semi-tele operations, the spokesperson said.
It is in the common interest of all countries to maintain peace and stability in cyberspace.
The spokesperson pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation are not stolen, not snatched, but through self-reliance and hard work.

Most districts of Urumqi free nucleic acid testing have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas
China New Network Urumqi July 26th (Reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) Urumqi Municipal Health and Health Commission Director Zhang Wei 26th in the Urumqi city of the latest epidemic and nucleic acid testing said, at present, Urum complete city free nucleic acid testing work in most of the district has been basically completed.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous regions and the city of Urumqi are making further assessments of the development of the epidemic based on the nucleic acid test and epidemiological investigation results.
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Press Office held a press conference on the 26th to inform Xinjiang about the epidemic situation and prevention and control.
According to him, between the hours of July 25th and 24th, there were 22 new confirmed cases of coronavirus in Urumqi (five of which were asymptomatic infected people), and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infected people were added.
As of July 2524, there are 135 confirmed cases in the city of Urumqi, and 147 cases of asymptomatic infected people.
The new asymptomatic infected people on the 25th are also basically through the city's free nucleic acid testing and active screening.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health and Health Commission, said on the 26th that most of the areas of free nucleic acid testing in Urumu Quancheng City have been basically completed.
He also said that from the experience of other parts of the country, there are many factors affecting the nucleic acid test results, such as the sensitivity of the detection reagents, the infection time of the person being tested, the cooperation of the testee at the time of specimen extraction (the difference in cooperation may lead to the specimen not being taken in place), and the ability of the test environment, the operation proficiency of the inspectors.
Nucleic acid testing can also have false negative results for various reasons.
The so-called false negative means that the person tested is indeed an infected person, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, for people who have been in close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to be ruled out.
For people who have been to high-risk areas of the epidemic, if fever and respiratory symptoms occur, there is a false negative possibility for a nucleic acid test negative, so two nucleic acid tests are also required to be eliminated.
He said that in view of the above situation, in order to the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, starting today, the city of Urumqi will conduct secondary free nucleic acid testing in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shaybak District, and carry out "checking the omissions" at the same time.
It is reported that the Tianshan District and Shaybak District are high-risk areas of the epidemic.

U.S. President Donald Trump, boasted of what he had achieved in the first phase of the deal at the beginning of the year, has changed at a recent pace.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China's recent single-day purchases of U.S. corn have broken records and bought a lot of soybeans, "but what this trade agreement means to me now is not as good as it was reached at the time of the original."

But he revealed that China's economic and trade-related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "we have tried our best to buy, so any additional procurement will have difficulties."

Xinhua News Agency Beijing July 25th People's Daily July 26th Commentator article: Concentrate on doing your own thing to create new advantages in future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence and concentrating on doing our own business is the key to our various risk challenges.
At the recent symposium of entrepreneurs, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, downturn in the world economy, and shrinking global market, we must concentrate on doing our own things, give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large-scale market, gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycle to promote each other, improve the level of industrial chain supply chain modernization, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate key core technology research, and create new advantages for future development.
The minded man's wisdom, the control of the Mighty Mansion to win.
In the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the "two ends" of the market and resources have played an important role in China's rapid development.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization has encountered headwinds and back waves.
To do a long time to cope with the changes in the external environment of the ideological preparation and work preparation, to promote China's economy to ride the waves, stable and far-reaching, an extremely important aspect is to expand and meet domestic demand as a strategic basis for development, give full play to their own advantages, through the prosperity of the domestic economy, smooth domestic circulation for China's economic development to add momentum, driving the world economic recovery.
We must deeply understand that building a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long-term development and long-term peace and stability.
The Party Central Committee has clearly put forward the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic, the need to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of China's economy, and the need to meet the people's growing better life.
The advantage of a big economy is that it can be internal.
China has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, perfect supporting capabilities, with more than 100 million market players and more than 1.7 billion people with higher education or with all kinds of professional skills, as well as a large-scale domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 4 billion middle-income groups, is in the rapid stage of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, agricultural modernization, and the rapid development of investment demand.
Public ownership as the main body, the common development of a variety of ownership economies, according to the distribution of labor as the main body, multiple distribution methods coexist, socialist market economy system and other basic economic system, can not only stimulate the vitality of various market subjects, liberation and development of social productive forces, but also promote efficiency and fairness organic unity, and continuously achieve common prosperity.
We must firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, so that all aspects of production, distribution and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance of aggregate supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other innovations in various fields, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern featuring domestic and international double cycles.
Openness brings progress, and closure is bound to fall behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's door to opening up will not be closed, it will only open wider and wider.
Taking the domestic cycle as the main body, it is by no means closed to close the door, but by giving full play to the potential of domestic demand, making the domestic market and the international market better connected, and making better use of the two international and domestic markets and two resources to achieve more powerful and more sustainable development.
At the same time, it is not contradictory to expand domestic demand and expand opening-up, and the smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to build a new pattern of opening up, and the more conducive it is to form a new advantage in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although the trend of protectionism is rising in the world, we must stand on the right side of history, persist in deepening reform, expanding opening up, strengthen opening-up and cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the construction of an open world economy, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many ordeals in history, but has never been crushed, but has become more and more courageous, and it has continued to grow in the ordeal and rise from the ordeal.
On the way forward, there is the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, the strong mobilization ability and strong comprehensive strength, the unity and struggle of the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the momentum of China's economic and social development, build a well-off society in an all-round way, and smoothly start the new journey of building a socialist modern country in an all-round way!

France to increase military investment in space - Xinhua
French Defense Minister Francois Parly said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to the space defense budget and develop space military forces to guard against "unfriendly moves" that other countries may make in outer space.
Parly told the Provence newspaper on the same day that between 2019 and 2025, the budget for spending on French space military projects will be increased from the previously proposed 36 billion euros ($42 billion) to 43 billion euros ($4 billion).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019 to 2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update existing observation satellites and communication satellites, launch three electromagnetic surveillance satellites, and improve the modernization of space surveillance radars in the future.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that the French Air Force would establish a Space Military Command and the "Aviation and Space Force"
Parly said she would formally announce the establishment of the space force when she visited a military academy in Salon, Provence region, later.
Paley said the space force, which is affiliated with the Air Force, will be in the capacity of 500 people by 2025.
"The idea that people used to think that space serves the common interests of science is gone. Space is now a place for countries to compete for global hegemony," she said.
Paly reiterated Macron's previous statement that the French side has no intention of provoking the arms race.
“We are not in any way an arms race, but it is my responsibility to fully recognize the threat we may face. ”
Paly re-emerges the surveillance of a French and Italian-shared military satellite in 2017.
She said, "Snooping" is a Russian satellite.
Russia denies this claim.
Parly said France would "soon" have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and locking down "black hands behind those unfriendly moves."
French media believe that the reason why France seeks to set up a space force is due to US President Donald Trump's request in February last February to draft a Space Force bill.
Trump signed a defense authorization bill in December to approve the creation of the sixth-largest U.S. military, the Space Force.
Some experts worry that these US initiatives have accelerated the pace of U.S. space militarization, potentially triggering a new round of space arms race.

In response to the situation, promote the construction of industrial projects - View the nod - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
In the summer of Hunan, the heat wave flap.
The province's industrial project construction to promote the enthusiasm of the on-site observation meeting, overshadowing the heat of the three-volt days, "to the strength of the industry, the hero of the project theory" the clear orientation of Sanxiang four water.
The development of Hunan always depends on the construction of projects and the training industry.
In the face of the highly unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province adheres to a chess game, devotes all efforts to fight the two hard battles of epidemic prevention and flood control, and takes the industrial project as a "first hand chess" for the implementation of "six stability" and "six guarantees".
From the decline of 1.9% year-on-year in GDP in the first quarter to the 1.3% year-on-year increase in the first half of the year, the difficulty during the period, the huge efforts made it is self-evident.
On this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery and development and stability.
The currents are smooth, irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be placed in the overall situation, both good at building momentum, preparing momentum, and planning, and being good at understanding, changing, and adapting.
In the current context of the complex and severe international situation, in addition to attracting investment, we still need to be calm to study the new characteristics of the current new situation, more grasp the law, more scientific and accurate, and better integrate into the new development pattern of domestic and international double-cycle mutual promotion.
Pay more attention to improving the basic capabilities of the industry.
In the first half of the year, our province not only has a large number of emerging industries heavyweight investment projects to break the ground, the hope of planting, more traditional advantages of industrial enterprises in digitalization, intelligent, green industrial transformation to accelerate the layout, fall like flying.
Yiyang O'Sagon Third Science Park project to transform the existing production line, high-end printed circuit board intelligent production line to seize the lead; Hunan smoke Changde cigarette factory new factory is committed to intelligent transformation, the construction of a modern factory, is also a vivid portrayal of "old trees new buds"... around the national major strategy and "two new one, focus on consolidating and upgrading the advantages of the industry, actively cultivate the development of emerging industries, comprehensively increase scientific and technological innovation and localization, in order to continuously consolidate the basic conditions, save the transformation momentum."
We should pay more attention to cultivating and developing new business models for the new economy.
The sudden coronavirus epidemic has brought the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided a new opportunity for industrial transformation: in the first half of the year, the manufacturing industry of computer and office equipment, electronics and communication equipment manufacturing in our province increased by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the limit increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal fee income of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to educate new machines in the crisis, open a new situation in the change, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitalization, and guide the integration and development of the digital economy and the real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the supply chain of the industrial chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises outside the province, there is still room and potential in the supporting chain.
Strengthen the industrial chain thinking grasp project, not only the head of the enterprise to continue to accumulate, in the key links of the industrial chain to achieve technological breakthroughs; also need to cultivate everywhere, to strengthen the chain replenishment chain extension chain to stimulate the "chain" lock reaction, to promote the coordinated layout of related supporting industries, accelerate the construction of an independent and controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
Overcoming difficulties, supporting enterprises, Hunan is still a hot land and a happy land for market opportunities, and a happy land.
All parts of the province frequently make tricks, new tricks, real moves, for the "burden reduction" of enterprise bail-out to spawn high-quality development "accelerated"; Shaoyang implements "shareholder-style" services, for enterprises to do not pretaste, policy to honor non-discount, problems do not stay overnight... In the process of restoring the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "do everything", find the short board points, and achieve the vivid story of the crisis.
A mind to research industry, cultivate industry, develop industry, solidly optimize the business environment, will win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves in the front are still there, but the state of wind and waves has become the normal situation of the province to grasp the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
On this critical period, we must study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of important instructions and instructions, effectively respond to external uncertainties with the certainty of his own work, persistently promote the construction of industrial projects, share enthusiasm and sweat, and ensure the successful conclusion of the "13th Five-Year Plan" and the comprehensive construction of a well-off society.

In June, the urban labor force participation rate rose by about 10 percentage points in February, which is close to the level of the same period last year.

Affected by the high comparison base in the same period last year, the price of fresh fruits continued to decline year-on-year, and the average decline of 13.3% in the first half of the year was 13.3%.
The basic life of the masses is effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation is stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation logistics, all localities have increased their supply and demand, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
At the beginning of March, the CPI fell for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase also fell from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June, and the price level was generally stable.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to maintain a moderate level, and the overall inflationary pressure is not large, but it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order under the premise of normalizing the epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in the main agricultural products such as food, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on the behavior of disrupting market order such as hoarding and inflating prices.

US White House adviser "anti-bite" states to resume work prematurely - China New Network
US White House adviser 'anti-bite' states return to work too early
On July 23rd, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of the global cases.
For months, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly asked states across the country to resume work and not until recently, he has changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public, and his advisers have "reversely bite" that some state governments are returning to work prematurely.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a news conference that some state governments had not complied with the resumption of work and restarted venues such as bars prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that previous claims that the president has "absolute power" to decide states to resume work is a misconventional rumour.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes that the states have autonomy."
She justified Trump.
However, the "rumors" in Conway's mouth were personally uttered by Trump at the White House epidemic briefing on April 13th.
The operation of this self-slapsticking was ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history loomed"
Kellyen Conway wants to rewrite history, she's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a shutdown.
Trump wants to push back to work so he can hold rallies.
This isn't the first time Kellyan Conway has caused controversy.
In an interview with Fox News on April 15, Conway blurted out: "This is COVID-19, and not COVID-1, friends loomed.
She seemed to understand "19" as a version, which was frantically ridiculed by netizens: read the newspaper without common sense!
Three-year-old children's college playground play was smashed, and it was reasonable to vend the school after being paid for it?
2020-07-26 05: 01: 11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sisuo Responsibility Editor: Wang Sisuo
The playground was smashed, and the child was awarded and then sued the school party after the child was awarded
□ Correspondent of this newspaper Zhao Yifan
When three-year-old Xiaowen was playing in a playground at a university, he was accidentally hit by the softball team's Chen when he was shot.
After Chen's compensation, Mr. Wen, Xiaowen's father, as the legal representative of Xiaowen, sued the school to the court, asking the school to apologize for the school where the incident was in the place of the incident, and paid medical expenses, mental damage compensation, etc., a total of twenty thousand yuan.
Recently, the Haidian District People's Court of Beijing, after hearing the case, believes that the school set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, and has fulfilled the appropriate security obligation, and Chen has made compensation, which has rejected the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen complained that during the summer holidays of 2019, he took Xiaowen to play in the school playground, when the soft team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid the risks, Mr. Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents are operating in the safe area designated by the softball team.
But then the softball team player Chen took off when he pitched, causing the softball to fly over the protection network to the above-mentioned safe area and hit Xiaowen's back of the brain.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with an external injury.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school stadium do not meet the relevant safety regulations and do not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The negligence of the school led to the above-mentioned events, resulting in great suffering caused by Xiaowen's physical and mental suffering, and at the same time brought great pain to his family, which should bear legal responsibility for this school.
In this regard, the school argued that the school has set up a protective net in the playground, and posted management regulations, training notices, told the playground to keep a safe distance from the training site and remind itself of its own safety, the plaintiff can not prove that the school "has not fulfilled the safety and security obligations, so it does not agree to compensation."
After the trial, the court held that the venue involved in the incident was a free venue for the public, and although the school had a security obligation for the management of the playground, it was necessary to meet the general obligation of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground, and has fulfilled the appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen also compensated Xiaowen for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses of more than two thousand yuan in accordance with the compensation agreement reached.
Afterwards, Xiaowen's parents once again advocated for school compensation, and there was no basis for law, and the court ruled to dismiss all the plaintiff's application.
After the sentence, neither party appealed, and the judgment has now entered into force.
According to article 37 of China's tort liability law, the school, as the administrator of a public place, has the obligation of safety and security; in the case of the damage caused by the actions of the third party, the third party bears the responsibility for tort or tort, and the public place manager who fails to fulfill the safety and security obligation shall bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
The judge said that since as the administrator of a public place, it is most likely to understand the actual situation of the entire place, foresee the potential danger and damage, so that it is most likely that the necessary measures are necessary to prevent the extent of the damage from occurring or mitigating the extent of the damage, and to avoid and mitigate the minimum cost of damage, so the law stipulates that it shall bear the corresponding guarantee obligation for social activities.
In this case, the school's security obligations should be commensurate with the social activities carried out in the social activities that are not specific to the public in the playground free of charge, mainly to take basic security measures and the obligation to inform the risk of concealment.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to have a high security obligation for the management of public places.
If the school has taken the protective net and fulfills the obligation of notification, it can be determined that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for third-party infringement, even if the administrator of a public place such as the school fails to fulfill the safety and security obligations, its liability is also a supplement to the damages. According to the latest promulgation of the Civil Code, after the supercharger bears the supplementary responsibility, it can also recover from the third party.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should not expand the scope of the claim after receiving compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is high.

As a popular tourist destination city, there are many tourists who arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers in the summer, while airport passenger flow is dominated by students, tourism and family visits.
The tourism market has gradually warmed up, and in July, Xiamen Airport was running 440 flights per day, and domestic flights have recovered to 80% before the epidemic.
Airlines have encrypted the air express lines from Xiamen to major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming and Xi'an, seizing the recovery of the tourism market.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a number of domestic inter-provincial tourism products, and the team itinerary is mainly based on outdoor attractions.
In view of the summer passenger peak in railway stations and airports, the relevant units have sent additional manpower to guide in areas where people are easy to gather at check-in counters and security channels.

Israel strengthens repeated prevention and control of the epidemic
At the beginning of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, Israel's prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the prevention and control measures, the number of new crown pneumonia diagnoses in Israel has increased significantly recently, and the Israeli government has taken many emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28th, the first case of new crown pneumonia was confirmed in Israel, so as to quickly take the closure of all ports of entry and exit, the suspension of non-essential industries, the change of schools to online teaching, restrictions on public transportation and non-essential social activities, the blockade of serious cities, military and police joint maintenance prevention and control measures.
This series of measures soon achieved positive results, and by mid-May, Israel's single-day new confirmed cases of coronavirus fell back to single digits.
With the control of the epidemic, all the prevention and control measures in Israel have been fully unblocked, and since June, the number of new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
Especially after entering July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, the number of daily new cases in Israel has been above 1500 for eight days, and as of July 25, the number of new cases reached 916 on the same day.
As of July 25, there have been confirmed cases of 59745 in Israel, with a death toll of 448.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases broke through the number of confirmed cases, the Israeli government closed public entertainment venues such as gyms, swimming pools, bars, and nightclubs, and at the same time introduced a policy restricting public transportation, which stipulates that the number of passengers per bus can not exceed 20 people.
On the 17th, the government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of the "sealing of the city" over the weekend, and the implementation of the "Closing City" between Friday and 5th of the week.
During this time, people can go out, but venues such as shops, shopping malls, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic service places such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited on all dates and periods, gyms, studios and other venues will be closed, and restaurants and cafes will be banned from eating, and only takeaway services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people have not paid enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic, and have not been able to form a synergy with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After the repeated outbreak in Israel, many people took to the streets for the impact of government prevention and control measures affecting their own economic interests.
On July 11th, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, arguing that anti-epidemic policies affect the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem to protest Prime Minister Netanyahu's promulgation of prevention and control measures such as restaurants and cafe halls and not giving compensation.
In addition, many people do not abide by the rules of wearing masks and maintaining two meters of safe social distancing when outdoor activities, and in order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on the chin or hanging on their wrists.
During the repeated epidemic, the school is a hard-hit area where the coronavirus has spread, and according to the reporter's recent visit to the kindergarten, the kindergarten teachers and students did not wear masks according to government requirements, nor did they maintain a safe two-meter social distance to each other, laying hidden dangers for a large number of teachers and students infected with the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the expert advisory group of the Israeli National Security Council on the fight against the epidemic, believes that Israel is heading for a "dangerous situation", pointing out that the current epidemic prevention and control measures taken by Israel are not enough, and all leisure and entertainment venues and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks a master plan to fight the epidemic, and parliament and government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, agree on the fight against the epidemic, and formulate clear steps to include relevant restrictions in different departments.

Ningxia Guyuan farmer Wu Fengfang can't be able to be his wife, Dai Tianfu, two people sitting in a car, from a home from 20 miles away, rushed to the Liang Yun Cultural compound.
Despite the inconvenience of the legs and feet of these two years, the 77-year-old Dai Tianfu still hopes to "come here every three for five turns, and I've been addicted to it."
This is a humble yard in the original state of Guyuan City, and the general farmhouse is different, the yard often comes from melodious Qin, as well as wonderful shadow play, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavity, poppy drama and so on.
The owner of the compound, Liang Yun, was once a carpenter.
More than a decade ago, he began to plan to build a cultural compound.
With the Liang Yun Cultural Complex, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
The reporter has not yet entered the Liang Yun Cultural compound, and the tune of Qin Qian has passed out.
The singing of the Qin cavity selection section for the villagers is the neighboring villager Bili Xiang.
She loved Qin Qing since her childhood, and now she has a small reputation in the local area, and as long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform the program for the villagers.
Recently, Peri Xiang also played live webcast.
"It's a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see themselves performing."
On stage, the singers glanced, the player a piece of the play, although it is an amateur, but the enthusiasm is not reduced.
Just like the rustic style of the farmhouse, outside the Qin cavity, the "grasroots" art and non-heritage culture in the Liang Yun Cultural Complex came to the fore.
The compound also has a collection of more than 300 pieces of physical objects from different eras, traditional and handmade tiles, paper cutting, embroidery, and shadow.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which showed his collection of old objects, old wine pots, three strings, spinning lines and so on.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"The film is my family craftsman, and I've been learning this craft since I was 15 years old."
Founded in 2012, Liang Yun Cultural Compound has become the first rural "Intangible Cultural Heritage Exhibition Hall" in Ningxia, which is also a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.

"Liu's spy war drama" returned again "Winning" to see Liu Yunlong Li Liqun's opponent "Race" - Xinhua
The 40-episting spy war drama "The Winning" will land on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16th.
Based on the real historical facts, "The odds" are based on the Soviet military archives that have been dusted for many years and first appeared.
Actor Liu Yunlong, who is known to the audience as a "spy war drama", broke through the image of the play, challenging a rather happy "stinging agent draulicity draulate dragon"
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as "The pretender", "Mask" and "Kite" has proved that the spy war type drama has a strong vitality.
Unlike previous spy works, "The Winning" looks at the world and extends the background to the battlefield of the Soviet Far East.
In the context of the final phase of the 1944 Anti-Japanese War, it tells the story of the "Muzandula" strategy of the Soviet Junction Intelligence Agency under the leadership of the Communist Party of China's underground party forest river and director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau under the leadership of the Communist Party of China's underground party forest river provincial party committee and director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau.
In many spy dramas, the male protagonist as a senior spy, an appearance is a perfect image of handsome, high intelligence, and maturity.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable for being a spy, "Spying should be the kind of people who can't find people in the pile, if they are a very handsome image, I want everyone to pay attention to you, can still lurk? "Kite" you do not come to catch me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang "spy to go to the elite."
So in "Winning", Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his role as the protagonist Tang Fei as a "stinging agent draulicity draulate"
The other camp in "Winning" was propped up by the director of the police department, Fang Shibao, played by Li Guanhua, played by the Japanese Fuyuan and Li Liqun.
One south, one north and one north two strengthist bones, for the whole play added a lot of master's tricks to the whole play.
Director Yin Fei used the word "Race" to describe the play Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong's opponent play, "I'm definitely a drag, they're two particularly tacit understanding, and their tacit understanding is very impactful to me. Many times their play is' now hung', for example, we only wrote half a page of the length of the paper, I don't stop shooting, they can continue to play."
The master does not play each other, the director does not stir the play, when the actor is in the role and the status of their characters, not only can from the perspective of the characters to shape the role, but also to the audience to bring more viewing possibilities, Yin Fei said that such a play is enough to be outstanding.
In the play, you can also see a lot of familiar faces in the "Jiu's spy war drama", "Kite" famous for a moment, the majestic "Mountain City F4" in the "Strike" also gathered in the three.
Hou Yu and Liu, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jian, once again played Tang Fei's right arm.
Director Yin Fei introduced, "There is no inferiority in these two people, they only go with the waves in that era and in that environment."
Liu Yunlong also offered to say, "We want someone to have a human touch. This person's love means that the people around me must have good and bad, bad people must be the enemy, but also to develop them, and our team will also grow up."
The ending of the two people in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, and he believes that he will hand over a satisfactory answer to the audience.

The Lancet article praises China's anti-epidemic efforts to encourage countries to learn from experience-China New Network
The Lancet magazine's 25-day article said that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion people and similar in size in Europe or the United States, has been effectively controlled at this stage, and there is no longer widespread spread, which has largely controlled the domestic epidemic.
The article said that in the past decade, China has made a lot of investment in domestic research and public health construction, which has made China more prepared for the new crown than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was prepared for that year.
The authors said that at the time of the SARS outbreak in 2002, at first China was ill-prepared, especially if the pathogen could not be determined.
When the new coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were quick to be able to identify the species of the virus and shared genome sequencing data with the world on November 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had elucidated the clinical characteristics of the virus, warning the world of the threat of the new coronavirus through a research paper published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, and under the state's declaration of a state of emergency, through close cooperation at home, such research was carried out very quickly and strictly, and in May and July, respectively, the results of the progress of China's early trials of the new coronavirus vaccine were published in The Lancet.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for the country to respond quickly and effectively to health emergencies and to global health safety.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are well worth learning.
In addition, China's experience proves that on the basis of strong research, there must be a strong high-level decision-making decisively by relying on scientific evidence, so that the new coronavirus epidemic can be effectively controlled.
The article stresses that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand the values of science, and act on it in the most favorable way for society.
In the early days of the outbreak, China National Defense Department commissioned three teams of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new coronavirus, and their recommendations provided a basis for the decision to seal the city in Wuhan on November 23rd; when experts proposed the necessity and urgency of building a square-cabin hospital, the government quickly made decisions and implemented them quickly; at the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also made the epidemic quickly and effectively controlled.
The article concludes by emphasizing that in response to the global health emergency, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response.

It is reported that in the film, in addition to the "three uncles" Wang's auspicious daughter is played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the scenes are done by the real director's family, the film's experimental audio-visual style, breaking the boundaries between the theater and the real, and bringing the audience a new immersion viewing experience.
According to the director Dapeng, the creation of "Auspicious" comes from "a natural provide for", during the shooting of a family of sudden series of changes, so that the original shooting plan has to change with it, the life without a script is eventually recorded into a film, but the tension beyond the design.
How does director Dapeng face this "intention" and how to continue to meet the changes brought about by this Providence?
There is no doubt that "Ausual" is full of experimental, almost all-in-situ and innovative audiovisual style turns the life of the camera into a film, and under the package of real images, the audience will find the shadow of himself and the family from the family presented by the film, and with the end of the family gathering in the film, arousing a series of thoughts.

On the way, a soldier was high-resistant, and his comrades were in urgent rescue.
In addition to the patrol mission, the fighters at the Bazjortan post carry out tactical and physical training every day.
Time passes by minute, the altitude is rising, the oxygen content is getting lower and lower, and the physical overdraft is constantly overdrawing, which test the will of the patrolman.
They gritted their teeth to persist, and in succession crossed several landslides, crossing a few of the emergency beaches.
At 16 o'clock, it was the lunchtime of the patrolmen, who took out their own dry food and sat on the spot at an altitude of more than 5700 meters, accompanied by sleet and snow, and replenish their physical strength with food.
The fighters at the Bahzhokoang post conducted tactical and physical training.
During the rest, they will play cards together, the losers to do push-ups, both entertaining and exercise physical fitness.
After a short break in the cold wind, they climbed the target point of the patrol, took out the flag on the mountain pass, solemnly swearing.
Behind them were snow-capped mountains, and ahead of them were dozens of kilometres of no man's land, and they, the safest guardians of the country.

In the first half of the year, telecommunications network fraud crimes rose by 70% of the top inspection and summary characteristics - China New Network
According to the top inspection website, in the first half of this year, the national procuratorial organs prosecuted 58101 people for fraud crimes, up 35% year-on-year.
In particular, in the crime of obstruction of epidemic prevention and control, fraud crimes are frequent, and the number of procuratorial organs prosecuted fraud crimes accounts for 43.4% of the total number of crimes that hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance, and a total of nine cases involving fraud have been issued in ten typical cases related to epidemic prevention and control.
Judging from the case of the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many names involving fraud crimes, to the national macro policy, and the people's food, clothing and housing, including epidemic-related fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health care products" fraud, "enrolment intermediary" fraud, "routing state subsidy fraud", national asset thawing fraud, etc., constantly "new" new, covering education, medical care, old-age, social security, land acquisition, land demolition, precision poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, not only cause economic and social losses.
In particular, some telecommunications network fraud breaks through the restrictions of national boundaries, regions and personnel, and has characteristics such as party, cross-border, remote, and electronic payment, and is not specific to the victim group and has a lot of harm.
For example, some set up a special company, rent a high-end office building, set up a number of departments or positions, the use of legal network platform publicity, recruitment, training and assessment of recruiters, the use of enterprise operation mode management, wearing "legal veneer", more confusing.
It is incumbent upon the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to issue early warnings to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In judicial cases, the procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only to maintain a high-pressure situation for fraud crimes, but also to refine various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and to promote social governance through the issuance of procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts of the arrest and prosecution of fraud cases, the evidence, the procedures and the law shall apply the customs, and the facts shall be based on the facts, so as to be the same as the rule, so as not to be in vain.
Especially for telecommunications network fraud crimes, pay attention to the central role of electronic data in the identification of facts, and strive to build a chain of evidence that is corroborated between electronic data, speech and word evidence, and documentary evidence.
Such as Zhejiang Province, Ningbo Yinzhou District Procuratorate should handle a case of epidemic-related fraud, the procuratorial organs for the first time to intervene in advance, from the case to the completion, only five days, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle the overall situation from fast and strict management, and maintain the overall stability of the society.
In the examination of the arrest and review and prosecution, pay attention to the prosecution of the case, correct the arrest of 733 people in the public security organs, and correct the omission of the public security organs to review and prosecute the same person 1113 people.
In the first half of the year, the national procuratorial organs issued 298 procuratorial recommendations for fraud crimes, and promoted joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promote deep-seated governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes in the supervision of telecommunications networks in the case of communication enterprises, banks, intermediary organizations, etc., the Guangzhou Procuratorate of Guangdong Province and the Dongguan Municipal Procuratorate made procuratorial recommendations in a timely manner, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision and improve the mechanism to promote the construction of a long-term system.
The fourth is to do a good job in the recovery of stolen property.
Procuratorial organs around the world seize the important links such as intervention in investigation and guidance, review and prosecution, urge the investigation organs to actively recover the stolen money, cooperate with the relevant departments to do a good job in the recovery of stolen property, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
Such as the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate handled by Lin a routine loan case, the case involves 22 suite maternity waiting for seizure, in the case that the real estate may be the first disposal of other cases, the first issued a "suspension execution letter", timely delivery to the relevant court, it is recommended that the previous seizure court on the case involved in the case of temporary execution, after the crime is found in a unified disposal, to recover the property involved, to recover the victim's loss of the best efforts.
The prosecutor reminded everyone that there is a high level of vigilance against fraud crimes, don't expect "the pie in the sky, don't expect the pie in the sky, and don't think that it is cheap and trust, keep your own" money bag ra drabye
Guizhou Province Weining County, the town: the apple tree is short, the road to poverty alleviation-China New Network

The heat is hot, the Economic Daily-China Economic Network reporter walked into the Zhonghai Village in the town of Zhonghai in Weining County, Guizhou Province.
In the hot sun, the villagers Li Yuanzhong hoeed the grass in the base, although the face was sun red, but from time to time in his mouth humming a few small songs.
Weining County, where the town is located, is low in latitude, high altitude, sufficient light, and a large temperature difference between day and night, the apples produced have a high sugar content and good taste, which has a certain popularity in the surrounding area, but also because of the small size and many spots, has not been able to sell a good price, and has not been able to form an industrial scale.
The town was once a poor township with "Baogu taro spring and autumn", and the incidence of local poverty was as high as 25.8% before 10 years ago.
In the critical period of poverty alleviation and decisive victory, it is urgent to change the traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure, and increase the income of farmers.
Chen Chao, party secretary of the town, and a group of people in the town who have visited after many visits believe that the industrial development can no longer take the old road.
To this end, the town introduced leading enterprises and cultivated apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to the town of Shaanxi in 2015 to investigate, and looked at the local planting conditions at a glance, starting from 2016 to planting apple trees in the local area.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees, and the Li Yuanzhong couple made a mutter in their hearts: "I have planted apples for so many years, and I have not seen anyone in the village grow apples made a fortune."
"The apples that are grown are dwarfed apples, and you will not let the apple tree grow too high."
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that this time the apple planting adopted a new method, irrigate the water pipe to each apple tree, water and fertilizer water to the roots of the tree, in the autumn harvest fruit, the tractor directly into the orchard, standing can pick the fruit.
At present, the apple base has gradually entered the fertile period, the market is also as expected by Hou Jianwen, Apple does not worry about selling, popular with Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities consumers.
The growing apple industry has made new changes in Li Yuanzhong's life, and although it is still in the land, there is a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong family has nine acres of land transfer to the apple base, in addition to the land transfer fee guaranteed every year, there are profits after the harvest, the husband and wife usually work in the base, "one person can get 80 yuan per day, year-round work jackah."
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividend of 2800 yuan, plus land transfer fees and the couple's work income, a family income of 80,000 yuan, "eat and wear no worries, the well-off days have been lived as a thousand."
"At present, it has begun to bear fruit, and the annual output value of one acre of apples is more than 1.5 million yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that the town has planted 20,000 acres of apples, only in the village of Zhonghai has 6000 acres, covering 4056 households, 1.72 million people, which covers the poor households of 656 households, 2952 people, the salary of more than 6 million yuan a year, the real realization of the base on the doorstep, working without going outside.
Li Yuanzhong, who is increasingly bulging, has also begun to realize his "wish dragon"
This year's Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle, and now drives a car every day to and from work, "there are more than ten acres of land at home, and so on the next step of the expansion of the apple base, all of which are transferred to them, and the income is more."

Film separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect" - China New Network
Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
Modification of the new hybrid matrix film preparation technology
NewsReports: Recently, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University made significant progress in "memol separation method to capture carbon dioxide", and successfully developed a new type of hybrid matrix film preparation technology, which greatly improved the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
The results have been published as the cover article in the international journal Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem that plagues human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprits of the "greenhouse effect".
How to capture and exploit carbon dioxide emitted by humans efficiently is the focus of scientists.
"Membrane Separation" is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology that separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, with the characteristics of high energy saving and simple operation.
How to make the membrane material "deep breathing", improve the efficiency of gas separation, is the bottleneck of using membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide.
Tianjin University research team innovative ideas, through repeated experiments, to explore the impact of different solvents on the separation of membrane gas.
The results of the experiment show that the production of carbon nanotubes in the membrane material is more uniformly distributed "more breathable", which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of membrane material gas separation.
The mixed matrix membranes prepared with this new technique, and the carbon dioxide separation performance is close to the current theoretical separation limit of such membrane materials.
"The new technology provides new ideas for the membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide."
Li Run, a member of the Center for Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy at Tianjin University, said: "We hope that this technology can provide strong support for the handling of fume gases in future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies, and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions."
Before filling in the voluntary report, I understand what is a professional grade difference - China New Network
2020-07-27 02: 22: 36 Source: Chongqing Morning News Author: Yu Xiao Responsibility Editor: Yu Xiao
Before filling in the voluntary report, you can understand what is a professional grade difference.
Every year, students or parents do not understand the terms involved in the voluntary report, and then affect the voluntary filing.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, five universities jointly issued the 2020 admissions policy and eliminated the professional grade difference.
What does professional grade difference mean, and what is the significance of volunteering?
There are three ways of professional distribution rules.
Experts remind that before filling in the volunteer, we must study the admissions of the school's admissions charter to understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the proportion of transfer, professional distribution rules and so on.
The professional allocation rules, refers to the college after the transfer, for professional admissions mainly have professional priority, score priority, professional grade difference of three ways.
Which method of use by colleges and universities will be clear in the Admissions Charter.
But there are some colleges and universities admission principles that are the total priority, and there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, the admission of candidates in accordance with the total score line, when the score does not reach the first professional volunteer admission score line, it depends on whether the second professional volunteer admission score line, so until the admission to the last professional volunteer, there is no grade difference between professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional grade difference" is that when the college arranges candidates for majors, according to one or more of the values published in the admissions charter, to determine the admission of different professional volunteer candidates, this score is "professional grade difference."
That is, the difference in the scores of the college in the admission of candidates for the first professional and non-first professional volunteer, and the difference in the grade difference of each major volunteer, such as 3 points, 2 points, and 1 points.
For example.
Assume that students Xiaoming applied for the A university, the examination of 560 points, its professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, A university professional admission to the implementation of professional grade difference, grade difference is divided into two points, 1 points, 1 points, 0 points.
In the professional allocation, if Xiaoming's first professional volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and has a planned balance, then Xiao Ming is admitted to "computer science" major; if the computer is not accepted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, according to the score of 558 points and the first professional volunteer examination of candidates for "international trade" sort, determine whether it meets the professional admission conditions; if it is still not satisfied, the third professional volunteer "automated"; if it is still can not meet the fourth major admission;Volunteer, will no longer be reduced, and so on.
Different college professional grade differential settings
With the popularity of parallel volunteers, many colleges and universities have now canceled the professional grade difference, but some colleges and universities have retained this method this method this year, from the "Admissions Charter" published by various schools, this year, more than two decades of universities have set up professional grade differentials.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight School, etc.
In these colleges and universities, the professional grade differential set by each university is different.
Some colleges and universities have grade differentials in each major, such as Ningxia University, the file has been submitted to the school candidates, according to the order of candidates to fill in the professional volunteer order in order of regression by score admission.
Some universities have different professional grade differentials between different majors.
For example, at Jimei University, the total score of the professional volunteer grade is 4 points, that is, the difference between the first professional volunteer and the other professional volunteer level is three points, and the other professional volunteer does not set a grade difference, which is regarded as a parallel volunteer, and the professional volunteer ratio between the professional and the adjustment of the professional level is one.
When filling in the volunteer, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the school, to see if there is a professional grade difference, the form of difference is, in full consideration of the score at the same time, but also reasonable analysis of the selected schools and majors, if the admissions regulations clearly take the score difference mode of admission, candidates in the choice of majors, pay attention to the gradient between the majors, improve the admission probability.
