The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a report on the 26th stating that Iran has begun using advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, further violating the 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers.
According to comprehensive foreign media reports, the IAEA report stated that advanced centrifuges at Iran&#39;s Natanz Nuclear Facility &quot;are accumulating or are preparing to accumulate enriched uranium.&quot;
Since U.S. President Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal and imposed sanctions on Iran in May last year, Iran has been gradually violating the restrictions of the 2015 nuclear agreement with major powers.
The agreement stipulates that Iran can only use first-generation IR-1 centrifuges to refine uranium.

The women&#39;s volleyball team is expected to defend the World Cup ahead of schedule!
On the 27th, in the match against the Dutch women&#39;s volleyball team, the Chinese team was defeated by its opponent after winning two consecutive games, and finally defeated the Netherlands 3:1, ushering in its ninth consecutive victory.
The World Cup schedule is coming to an end. Although the defense of the title is in sight, the Chinese women&#39;s volleyball team still cannot take it lightly when facing the Serbian team.
In the first two games of the match against the Netherlands, the Chinese women&#39;s volleyball team performed as strong as ever, winning the first two games at 25:19 and 25:16 respectively. It was not until the third game that the team encountered a setback.
The Dutch women&#39;s volleyball team increased their aggressiveness in serving when they fell behind. The Chinese team was hit by the first pass. Coupled with the girls&#39; eagerness to attack, their mistakes began to increase. In the end, they were pulled back by their opponents at 21:25.
Lang Ping also pointed out in an interview after the game: &quot;In the third game, we lost about 8 points due to mistakes. &quot;
Of course, the strength of the Dutch women&#39;s volleyball team should not be underestimated. The Chinese women&#39;s volleyball team also made difficult preparations before the game. Although they lost one game, everything was still under Lang Ping&#39;s control. &quot;It&#39;s normal to win or lose when playing against a strong team. Play five games.&quot; It’s normal, so we told the players to focus,” Lang Ping said.
In the fourth game, the players actively adjusted their status. Zhang Changning was full of firepower on the offensive end, scoring 8 points in a single game and making great contributions to the team&#39;s victory.
So far, there are only two rounds left in the 11 rounds of competition. Although the Chinese women&#39;s volleyball team has already touched the championship trophy with one hand, the match against the Netherlands did sound a wake-up call for the Chinese women&#39;s volleyball team: the more critical the moment, the more important it is. The more you have to go all out.
In another match on the 27th, the Russian and American women&#39;s volleyball teams played for five full games. The American team failed to get all three points from their opponents. As a result, as long as the Chinese women&#39;s volleyball team gets all three points against Serbia, they will be able to win. The title can be defended one round ahead of schedule.
All situations are developing in favor of the Chinese women&#39;s volleyball team.
However, although all six main players of the Serbian team are absent this time, this does not mean that they will easily give three points to the Chinese team.
Judging from the current form of the standings, the Serbian team has basically missed the medal, which means that they can &quot;go into battle light&quot; in the match against the Chinese women&#39;s volleyball team, put down their baggage and go all out to attack their opponents, while the Chinese team is burdened with the pressure to win the championship. Instead, there may be ups and downs.
In addition, the Serbian team on the bench is not a lamb that is &quot;allowed to be slaughtered&quot;. In the previous battle with the Dutch team, the two sides fought for 5 games. The Serbian second team finally reversed the Netherlands&#39; full main lineup 3:2, which shows the thickness of its lineup. deep.
Before the start of the third stage of the game, Lang Ping also said that both the Dutch and Serbian teams were difficult to deal with: &quot;The Osaka game will be very difficult. We still have to prepare carefully as always. &quot;
Now that the title defense horn has sounded, the competition has truly entered the &quot;white-hot stage.&quot;
In terms of strength and lineup, the Chinese women&#39;s volleyball team is superior to its opponents. It&#39;s just the last critical moment. It still depends on whether the women&#39;s volleyball girls can perform at a normal level and release themselves on the court.

On September 24, the &quot;Take me with a ticket to see&quot; charity event for the disabled was held in Orange Island, Changsha. More than 100 people with disabilities from Changsha were invited to board the Orange Island Star Cruise to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Xiangjiang River and Celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Most of the more than 100 people with disabilities who participated in this event were boarding a cruise ship for the first time.
56-year-old Zhao Zhengang is a physically disabled person. Due to difficulty in moving his feet, he rarely goes out.
He said: &quot;Today I took a cruise for the first time. I admired the majestic waves of the Xiangjiang River up close and felt the pulse of Changsha&#39;s development. I was very excited and unforgettable. &quot;

The Republic is about to celebrate its 70th anniversary. The spotlights of various media suddenly turn on, making many images that we don&#39;t usually remember shine brightly - it is they who have brought every trace of those shining days to us. Bring heat energy, bring light source...
However, if a hero walks beside you, he may seem ordinary, just like you or me.
Yuan Longping devoted himself to rice research and bred improved seeds for cultivation all over the world, which made more than one billion people no longer in danger of hunger. He has done a great job. He is also like an old farmer who likes to walk in the fields; Nan Ren Dong, the chief scientist who worked hard to make China&#39;s &quot;eyes of heaven&quot; open. He is a person, a whole life, a pot, and only does one thing in his life. He is eating cold steamed buns in the mountains of Guizhou, and he is no different from the old man in the village; Zhou Ruchang, Hongxue Jia, a village boy who was enlightened very late, still looks like a child even when he is old, has learned both Chinese and Western knowledge, has a head of disheveled white hair, talks about knowledge knowingly, and likes to burst into laughter; Qin Yi, who is famous in the movie &quot;Half the Sky&quot; The artist, who is over ninety years old, still travels on the plateau for six or seven hours a day for rehearsals, and is still willing to play an unknown old maid in &quot;The Legend of the Demon Cat&quot;...
They seek benevolence and get benevolence, and live a simple, simple and persistent life. As long as they are immersed in a career that outsiders don&#39;t understand but they cherish, they will easily become happy, without caring about fame, wealth and glory.
Just like in Jin Yong&#39;s novel, the sweeping monk in the Sutra Pavilion of Shaolin Temple, although he has amazing martial arts skills, he is neither ostentatious nor shy, neither happy nor sad.
Behind every &quot;sweeping monk&quot; and every innocent heart, there is a responsibility for the family and country other than myself.
The responsibility for the country lies not only on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the hands of hundreds of millions of people.
Once, the words of a female middle school student were widely circulated by netizens, &quot;When a hero passes by, someone always sits on the roadside and applauds... I don&#39;t want to be a hero, I want to be the person who sits on the roadside and applauds. &quot;
In fact, being a hero and applauding heroes are not contradictory.
People applauding on the roadside are also passing on heat and light, and are themselves luminaries.
Ordinary people like you and me, there are always some opportunities in life, there are some moments, there is a kind of accumulation over time that also shapes the appearance of a hero.
Zou Bihua, an outstanding judge in Shanghai, shoulders the important task of judicial reform, but at the annual meeting, he asked the master of the communication room to tell his story. He sent and received countless newspaper letters in a year without making any mistakes. &quot;Doing simple things well is not simple.&quot; , Zou Bihua led the judges to give applause to this old &quot;sweeping monk&quot;-style transceiver.
This is the sympathy between heroes, it is one hero applauding another hero.
The sweeping monk has the Shaolin Temple Sutra Pavilion, Yuan Longping has the vast rice experimental field, Nan Rendong has the &quot;eye of the sky&quot;, Qin Yi has the stage, Zhou Ruchang has the forum... Whether you can be a hero depends not only on your own efforts, but also on good qualities. environment and positive incentives.
For example, the &quot;Chinese Sky Eye&quot; seems to be a myth now.
In the 1990s, China&#39;s scientific and technological circles were still struggling to climb the ladder, and the novelist Liu Cixin had not yet started writing &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;.
The most powerful &quot;eye&quot; at that time was Arecibo, a single-aperture radio telescope in the valley of the island of Puerto Rico in the United States. With a diameter of 350 meters, it was considered to be the &quot;unsurpassable&quot; largest in the world.
At that time, the diameter of the Chinese radio telescope was less than one-tenth of that of others.
However, Nan Rendong, who enjoyed world-class scientific research conditions and salary in Japan, insisted on returning to China and brought back an almost crazy idea: to build a new generation of radio &quot;large telescope&quot; in China to receive more messages from outer space!
China is full of waste and is waiting for prosperity. Why invest huge sums of money just to play for the stars?
The motherland trusted Nan Rendong, and the &quot;Sky Eye&quot; project was launched with great success.
It took 12 years to select the site, and another 9 years from project establishment to completion.
With the opening of the 500-meter-diameter &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot;, China has completed a large-scale scientific project that has no precedent and is &quot;unique in the world.&quot;
Therefore, the &quot;Eye of the Sky&quot; is amazing, Nan Rendong and others are amazing, and the Republic of China, which is tolerant and has a high vision, is amazing.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, Nan Rendong and others have the opportunity to become the soul of the country and the courage of the people.
There are young talents and white-haired heroes walking by kindly, and people applauding gently on the roadside. This kind of country is very beautiful and harmonious.
Garbage classification education enters Jilin kindergarten for the first time. Environmental protection concept starts from childhood
On the 27th, a kindergarten in Jilin City, Jilin Province conducted a garbage classification education class to teach children to distinguish recyclable garbage from other types of garbage.
It is reported that this is the first time that garbage classification has been introduced into local early childhood education classes.
A few days ago, nine departments in Jilin Province jointly issued the &quot;Jilin Province Work Plan for Promoting the Classification and Treatment of Domestic Waste in Prefecture-Level Municipalities.&quot;
In 2019, based on Changchun City’s pilot program of mandatory domestic waste classification, the province decided to carry out domestic waste classification work in prefecture-level cities.
Jilin City is one of them.
We hope that through this event, we can achieve the effect of using children to drive families and kindergartens to drive society, and advocate the concept of environmental protection.
Liu Lijuan, executive director of Hifaner International Kindergarten, which hosted the event, said.
On the same day, the principal read out an environmental protection initiative, hoping that garbage classification would start from children.
After the children performed the &quot;Low Carbon Beibei&quot; dance, they divided into groups to play a garbage sorting game.
The instructor also distributed &quot;recyclable&quot; and &quot;other garbage&quot; labels and suggested that the children stick the labels to the trash cans and record a short video when they go home.
Liu Lijuan introduced that the kindergarten has always advocated the concept of low carbon and green environmental protection and regularly holds environmental lectures.
There are also sortable trash cans at the garbage disposal areas in the park, with the categories marked on them.

According to preliminary statistics, Jilin Province produced approximately 5.4652 million tons of urban domestic waste in 2018, all of which entered domestic waste treatment plants for processing.
Among them, 3.2929 million tons were sanitary landfill, 2.0923 million tons were incinerated, and 80.1 thousand tons were processed through comprehensive utilization technology.
After years of hard work, all cities and counties in the province have the ability to harmlessly process domestic waste.
The &quot;Jilin Province Work Plan for Promoting the Classification and Treatment of Municipal Domestic Waste at the Prefecture Level&quot; that has been issued clearly requires the in-depth implementation of activities such as introducing garbage classification into campuses, teaching materials, and classrooms, through the creation of garbage classification songs, ballads, comics, micro videos, etc. The works strengthen the interaction between students and parents and achieve the effect of &quot;educating a child, influencing a family, driving a community, and cultivating a new generation.&quot;

Chirac&#39;s political legacy will last forever after his death
On the 26th local time, former French President Chirac passed away suddenly at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, the many political legacies left behind by this French politician when he was in power still deserve our praise.
Chirac served as French president for 12 years in a charismatic manner.
He not only inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of de Gaulleism, but also firmly supported European integration. He was a representative figure in pursuing the &quot;European Dream.&quot;
At the same time, he also strongly advocates world multipolarity and multilateralism, and is a politician with strategic vision.
Because of this, the French media evaluated him as &quot;an outstanding representative of France on the world stage.&quot;
One of Chirac&#39;s most talked-about political decisions was his opposition to the US-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France joined hands with Germany to withstand American pressure and was at the forefront of the anti-war movement.
One year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to an intensification of terrorist activities and make the world more dangerous.
Later facts proved that Chirac&#39;s warning was correct.
At a time when European integration is in hesitation and the unilateralism of the United States is becoming more and more prominent, Chirac&#39;s strategic thinking and decisions on international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly of great enlightenment in retrospect.
Chirac is also a French politician who makes the Chinese people feel familiar and cordial.
He is one of the advocates and creators of the &quot;Golden Decade&quot; of Sino-French relations. After being elected President of France for the first time in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of Sino-French relations with a statesman&#39;s strategic vision.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges between China and France entered a new stage.
During Chirac&#39;s administration, the bilateral trade volume between China and France grew rapidly, and the two countries made breakthrough progress in cooperation in aviation, nuclear energy, railway transportation and other fields.
The China-France Cultural Year initiated by Chirac created a new cultural exchange model in the history of China and France.
Chirac&#39;s lifelong love for Chinese culture is particularly impressive.
According to Chinese diplomats who know him well, Chirac can recite some poems by Li Bai and Du Fu, and can even accurately determine the historical age of Chinese bronzes.
“If you don’t see the pyramids, you haven’t really been to Egypt, and if you don’t see the Qin Terracotta Warriors, you haven’t really been to China.” This golden saying comes from Chirac.
Chirac once said in an exclusive interview with a reporter from Xinhua News Agency: &quot;The West has concerns about China&#39;s political and social development, the ecological problems caused by China&#39;s economic growth, and China&#39;s political status in the world.
But I personally have full confidence in China.
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is enough to help it establish concepts and values to achieve harmonious development and shoulder its own responsibilities on the world stage for a long time. &quot;
I also believe that China&#39;s renaissance will bring new creative vitality to world culture and enrich world culture.
The man has passed away, but the political legacy and inspiration Chirac left to the world will last forever.

Pro-establishment members of the Hong Kong SAR Legislative Council signed a petition to oppose the US bill related to Hong Kong
Some pro-establishment members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region issued a joint statement on the 27th, expressing strong opposition to the passage of the &quot;Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019&quot; by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House and Senate of the United States Congress.
The statement, signed by 40 pro-establishment lawmakers, stated that the rights currently enjoyed by Hong Kong are conferred by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, including maintaining the status of a free trade port and a separate customs territory, in the economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, and culture. , sports and other fields, in the name of &quot;Hong Kong, China&quot;, it trades, cooperates and develops relations with different countries and regions around the world, and signs and implements bilateral and multilateral agreements.
These rights are not conferred by any foreign government or legislative body.
Hong Kong has always strictly abided by international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, conducted business with different countries and regions, and participated in cooperation in many related fields, with remarkable achievements that are obvious to all.
The statement said that the US Senate and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee&#39;s move to pass the relevant bill was unnecessary and was only in response to the call of its agents to cause trouble in Hong Kong, as a means of grossly intervening in Hong Kong&#39;s internal affairs and gaining political chips for its agents in Hong Kong.
Establishment lawmakers deeply regret the move by the US Congress and strongly oppose it.
The statement pointed out that Hong Kong is an important trading partner and the largest source of trade surplus for the United States.
Hong Kong&#39;s excellent rule of law, fair and free business environment, and clean society make it a good choice for American businessmen to do business.
If the U.S. Congress passes this bill, it will not only hit the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself, but also make Sino-U.S. relations worse. It will not benefit anything and will harm others and itself.
The statement stated that Hong Kong will, as always, unswervingly implement the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; policy, continue to enjoy the rights granted by the Basic Law, and earnestly perform its obligations.
No matter in the past, present or future, Hong Kong will continue to make due contributions to the international community and international trade.
According to a report by &quot;European Times&quot; on the 26th, the two houses of the French Parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week.
French President Macron recently stated that France cannot &quot;accept everyone&quot;, but at the same time it must strive to &quot;accommodate properly&quot;.
According to reports, Macron is trying to find a compromise line on immigration matters to slow down the impact of the upcoming debate.
Recently, in an interview during the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Macron expressed his hope for a true &quot;two-pronged&quot; plan on immigration policy to find a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Macron said: &quot;If France wants to be able to accept (immigrants) properly, it cannot accept everyone.&quot;
Macron listed four priorities for immigration policy: grant asylum status to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; promote the integration of immigrants more efficiently; receive and protect all immigrants entering French territory; and resettle those who have entered France illegally and are not suitable to stay more efficiently. people.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the National Medical Assistance (AME) system has been the most discussed topic in the past.
Macron said he hoped to &quot;evaluate&quot; the system but not abolish it, but impose certain restrictions on it.
After Macron made these remarks, Le Pen, the leader of the far-right &quot;National Alliance&quot;, tweeted that Macron&#39;s statement was &quot;empty talk.&quot;
Senate President Raschel, a member of the right-wing Republican Party, also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a &quot;moderate&quot; but &quot;face to reality&quot; manner, indirectly criticizing Macron.
Varao, a member of the left-wing Socialist Party, believes that France should &quot;accept more and better&quot; when it comes to immigration and criticized Macron for &quot;manipulating&quot; this issue.
The report pointed out that the new version of the &quot;Asylum and Immigration Law&quot; has been enacted for a year. It has caused disagreements within the ruling party, but at the same time it has been unable to appease the right-wing opposition parties.
In the next general election in 2022, the topic of immigration policy will once again become the focus of the far-right attack. Macron needs to make a difference on this issue, but at the same time he will risk angering left-wingers within the ruling party.
According to reports, the French National Assembly’s lower house will debate immigration policy from September 30, and the Senate will debate it from October 2.
There are signs that China&#39;s A-shares are ushering in a &quot;buyback wave&quot;, with many listed companies spending &quot;real money&quot; to buy back company shares.
According to statistics from financial data service provider Orient Fortune, as of the 27th, the total amount of repurchases implemented by A-share listed companies in 2019 has exceeded 100 billion yuan (RMB, the same below), far exceeding the data for the same period in previous years, setting a record for A-share stock repurchase funds A record high in volume.
In this regard, Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Maikerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said that the overall valuation of the A-share market this year is low, and repurchasing shares at a relatively low price will help listed companies improve the efficiency of the use of funds, and also reflects The willingness of listed companies to proactively manage market value and their abundant cash flow will help boost investor confidence.
In addition, the continuously improving share repurchase system has also promoted listed companies to actively carry out share repurchases.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued detailed implementation rules for listed companies to repurchase shares, providing listed companies with detailed specifications and guidelines for share repurchases.
According to media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented shareholding increase and repurchase plans are mainly concentrated in the infrastructure industry, real estate industry, information technology industry, and electronic equipment manufacturing industry.
In addition, judging from the amount of repurchase payments, 6 listed companies have repurchase amounts of more than 1 billion yuan this year.
Among them, Yili shares top the list, with a repurchase amount of more than 5 billion yuan.
What impact will stock buybacks by listed companies have on the market?
Zhao Xijun, deputy dean of the School of Finance at Renmin University of China, said in an interview with a reporter from China News Service that buybacks on the one hand show that listed companies have strong economic strength and good financial status, and have the ability to maintain stock price stability, giving investors confidence. On the other hand, it also shows that listed companies and their controlling shareholders are responsible for the company, the market and investors.
The former is based on the company&#39;s good operating performance, while the latter requires listed companies and their controlling shareholders to have higher quality.
For the capital market, these are the core basic elements.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies will help boost investor confidence and support the stock prices of listed companies.
According to Orient Securities research reports, based on the estimated number of stock repurchases set by A-share listed companies since the beginning of this year and the average transaction price of repurchased stocks, the incremental funds that repurchases will bring to the A-share market this year It is expected to exceed 150 billion yuan.
It took nearly two months to restore the large-scale mural &quot;Tianhou&#39;s Holy Relics&quot; in Tianjin&#39;s Tianhou Palace, a key cultural heritage site, on the 26th. It will be reopened to the public during the National Day this year.
&quot;The Holy Relics of the Queen of Heaven&quot; is a large-scale traditional mural that comprehensively reflects Mazu&#39;s life.

It tells more than 30 stories such as the birth of the Queen, crossing the sea on a seat, and her ascension to heaven. 358 The individual characters reproduce Mazu’s life story.
Cai Changkui said that in recent years, Tianjin has been rainy in summer and dry in winter. This &quot;wet and dry&quot; situation has caused the murals to crack, and the cracked parts account for 60% of the entire mural area.
In order to protect and save the murals of Mazu&#39;s deeds, the Nankai District Ancient Culture Street Management Committee and Tianhou Palace in Tianjin launched a restoration project of the main hall of Tianhou Palace and the murals in the palace.

Wang Boxiang, former Secretary of the Shouguang County Party Committee in Shandong Province - a pure heart to strengthen the county and enrich the people - Xinhuanet
Wang Boxiang was born in Shouguang, Shandong Province in February 1943. He started working in 1967 and has successively served as secretary of the township party committee, secretary of the county party committee, and mayor.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang was appointed secretary of the Shouguang County Party Committee in Shandong Province. At that time, Shouguang was a poor county in Weifang.
During the five years he served in Shouguang, Wang Boxiang had a heart for the people and concentrated on doing three things: first, promoting the industrialization of vegetables; second, developing the Shoubei salt-alkali flats; third, laying the foundation for industrial turnaround, allowing Shouguang people to Puff your pockets and straighten your back.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables, and they also have experience in growing vegetables.
In the early 1980s, farmers in Shouguang had a good harvest of vegetables, but they could not sell them and were rotting in the fields.
Wang Boxiang’s research found that the key to grasping vegetables is to improve circulation.
Shouguang took the lead in building a vegetable wholesale market, kicking off the development of a market economy.
Party members and cadres must take the lead. If something goes wrong, the county will bear all the losses.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Boxiang, 17 party members including Wang Leyi of Sanyuanzhu Village built 17 winter-heated vegetable greenhouses. That year, 17 &quot;double-thousand-yuan households&quot; emerged in the village.
Subsequently, a promotion team was set up in the county. Mobilized by Wang Boxiang, Wang Leyi toured various towns and villages to provide guidance; more than 5,000 vegetable greenhouses were promoted in the first year, and then vegetable greenhouses were spread throughout the county and even the country like a prairie fire.
For thousands of years, the 1.6 million acres of land in Shoubei have been composed of salt-alkali shoals and shallow tidal flats.
The life of the local people is very difficult.
Shounan has a vegetable greenhouse, what should Shoubei do?
Wang Boxiang organized hundreds of thousands of people to hold a big battle and camped on the deserted alkali beach for forty or fifty days.
Wang Boxiang and the leading cadres in the county had food and accommodation on the construction site. Like migrant workers, they pushed carts and carried burdens, and slept in the open air. When the people saw them, they gave them thumbs up and admired them from the bottom of their hearts... At that time, Shoubei developed a shrimp pond of 150,000 acres. , 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and a &quot;treasure basin&quot; developed on the saline-alkali tidal flats.
In July 1986, Wang Boxiang attended the Weifang Industrial Conference for the first time as secretary of the county party committee.
During the meeting, a &quot;Comparison Table of Industrial Economic Figures of Twelve Counties and Urban Areas in Weifang City&quot; was issued. At first glance, Shouguang&#39;s total industrial output value is not bad, ranking fourth.
But if the raw salt is removed, Shouguang&#39;s pure industrial output value is only 119 million yuan, ranking third from the bottom.
Wang Boxiang took a group of more than 70 people to study abroad and went to other places to &quot;change their minds.&quot;
Less than a year after returning, the county invested 150 million yuan and launched 77 projects.
Since then, &quot;Learning Groups&quot; have been organized every year to travel to Shenzhen, Dongguan, Shanghai and other places to learn from the teachings.
Shouguang lacks enterprises and even more entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang presided over a special meeting to make the final decision: a public selection of factory directors and managers throughout the county, and 40 &quot;enterprising and capable people&quot; stood out and were promoted to the front line of industry.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the top 100 counties in the country, and Wang Boxiang was transferred to the deputy mayor of Weifang City.
What he left behind are more than 200,000 vegetable greenhouses, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, and shrimp ponds, 4,854 enterprises, more than 100,000 &quot;ten thousand-yuan households&quot;, and a cadre team recognized by the people. The people of Shouguang still affectionately call him &quot;our Secretary Boxiang&quot;.
On September 26, local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi chaired the Foreign Ministers’ Meeting of China and African Members of the Security Council at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
Current African Security Council members Cote d&#39;Ivoire&#39;s Foreign Minister Tano, Equatorial Guinea&#39;s Foreign Minister Oyono, South Africa&#39;s Foreign Minister Pandor, and incoming members Niger&#39;s Foreign Minister Kara and Tunisia&#39;s Foreign Minister Jessinaoui attended the meeting.
Wang Yi put forward four suggestions on strengthening cooperation between China and Africa in the Security Council.
First, strength comes from unity.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism. The direct consequence is that the basic norms of international relations are challenged, the role of the United Nations is affected, and the interests of developing countries and small and medium-sized countries, including African countries, are harmed.
To cope with this challenge, China and Africa need to work hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder. Only through unity can we have strength.
In the Security Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, and the focus is not just on the three votes, but on the entire African continent.
When China and Africa stand together, it will not just be 4 votes, but will lead other countries to follow suit and influence and shape the agenda of the Security Council.
Since 2018, China has established a &quot;3+1&quot; coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council, and we must make full use of this coordination mechanism.
Second, resolve disputes through consultation.
China has always advocated political settlement of hot-spot issues. Africa has a good tradition of consultation and has experience in successful mediation by African regional and sub-regional organizations.
Many complex problems on the Security Council&#39;s agenda, especially hotspots in Africa, are mostly caused by colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.
We must jointly make good use of Chapter 6 of the United Nations Charter and give full play to the role of the United Nations in mediation and mediation.
Third, rely on independence to seek self-improvement.
African countries and people understand Africa&#39;s problems best, and Africa also has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
When dealing with hot-spot issues in Africa, the Security Council should listen to and respect Africa&#39;s wishes, play the role of regional and sub-regional organizations, and encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is willing to strengthen coordination with Africa and firmly promote capacity building for independent peace operations in Africa.
Fourth, rely on development to treat the root causes.
China and African countries are both developing countries. We must insist on putting economic and social development first and support each other&#39;s development paths chosen by each other.
China is willing to closely integrate the joint construction of the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; with the African Union&#39;s Agenda 2063, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the development strategies of African countries, so as to help African countries enhance their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflicts.
We must jointly promote the United Nations to increase investment in African development.
The Ebola epidemic broke out again in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. China has and will continue to provide all-out assistance, providing manpower and material assistance within its capacity. China is also willing to coordinate actions with African countries, mobilize the United Nations, WHO and others to increase assistance and give full play to the United Nations The role of Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The neonatology department and others worked together to save the little life.
thrilling!
The pregnant mother of her second child had an early seizure. On the way to the hospital in a hurry, a 32-week premature baby was eagerly born in the passenger seat of her father&#39;s car.
Fortunately, the obstetrician and neonatologist responded promptly and saved this little life.
Coincidentally, on the 19th, 20th, and 21st, the Obstetrics and Neonatology Department of Hubei Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital received three premature babies born on the road for three consecutive days, and the other two were born in the 120 ambulance. All were premature babies at 29 weeks.
Ms. Cheng is a pregnant mother with her second child. At 7 a.m. on September 19, she felt a little pain in her stomach. Thinking that she was already 32 weeks pregnant and her first child was also premature, she packed up her belongings and prepared to go directly to the hospital after taking a shower. .
After 9:30, Ms. Cheng packed up and asked her husband to drive from his home in Xudong to the hospital.
Unexpectedly, not long after the car drove out of the house, the baby could not wait to be born in the passenger seat of his father&#39;s car.
20 minutes later, Ms. Cheng and her baby finally arrived at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Building of Hubei Maternal and Child Health Hospital.
When the hospital security saw the panicked couple and baby, they immediately notified the obstetrics and delivery room. Four doctors including deputy chief physician Zhang Huan and midwife Liu Yanyan rushed downstairs with the delivery bag and umbilical cord tray.
&quot;At that time, the mother was half-lying on the passenger side of the car, with amniotic fluid and blood underneath her body. A baby boy was next to her, still connected to the umbilical cord. &quot;
Zhang Huan inquired and learned that the baby was a 32-week premature infant. The parents did not have time to wrap the baby during the journey. The early autumn morning was already chilly. His skin was pale from the cold, he did not cry, and his limbs were limp.
Liu Yanyan hurried to the passenger seat to treat the baby&#39;s umbilical cord. Zhang Huan got in from the cab, quickly opened the delivery bag, used the treatment towel inside and the delivery bag wrapping cloth to wrap the baby in several layers to keep warm, and cleared the newborn&#39;s respiratory tract. (As shown in the picture), and then carried the baby to the neonatal department on the 12th floor.
After the neonatology department doctors learned the news, they immediately rushed to the nurse station to rescue the premature baby on the spot.
At that time, the baby&#39;s face turned purple and he was suffocating and hypoxic. The doctor immediately performed a tracheal intubation on him. In less than a minute, the baby&#39;s heartbeat resumed and his skin color gradually returned to rosy. The resuscitation was successful.
After being admitted to the hospital, the 32-week-old baby was put on an invasive ventilator. After continuous rescue, his breathing became stable and he was successfully weaned off the ventilator the next day.
After a week of treatment, the baby&#39;s vital signs are now stable, his breathing is smooth, and he has started to feed a small amount of milk.
Coincidentally, on the 19th, 20th, and 21st, the obstetrics and neonatology departments of the hospital received three premature babies born on the road for three consecutive days. The other two were born in the 120 ambulance, both 29. Zhou&#39;s premature baby is currently being actively treated in the neonatal department.
Sun Guoqiang, director of the obstetrics department of the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital, said that in recent years, the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital has received many babies born on the subway or in private cars. If this situation is not handled well, it may threaten the life safety of the mother and child.
Director Sun reminded that pregnant mothers should come to the hospital immediately if they experience abdominal pain, water rupture, redness, etc.
In case of giving birth at home or on the road, the mother should try to lie on her back as much as possible. She can put a blanket under her buttocks to prevent the baby&#39;s head from hitting the ground after delivery. The baby should be kept warm immediately after delivery and sent to the nearest hospital as soon as possible.

A free throw is worth a maximum of three points?
On the 27th, Beijing time, the NBA Development League announced a trial of new free throw rules. Each free throw is only taken once, and the points are determined by the foul situation.
O&#39;Neal has a very low free throw shooting percentage among NBA stars.
The new rules stipulate that a two-point shooting foul will be worth 2 points, a three-point shooting foul will be worth 3 points, and a foul plus penalty will be worth 1 point.
In the last two minutes of regular time and overtime, the previous free throw rules will apply.
Although this rule will only be implemented in the NBA Development League on a trial basis in the new season, fans are more concerned about what impact it will have on current players if the rule is implemented in the NBA.
At present, many people believe that the new rules may be beneficial to the &quot;bearded&quot; Harden, while James, who is relatively less good at free throws, will &quot;suffer&quot;.
Wuhan promotes the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises with subsidies of up to 20 million yuan
On the 27th, reporters learned from the Wuhan Municipal Government Information Office&#39;s &quot;Praise to New China for the Military World Games&quot; series of city press conferences that since this year, the city has accelerated the transformation of industrial intelligence and implemented transformation subsidies of up to 20 million yuan. measure.

Trudeau&#39;s &quot;personality has collapsed&quot;, can he still be re-elected?
The &quot;big hole&quot; that caused Trudeau to stumble this time was dug out bit by bit by Trudeau himself.
Recently, Canadian media have exposed many old photos of the current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which Trudeau dressed himself as a black man.
This was considered an obvious act of racial discrimination and immediately caused an uproar in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, Canadians don’t buy it very much.
Trudeau shot himself in the foot.
As political commentator Riley and others have pointed out, since the &quot;anti-blackface movement&quot; emerged in the United States, Trudeau and the federal Liberal Party have been high-profile in accusing the opposition or dissidents within the party of &quot;making major mistakes&quot; in this regard. &quot; and repeatedly threatened that &quot;whoever makes this mistake should be fired immediately.&quot;
To put it simply, the &quot;big hole&quot; that tripped Trudeau out of trouble this time was exactly what Trudeau dug out bit by bit.
Trudeau is the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. He is young and handsome. When he first debuted, he became a &quot;political idol&quot;.
Originally a &quot;political amateur&quot;, after taking over as leader of the federal Liberal Party, he fought an unexpectedly good battle in the 2015 Canadian federal legislative election - the federal Liberal Party won more than half of the seats in the federal House of Commons and gained the precious right to form a separate government. .
At that time, Trudeau proposed many inspiring political platforms and concepts, such as &quot;ethnic and gender equality&quot;, &quot;ecological environmental protection&quot; and &quot;economic revitalization&quot;, and emphasized the elimination of corruption and &quot;unhealthy practices&quot;.
However, in the five years since he took office, he has failed to make ends meet in almost all the above-mentioned aspects.
Take the issue of &quot;ethnic and gender equality&quot; as an example. Putting aside this &quot;blackface&quot; incident, he has previously paid lip service to a series of issues related to aboriginal people, which has made it difficult for aboriginal groups and leaders to establish a country in Canada. On the 150th anniversary, the protest tent was moved to the gate of the Capitol.
In terms of eradicating corruption, at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, Trudeau was involved in the highly publicized &quot;Lavalin incident.&quot;
It was revealed that he put pressure on the departments and officials responsible for the investigation and asked the latter to &quot;show their favor&quot; in a major violation of laws and regulations and malpractice at the construction engineering company &quot;Lavalin&quot; in his hometown.
Moreover, when the matter escalated, Trudeau turned his anger on the official who disclosed the fraud—the aforementioned Wang Chaudi was the first to disclose the fraud and the then Attorney General of Canada who directly handled the case.
Although there are still doubts about the case itself, the suspicion is difficult to eliminate.
Many observers pointed out that the collapse of Trudeau&#39;s personality during the five years he was in power was mainly caused by his own &quot;digging holes&quot;, and the biggest &quot;holes&quot; are &quot;anticlimactic&quot;, &quot;reaping one&#39;s own consequences&quot; and &quot;being lenient in disciplining oneself but strict in disciplining others&quot;. Three.
Canada&#39;s most authoritative Angus Read poll data shows that since 2015, the number of respondents who support Trudeau has dropped from more than 60% to more than 30%, while those who oppose him have soared from less than 30% to 60%. %above.
Although other opposition parties and their leaders have also performed poorly, even a considerable number of voters who are still willing to vote for the federal Liberal Party now disapprove of the personality of the federal prime minister and leader of the ruling party.
On October 21, the new Canadian federal legislative election is about to begin. Can Trudeau repeat his resounding victory five years ago?
The answer may be one word: difficult.
Whether it is from the perspective of corporate competition, consumer experience, or regional aviation integration and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration, it has far-reaching impact and positive significance.
On September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially opened to flights.
A reporter from the Beijing News learned from the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission that the Capital Airport is already in a super-saturated operation state, and the opening of Daxing International Airport will enhance the Capital’s aviation service capabilities.
After Shanghai, Beijing has become the second city in my country to have two airports in the same city. Similar to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, which mainly serves domestic aviation affairs, and Pudong Airport, which mainly serves international aviation, the Capital Airport and Daxing Airport will also operate in the future. Serve the differentiated positioning of different domestic and international aviation businesses and provide more segmented services.
The opening of Daxing Airport will have a more positive impact on Capital Airport from a business development perspective.
The passenger throughput of Capital Airport exceeded 100 million in 2018, ranking first in the country. However, compared with the rapidly growing business demand, there is still a significant capacity gap, especially there is a large gap in demand for international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passengers for tourism and business trips, and to adapt to the urban development trend of Beijing becoming increasingly open and in line with international standards, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub airport, and plans to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million passengers, cargo and mail throughput in the future The volume is 4 million tons.
Therefore, the positioning of the two airports does not overlap, they each target different customer groups, and both have sufficient market space.
From an economic account level, the opening of Daxing International Airport will obviously create a win-win effect, easing the tight situation in Beijing’s aviation capacity, accelerating the growth rate of passenger and cargo throughput, and creating an incremental cake for Capital Airlines’ dual-core operations.
From a user perspective, with the opening of Daxing International Airport, travel in the future does not have to be concentrated at the Capital Airport. It can also reduce a series of problems caused by over-concentration of routes, such as longer transit guarantee time and slower passenger boarding speed. , which indirectly increases the detention time of aircraft and passengers at the airport and increases the burden on airport operations. By reducing the shipping burden at Capital Airport, it actually improves the travel experience of passengers.
According to media calculations on the time and cost of various transportation routes to large international airports, if you start from the South Fifth Ring Road and take the Beijing-Kaifeng Expressway and go directly to the Daxing Airport Expressway, you can get there in 50 minutes by car, and the gas cost is about 40 yuan for a round trip, and the expressway fee 15 yuan; if you choose the rail transit subway Daxing Airport Line, the distance is limited to 20 kilometers or 30 kilometers according to the distance, and the fares are divided into three levels: 10 yuan, 25 yuan, and 35 yuan; citizens can also take the Beijing-Xiongan intercity bus from Beijing It only takes more than 20 minutes from West Railway Station to Daxing Airport Station.
Generally speaking, citizens have a variety of transportation options to choose from to go to Daxing Airport, and the cost and time are also within a reasonable range.
From the perspective of trend development: Daxing Airport is positioned as a transportation hub in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, so it is slightly far away from the urban area of Beijing. However, it has strengthened its radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, making it easier for more people to travel, and it will stimulate the economy of Hebei and Tianjin. Development is of great significance.
In the future, passengers from Hebei and Tianjin can enjoy more international air route services provided by Daxing International Airport, which is evident from the transportation planning of Daxing Airport.
The supporting transportation facilities of Daxing Airport are very complete. In addition to the new airport line directly from Beijing city to Daxing Airport, there are also a number of expressways connecting Daxing Airport and surrounding areas.
Just like passengers from cities such as Dongguan, Foshan, and Qingyuan in Guangdong can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport through the Guangzhou-Foshan Expressway and Guangzhou-Shenzhen Expressway, residents in Langfang, Xiongan New Area and other places around Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport and obtain convenient and efficient aviation services. Serve.
It can be seen from this that the opening of Daxing International Airport is not just about adding a few runways and a few planes, whether it is from the perspective of corporate competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration, and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration It has far-reaching impact and positive significance at all levels. It is not only related to the long-term layout and development of Beijing&#39;s shipping industry, but also provides diversified travel choices for the majority of residents in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, promotes the further improvement of the service quality of Beijing&#39;s shipping industry, and is more conducive to the promotion of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei It is hoped that the integrated development process of Hebei will stimulate the economic and trade development of the areas surrounding Daxing Airport.
Therefore, regarding the navigation of Daxing Airport, we must not only consider the small accounts of individuals economically, but also the big accounts of overall development.

The 2019 Vietnam Economic and Social Issues Forum was held in Thua Thien Hue Province
Nguyen Duc Kien, deputy director of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, revealed that at the beginning of this year, Vietnam’s economic and social development showed many new improvements and continued to maintain a growth trend.
The forum focused on the prominent economic and social issues in the first few months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development at the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the forum, participating representatives discussed the economic development in 2019 and the impact of some free trade agreements, some outstanding issues in Vietnam’s economy in 2019, outstanding issues in Vietnam’s society and culture in 2019, and predictions and suggestions for Vietnam’s economic and social development in 2020. In-depth exchange of opinions and views on 4 topics.
Representatives generally believed that in the first few months of 2019, global economic growth slowed down and risks and challenges increased.
Trade frictions among major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has determined that although the global economy is full of uncertainties, with 70% of the world&#39;s economies stagnating, Vietnam&#39;s economic development has still achieved many gratifying achievements, with the macroeconomy operating smoothly and inflation effectively under control. , the consumer price index increased by an average of 2.64% in the first half of 2019, the lowest growth rate in the past three years.
GDP growth in the first half of 2019 was 6.76%. Although it was lower than the 7.05% in the same period last year, the growth rate was still relatively high compared with the same period in the 2011-2017 period.
When predicting Vietnam&#39;s economic development trend in 2019-2020, Deputy Director of Vietnam&#39;s National Economic and Social Forecasting Center Dang Duc Anh said that against the backdrop of world economic turmoil, Vietnam&#39;s economy will show a high growth momentum in 2019.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam&#39;s macro-economy will continue to remain basically stable. The implementation of various free trade agreements will boost trade development, and economic structural adjustment and business environment improvement will be further strengthened. Due to the impact of trade frictions, Vietnam&#39;s external export activities will show a downward trend.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring, forecasting and early warning mechanism, proactively seek trade relief measures for Vietnam’s export commodities, look for opportunities to expand new export markets, and create convenience for the export of various commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, the inflation rate should be controlled at a reasonable level to promote the development of auxiliary industries and support the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture, ecological agriculture, etc.

Witness the ten-year &quot;cloud rise&quot; of digital China in Yunqi Town - Xinhuanet
If we take the local website forum in 2009 as the starting point, the 2019 Yunqi Conference held in Hangzhou from the 25th to the 27th has passed a full decade.
From a &quot;cloud-based&quot; concept to the practice of &quot;going to the cloud&quot;, big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies supporting China&#39;s economic development, social management, and public services in 10 years.
At Chint New Energy&#39;s photovoltaic cell workshop in Haining, Zhejiang, a new &quot;colleague&quot; equipped with Alibaba Cloud artificial intelligence has recently been added to the quality inspector&#39;s side.
It operates 24 hours a day, its recognition speed is more than twice that of manual work, and its quality inspection accuracy is stable at over 95%.
According to the person in charge of the company, this &quot;quality inspector&quot; with a camera has intensively studied more than 40,000 defective samples. With the cloud computing power behind it, it can quickly convert infrared images into binary language to detect defects. The battery cells are placed in categories.
This company is just a microcosm of how cloud computing is helping the transformation of manufacturing today.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the &quot;Implementation Guidelines for Promoting Enterprise Cloud Migration (2018-2020)&quot;, proposing that by 2020, we will strive to achieve a significant increase in enterprise cloud awareness and enthusiasm, and significantly increase the proportion and application depth of cloud migration.
Wang Jian, founder of Alibaba Cloud, said that today, data-centered cloud computing has built a bridge and opened up a way for the digital economy where data is a key element.
At the same time, over the past 10 years, the scale of my country&#39;s cloud computing industry has also continued to expand.
The &quot;Cloud Computing Development White Paper (2019)&quot; released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology in July this year shows that China&#39;s overall cloud computing market size reached 96.28 billion yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2% compared with 2017.
In addition to becoming a key technology that supports industrial transformation and the development of the digital economy, the invisible and intangible &quot;cloud&quot; has also unknowingly changed urban management and social life.
At this year’s Yunqi Conference, the “Urban Brain” that has been unveiled for three consecutive years still attracts attention.
According to Alibaba Cloud, City Brain has now transformed from a traffic management tool into an urban management center, and related cooperative applications have been expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, and the powerful computing power of the city brain, new urban management service functions such as &quot;park first and pay later&quot;, &quot;real-time perception of the number of doctors&quot; and &quot;tourist route design&quot; can be realized.
In the field of government services, &quot;one cloud&quot; is used to connect &quot;one thing&quot; and &quot;handheld office&quot; and &quot;handheld services&quot; are collaboratively promoted. Cloud computing brings convenience to both ends of the supply of government services.
At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform for the entire province through the cloud migration of government affairs.
As of September 11, this platform has covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province, and has collected and managed 19.08 billion pieces of data in 3,066 categories.
The average number of data calls and shares between government departments in Zhejiang Province has reached 12 million times per month. Each additional call and flow of data on the &#39;cloud&#39; may mean less errands for the public to do.
Be careful about using plastic tea bags to make tea!
According to the &quot;Central News Agency&quot; report, a recent Canadian study found that a bag of plastic tea bags may release billions or even tens of billions of plastic particles, which is significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastics a person ingests throughout the year. But so far there is no evidence that ingesting plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
According to reports, researchers from Magill University in Canada found that when a plastic tea bag is immersed in a cup of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius), the tea bag will release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles. in the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than the amount of microplastics a person is estimated to ingest in an entire year.
According to research published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles every year and inhales the same amount of microplastics.
It is reported that this study was published in the &quot;Journal of Environmental Science and Technology&quot;. The researchers tested 4 different types of plastic commercial tea bags in stores and cafes in Montreal. They opened the tea bags, washed the tea bags and immersed them in almost boiling water for 5 minutes. , and then analyzed using an electron microscope and spectrometer.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, &quot;several levels higher than previous plastic loads from other foods.&quot;
According to reports, most tea bags are made of natural fibers, but many tea bag brands that use natural fibers still use plastic to seal them.
Some brands of tea bags no longer use paper and instead use plastic, and these plastic tea bags were the subjects of the researchers&#39; tests.
Microplastics are tiny fragments of plastic. Researchers define the size of these microplastics as ranging from 100 nanometers to 5 millimeters. They are mainly produced by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in the air, soil, rivers and deepest ocean trenches around the world, and they can also be found in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
In October 2018, researchers first discovered plastic particles in human fecal samples from several countries in different regions of the world.
To test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from tea bags, the Canadian research team put water fleas into contaminated water and found that microplastics affected the behavior of these water fleas and caused them to develop developmental abnormalities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence so far that ingesting plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO noted that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and what impact they have on humans.
Researchers speculate that the reason why these tea bags release a large amount of plastic particles may be that these plastic tea bags come into contact with boiling water. Even &quot;food grade&quot; plastic may decompose or leak toxic substances when heated to above 40 degrees Celsius.
Guterres said the climate emergency is the biggest threat to the survival of small island nations.
There, a natural disaster can erode a generation&#39;s worth of development gains.
The disasters in Barbuda, the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas, which have been hit by hurricanes this year, illustrate this point.
About a quarter of the people in small island developing states live at an altitude of 5 meters or less.
Relocation may seriously affect their society and way of life, and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
Small island nations are once again leading the world in the right direction when they join forces at Monday&#39;s Climate Action Summit to commit to becoming carbon neutral and 100% renewable by 2030.
Guterres said: “The climate crisis is piling new injustices on top of old ones.
Although small island developing countries contribute only a small amount to global warming, they pay the highest price.
Due to their middle-income status, many countries are also trapped in an accelerating and unsustainable cycle of disaster and debt.
The world must act. Now is the time to make big decisions and invest heavily in small island developing states. &quot;
Today&#39;s high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and transition to renewable energy; urging international agencies to help small island developing States Countries, especially heavily indebted middle-income countries, receive funding.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the oceans, the lifeline of the planet.
The latest special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released this week, confirms that oceans are already suffering &quot;sweeping&quot; severe consequences of the climate crisis.
By mid-century, many regions may experience annual levels of extreme sea level rise that would otherwise only occur once a century.
The report warns that without significant investment in adaptation, some island nations are likely to become uninhabitable.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have taken a huge toll.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the past 40 years.
The demands of industry, shipping, mining and tourism are reducing resources, including the fisheries that sustain many island communities.
Small island states also face high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They rely heavily on some external market, making them subject to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also grappling with the security implications of illicit trafficking in people, weapons and drugs.
&quot;By solving a problem in the most challenging environments, it can be solved anywhere,&quot; Guterres said.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons and examples that the world can learn from. &quot;
He emphasized that small island developing countries are special cases of sustainable development.
They require long-term attention and investment from the entire international community.
India&#39;s finance ministry said there was sufficient liquidity in the financial system.
Indian Finance Minister Sitharaman said on the 26th that there is currently sufficient liquidity in the financial system. Driven by holiday consumer demand, India&#39;s economic growth is expected to recover in the second half of this fiscal year.
Sitharaman made the above statement after holding a meeting with representatives of Indian private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks and other institutions.
Sitharaman did not elaborate on the specificity of these remarks.
Some Indian and overseas media have previously attributed India&#39;s current economic slowdown to tight liquidity in non-bank financial institutions.
Sitharaman cited the decline in car sales as an example and denied that tight liquidity was the main reason for the decline in sales.
Sitharaman pointed out that the decline in automobile sales was mainly due to cyclical factors.
Sitharaman predicts that India&#39;s economic growth may recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by festive consumption.
India&#39;s annual shopping season starts in September and will last until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping consumption will greatly promote India&#39;s economic growth.

“It is estimated that overage migrant workers account for more than half of the workers on some construction sites.
Where to find young workers now?
We don&#39;t want to use so many &#39;old people&#39; on the construction site, there is no other way. &quot;
Recently, Zou Kui, who has been working as an engineering contractor in the construction industry for many years, lamented the fact that there are many overage migrant workers (over the retirement age) on construction sites.
Recently, the university where the author works has carried out a rainwater and sewage diversion project, and many migrant workers have appeared on campus. If you pay attention, you will find that there are many overage migrant workers here.
Overage migrant workers go out to work not because they “can’t have time”, but because they “can’t have time” and have the helplessness and hardship of “having to do this” – whether they are saving money to solve their own pension and medical problems, or to support their children. It drives these old people who should have been &quot;free&quot; to continue to work hard.
It is not as easy as we think for over-age migrant workers to have a place of support in old age.
Raising children, supporting the elderly, providing education for children, helping children build buildings and buy cars, helping children start a family and start a business, and raising grandchildren across generations, when these migrant workers have completed their &quot;life tasks&quot;, their pockets have been emptied and they even have a lot of debt. , most of them lack wealth accumulation.
In order not to hinder their children and to accumulate more wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insist on &quot;working until they can&#39;t work anymore.&quot;
Many new generation migrant workers born in the 1980s, 1990s and even 00s are unwilling to engage in the secondary industry or low-end service industry with difficult conditions and high labor intensity, resulting in a structural &quot;labor shortage&quot;. These lack of Attractive jobs provide opportunities for over-age migrant workers.
Due to lack of skills and reduced physical function and labor ability, many over-age migrant workers are doing jobs that are intensive, low-income, high-risk, and have little security.
The more work you can do, the more you can earn. The survival plight of over-age migrant workers behind the &quot;no idleness&quot; cannot be ignored or ignored.
Solving the problems of wage arrears and wage demands, improving labor protection, reducing safety risks, increasing labor income, and improving the living conditions of overage migrant workers, in addition to their &quot;self-salvation&quot;, are also inseparable from the institutional protection and humanistic care of the public sector.
Some scholars point out that over-age migrant workers are no longer able to rely on returning home to farm to solve their own pension and medical problems. They must find other ways to support their families.
Understanding the helplessness and strength of over-age migrant workers who “cannot be idle” will help us better understand the love and pain of over-age migrant workers.
Seeing the backs of over-age migrant workers, hearing their sighs, and finding ways to make them truly &quot;have someone to support themselves in old age&quot; when they return to the countryside requires the public sector, market and society to share responsibilities in a positive interaction, and requires the joint efforts of many parties.
Chemezov said that Russia will not export such systems in the next five years because &quot;it must first supply its own army, and only then will export production take place.&quot;
This approach is fully in line with international practice.
Major producers of weapons and military equipment always first secure their own defense needs before processing export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Glekhov, deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian Aerospace Forces, said that development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system is developed by the &quot;Adamantine-Antey&quot; air and space defense company.
This is a new generation air defense system that uses working principles designed to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main function of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, and can intercept missiles with a range of less than 3,500 kilometers.
In addition, according to some information, the S-500 can also destroy hypersonic cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles exceeding 5 times the speed of sound, and even targets located in near space.
This weapon can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defense systems, especially the S-400 system, which is very important from a national defense perspective.
Sergei Chemezov expressed special concern for the S-400.
The system is currently in great demand around the world, but the Russian military also needs it, including in the Arctic, he said.
The S-400 air defense system enters service with the Arctic Air Defense Regiment.
According to news on September 15, the work of modifying the S-400 air defense missile system by the Novaya Zemlya Arctic Air Defense Regiment has been completed.
This is not Russian militarization of the Arctic.
The Russian Ministry of Defense stated that this is entirely a process within the transition plan to more advanced defense tools in the northern strategic direction.
The press service of the Russian Northern Fleet said: &quot;With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controllable airspace in the Arctic has significantly increased. &quot;
Very importantly, the military assesses that the system has been successfully used in the Far North and Arctic regions.
The officers and soldiers of the air defense regiment conducted training on the new system and were ready to enter combat duty.
Previously, the S-300 long-range air defense system was equipped there, and part of it is still retained.
When it comes to air defense systems, they must have weapons that can destroy all kinds of air targets, whether they are targets flying at high speeds at outer altitudes or &quot;fish that slip through the net&quot; approaching the protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system developed by the Golden Diamond-Antey Air and Space Defense Consortium is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other air attack weapons.
This weapon can attack aerodynamic targets at a range of 400 kilometers and shoot down ballistic targets traveling at 4.8 kilometers per second at a distance of 60 kilometers.
Russia has never hidden that it will deploy additional air defense forces in the Far North to ensure airspace security along the Northern Sea Route.
Not long ago, the first batch of 12 &quot;Tor-M2DT&quot; air defense missile systems was delivered to the Russian Arctic. They are enough to form an air defense battalion to strengthen the air defense system in the Arctic.
The Russian Ministry of Defense stated at that time that the Arctic &quot;Thor&quot; force would be expanded to a complete brigade-level organization in the future.
Together with the newly deployed S-400 long-range systems on Novaya Zemlya and the Kola Peninsula and the &quot;Pantsir-SA&quot; short-range systems deployed in the Far North, these advanced air defense weapons effectively defend Russia&#39;s polar skies.
Enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles will have a hard time penetrating this defense.
According to the Russian government&#39;s ideas, the flagship store will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place their products, avoiding the complicated and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
As a Russian goods store operator, Rupinduo Company focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
Erpinduo has online stores on China&#39;s largest trading platforms such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, ShouQ, and the multi-functional instant messaging software Wechat, and has It has its own online platform Epinduo.com and Russian commodity retail chain stores.
The Russian Export Center will work with Russia Pinduo to formulate store marketing strategies and participation criteria, and select companies with products to put on virtual shelves.
The store plans to open before the end of this year and stock products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to data from the Russian Export Center, the total monthly visits to Chinese e-commerce platforms are as high as 1 billion.
At the same time, food exports to China have been showing steady growth since 2014 and exceeded US$1 billion in 2018.
Currently, Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of its global import strategy.
According to Alexey Kozhevnikov, the new store will display products from companies with sales of at least 500 million rubles.
To be honest, my expectations were higher, sales of 500 million rubles are not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers have a very positive attitude towards Russian products and regard our products as high-quality and green and environmentally friendly products. &quot;
Competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and intensifying, Kozhevnikov said.
&quot;We have an ambitious goal of launching 500 businesses through this store within three years,&quot; he said.
At the same time, the platform will also list products from companies in the Russian Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor at the Department of Fundamentals of Trade Policy at the Plekhanov University of Economics in Russia, said: “This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian Export Center is a state-owned rather than a private institution.”
&quot;I don&#39;t see a lot of competitive Russian products on the market. &quot;
He believes that the project will probably not be implemented, but will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to RIA Novosti, President of the Russian Export Center Andrey Slepnev said during the Eastern Economic Forum that product information of more than 170 Russian companies has been published on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform. Published on and available for purchase in China or other countries.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, namely a training program for Russian companies by experts from Taobao University, the first seminar of which was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Center will also serve as the organizer of industry exhibitions and commercial projects for Russian companies at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November this year.
A large-scale exhibition will be held in the 1,000-square-meter exhibition hall, which will also become a center for business project activities, agreement signing ceremonies, promotion meetings and meetings with representatives of Chinese companies.
About 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
&quot;In addition to the agricultural exhibition stand, we will certainly hold business meetings, arranging direct contacts between entrepreneurs,&quot; the press service of the Russian Export Center said.
“This is another direction in which we are working to support businesses and secure dozens of dedicated meetings for them. ”
In addition, the expo will also host master classes, cooking competitions and Russian food tastings cooked by famous Russian chefs under the &quot;Exploring Russian Food on the Shanghai Station&quot; project.
After the coroner&#39;s court ruled on Friday that the cause of death was not accidental, the police are waiting for a complete report and instructions from the Attorney-General&#39;s Chambers before taking the next step.
Datuk Huzir of the National Police Criminal Investigation Department issued a statement on Friday saying that based on the coroner&#39;s court&#39;s ruling, the police will await further instructions from the Attorney-General&#39;s Chambers.
In his statement, he stressed that the police had never closed the investigation into Mohd’s murder and that the investigation was still ongoing.
On the other hand, Selangor Chief Police Officer Noor Azam said that the police will wait for a complete report on the relevant rulings before taking action.
He responded this way when asked about the matter after attending the handover ceremony of the Selangor Deputy Chief Constable at the Selangor Police Headquarters on Friday morning.

When does the next bus come?
&quot;Internet + Smart Stop Sign&quot; lets you know what&#39;s going on.
On the 27th, Nanjing Smart Transportation and Amap announced that the first batch of &quot;Internet + smart stop signs&quot; in the country has officially landed in Nanjing. By then, 54 electronic bus screens will be lit in Nanjing. This move will comprehensively upgrade Nanjing&#39;s information service level. , improve the efficiency of public transportation services and the happiness of people traveling.
In the past, the anxious scene of waiting for the bus was performed at bus stops almost every day.
It is difficult to predict the running time of buses, and it is difficult to know the bus conditions and vehicle locations along the way. The pain points of bus travel need to be solved urgently. Especially in some big cities, long commuting distances and complex traffic conditions during morning and evening peak hours make it difficult to guarantee the punctuality of buses.
To this end, Nanjing Smart Transportation has joined hands with Amap to explore the new direction of &quot;Internet + Transportation&quot; convenience services and launch the first batch of &quot;Internet + Smart Stop Signs&quot;, an intelligent service project in the country.
It is reported that the first batch of &quot;Internet + smart stop signs&quot; in the country has been launched in Nanjing. It integrates AutoNavi big data and AutoNavi&#39;s vehicle estimated travel time ETA algorithm, and relies on bus electronic stop signs, mobile Internet, and transportation big data upgrades to achieve &quot;Smart bus stop signs + electronic maps&quot; have the ability to publish bus routes, estimated bus arrival times, etc. on both ends.

Xinhua Commentary: Unswervingly follow our own path
The white paper &quot;China and the World in the New Era&quot; released on the 27th gives the answer: Over the past 70 years, the fundamental reason for China&#39;s success in development is that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the correct development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and followed this path. Go down this road unswervingly.
It is the choice of history and the people for China to follow a development path that suits itself.
Since modern times, in an environment of poverty, weakness, internal and external troubles, generations of people with lofty ideals have been exploring and searching for a way to save the country and the people.
However, &quot;Constitutional monarchy, restoration of the monarchy, parliamentary system, multi-party system, and presidential system have all been thought about and tried, but none of them work. &quot;
It was not until the Communist Party of China and New China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The path China has taken is the path to happiness for the Chinese people, the path to rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the path to common development between China and other countries in the world.
It is precisely because it is on the right path that China can handle its own affairs well, become the world&#39;s second largest economy, the country that contributes the most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As the white paper points out, China&#39;s development path is in line with China&#39;s national conditions and adapts to the requirements of the times. It will increasingly show brighter development prospects as the times advance.
Looking back on the past, the Chinese people know how difficult it is to find a correct path; looking around the world, the Chinese people cherish this correct path even more.
Chinese people understand the principle of oranges in the south and tangerines in the north. They understand that what is suitable for others may not be suitable for themselves, and only what is suitable for themselves is the best.
It is precisely with this kind of road confidence and strategic determination that China has created a miracle that has attracted worldwide attention.
In the tortuous process of human progress, the &quot;end of history theory&quot; once became famous.
Today, the success of the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics has announced the end of the &quot;end of history theory&quot;, the collapse of the &quot;China collapse theory&quot;, and the failure of the &quot;socialist failure theory&quot;.
China&#39;s success has boosted the confidence of developing countries in achieving national prosperity and strong people, expanded the path for developing countries to modernize, and enabled those countries and nations in the world that both hope to accelerate development and maintain their independence to take the path that suits their national conditions. The road provides experience and reference.
The world is colorful.
China has always respected the right of all countries to choose a development path that suits their own national conditions.
China does not &quot;import&quot; foreign models, nor does it &quot;export&quot; the Chinese model. Instead, it will unswervingly follow its own path, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen exchanges on state governance with other countries, and make due contributions to the common realization of good governance. contribute.
A Foodworks supermarket boss has been slammed as &quot;disgraceful&quot; after the Fair Work Commission found he fired a 66-year-old female worker via text message because he preferred to hire staff from Asian backgrounds. .
The commission said the way Ms Gail Ayton&#39;s boss, Jianbin Wang, known as Eddie, who has worked at the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, treated staff &quot;grossly unfairly&quot; and may have breached anti-discrimination laws.
Ms Ayton told the committee that Mr Wang, who took over the store in 2016, had been &quot;trying to fire me&quot; because she was not Chinese.
In the case, commission deputy chairman Peter Sams conducted an internet search and found &quot;a number of recruitment advertisements posted by Mr Wang in the past on various Chinese-Australian employment forums&quot;.
Among the job requirements listed for these positions, one said &quot;Asian ladies preferred&quot; and another said &quot;Asian employees preferred.&quot;
A third post said he &quot;prefers overseas people (sic)&quot;.
Mr Wang fired Ms Ayton via text message in April this year, later claiming it was due to her absence from work and a small amount of cash ranging from $5.10 to $30 that was allegedly missing from the cash register.
But Mr Sams said Mr Wang&#39;s reasons for sacking Ms Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
She had only missed one shift in three years, and the &quot;missing amount&quot; totaled a few dollars.
He said Ms Ayton&#39;s dismissal had &quot;in fact nothing to do with her conduct or performance&quot;.
He said: &quot;In my view, supported by the evidence of the recruitment advertisement posted by Mr Wang, the respondent&#39;s real motive for dismissing her was his preference to employ staff with an Asian background.
Mr Wang&#39;s conduct prima facie constituted a breach of anti-discrimination laws and/or the applicant&#39;s dismissal was unlawful under section 772(f) of the Fair Work Act. &quot;
Mr Sams said given Mr Wang&#39;s &quot;appalling&quot; treatment of Ms Ayton it would be inappropriate for him to consider reinstating her.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton, who was a casual worker earning $26 an hour.
In light of the potential breaches of anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation, Sams said he would refer his findings and documents to the commission&#39;s supervisor to consider whether Mr Wang&#39;s conduct should be referred to another agency to investigate possible breaches of state or federal law. the behavior of.
He said Mr Wang did not give Ms Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
He said: &quot;In my opinion, the respondent adopted a hopelessly unfair and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant, with Mr Wang &#39;waiting&#39; for this opportunity which he believed would &#39;justify&#39; the termination of the applicant&#39;s employment. Legitimate. &quot;
&quot;He was wrong... the respondent&#39;s complete disregard to accord the applicant any natural justice in dismissing her was shockingly disrespectful and grossly unfair.&quot;
Mr Sams said that while Foodworks was a small business, &quot;it must be said frankly that no decent employer would dismiss employees in the grossly unfair and perfunctory manner admitted in this case.&quot;
He said: &quot;This is disgraceful and extremely unfair.&quot;

Walking with the Motherland - Sketch of a certain formation of the Armed Police Force
In the golden autumn, at the military parade training ground, a certain formation of the Armed Police Force composed of officers and soldiers with an average height of 1.83 meters was busy training.

The world&#39;s oldest barber dies at 108 after cutting hair for 96 years
In New York, USA, there is Anthony Mancinelli, the oldest barber in the world certified by Guinness World Records. At 108 years old, he has never retired and diligently cuts hair for his clients every day. However, on the 19th, Mancinelli was diagnosed with a chin injury.

The scale of buybacks by listed companies during the year exceeded 100 billion yuan, a record high - Xinhuanet
In order to stabilize the company&#39;s stock price and maintain the company&#39;s image, listed companies have begun to frequently repurchase shares in the past two years. Through targeted repurchases, collective bidding transactions, etc., they hope to convey the information that the company&#39;s value is undervalued to the market, thereby stabilizing the stock price and enhancing Investor confidence.
Oriental Fortune Choice data shows that the funds used by listed companies to repurchase shares in 2017 were 7.9 billion yuan, which surged to 51 billion yuan in 2018. Since 2019, the total amount of repurchases implemented by A-share listed companies has exceeded 100 billion yuan. , setting a new high in the amount of A-share repurchase funds in history, and far exceeding previous years.
From the perspective of the purpose of the repurchase, the company&#39;s repurchase of shares and the increase of holdings by major shareholders seem to be the same, but there are big differences in the implementation entities, sources of funds, purposes of repurchase, and the equity of the stock itself.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Maikerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said in an interview with a reporter from Securities Daily that the &quot;Opinions on Supporting the Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies&quot; issued in November 2018 has a narrow scope for share repurchases. Problems in the current system such as complex decision-making procedures and incomplete inventory systems were repaired. Since the policy had previously begun to encourage listed companies to repurchase shares, the phenomenon of share repurchases increased significantly that year.
In January this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange officially released the &quot;Detailed Implementation Rules for the Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies.&quot; The introduction of these policies has broadened the sources of funds for listed companies&#39; repurchases, appropriately simplified implementation procedures, guided and improved governance arrangements, and encouraged all types of listed companies to implement Equity incentive or employee stock ownership plan.
After the promulgation of the opinions, listed companies have more applicable situations for share repurchase, the repurchase process is simpler, and the enthusiasm for share repurchase is greater.
Repurchasing shares at a relatively low position can also help listed companies improve the efficiency of capital use, thereby increasing the level of earnings per share, improving return on net assets, and reducing the pressure on the company&#39;s profitability indicators.
Compared with the increase in holdings by major shareholders, the repurchase of shares by listed companies is of greater significance, and also reflects the listed companies&#39; willingness to proactively manage market value and abundant cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that underestimation of stock prices is the main factor in the buyback of listed companies. The company&#39;s stock price can no longer reflect the company&#39;s future development prospects. Therefore, such companies deserve investors&#39; attention, but they cannot invest blindly. They need to pay attention to such listed companies. financial reports and specific operating conditions.
Listed companies that engage in large-scale repurchases at least demonstrate the company&#39;s development confidence and financial strength.
The enthusiasm for repurchases of A-share listed companies has gradually increased, which has also normalized repurchase behavior. Data shows that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented share repurchases this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the main force in the repurchase market.
Ping An of China recently disclosed its repurchase progress, saying that the company has repurchased a total of 57.59 million A-shares through centralized bidding transactions, accounting for 0.315% of the company&#39;s total share capital, and the total funds paid have totaled 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction fees). All repurchased shares will be used for employee stock ownership plans, including but not limited to long-term service plans that have been reviewed and approved by the company&#39;s general meeting of shareholders.
Yili has paid 5.792 billion yuan for share repurchase, and has recently adjusted the use of repurchased shares. The original plan of &quot;all repurchased shares will be used as a source of stocks for the later implementation of equity incentives&quot; has been changed to &quot;accumulated repurchases&quot;. 183 million shares will be purchased, of which 152 million shares will be used to implement equity incentive stock sources, and the remaining 30.49 million shares will be used for cancellation to reduce registered capital.&quot;
Yili Co., Ltd. said that canceling some of the repurchased shares will help further increase the level of earnings per share and effectively improve the investment return of the company&#39;s shareholders.
TCL Group released a repurchase progress announcement on September 25, which showed that TCL Group had repurchased a total of 3.59% of the company&#39;s shares at a total cost of 1.65 billion yuan.
The TCL Group Board of Directors Office told a reporter from Securities Daily that the repurchased shares will be used for employee stock ownership plans, equity incentives or for converting corporate bonds issued by listed companies that can be converted into stocks.
TCL Group adheres to its established business strategy, continuously improves its competitiveness, and achieves sustained and healthy development.
Based on the confidence in the company&#39;s future development and the protection of investors&#39; interests, combined with the performance of the company&#39;s secondary market in the past year, and comprehensive consideration of the company&#39;s operating conditions and financial status and other factors, the company plans to use its own funds, self-raised funds and Other financing methods include repurchasing company shares.
Yang Delong, chief economist of Qianhai Kaiyuan Fund, said that the operation of stock repurchases by listed companies can, on the one hand, reduce the number of shares circulating in the market and increase the earnings per share of listed companies, which is an important benefit to the stock price in the secondary market; In addition, listed companies are willing to take the initiative to spend real money to repurchase shares from the stock market and cancel them, which has greatly boosted market confidence.
Buybacks of domestic listed companies have gradually increased in recent years, especially for blue chip stocks. Boosting investor confidence through share buybacks is a very good way and a practice worthy of recognition and encouragement.
Hu Henghua, member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and Secretary of the Changsha Municipal Party Committee, and the four leaders of the Hunan Army of Construction Machinery Manufacturing - Zhan Chunxin, Liang Wengen, He Qinghua, and Liu Feixiang - set a &quot;small goal&quot; around &quot;Changsha from construction machinery to intelligent manufacturing&quot; - In three to five years, we will create a world-leading construction machinery industry cluster.
To build a world-leading construction machinery industry cluster in Changsha, in today’s fashionable words, is to create “the strongest on the planet.”
As an inland provincial capital city, where does Changsha have the confidence to shout out such heroic words?
Relying on his domineering and revealing strength.
The four Hunan construction machinery companies participating in the dialogue are all very skilled, covering all fields of air, underground, sea and land: Sunward Intelligent&#39;s light aircraft, Zoomlion&#39;s concrete pumps, Sany Heavy Industry&#39;s all-terrain equipment The &quot;hard power&quot; of cranes and tunnel shield machines of China Railway Construction Heavy Industry can be said to be unique in the world and stand out among the others.
Once upon a time, China basically had no say in the field of construction machinery manufacturing.
Times have changed, and Chinese companies have adopted the two-wheel drive of &quot;bringing in&quot; and &quot;going out&quot;. Taking advantage of the &quot;One Belt, One Road&quot; initiative, they have adopted multiple measures such as acquisitions, mergers, and factory establishments, and have become leaders in the global construction machinery industry.
Among them, leading construction machinery companies such as Sany Heavy Industry, Zoomlion Heavy Industry, Railway Construction Heavy Industry, and Sunward Intelligent have significantly led similar companies in their output value, market share, sales and other major economic indicators.
It relies on the camera to control the current situation.
The &quot;Four King Kongs&quot; of the Hunan Army of Construction Machinery are the leaders in the Changsha construction machinery industry cluster and the leading enterprise in the global construction machinery industry.
In the world of global industry, whoever survives and lives well is what matters most.
In the early years, the global construction machinery industry encountered a cold winter, and many internationally renowned construction machinery manufacturing companies collapsed. However, Changsha&#39;s construction machinery manufacturing companies regarded &quot;cat winter&quot; as &quot;winter swimming&quot;, exerting pressure on themselves and making breakthroughs through the industry. Structural transformation, from manufacturing to intelligent manufacturing, not only has it survived, but the body and bones have become stronger.
It relies on the combined efforts of government and enterprises supported by many stars.
Developing advantageous industries requires both proactive enterprise and proactive government action.
The reason why Changsha has the reputation of &quot;City of Construction Machinery&quot; is that it has brought together the entire industrial chain from upstream to downstream, created many related industrial clusters, and decentralized management by optimizing the business environment, improving supporting services, simplifying the approval process, etc. With the service measures, the company&#39;s R&amp;D, manufacturing and sales costs have been greatly reduced.
The good business ecology has attracted a large number of construction machinery manufacturing companies.
History has pushed Changsha to the forefront of building the world&#39;s leading level of construction machinery. Time waits for no one and we must do our part.
Whether it is the government, enterprises, or even related industry-university-research and business links, they should seize the opportunity, follow the trend, set goals, continue to exert efforts, and contribute Hunan&#39;s strength to building a strong manufacturing country.

Qingyang, Gansu: Hu sheep carry &quot;Poverty Alleviation Scripture&quot;.
Autumn in September brings color to the Loess Plateau.
In the Yimin Breeding Professional Cooperative in Yima Town, 58-year-old villager Xia Weili filled the trough in the sheepfold with the last spade of fodder and stood by the trough, watching the white Hu sheep chewing each bite.
&quot;It&#39;s so delicious. When it&#39;s full of fat in autumn and winter, it can be sold at a good price. &quot;
Xia Weili said that he feeds the sheep &quot;special nutritious meals&quot; every day, cleans, sterilizes and disinfects them regularly, and takes care of them carefully without neglecting them.
Xia Weili has been raising sheep for more than 20 years. It was not until he came to work in the cooperative that he realized how extensive sheep farming was in the past.
Xia Weili is from Xia Laochi Village, Yima Town, Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His neighbors are all sheep farmers, but they adhere to the traditional free-range way of raising sheep, resulting in poor quality sheep and a small number of sheep.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor households in the village joined the cooperative, and everything began to change.
Xia Weili immersed himself in breeding all day long because he always had a strong energy in his heart.
The people who bought shares were all from poor households. They all entrusted their sheep to the cooperative, and they all depended on him whether they would get dividends and sell them at a higher price at the end of the year.
Fortunately, with the guidance of technical personnel, he gradually learned to prevent epidemics, mastered scientific feeding, and became one of the few &quot;good masters&quot; in breeding in the village.
Yimin Breeding Professional Cooperative is a standardized cooperative with a total of 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1,400 Hu sheep.
Zou Tao, the person in charge of the cooperative, said that the standardized sheep sheds are very professional both inside and outside.
&quot;The wool is thick and dense, and it is easy to breed bacteria. Hu sheep cannot stay in hot and humid places. The sheep shed must be built in a place surrounded by ditches on three sides, and a fan must be installed for ventilation and heat dissipation. &quot;
Zou Tao said that in order to prevent the epidemic, the sheep sheds need to be regularly sprayed and disinfected, and the sheep should be vaccinated three to four times in the first quarter.
In addition to living well, the &quot;little sheep&quot; also have to eat a mixture of corn silage, wheat straw, alfalfa, etc., and have a wide enough &quot;playground&quot; to stretch their muscles.
The cooperative adopts the method of trusteeship and breeding to guide local farmers to put fine-bred Hu sheep here, and uniformly raise, manage and sell them to achieve fine-bred, scientific, standardized and intensive breeding.
Today, 140 poor households with sheep as shares receive dividends of more than 6,000 yuan per household every year, and 4 registered poverty alleviation targets are working in the cooperative.
From &quot;grazing in the mountains&quot; to &quot;precision feeding&quot;, from &quot;local mating&quot; to &quot;artificial insemination&quot;, from &quot;looking at the body shape and feeling the belly&quot; to &quot;doing B-ultrasounds one by one&quot;... In Qingyang, Gansu, mutton sheep breeding is not only It is a change in the way of feeding. The &quot;leading enterprise + cooperative + farmer&quot; model has changed the scene of &quot;raising sheep on the hillside and selling sheep in the market&quot;, overcoming the weakness of traditional agriculture and animal husbandry, and the poor life of farmers. Because modern sheep farming has become better.
Zou Tao said that if the market price is weak, Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd., a leading local company, will purchase the product at a market protection price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers diversify market risks.
Xu Jianfeng, general consultant of Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd., said that the company has driven more and more poor households to recite the &quot;Sheep Sutra&quot; by providing loan guarantees, breeding sheep supply, order breeding, quotation acquisition, unified processing and sales and other services to poor households. .
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have achieved a stable increase in income by &quot;joining&quot; Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry&#39;s forage breeding, improved seed breeding, large-scale breeding, slaughtering and segmentation, and market sales.
Qingyang City is located in the northern agro-pastoral transition zone and is rich in forage resources.
At present, there are 913 large-scale mutton sheep farms and cooperatives in the city, with more than 5 million mutton sheep raised, and two processing production lines with a slaughter capacity of 1.3 million mutton sheep have been built. The sheep are becoming the &quot;leader&quot; in the local industrial poverty alleviation. .
French Finance Minister says tax cuts will exceed 10 billion euros next year and calls on Germany to follow suit

Research: The U.S. National Healthy Eating Index has increased slightly but remains challenging - China News Service
China News Service, September 27. According to the American Overseas Chinese News Network, a recent study in the United States showed that the U.S. government’s healthy eating index has increased moderately over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58.
But with a perfect score of 100, that&#39;s not cause for celebration.
Americans still face &quot;significant challenges&quot; in their diet.
One of the study&#39;s authors, Dr. Fangfang Zhang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said Americans still eat too much food that may cause heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other diseases, which are the most common diseases in the United States. The disease you suffer from.
This study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on the 24th.
The study is based on U.S. government health surveys of 44,000 adults from 1999 to 2016.
&quot;Despite considerable improvements, significant dietary challenges remain,&quot; the authors wrote.
It is reported that these challenges include getting American people to reduce their intake of snacks, hot dogs, fatty beef, butter and other foods containing saturated fat.
The study found that people&#39;s daily dietary intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended intake limit of 10%.
The biggest improvement in the American national diet is that sugar intake has dropped from 16% to about 14%, but the intake is still too high.
Officials believe that the intake of added sugars in the daily diet should be less than 10%.
As for the reason for the decrease in sugar intake, researchers believe that it is related to the decrease in people drinking sweetened sodas, but Zhang Fangfang emphasized that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
U.S. adults&#39; consumption of fruits, nuts, oats, and other whole grain foods increased slightly.
However, data from 2016 shows that these foods still account for less than 5% of the daily diet.
Although people are eating slightly less salt and drinking less fruit juice, which results in lower-quality carbohydrate intake, Zhang Fangfang said they still account for up to 42% of daily calories, many of which come from highly processed white bread. and other refined grains.
The study is based on biennial personal health surveys, which ask adults to recall what they ate in the past 24 hours.
These health surveys have asked this question twice every few days since 2003.
The dietary guidelines for Americans issued by the government recommend that people adopt &quot;healthy eating patterns&quot; to reduce the possibility of chronic diseases.
The guidelines point out that people should eat more nutrient-dense foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, as well as seafood, lean meats, poultry, eggs, and seeds that can provide protein.
During the study period, the number of Americans with diabetes nearly doubled to more than 7 percent, and obesity rates also increased over the years—about 70 percent of American adults are now overweight or obese.
Additionally, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States.

The country&#39;s first joint-stock bank wealth management subsidiary is established to empower asset management business with technology
On the 26th, Everbright Financial Management Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Everbright Bank, was officially established in Qingdao. This is the first joint-stock bank financial management subsidiary established in my country.
Experts said that asset management is an important area for the development of financial technology, and the establishment of financial management subsidiaries by banks will help them use technological means to improve their asset management business.
In April this year, China Everbright Bank and China Merchants Bank respectively issued announcements stating that they had received approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission to establish wealth management subsidiaries.
On September 24, Everbright Bank announced that Everbright Financial Management has been officially approved to open.
Just two days later, Everbright Bank took the lead among many joint-stock banks and took the lead in establishing Everbright Financial Management in Qingdao.
Li Xiaopeng, chairman of Everbright Group, said that Everbright Group will accelerate the pace of innovation, use modern scientific and technological thinking and methods, and rely on big data, the Internet of Things, and cloud computing to increase the coverage, utilization and penetration of financial capital, and improve customers&#39; sense of gain and A sense of well-being and security.

Experts believe that while asset management technology can improve customer service capabilities and innovate and enrich products, it can also enhance risk prevention capabilities and improve asset management efficiency.
Zhang Xuyang said that in the past, it was easy to bias the risk preferences of customers through questionnaires, but now the use of artificial intelligence for user profiling helps to better locate customers and launch corresponding products based on customers&#39; investment preferences, which helps to resolve risks. .
&quot;Alternative big data such as e-commerce and spatio-temporal data can help us better characterize the activity and prosperity of a region and an industry. &quot;
Zhang Xuyang said that while resolving risks, big data technology will also help improve risk control capabilities.
The record for the deepest railway tunnel shaft in China has been broken
China News Service, Baoshan, September 27 (Zhang Weiming, Xu Weiguo, Zhou Jingbo) After more than 1,200 days of day and night construction, the No. 1 shaft of the Gaoligongshan Tunnel of the Dali-Rui-Li Railway under construction was completed on the 27th, and the shaft depth reached the ground At 762.59 meters below, it breaks the record for the deepest railway tunnel shaft in China, and this record was set despite a large amount of water inflow.
The 34.5-kilometer-long Gaoligongshan Tunnel of the Dali-Ruili Railway is located in Yunnan. The tunnel crosses the Gaoligongshan Mountains from the west bank of the Nu River and is the longest double-track single-hole tunnel in Asia.
This tunnel crosses 19 fault zones with a maximum burial depth of 1,155 meters. Because it covers almost all adverse geology and major risks that may be encountered in tunnel construction, the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel is called the &quot;Geological Museum&quot; of tunnel construction.
The shaft is the most important auxiliary tunnel of the Gaoligongshan Tunnel. It shoulders the important task of increasing the working surface to achieve &quot;long tunnel tunneling&quot; and ventilation for later railway operations.
The No. 1 shaft was successfully excavated to the bottom, marking the official entry of the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel into horizontal tunnel construction. After the bottom shaft yard is excavated and equipment is replaced, four more working surfaces can be added underground to speed up the tunnel&#39;s main tunnel excavation.
&quot;The shafts are all in the granite formation. Because there are many fissures in the granite formation, the water cannot be stopped and flows from top to bottom. Basically, the water pressure will be as deep as the well. &quot;
Si Jingzhao, chief engineer of the Dali-Ruili Railway Project Department of China Railway Tunnel Bureau, told reporters that during the construction of the shaft, dangers such as mud and water surges and collapses occurred many times. The builder invited experts to check the pulse on site and discussed solutions more than 20 times.
&quot;When the water inflow in the shaft reaches its maximum, it reaches more than 300 cubic meters per hour. The water pressure at the bottom of the well more than 700 meters deep is equivalent to the seabed 700 meters deep. &quot;
Si Jingzhao said, &quot;If the water is not pumped and drained in time, the well will flood 10 meters in one hour. We spend almost 85% of the time controlling the water and 15% of the time digging. &quot;
In order to overcome geological problems such as the development of longitudinal joints in the surrounding rocks of Shaft No. 1, sudden mud and water intrusion, and water-rich granite, the tunnel construction adopts systematic water control measures that combine &quot;exploration, injection, and excavation&quot; to reduce construction risks.
After many improvements, the construction of No. 1 Shaft has formed a mechanized assembly line such as excavation system, ballast removal system, suspension system, and winch lifting system, realizing full-process mechanized operations such as drilling, blasting, ballast removal, formwork installation, and concrete pouring. , speeding up the construction progress.
Finally, after more than 1,200 days and nights of construction, the shaft was successfully excavated to a depth of 762.59 meters.
The Dali-Ruili Railway, with a total length of 330 kilometers, is an important part of the China-Myanmar international corridor and an important transportation infrastructure for the implementation of the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; construction.
After it is completed and opened to traffic, the driving time from Dali to Ruili will be shortened from the current 6 hours to 2 hours. This will greatly improve the transportation pattern in western Yunnan and play a role in promoting economic and trade cooperation and friendly personnel exchanges between China and South and Southeast Asian countries. enhancement.

I started to feel lonely in the afternoon, and I didn’t want to go out. I haven’t adjusted to the fact that the children are not around yet.
Cheer up and say to the dog Nana: Mom will take you out.
I carefully wrote down a few things I had to do when I went out. The personality traits of type A blood became more and more powerful, and I felt very awkward.
Pick up a suit, buy nutritional tablets, pay, buy sashimi, Nana&#39;s snacks.
These are the reasons to go out.
On the phone, I just finished telling my sister Aiqiang that thanks to Nana, otherwise I wouldn’t even have an excuse to buy snacks.
The other person laughed perfunctorily a few times, said the child had called, and hung up.
Nana jumped onto the passenger seat with familiarity, and lay down obediently. She knew that she was carsick, and was terrified, but she was unwilling not to accompany me.
Husband Boao came back early for a rare occasion.
I repeatedly praised the delicious salmon and avocado salad, and then went to the bedroom to lie on the bed and watch TV.
Looking at the crotch on the wall, it was just 7 o&#39;clock. In the land of rising sun, the sunset was also early, and it was already dark.
Everyone in the circle of friends is discovering the moon. It turns out that today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.
I washed a bunch of grapes sent by a friend and left half of them for Boao. I put the rest in my favorite flower bowl and took it out to watch the moon.
Sitting on the ground with Nana, I ate the grapes and she ate the skins, and I spit out the seeds far away.
The moon is hidden in the clouds. Fortunately, when the clouds move, the moon appears and disappears, which is a bit dazzling.
Various poems about the bright moon are surging in my mind, but I only like this sentence clearly: We are reunited every three or five days/A handful of clear light protects the jade fence/It is only held out by the sky/Everyone in the world looks up.
Maybe we have given too much emotion to the moonlight. For me now, actually, the sentence &quot;Give to God what is God&#39;s and give to Caesar what is Caesar&#39;s&quot; is the best.
The moonlight belongs to the moonlight, and the emotions belong to yourself.
After eating the grapes, the cold moon was freezing.
Nana snored slightly at her feet. She stood up and spread Nana&#39;s little blanket beside her little house. Nana lay happily on it.
Open the door and shout loudly: Is the bath water ready?
You can&#39;t see the moon from the bathroom window, you can only feel the moonlight, turn off the bathroom light, and open the glass with a bang.
I didn’t eat moon cakes or drink alcohol.

Will MCA contest the Tanjung Piai parliamentary by-election in Johor?
MCA President Datuk Seri Wee Ka Siong: “Leave it to the Supreme Council of the Barisan Nasional for discussion!”
The Tanjung Piai parliamentary seat by-election is about to begin, and whether MCA, a member party of the Barisan Nasional, will contest this traditional parliamentary seat is attracting attention.
However, after the MCA Central Committee held a meeting, it was announced that it would be left to the Supreme Council of the Barisan Nasional to decide whether this traditional MCA seat should continue to be contested by MCA or be replaced by other member parties.
After presiding over the MCA Central Committee meeting on Thursday afternoon, Wei Jiaxiang told the media that any by-election would be conducted by the Barisan Nasional in accordance with the standard operating procedures (SOP), which means that it must be finalized after a meeting of the Barisan Nasional Supreme Council.
He said that since the Election Committee will not meet until next Monday (1st) to finalize the Tanjung Piai parliamentary by-election, the BN Supreme Council meeting is expected to be held in early October.
&quot;Yesterday (26th) morning, I also met with Barisan Nasional Chairman Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi. We all agreed that this seat must be regained from the Pakatan Harapan. &quot;
&quot;We have decided to convene a special BN leadership meeting in early October. The leaders of the three BN parties will determine which member party will join the battle. &quot;
Asked whether MCA would insist on contesting this traditional seat in the Supreme Council of the Barisan Nasional, Wee Ka Siong reiterated that as the president of MCA, he must act in accordance with the standard operating procedures, so any decision must obtain the consensus of the Barisan Nasional.
&quot;In any by-election, it is common for some people to be willing to fight, some political parties and certain parties to think they should come out. &quot;
“The most important thing is what organization and political alliance do we come from?”
&quot;This is a big test for the political alliance we have formed over the years. We believe that the Barisan Front has upheld some valuable values along the way. &quot;
&quot;Someone may say something during this process, and that&#39;s not surprising.&quot;
&quot;However, once the Supreme Council of the Barisan Nasional makes a decision, everyone must prepare for war with all their strength. That is the most valuable thing. &quot;
In any case, Wee Ka Siong said that MCA will make every effort to prepare for the upcoming Tanjong Piai parliamentary by-election at three levels, namely the district committee, the state joint committee and the central government.
“The district committee will be led by (Tanjung Piai) district committee chairman Datuk Seri Wong Jik Sheng; the state joint committee will be led by Datuk Lim Pei Xing, acting chairman of the Johor joint committee; and the central committee will be led by the acting president Dato Ma Hanshun and General Secretary Dato Zhang Shengwen personally deployed. &quot;
Last Saturday (21st), Tanjung Piai MP Datuk Mohd Farid of the Bersatu Party passed away at the Pontian Government Hospital due to heart problems at the age of 42.
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province was ordered to &quot;compulsorily patrol the mountains&quot; for hunting wild animals.
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province was sentenced for hunting wild animals and was ordered to compensate 15,420 yuan (RMB, the same below) for the cost of repairing damage to ecological resources and the environment.
Due to the poverty of the defendant&#39;s family, the procuratorial organ used alternative labor to compensate for ecological restoration costs, achieving an organic unity of legal and social effects.
Wang Zhongliang, deputy chief prosecutor of the Baokang County Procuratorate, introduced on the 27th that through three months of &quot;voluntary mountain patrol&quot; and other alternative labor, the defendant Zhou had established a deep relationship with the wild macaques and felt deeply remorseful for his previous behavior of hunting animals. .
On June 21 this year, a civil public interest litigation incidental to a criminal case in the field of ecological resources filed by the Baokang County Procuratorate was heard publicly in the county court and the verdict was pronounced in court.
The defendant Zhou was sentenced to 3 years in prison, suspended for 4 years, and fined 3,000 yuan. He was also ordered to compensate 15,420 yuan for ecological resource and environmental damage repair costs.
After investigation, Zhou began to set up a power grid on the cliff in late January 2014 and hunted more than 20 wild animals, including gorals, muntjacs, and tufted deer.
The goral is a national second-level endangered wild protected animal, and the muntjac and tufted deer are listed in the &quot;National Terrestrial Wildlife Protection List.&quot;
During the trial, Zhou confessed to his illegal facts and actions and was willing to bear additional civil liability.
However, considering the poor economic situation of Zhou&#39;s family, under the coordination of the Baokang County Procuratorate, the local village committee, the forest station, and Zhou reached an agreement on alternative labor compensation for ecological restoration costs: that is, Zhou carried out the work in the village macaque reserve. Macaque domestication, management and protection, voluntary mountain patrols, and forest protection will be provided for one year, and public welfare services will be provided to offset the cost of ecological restoration.
The court recognized the prosecutor&#39;s suggestion and agreed that Zhou should actively fulfill his obligation to &quot;compensate for ecological restoration costs through alternative labor&quot; while executing his suspended sentence.
At present, Zhou has been working voluntarily in the macaque reserve for three months, actively patrolling the mountains and performing well.
In recent years, Baokang County Procuratorate has organically integrated procuratorial functions and social governance behaviors in practice, scientifically used procuratorial suggestions, investigation supervision, litigation supervision and other supervision methods, and used judicial means to minimize the damage caused by criminal acts to the ecological environment.

Karen Birch, a global economist at the British Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that the U.S. economy will continue its gradual downward trend this year and its growth rate will drop to a lower level than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody&#39;s Analytics, predicts that, assuming that economic and trade frictions do not continue to escalate, the U.S. economic growth will be 2.3% this year and will further slow down to 1.6% next year.
Ellen Hazen, investment manager of Putnam Investment Company, pointed out that the current biggest concern of enterprises is economic and trade disputes and the uncertainty they bring. If the economic and trade disputes can be resolved, the uncertainty will be significantly reduced, and the performance of the industrial sector will be better than Much better now.
Matt Melly, equity strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said that economic and trade frictions remain the &quot;primary issue&quot; and are also the main cause of the sharp fluctuations in the U.S. capital market this year. Whether the economic and trade frictions can be properly resolved will be a factor that will affect this year. The key to the direction of U.S. capital markets in the remaining time.

Finance Minister Liu Kun: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred 860.1 billion yuan of state-owned assets to replenish social security funds.
Finance Minister Liu Kun said on the 27th that so far, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of part of state-owned capital to enrich social security funds, with a total transfer of state-owned capital of approximately 860.1 billion yuan.
Liu Kun made the above statement at the national task deployment meeting for transferring part of state-owned capital to replenish social security funds jointly held by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission on the same day.
&quot;Transferring part of state-owned capital to enrich social security funds is an important measure to reform and improve the basic pension insurance system. It is a full reflection of the universal sharing of the development results of state-owned enterprises and the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system. It is a plan that is based on the present and takes into account the long term. policy measures. &quot;
In 2017, the State Council issued the &quot;Implementation Plan for Transferring Part of State-owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Funds&quot;, requiring the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to carry out pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, the preliminary work of the transfer has achieved positive results.
At the central level, three batches of transfers of a total of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been completed, with a total transfer of state-owned capital of approximately 860.1 billion yuan.
Among them, the transfer work of the central financial institution that the Ministry of Finance performs as an investor has been basically completed.
The transfer of central enterprises has reached a certain scale.
At the local level, preliminary work for enterprise transfer has been carried out one after another.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had been basically completed, and 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan of state-owned capital had been transferred respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also carried out preparatory work for the transfer, laying the foundation for the next implementation of the transfer.
According to a notice jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the work of transferring part of state-owned capital from the central and local governments to replenish social security funds will be fully launched in 2019 and will be basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held that day made specific arrangements for comprehensively promoting the transfer work.
The meeting emphasized the need to complete the transfer work pragmatically and efficiently.
“According to the schedule, the transfer work will be basically completed by the end of 2020.
The transfer work time is tight and the tasks are heavy. &quot;
Liu Kun said that all regions and departments must carefully organize and arrange carefully to ensure that the transfer work is completed as required; solidly advance the work and accurately grasp the content of the transfer policy; strengthen communication and coordination, and solve difficult problems in a timely manner.
Transfer of state-owned assets to enrich social security funds - Starting from the starting point of &quot;enriching the money bag of social security funds&quot;, the destination is to provide strong support for pension security.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple &quot;physical displacement&quot; of equity, but a &quot;mathematical addition&quot;.
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission jointly issued the &quot;Notice on Comprehensively Promoting the Transfer of Part of State-owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Funds&quot;, clarifying the timetable for the transfer of state-owned assets to social security funds, namely The work of transferring part of state-owned capital from the central and local governments to replenish social security funds was fully launched in 2019.
After the document was released, the Ministry of Finance and other departments implemented it very quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred all 10% of the equity held by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China to the Social Security Fund. The total value of the two equity transfers exceeded 115 billion yuan.
According to regulations, social security foundations and other undertaking entities, as financial investors, enjoy the income rights, disposal rights and information rights of the state-owned equity transferred.
ICBC and Agricultural Bank of China stated in the announcement that this change in equity will not lead to changes in the bank’s controlling shareholders and actual controllers.
In this regard, the author believes that similar state-owned enterprise equity transfers are not simple changes in equity ownership, but &quot;addition operations&quot; that can stimulate a series of effects.
The &quot;additive result&quot; of the first step of transferring part of state-owned assets to social security can naturally reflect that state-owned enterprises are owned by all the people and the fruits of development are shared by all.
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in my country&#39;s economy, and their overall profitability is strong and stable.
Among them, leading companies continue to become better, bigger and stronger.
On July 10, the State Council executive meeting decided to fully launch the transfer of part of state-owned capital to replenish social security funds this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately stated that it will work with relevant departments, in accordance with the deployment of the State Council executive meeting, to comprehensively promote the transfer of part of state-owned capital to replenish social security funds, fully reflecting the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system and the universal sharing of the development results of state-owned enterprises.
The second step of the transfer, the &quot;additional result&quot;, is to enhance the sustainability of my country&#39;s social security funds and further consolidate the foundation of the pension social security system.
With the aging of the population, my country&#39;s social security funds are under pressure. Most of the state-owned assets that are transferred this time have the ability to continue to make profits and pay dividends. They can not only effectively supplement the social security funds, but also provide a source of vitality for the social security funds.
Some estimates show that every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital transferred can support a 1 percentage point reduction in the corporate basic pension insurance deposit ratio.
The third step of the transfer, the &quot;additional result&quot;, is to add stabilizers to the capital market.
The way for the transferee to obtain income for this transfer is &quot;mainly dividends, supplemented by operations.&quot;
As a financial investor in state-owned capital, social security funds do mainly obtain equity dividend income.
However, as a value investor in the capital market, social security funds have strong capital operation capabilities.
For listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in shareholding will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed companies, help improve corporate operating standards, and have a positive impact on listed companies and the capital market.
At the same time, as an investment vane, the increase in shareholding weight of social security funds will help further enhance their influence in the market and play a &quot;stabilizer&quot; role in the market.
In addition, it is also conducive to giving full play to the &quot;value discovery&quot; function of institutional investors and guiding investors to invest rationally and value.

Baidu&#39;s first self-driving taxi fleet begins trial operation
Yesterday, Baidu announced in Changsha that the trial operation of its self-driving taxi fleet Robotaxi has officially started.
The first batch of 45 &quot;Hongqi EV&quot; Robotaxi fleet jointly developed by Apollo and FAW Hongqi has begun trial operation on some open test roads in Changsha.
From now on, ordinary Changsha citizens can log in to Apollo’s official website to apply to become seed users and have the opportunity to test drive.
An experience passenger said that he sat in the back of the vehicle and clicked on the screen in front of the passenger seat to start the vehicle&#39;s autonomous driving journey with one click.
In the car, for the safety of passengers and current policy and regulatory requirements, trial operation vehicles are equipped with a safety officer in the driving position to maximize passenger safety.
During driving, the vehicle can intelligently change lanes according to road conditions, judge the driving conditions of surrounding vehicles, and automatically avoid situations such as close overtaking.
Throughout the experience, the screen in the passenger area displays pedestrians, cars, and even some traditional blind spots on the road in real time.
Even if the vehicle is blocked, you can still see information such as changes in traffic lights ahead and waiting time in advance, and all vehicle conditions and road conditions are clear at a glance.
I had heard about autonomous driving on TV before and thought it was far away from us, but today I discovered that it is in our lives and it feels amazing.
We look forward to it truly entering people&#39;s lives in the future.
In June 2019, Apollo obtained 45 manned test licenses issued by the Changsha Municipal Government.
At present, Changsha’s open roads for autonomous driving testing pass through Changsha Artificial Intelligence Technology City, Meixi Lake, Yanghu, Dawang Mountain, High-tech Zone and other areas, with a total length of 135 kilometers and a demonstration area of 70 square kilometers.

&quot;In the third game, the opponent became more aggressive in serving. Some of our (first passes) were not in place and we couldn&#39;t attack the ball. We made a lot of mistakes. &quot;
&quot;It&#39;s difficult to play against a strong team and make so many mistakes. &quot;
Lang Ping said in an interview after the game.
&quot;We told the players to focus. If the first pass is not attacked properly, we have to adjust the attack well. In addition, we have to defend against the opponent. &quot;
Lang Ping also commented on Zhang Changning&#39;s performance, saying that she encountered some difficulties in offense, was anxious, wanted to kill the ball too much, and her movements would be deformed.
I hope she can be patient and &quot;we all protect her.&quot;
China&#39;s development is an opportunity to the world, not a threat or challenge.
(70 Years of New China) White Paper: China’s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
The white paper points out that China&#39;s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
The white paper said that with the rapid increase in China&#39;s comprehensive national strength and international influence, some people in the world are worried that China will take the path of &quot;a strong country will seek hegemony&quot;, and some people have put forward the so-called &quot;China threat theory.&quot;
This is caused by cognitive misunderstandings, deep-rooted prejudices, psychological imbalance caused by the rise and fall of power, and deliberate distortions to protect one&#39;s own vested interests.
Achieving national prosperity, national rejuvenation, and people&#39;s happiness is not only the dream of the Chinese people, but also the common dream of people of all countries.
&quot;China&#39;s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge. &quot;
The white paper points out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth. China is the largest contributor to world economic growth. China&#39;s scientific and technological innovation has injected new momentum into world economic growth. In the future, China&#39;s role as a stabilizer and power source for the economy will become more prominent.
The current world economic growth momentum is insufficient, and a stable Chinese economy is increasingly important to the world.
China&#39;s economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development. New industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization are accelerating. The economic structure is undergoing in-depth adjustments, industrial optimization continues to be upgraded, and new economic growth points are constantly emerging.
&quot;A research report by McKinsey Global Institute believes that by 2040, the integration of China and other economies around the world is expected to create an economic value of US$22 trillion to US$37 trillion, equivalent to 15% - 26% of the global economy. The rest of the world Strengthening cooperation between economies and China will create huge economic value. &quot;
The white paper emphasizes that China&#39;s economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and are deeply integrated.
A China with more stable economic performance, higher quality growth and promising growth prospects will be a long-term positive for world economic development.
It is neither feasible nor harmful to regard China&#39;s economic development as a &quot;threat&quot; and &quot;challenge&quot;, to try to squeeze China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain, and value chain, and to &quot;decouple&quot; China from the world economy.
The white paper points out that all-round opening up will create more opportunities for all countries to share &quot;China dividends&quot;.
China unswervingly pursues a mutually beneficial and win-win opening-up strategy and achieves a greater intensity and higher level of opening up to the outside world. China has the most potential consumer market in the world. China is the most attractive investment destination, with a larger scale. &quot;Going Global&quot; will benefit more countries.
“Opening up should be two-way and mutually beneficial, rather than one-way and benefit one party.
Mutual benefit can only last in the long run. &quot;
The white paper states that China is committed to continuing to expand imports, relax market access, improve the business environment, and strengthen intellectual property protection. Other countries should also expand opening up, take corresponding measures, and strive to improve their own business environments.
Only when all parties work together in the same direction can we create an open, inclusive, universally beneficial, balanced, and win-win development environment, and jointly make the &quot;cake&quot; of development bigger and bigger, forming a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests.
The white paper points out that China will provide more public goods to the international community.
This includes promoting high-quality joint construction of the “Belt and Road”, building a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively carrying out foreign aid.
&quot;China&#39;s development has benefited from the international community, and it has always given back to the international community and provided more and better public goods to the international community. &quot;

Demonstrations trigger the resignation of the president, and the authorities in Egypt declare a strong crackdown
Twitter hashtags and social media are strongly encouraging Egyptians to take to the streets today to peacefully demand President Sisi&#39;s resignation.
But the authorities have stated their intention to use force to suppress the protests.
Since then-military chief Sisi seized power in a military coup in 2013, expressions of dissent have almost disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest is even more dangerous.
The British &quot;Guardian&quot; reported that the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a non-governmental organization in Cairo, pointed out that more than 1,900 people have been arrested since the rare protests calling for Sisi&#39;s resignation broke out last weekend.
Corruption accusations surrounding Sisi and his family&#39;s squandering of public funds in pursuit of vanity have led to thousands of people taking to the streets to demonstrate on the 20th.
Egypt&#39;s Ministry of Interior took a firm stance yesterday and stated that it will decisively respond to any attempt to undermine the country&#39;s stability and will never show mercy.
Central Cairo has long been heavily guarded, and riot police, security agency vehicles and plainclothes police can be seen everywhere on the streets around Tahrir Square, the flashpoint of Egypt&#39;s revolution in 2011.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of important scholars and social figures on the 25th, including Cairo University political science professor and well-known columnist Nafa.
He tweeted on the 24th: &quot;Continuing to allow Sisi&#39;s absolute rule will cause disaster, I have no doubt.&quot;
&quot;It is in Egypt&#39;s interest that he step down immediately. &quot;
Prior to Nafa&#39;s arrest, Hosni, who served as the spokesman for Egypt&#39;s former military chief of staff, Annan, was detained.
Annan was arrested last year after trying to run against Sisi for the presidency.
Davoud, chairman of the Constitution Party, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe the crackdown on dissidents reflects the government&#39;s instability and fragility at a time when economic hardship for the poor and middle class is intensifying.
Opposition leader Ayman Nour, a former presidential contender, said: &quot;The arrests highlight the regime&#39;s disregard for the Egyptian people and how afraid it is of itself.&quot;
&quot;With the economy already in shambles and with widespread political repression, Sisi is trying to send a clear message to the key generals and politicians who might replace him.&quot;
Noel pointed out that as the socio-economic situation continues to deteriorate, the government&#39;s high-handed tactics will only increase people&#39;s anger.
Now that the fear barrier has been breached, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor currently in exile in Spain, was a former Egyptian military construction contractor. He began uploading a series of videos at the beginning of the month, claiming to have benefited from government corruption, triggering a wave of small demonstrations in different cities last weekend.
Ali said his company, Amrak General Contracting, was able to secure lucrative contracts without having to go through the legal bidding process, emphasizing the military and Sisi&#39;s relatives, including first lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi. Corruption is rife.
He deeply regrets his involvement.
Ali claimed that the magnificent palaces and luxury hotels he built for Sisi were in sharp contrast to the current abject poverty of Egyptians, and that the other party had not yet paid.
On Twitter, hashtags such as &quot;Stand up you are not alone,&quot; &quot;Sisi you are finished,&quot; &quot;Sisi needs to go,&quot; and &quot;Next Friday&quot; have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and retweets. , the content called on people to peacefully take to the streets to demand Sisi&#39;s resignation.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Ama Wik has nearly 7 million followers on Twitter.
He tweeted yesterday in Arabic: &quot;Sisi is doomed... He is finished and those who supported him are now making a big mistake. &quot;

After being detained by Iran for two months, the British oil tanker &quot;Stena Impero&quot; was finally released and set off from Bandar Abbas Port in Iran on the morning of the 27th, heading for international waters.
Just in the middle of last month, authorities in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar released an Iranian oil tanker that had been detained for more than a month.
According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, at 9 a.m. local time on the 27th, the British oil tanker &quot;Stena Impero&quot; departed from Bandar Abbas Port and headed for the international waters of the Persian Gulf.
Iran&#39;s Hormozgan Province Ports and Shipping Organization confirmed that the ship&#39;s commander and crew had made a formal and written commitment that they had no claims despite the ship&#39;s seizure.
The Swedish owner of the Stena Impero tanker, Stena Bulk, also said that the ship was setting sail from Bandar Abbas Port.
In addition, Refinitiv ship tracking data also found that the tanker began moving on the 27th and left Bandar Abbas Port.
The British-flagged Stena Impero oil tanker was seized by Iran in July this year.
A spokesman for the company said the tanker was preparing to leave Bandar Abbas Port.
Two weeks after Britain seized an Iranian oil tanker off Gibraltar, Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guards detained the Stena Impero tanker in the Strait of Hormuz waterway.
The ship was released in August.
Earlier this week, an Iranian government spokesman said that all legal procedures required to release the Stena Impero had been completed.
But Iran said the investigation was still ongoing.
Many Iranian media also released videos of the tanker setting sail.
On July 19, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy detained a British oil tanker &quot;Stena Impero&quot; in Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz and then escorted it to Bandar Abbas Port.
The impounded Iranian oil tanker Grace 1 sailed out of the waters of Gibraltar.
In addition, on July 4, authorities in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar seized the Grace 1 oil tanker carrying Iranian crude oil in the Strait of Gibraltar on suspicion of transporting oil to Syria in violation of EU sanctions.
More than a month later, on August 15, the Gibraltar authorities announced the release of Grace 1.
This afternoon, a special meeting on the inspection and rectification work of thematic education in undergraduate colleges and universities across the province was held in Changsha.
Wu Lan, deputy secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, emphasized the need to improve political standing, strengthen political responsibility, strictly review and rectify problems, and use the effectiveness of thematic education to promote the high-quality development of party building, ideological and political work, and reform and development in colleges and universities.
Wu Lan fully affirmed the initial results achieved by various undergraduate colleges and universities in the second batch of thematic education.
She pointed out that carrying out the theme education of &quot;never forget the original intention and keeping the mission in mind&quot; is a major deployment made by the Party Central Committee. All undergraduate colleges and universities must thoroughly study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping&#39;s important speech on carrying out the theme education of &quot;never forget the original intention and keep the mission in mind&quot;.
From the political perspective of strengthening the &quot;four consciousnesses&quot;, achieving &quot;two safeguards&quot;, and fulfilling the original mission, we must conscientiously complete the prescribed actions of thematic education, especially the series of problems identified through solid rectification and inspection, and coordinate all aspects of school reform and development. In this work, we must achieve &quot;two correctnesses and two promotions&quot;.
Wu Lan emphasized that we must adhere to the principle of turning the blade inward, do a good job in examining problems, follow the requirements of &quot;four comparisons&quot; and &quot;four searches and one search&quot; to find out the correct problems by benchmarking against the table, and openly solicit opinions from teachers, students, employees, parents and all walks of life. Opinions and suggestions, ideologically serious and profound analysis to dig deep into the root causes, and then clarify the direction of efforts and improvement measures, and come up with practical and hard measures to solve the problem.
We must persist in making precise efforts, strengthen real reforms, and effectively incorporate the word &quot;reform&quot; throughout.
It is necessary to combine thematic education with &quot;cultivating people by virtue&quot; and other work, and consolidate the rectification responsibilities to ensure that all problems are solved and cleared to the bottom, so as to ensure the effectiveness of rectification.
It is necessary to insist on treating both the symptoms and root causes, improve the long-term mechanism, weave a tight and tight institutional cage, strengthen the rigid constraints of the system, ensure that all work has rules and regulations to follow, and truly use the system to manage people, affairs, and power.
It is necessary to adhere to the leadership of the above, leading cadres to take the lead in strengthening theoretical arming, taking the lead in serious inspection and rectification, taking the lead in strict self-discipline at all times, giving full play to the demonstration role of the &quot;key minority&quot;, and striving to complete various tasks of thematic education inspection and rectification.

Two major ultra-high voltage projects, &quot;One, One, One, All&quot;, were put into operation
On the 26th, the Zhundong to Wannan ±1100 kV UHV DC transmission project and the Sutong 1000 kV AC UHV GIL integrated pipeline project were put into operation.
Both projects occupy the commanding heights in their respective fields of current world power transmission technology. Once put into operation, they will greatly improve the large-scale optimal allocation of energy in our country.
Guo Zhi, chief economist of the National Energy Administration, said that the Zhundong to Wannan project is the transmission project with the largest power transmission capacity and the longest transmission distance in the world.
Its operation is of great significance to promoting the development of Xinjiang energy base and ensuring the power supply in East China.
GIL stands for gas insulated metal enclosed transmission line.
The Sutong Pipeline Gallery Project has set a record for the GIL project with the highest voltage level and strongest transmission capacity in the world, and has achieved the closed-loop operation of the &#39;AC double-ring network&#39; with the highest voltage level in East China&#39;s backbone power grid.
According to the State Grid Corporation of China, the power transmission distance of the Zhundong to Wannan project is 3,324 kilometers.
If conventional technology is used, more than 15% of the electric energy will be lost in transit. However, through research and development of this project, the economic transmission distance has been greatly increased to more than 3,000 kilometers.
After the Zhundong to Wannan project is put into operation, it will be able to transmit 100 million kWh of electricity every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which can help solve the problem of existing new energy consumption in Xinjiang.
Based on full load estimates, the annual power transmission of this line alone will reach 60 to 85 billion kilowatt hours, which can meet more than half of Shanghai&#39;s annual electricity consumption.
The Sutong GIL integrated pipe gallery project is a control project for the UHV AC ring network across the Yangtze River.
If conventional overhead lines are used to cross the river, two giant towers over 450 meters tall will need to be built on the Yangtze River, and an artificial island larger than four football fields will need to be built for each tower.
In this regard, State Grid boldly innovated and developed compact UHV AC GIL transmission technology to cross the river underwater through tunnels to avoid impact on the golden waterway.
The two projects have promoted my country&#39;s electrical equipment manufacturing capabilities to achieve a new leap.
At present, the State Grid has completed a total of &quot;10 AC and 11 DC&quot; UHV projects, and there are still &quot;4 AC and 3 DC&quot; projects under construction.
State Administration of Foreign Exchange: my country’s external debt structure continues to be optimized and the stability of external debt is enhanced
&quot;Overall, my country&#39;s foreign debt structure continues to be optimized, and the stability of foreign debt has been enhanced. &quot;
Wang Chunying, spokesperson and chief economist of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said on the 27th that the main indicators of my country&#39;s foreign debt are within the internationally recognized safety line, and the risk of foreign debt is generally controllable.
Wang Chunying made the above remarks when answering reporters&#39; questions when the Foreign Exchange Administration announced the foreign debt data for the end of June 2019 that day.
Data show that as of the end of June 2019, my country&#39;s full-scale (including local and foreign currency) external debt balance was US$1.998 billion, an increase of US$26.3 billion or 1.3% from the end of March 2019, mainly due to the increase in the balance of debt securities.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70% of the increase in my country&#39;s full-scale external debt was driven by the purchase of domestic RMB bonds by non-residents, and non-residents were mainly medium- and long-term investors such as the central bank.
At the end of June 2019, the proportion of medium- and long-term external debt increased by 3 percentage points compared with the end of March 2019, and the proportion of local currency external debt increased by 1 percentage point compared with the end of March 2019.
Wang Chunying said that with the inclusion of my country&#39;s domestic RMB bonds in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Composite Index in April 2019, international investors have further enhanced their recognition of China&#39;s bond market and continued to increase their holdings of domestic RMB bonds.
&quot;my country&#39;s international balance of payments maintains an overall balance and foreign debt risks are controllable. &quot;
The reporter learned from the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences on the 27th that Spodoptera Frugiperda has been effectively controlled in Yunnan, without causing large-scale outbreaks and disasters. The prevention and control work has achieved phased results.
In January this year, Spodoptera Frugiperda that had migrated from abroad was discovered for the first time in Jiangcheng County, Pu&#39;er City, Yunnan Province, and was subsequently confirmed to occur in 129 counties in Yunnan.

Spodoptera Frugiperda is an important polyphagous long-distance migratory agricultural pest native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a major migratory pest in the global warning of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. It has &quot;international, migratory, and outbreak characteristics.&quot; &quot;sexual, destructive&quot; characteristics.
This pest harms more than 80 crops such as corn, sugarcane, and sorghum. It feeds heavily and can cause yield losses of up to 70%.
Control is difficult, and there are currently no registered pesticides to control this insect in China.
Since Spodoptera Frugiperda migrated and invaded Yunnan, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences selected researcher Chen Aidong to lead the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences&#39; agricultural cross-border pest collaborative green prevention and control provincial innovation team to go to the front line to conduct field surveys, collect samples, and carry out Technical guidance and test demonstration.
Chen Aidong&#39;s team has initially grasped the population characteristics of Yunnan Spodoptera Frugiperda, natural enemy insect resources, characteristics of overseas insect sources, population migration trajectories, pesticide toxicity and field control effects.
They actively carry out research and application of green prevention and control technologies. Through the implementation of new green prevention and control technologies such as population monitoring, adult insect trapping, scientific use of pesticides and agronomic measures, the prevention and control effect in the demonstration area has reached more than 90%, while reducing chemical The use of pesticides protects natural enemy resources and the ecological environment, and provides technical support for effective control of Spodoptera Frugiperda outbreaks and sustainable management in Yunnan.
At present, Spodoptera Frugiperda has been effectively controlled in Yunnan, without causing large-scale outbreaks and disasters. The prevention and control work has achieved phased results.
In the next step, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on the ecological mechanism of population migration and invasion outbreaks, and break through the construction of biological prevention and green prevention and control technology systems.
At the same time, we actively promote cross-border international cooperation and strive to establish joint key laboratories, joint monitoring sites and demonstration areas overseas to enhance Yunnan’s all-round monitoring and early warning capabilities for Spodoptera Frugiperda.

Soliciting opinions on new regulations: Qualifications are required for social capital to obtain rural land management rights
Qualifications are required for social capital to obtain rural land management rights
The &quot;Measures for the Administration of the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights&quot; is publicly soliciting opinions and intends to supervise the transfer of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises to obtain land management rights.
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued a notice for public comment on the &quot;Measures for the Management of the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights (Revised Draft for Comments)&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Draft&quot;), which added requirements for the transfer of land acquired by social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises. Supervision and risk prevention of operating rights.
The &quot;Draft for Opinions&quot; will be open to the public for comments from now on.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs stated that in order to implement the newly revised &quot;Rural Land Contract Law&quot;, further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system, and implement the &quot;separation of three powers&quot; system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has revised the &quot;Rural Land Contract Law&quot; The &quot;Measures for the Management of Transfer of Operation Rights&quot; were revised and the &quot;Draft of Opinions&quot; was formed.
A reporter from the Beijing Youth Daily learned that the &quot;Draft of Opinions&quot; released for the first time has many important revisions.
The newly revised &quot;Rural Land Contract Law&quot; clarifies the scope of land transfer, implements the concept of &quot;separation of three rights&quot;, and sets up special sections for &quot;Land Contract Management Rights&quot; and &quot;Land Management Rights&quot; respectively, and regulates the transfer and mutual transfer of land contract management rights. A clear distinction is made between the exchange and the transfer of land management rights (leasing, subcontracting, equity participation or other methods).
In this &quot;Opinion Draft&quot;, in order to implement the concept of &quot;separation of three rights&quot;, effectively respond to the gist of the amendment to the &quot;Rural Land Contract Law&quot;, and take into account the transfer of land management rights and the exchange and transfer of land contract management rights, the parties and procedures are , supervision and other aspects. This revised draft defines the scope of transfer, focusing on the transfer of land management rights. The transfer methods include leasing, shareholding, etc., and the name of the regulation is changed from &quot;Measures for the Administration of Transfer of Rural Land Contract Management Rights&quot; It is the &quot;Measures for the Administration of Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights&quot;.
Separate management measures will be issued to regulate the transfer and exchange of land contract management rights.
The &quot;Opinion Draft&quot; points out that in the context of &quot;separation of three rights&quot;, farmers only have land management rights for a certain period of time.
Theoretically speaking, even if bankruptcy liquidation occurs, farmers only have the risk of losing their management rights for a certain period of time. Therefore, it is no longer necessary to provide that the contracted land should be returned to the original contracting household, and it also conflicts with the Bankruptcy Law.
In order to prevent farmers from the risk of losing their land, methods such as preferred shares, rent first and shares later, and buyback have emerged in practice.
Considering that preferred shares have relatively mature theoretical discussions in corporate law, it is recommended that they be used as an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of losing land when investing in shares.
