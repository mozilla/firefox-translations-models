Civil rights groups issue travel warnings for Missouri
Due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the Association for the Advancement of Colored People of America (NAACP) issued a travel warning to people of color who are preparing to travel to Missouri.
"The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, effective August 28, 2017, calls for all African American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to exercise special care and extreme caution when traveling to Missouri due to a series of recent suspicious racially sexual incidents," the group's statement declared.
NAACP noted that a recently passed Missouri law that made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits and that the state's enforcement targeted minorities to some extent prompted the organization to issue a travel warning.
Violations of civil rights are happening to people.
They were stopped for questioning, beaten or killed because of the color of their skin," Missouri NAACP President Rod Chappell told The Kansas City Star.
"We have received many complaints, an unprecedented number. ”
This is the first such warning issued by the group in the United States against a state.
The group cited racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black male from Tennessee.
Earlier this year, Sanders died under suspicious circumstances. He ran out of fuel while traveling in Missouri and was detained by Missouri police without charge of a crime.
The consultation also noted that a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office showed that "black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped for questioning than whites."
"The consultation was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri," Chappell said. ”
"People need to be prepared, whether it's traveling to Missouri with bail or letting relatives know they're traveling in-state."
According to the latest data from the FBI's Hate Crime Reporting Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 and ranks 16th in the nation based on the number of crimes.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law that will make it harder to sue businesses for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, U.S. states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain immigration violators, a move the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said would increase the number of racial lawsuits and issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona.
Travel advisories are usually issued by the U.S. government for other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have taken this approach in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
After experiencing the "golden age" of box office surge in 2015, the overall film market in 2016 entered a cooling-off period, and whether it can break through last year's total box office performance of 44.069 billion yuan has become a suspense.
According to the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, in October, the prices of new and second-hand houses in Beijing both cooled, rising by only 0.6% and 1.1% month-on-month.

BBC Says Beijing Becomes the Most Exciting City: Making Foreigners Feel "Living in a New Era"
Reference News Network reported on January 18 that British media said that Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly transforming into today's modern charming city.
With its blazing-fast internet, cutting-edge technologies such as facial recognition software, huge investment in artificial intelligence and unrivalled cosmopolitanism, the Chinese capital is one of the most exciting cities for exploratory foreigners.
According to a report on the BBC website on January 16, German expatriate Clemens Seich said: "If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere in the future." He was quoting the lyrics of singer Frank Sinatra singing the praises of New York City.
Sehi, who works as creative director of Traveler's Archives magazine, said: "If Sinatra had lived to this day, he would probably have sung about a city like Beijing." Living in the city, he says, makes you feel "living in a new era" and always keeping up with trends.
Simon Norton, who is originally from England but recently lives in Beijing, wrote on his blog site 4Corners7Seas: "There is a general feeling that people are at the center of some kind of grand thing, which is difficult to articulate, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it will become, and they want to see it for themselves. ”
The city's high-quality, high-speed internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever, the report said.
Andy Peñafelt, from Manila who is currently deputy editor-in-chief of the Beijing Kids website, said: "Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society, with the internet integrating the functionality of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions. ”
But smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing's technological ambitions, with facial recognition software already widespread and many mobile apps using it to make bank transfers and payments, get people into apartments and offices, and even verify the identity of ride-hailing drivers, the report said.
Beijing also recently announced plans to spend 13.8 billion yuan to build an artificial intelligence technology park that will be home to more than 400 companies that will focus on developing AI technologies ranging from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food is also at the heart of many of China's major festivals over the years, and participation in these celebrations is highly regarded by foreigners, with the Spring Festival being the most important social and economic festival and one of the easiest for foreigners to participate in.
"I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year, cleaning the apartment is just as important as sticking a red couplet with a New Year's greeting on the door, and on Chinese New Year's Eve, all family members gather for a hearty meal, and then keep the New Year until midnight to welcome the New Year with brilliant fireworks," Sehi said. For foreigners, spending the evening with friends and family is indeed an opportunity to integrate. ”
The number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but the language barrier in China and the ease of communication between expatriates can easily excuse them from fully assimilating into the local culture, the report said.
"Some foreigners have been living in China for many years but have little experience with their host country," Sehi said. If your initial attempts to reach out to Chinese were not successful, it is easy to feel that it is easier to get along with other foreigners.
In these so-called "foreigner bubbles", foreigners mingle only among foreigners and do not come into contact with the locals and their culture, where foreigners huddle in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and have only foreigners among their friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin – it's easier than one might think.
"An hour or two of private Chinese lessons a week or an introductory radio drama should fit everyone's busy schedule," Sehi said. ”
Learning even a few classic phrases can be helpful for shopping, ordering food at a restaurant, or chatting in a taxi.
Stubborn air pollution is also a fact of everyday life, but in recent years the government has tried to curb some of the problems, the report said.
Residents stress the importance of getting outdoors during the warmer months, when pollution tends to be lighter, and using those blue sky days as an opportunity to wander the historic hutongs or explore the popular Ritan Park.
"Beijing is the Chinese city that has the most to discover below the surface, with great art and music activities, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and old hutong districts," Norton said. ”
According to the report, the hindrance of aging on the growth of human capital is becoming increasingly obvious, especially in the northeast region, where the average annual contribution rate of aging to the growth of human capital is -1.28%.
Pan Gongsheng pointed out that at present, the risk of cross-border capital flow is controllable, and the fundamental factors supporting the balance of payments still exist for a long time.
Beijing, December 17 (Reporter Gao Kai) The world is brilliant because of heritage - the 2016 International Summit Forum on the Appraisal, Restoration and Protection of Chinese Ancient Calligraphy and Painting opened at the Chinese University of China on December 17.
In April, the European Commission accused Google of forcing phone makers to pre-install software such as Google Search and Chrome browsers to prevent them from using other Google apps.
The European Commission considered the move to be detrimental to consumers and discouraged competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
If convicted of antitrust charges, Google faces fines of up to 10% of its global revenue, or about $7.4 billion.
Google has not immediately commented on this.
Google is also facing an EU investigation for favoring its own shopping services in its search results.

A picture to understand: Bitcoin's legal status around the world
Abstract: In addition to the price correction naturally caused by speculative properties, the current round of digital currency crash is also related to the "old enemy" - regulatory risks.
Judging from the visual map, Eastern countries are more conservative towards Bitcoin than the West, and the countries that account for the majority of the world are still waiting to see the legitimacy of digital currency, which means that the "black swan risk" is still very large.
*This article is from Wall Street News (WeChat ID: wallstreetcn), edited by Wang Mu. For more information, please visit the wallstreetcn.com or download the Wall Street News app. *
With the regulatory storm in major Bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union, the global digital currency led by Bitcoin has suffered a bloodbath this week, with the price of Bitcoin falling below the psychological integer of $10,000 on Tuesday and the biggest one-day decline in three years.
In addition to the price correction naturally caused by speculative properties, this round of digital currency crash is also related to the long-standing "old enemy" - regulatory risks.
At this important juncture, the visual big data website HowMuch.net produced a map showing the legitimacy and regulation of Bitcoin in various countries around the world.
As you can see in the chart below, green represents the legitimate market for Bitcoin, orange represents a neutral market that has not yet publicly legalized its status but has no major restrictions on its use, pale pink represents a restricted market where local governments are trying to approach the use of digital currencies through redline policies or regulations, dark pink represents countries where Bitcoin is defined as illegal, and gray is a country that has not yet commented.
(Above HowMuch.Net image from the visualization team on January 15)
The article points out that from the distribution of non-green color blocks in the figure, it can be seen that the traditional Eastern countries have a more conservative attitude towards Bitcoin than the West.
Russia is currently the largest country to define Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries that have not yet commented on Bitcoin and have no policies in place.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of Bitcoin, i.e., the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
Views on Bitcoin are clearly divided across the Middle East and Latin America, with a more mixed distribution of color patches in these regions.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Brazil are all legitimate bitcoin markets, while Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, etc. have a certain degree of restrictions on their trading and use, and more Latin American countries have not yet spoken out about bitcoin.
Based on the above data, it can be seen that a total of 99 countries (or 40%) of the 246 countries in the world do not impose restrictions on the trading and use of bitcoin, that is, green and orange regions.
Seven countries (or 3%) have restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4%) define Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53%) have no more information about digital currencies (gray).
This shows that the countries that account for the main body of the world (53%, more than half) are still waiting to see the legitimacy of digital currencies led by Bitcoin in their territories, and it also represents that the "black swan risk" of Bitcoin is still very large, because some of these countries may eventually make legislative decisions to restrict digital currencies.
The article argues that global regulators have not yet fully understood the emerging category of digital currency, which may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made a statement.
Although Bitcoin's "popularity" has grown exponentially since last year, it does not mean that all countries are interested, and some countries may be worried about the threat of local fiat currencies as a result, or more worried about digital currencies being exploited by criminal organizations.
Wall Street Insider has written a detailed summary of the international regulatory news against Bitcoin since last week, including China's crackdown on centralized online platforms and mobile apps for OTC-like exchanges, South Korea's ongoing consideration of shutting down digital currency exchanges, and the European Union's belief that Bitcoin has not yet been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of "losing all their money".
The editor-in-chief of Wall Street News has mentioned that from the perspective of supervision, acceptance/criticism, and adoption, 2018 will become the first year of digital currency for global central banks.
Russia and other major countries criticize Bitcoin's legitimacy in order to make way for the official issuance of digital currency.
Madrid, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona's new signing Philippe Coutinho made his debut in a Barcelona jersey at Camp Nou on the 8th.
Coutinho passed Barca's medical examination that morning and signed a contract with Barca president Bartomeu that expires in the summer of 2023.
He then appeared as a Barcelona player in front of nearly 7,000 fans at Camp Nou.
According to Spanish media, Coutinho's total transfer fee may reach 160 million euros (1 euro is about 7.77 yuan), which is the first value in the history of Barcelona Club and La Liga.
With Coutinho still injured, he still needs to rest for nearly 20 days before he can make his debut in a Barcelona shirt.
What else is sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The most certain sign of regime change was when they began attacking the statue.
Americans agree with this as much as anyone else. Thus, in 2003, Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Paradise Square was orchestrated to topple him.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration's key think tanks, must have known what would happen when he was arguing with CNN's Jim Acosta about the president's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, a group of cruise ship owners and liberal followers would surely have eaten him alive.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially when Emma Lazarus' famous poem was inscribed on the pedestal in 1903 (the monument was erected 17 years later).
As Miller rebuked Acosta and said, "I don't want to talk about the whole facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ...... symbol of American freedom to light up the world."
The poem you are referring to, which was added later, is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. ”
In fact, Miller was right, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
This relates to the modern echoes of Lazarus' astonishing words, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrant, but the poorest of the poor: "Thy weariness, thy impoverishment, or thy huddled crowd longs to breathe freely, / The miserable reject thy crowded beach." ”
There is no such thing as "suffering people refuse" at a moment when our screens become more glaring.
Miller, who did not work as a literary critic, made it clear that these people would not be popular in Trump-era America.
This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually in conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends, who held events after her death to inscribe her verses on pedestals, were well aware of the highly political nature of the actions they were participating in.
The purpose of the sculpture is to express the connection between French and American republicanism through the archaic classic metaphor of being the female embodiment of Lady Liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poems, the female figure was no longer abstract, she had to speak.
She gave herself a very different name: Mother of Exile.
The combination of the poem and the painting was a successful feminist coup d'état and a devastating blow to American nativism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have always wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker, Rush Limbaugh, a baptist at the time of Trump, argued in 2010 that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, and that he was now an early neoconservative who brought the flame of American wisdom to a world of ignorance: "Liberty is unstoppable.
Her intention was to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to illuminate America's path. ”
Unusually, Limbo was actually struck by something.
The significance of the statue depends entirely on the perspective of cognition.
Lazarus' most imaginative approach was to be able to see it. When tired, poor but hopeful people will be able to see it on the deck of a ship after a long and often frightening journey.
On the face of it, it is a question of how those seeking refuge and having the opportunity to improve their lives see the world.
The hope and welcome that her statue conveyed to them and needed them to hear.
Of course, this is not a point that Miller and Trump have ever wanted to admit.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to ignite hatred that is their only source of strength.

World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish players in the Great Britain national team
Eilidh Doyle recalls that there were only two Scots in the British national team.
British Athletics Executive Director Neil Black said the 16 strong Scots in the World Championships squad would make a "huge contribution to the national team".
The largest number of Scottish field athletes selected to compete at the 2017 World Athletics Championships in London, which kicks off on Friday.
According to Black, "Scotland is making extraordinary progress" and British athletics athletes must learn from it.
"We accept and try to understand this, and we're going to stick with it until we succeed," Blake said.
"I spoke to the Scottish Sports Academy. They think it has something to do with what they do.
Scottish track and field athletes believe it has something to do with their actions.
British Athletics believes it has something to do with what they did.
Even people on the street think so.
Whatever the case may be, this is extremely brilliant. “
A number of Scottish track and field athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will face Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle is captained by the group.
"Led is a bit modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," Blake said.
"A lot of track and field athletes, whether they're Scots-old or not, or wherever they live or train, walk out the door with pride and energy.
The passion and genuine affection that Led naturally put into it is very good. ”
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at his fifth World Championships, said it was "incredible" that there were 16 Scots in the British national team.
Previously, the maximum number of Scottish track and field athletes competing at the World Championships was seven, which is the number achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle runner Muir is the leader. In the past year, she has set five British records and two European records.
She will compete in the 1500m and 5000m events.
Chris O'Hare, competing in the 1500m, is another Scottish athlete to watch, having had a very successful season, winning the British National Pairs Qualifiers and the Olympic Anniversary Races.
Doyle recalls her first World Championship, when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was proud that so many of her compatriots not only joined the team, but in some cases, would also challenge for medals and compete for the final.
"What's special about being captain of the national team is that it's voted for by the rest of the national team. So it's a great honour for me to know that your teammates voted for you to go for something extremely unusual", she added.
'Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scottish players.
It just goes to show how far we've come.
And they're all veteran track and field athletes here, track and field athletes who are about to finish on the podium.
How was my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's pretty good.
I just referred to the fact that in this case we were very lucky because we were hosting the World Championships at home stadium.
So it's really important that we're going to be able to grow with the support of our home stadium and because we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I'm going to get a second chance to play and the atmosphere is going to be fantastic. ”

Block critics on Facebook: If you can't stand the blame of voters, don't run for office
Our Founding Fathers understood the style of bad media.
Americans love Washington, but it wasn't long before the major newspapers began lashing out at him for everything from domestic policies to political principles.
He was annoyed by the criticisms, no doubt.
But he did not silence these critics.
For as early as 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech is taken away – and we are slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance." ”
It reminds me of Maryland's Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 people's posts for posting their views on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as sloppy, and online reports were rife with their outcry: "Who cares?"
A lot of people say, "It's just Facebook." ”
But, it's important.
This is especially important because you're dealing with someone like Hogan.
This is a Republican who serves as governor in a democratic-majority state, and he's surprisingly popular.
He received the second-highest praise among the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan was not a reactionary impatient.
He was in charge of Maryland smoothly and strictly followed the rules.
He is also very adept at using Facebook as his primary way of connecting with his constituents, playfully showing his post-chemotherapy baldness for the first time on his homepage.
So blocking people who come to the governor's homepage to comment is completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous. This homepage is a public forum and an official management platform advertised by the public's tax-paid staff.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Amelia Schass, a spokeswoman for Hogan, defended the governor's actions, saying she believed that blocking their comments was nothing more than an attempt to get them to refrain a little.
But they are too hasty to describe it as a flood beast or a cynic sweeping the web.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with people who had been blocked by Hogan.
They're just ordinary people talking to their elected leaders: teachers, small business owners, and pastors, not some kind of beast.
They all said that their comments were in-depth, respectful, and not lewd.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Ramani, a barrister from Maryland Bowie, was not cynical, but she asked questions about hate crimes.
She wrote in the Washington Post's News Story Comments section, "I politely commented that I was disappointed that he didn't respond to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also don't like a group of people commenting on the same topic, because these people will be directly ignored by some people, thinking that they are a so-called herd mentality, rather than treating them as a group of citizens who are worried about the country and the people. ”
What the governor's staff calls "intensive spam bombardment" may seem to others as "sticking to the word."
The Facebook era has made it easy to modify a message by simply blocking a detractor or deleting a negative comment.
And the clean-up is much cleaner than in the past, when staff were sent out to collect and burn critical newspapers or protesters arrested or silenced.
But that's really what's happening right now, but on a digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for silencing others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
A landmark ruling emerged in Virginia last week on such issues.
According to District Judge James C. Kacharis in Alexandria, the chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment by blocking voters from her Facebook page.
Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevan (R) has also been patronized by the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's era, affordable postage and the Internet had a similar impact.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters were written violently criticizing his leadership.
And even at that time, Washington had an anonymous flood beast against him.
Pseudonyms such as Eurekla, Valerius, Belisarius, and Bojus were written to the newspaper to harshly criticize Washington's decision-making.
His office was inundated with petitions criticizing his attitude toward the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King and the United States of America, which was signed with Great Britain, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Newspaper Online Project.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of dissent, and freedom of speech are the foundation of this country.
And true leaders need to accept that.
The slightest disturbance in the property market affects people's sensitive nerves.
Purchase restrictions are a hard bar in many urban real estate control policies.
In May 2017, Jinan issued a regulation that undergraduate students who pay social security for half a year can enjoy the same housing purchase policy as local permanent residents;
In June, Wuhan issued a policy stipulating that college students can settle down within three years of graduation with their graduation certificates and employment permits.
Subsequently, the policy was increased, and the official said that "college students can buy a house at a price 20% lower than the market price";
In July, Chengdu issued regulations that young talents with a bachelor's degree or above from other universities can apply to settle in Chengdu with their graduation certificates.
In addition, cities or regions such as Kunshan and Shanghai Lingang have also introduced policies related to "talent introduction" to lower the threshold for talents to purchase houses and settle down.
Zhang Hongwei believes that this is actually the competition for the population, especially talents, and the city can be competitive only by retaining the population, especially talents, which is the most important significance of these real estate policies.
Some people even believe that this means that the time has come for the "purchase restrictions" in the property market to be lifted.

Ronan Lafferty is looking forward to enjoying the feeling of coming home at the Renaissance Club
The East Lothian Renaissance Club hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Evergreen Open, and former European champion Ronan Lafferty will enjoy the feeling of coming home for the next three days.
The Northern Irishman led next door Archerfield Links to the final last year but ultimately lost to Paul Ears. He is now working for the new venue, representing Jerry Salvati, the club's founder and CEO, as an ambassador for the event.
"I witnessed the founding of the Renaissance Club, and we will also witness its glory through this competition," Lafferty said.
Athletes will see the best of this pitch and the best of its finest.
Jerry made this place unparalleled.
He is an avid supporter of the competition and is proud of what he has achieved here.
This is the best stage to showcase this stadium. ”
Englishman Ears is looking forward to defending his title for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in a 32-year career.
The Southport athlete said: "It's really very special.
I didn't defend the Extremadura Open because the tournament was canceled the year after I won.
It feels amazing to come to this place,
Golfing here is wonderful.
Memories of last year come back one by one, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year's win has a special meaning for us.
It was truly a special memory that we will always remember. ”
Back in his native race was Gary Orr, who turned 50 earlier this year and then also competed on the European Evergreen Tour.
This is his first Scottish tournament since the 2013 Scottish Open.
Helensburg native Orr said: "There is always more meaning in returning to your hometown.
You want to do well, but you can feel that extra pressure.
I'm really enjoying being able to play again, I've been playing golf.
I'm happy with the current situation. ”
Joining the trio are former Masters winner Ian Woosnan and Evergreen champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNuitty.
There were six Scottish athletes on the field, with Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance being two of them, the other four being Andrew Odercohen, Stephen McAllister, Bill Lang Miu and Ross Drummond.

Zou Shoumin, director of the Environmental Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, introduced in Beijing on the 22nd that in August, a total of 57 cases of continuous punishment were implemented nationwide, and the newly revised "Environmental Protection Law" implemented at the beginning of this year significantly increased China's environmental law enforcement.
At present, environmental protection authorities across China can investigate and punish environmental violations by imposing penalties on a daily basis, sealing and seizure, limiting production and stopping production, and transferring them to administrative detention, and cooperate with the judicial authorities to punish environmental crimes.
According to Zou Shoumin, in August, a total of 335 cases of sealing and seizure, 177 cases of limiting or suspending production, 189 cases of administrative detention were transferred, and 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution crimes were transferred to various parts of China.
Among them, Henan has imposed 7 consecutive penalties on a daily basis, and at present, China is comprehensively strengthening environmental pollution control from terminal control to full embeddedness.
Although the downward pressure on the economy has emerged, China's Ministry of Environmental Protection has previously made it clear that China should correctly handle the positioning of environmental protection in economic development and enhance "green determination".
There is no highest, only higher, and Kweichow Moutai's share price can't stop on the road to a new high.
On January 9, the share price of Kweichow Moutai, the "king of shares" of A-shares, hit a record high again, closing at 782.52 yuan as of the close, with a total market value of 983 billion yuan, just one step away from the trillion market value.
The guide price of 1,499 yuan has increased by 200 yuan from the previous retail price of 1,299 yuan.
On December 28, 2017, Kweichow Moutai announced that after research, it was decided to appropriately raise the price of Moutai products from 2018, with an average increase of about 18%.

Is it that the next toilet that our tourists want to enter will be out of paper, so this is also what we are particularly emphasizing in the new three-year plan
It is necessary to solve this imbalance and inadequacy
To push the toilet revolution deeper is to think more about what the masses think.
There must be a third toilet to facilitate family members to accompany the elderly and children to the toilet.

It has already achieved great results, and actively promoting the toilet revolution can not only help people stay away from disease, but also drive economic development and narrow the regional development gap.
This toilet problem is a general problem and a node in the development of a social problem.

Poverty and death in Golden State, Indonesia
Badtina Daijay doesn't use a stove when she cooks.
She rarely even uses a pot.
Her wooden house is located in Enarotali, the capital of Paniyai county in Indonesia's Papua province, where the housewife usually just puts a sweet potato — known locally as "nota" — directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the burnt sweet potato was eagerly taken out by a pair of unwashed hands and devoured.
Dai Jie sat on the dirt floor—she had no furniture, and this was where she did her daily household chores, such as doing laundry, which was muddy and got from a nearby swamp.
There is a bucket in a room without a roof, and this is the outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to the fields to take care of her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, it was dangerous to work late at night: most of the men in the village were unemployed, and many were drunk, plus there were a lot of soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she said. ”
It's a rare glimpse of everyday life in the Papua Highlands, a former Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after a 1969 referendum, but that referendum was also controversial when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands in front of the troops occupying the area.
The current strong campaign for independence against Dutch rule soon turned its finger at the Jakarta government, which imposed repressive rule over the region and isolated foreign journalists and activists.
In 2003, the province was officially split into the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Ena Rotali is remote and inhospitable, and it's a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to Nabira, followed by a five-hour rental car.
There is no public transport here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, wooden houses are surrounded by bamboo fences, and the folded tin roofs are various yellow-brown coverings made of rust.
Very few Indonesians come to China, let alone journalists, and there are almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian preachers, me Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tame.
There are other changes here as well.
Dai Jie said: "We are not used to wearing these clothes. She was referring to her brightly colored hand-woven bandana, dark blouse and bright skirt.
"We used to cover our bodies only with leaves. ”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and has the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also the golden continent of Indonesia.
Located in the highlands, Paniai County is about the same size as New Jersey and is home to 153,000 people. The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Glasberg, is only 60 miles away, and is owned by Phoenix-based Philip McMoRan Copper & Gold.
In 2015 alone, Phillips mined approximately $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua is rich in timber resources, with an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, these abundant resources are also a source of tragedy for the Papuans, which has enabled Indonesia's strong military to keep them at bay.
A 2005 New York Times investigative report revealed that Philip paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, a whopping $150,000 for officials alone.
The Papuans' growing demand for independence threatened the patron, who was subjected to cruel treatment.
Since 1969, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian military, according to activists.
According to the Asian Commission for Human Rights, mass massacres in the Papuan tribal highlands in the 1970s have escalated into genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane, "We Will Lose Everything," contains evidence of the previous year's most egregious abuses, such as extrajudicial executions, torture – another report says rape and electrocution were particularly common – and a brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
Andreas Halsono, an Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: "Violence happens every day, so it's hard to count the number of victims." ”
Papua's resources attracted a large number of immigrants from outside Indonesia, and the oppression began.
Eighty-three percent of the province's population of 3.5 million are Christians, but the demographics of the province changed when Muslim economic migrants arrived from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Javanese food stalls sell fried chicken and vegetable mixed gadogado with peanut butter.
The locals fought hard.
Apos You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura to find work, explains: "Those immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables at a lower price than the local Papuans in traditional markets.
This has deprived the local Papuans – the Papuan women (mama-mama) – of their market. ”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo (popularly known as Jokowi) vowed during his 2014 campaign to address inequality and abuse of power in Papua.
The former carpenter's path to the Jakarta Presidential Palace is supported by 27 of the 29 districts – including Paniai.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and today, the locals feel betrayed.
"We are heartbroken, and in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the hope that he would fulfill our wish and restore fairness," Yu said. ”
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Pania suffered his worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Ena Rotali were singing Christmas carols outside in front of a bonfire when two Indonesian soldiers suddenly rushed over on motorcycles.
The frightened children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to the local priest, Yawit Tebai, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and subsequently returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said the drunk soldiers were chasing the children with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers opened fire on the group of children.
16-year-old Julianus Yemo was beaten badly and fell into a coma.
A few hours later, a raging fire broke out in the building of the Election Commission of a nearby government agency, and the incident escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
Armed with ceremonial hunting bows, they do the waita dance of the Papuan me Pago tribe – running in circles and mimicking birdsong.
Some protesters began throwing stones at regular military posts.
According to an official document seen by Time magazine, when emotions continued to intensify, the soldiers received an order via internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot immediately." But the document was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayamu, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, sensed impending danger and called on the crowd to calm down and begged them to go home.
But no one was in the mood to listen to him.
Standing on the porch of his brightly colored wooden house, he told Time magazine, "When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist. ”
Kayam still doesn't know who fired the shot, but he said the bullet came from among the gathered soldiers.
He added: "It was crowded, they fired a lot of shots. ”
According to a cousin of a local, Olfuus Yule, he witnessed the shooting and saw Ofjus Yule being shot three times.
Juhanes sadly told Time magazine, "I ran over to check his body to see if it was him,
I found out he was dead...... I kissed him. ”
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yuje Mende told reporters that his subordinates were only "protecting" the police station because it had been attacked.
In 2015, Papua Police spokesman and Police Chief Pugio Sulistio said, "When someone threatens to kill us, we have to defend ourselves."
It's a matter of life and death. ”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
The next day, news of the killing spread slowly only in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura in which he expressed deep sympathy for the victims' families and vowed to address the legacy of Papua's history of abuse.
"I hope that this case will be resolved as soon as possible so that it will not happen again in the future," he said. ”
In October 2016, Security Minister Vilando said he wanted to set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical problem of human rights violations.
But the excuse for shirk also sounded almost immediately.
"Most of the violations took place a long time ago," he said.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but this will require a process. ”
Then on June 5 in Jakarta, Vilando went back on his word during a conversation with Time magazine, saying that he had no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be settled according to the law." ”
The United Nations has filed charges against Wilando for "crimes against human rights" in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the bloody independence votes in East Timor in 1999, but he said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai incident scoffed at these claims.
"I've had four interviews in the last three years, but things haven't progressed at all," Juhanes said. ”
Years later, he said, "I'm tired. ”
He still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he said.
I was afraid of being arrested by the army, I was afraid of being shot. ”
His brother Yukabus also thought that the people of Paniai were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
"After burying the body, the military came looking for me," he said. ”
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deyai district, a neighboring county in Pani Ai.
A construction company manager refused to help transport an unconscious man to the hospital, and the two sides clashed, one died and 17 others were injured, including children.
Lavianus Dovu, a 24-year-old man, died on his way to the hospital after drowning while fishing in a nearby river.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's on-site office.
Police said villagers threw stones at police, so officers fired warning shots.
But the riot mobile unit (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot into the crowd, and one person was killed.
Domingu Buddy, 29, told Time magazine, "We were all panicked and now we're scared that they're going to retaliate." "He lived near the hospital and witnessed the wounded being rushed to the hospital.
"I hid at home for two days. ”
The Dhay parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and for the mobile riot units to be withdrawn from the area.
Pania has always been a place of right and wrong for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has fostered discontent among the me, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, scattered in the lush central highlands of Paniai.
Many joined the Free Papuan Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by dispersing raids and raids to kidnap Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Paniai, including Tadius Yugi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result, thousands of Panai have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military in recent years under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty".
Some never showed up again.
In the eyes of Papuans, Pania is a "forgotten land of tragedy".
Poverty breeds resentment.
The rice sold in Enarotali is so small that the locals simply can't afford it.
Bread is simply out of reach.
The people here grow everything they can eat: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and each woman can take care of four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for domestic use, and sell the rest at the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes are worth only 10,000 rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has widened among local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased significantly since the opening of the new route to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist often go to better-educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run a competitive company.
John Gobay, president of the Paniai Tribal Council, said, "Young people don't want to stay in this village...... Because there is no work and no money here. ”
Papua is isolated.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Longchamp were expelled from Papua because they "did not cooperate with the relevant agencies", even though they had obtained rare filming authorizations.
According to Felim Kane, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election vow to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not been fulfilled.
"If foreign journalists try to cover Indonesia's easternmost disgruntled provinces, Papua and West Papua, they are at new risk: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement. ”
The absence of media surveillance means that international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely confined to Papua's neighbors.
In March, six Pacific countries – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands – asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "all kinds of widespread human rights violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries also supported the Free Papua Movement.
Indonesia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Armanata Nasir, who was unfazed by the group's accusations, told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still democratic and has a free media, so evidence of human rights violations is difficult to cover up." ”
Locals want more attention from foreign governments.
When Dutch human rights ambassador Keith van Barr led a delegation of officials to visit Jayapura on May 4, the local people broke their silence and pleaded, "We want to be free," according to a person familiar with the matter. He also attended that meeting, but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
The chairman of the tribal council, Gobay, said that "Jokowi's intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people who were involved in the Paniai shooting." ”
He wanted Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai not only live under the threat of a greedy army, but also have nothing, that the area has little education and poor public health care.
Gobay said that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, believe that the vote they cast for Jokowi is a debt that he must repay.
"They don't need money, they need justice," he said. ”
Even under threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting made one last symbolic resistance: burying the body of a victim opposite the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let the culprits forget their crimes.
Yukabus bowed his head and said, "My family was killed,
What else can we do?"
On February 10, 2017, the China Securities Regulatory Commission approved the initial application of Guangdong Shangpin Home Delivery Home Furnishing Co., Ltd., and issued a listing pass for the small and medium-sized board of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, more than 20 days after the initial IPO of Opai Home Furnishing was passed.
Industry insiders believe that with the successive listings of Shangpin Home Delivery and Opai Home, the field of customized home furnishings, which is already on the tuyere, will shift from product competition to capital competition.
At the beginning of the new year, the news that Shangpin Home Delivery, a typical representative brand in the field of custom home furnishing, was about to be listed attracted the attention of the entire home furnishing industry.
Reuters said on the 9th Beijing time that Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. on Tuesday released the first set of components for self-driving vehicles, as well as infotainment solutions jointly developed with Harman International, which is an important move for the company to enter the automotive electronics market.
Samsung Electronics acquired Harman International about a year ago.
At this week's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Samsung unveiled automotive cameras with collision warning, lane departure warning and cruise control features developed in partnership with Harman.
Samsung plans to start shipping the camera system this year, which is built on machine learning and augmented reality technologies.
Samsung also showcased a "digital cockpit" that allows the driver to be more personalized, even if the driver is not the owner, as it allows users to download the driver's information from their mobile devices and the cloud.

The fire once again engulfed Dubai's "Torch" skyscraper
On Friday, a fire broke out in one of the world's tallest residential buildings in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-tall, 79-story supertall building.
This is the second fire to sweep through a high-rise building in just two years, and it happened to happen in the skyscraper known as the "Torch".
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported, and no cause of the fire has yet been discovered.
"We were sleeping, and then we were woken up by the fire alarm and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 50 minutes to run down from the 10th floor," a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said the fire brigade extinguished the fire at around 4 local time (0000 GMT) and is cooling the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The accident could reignite concerns around the world about the safety of façade materials used in high-rise buildings.
An investigation conducted by the management of the Torch skyscraper after its 2015 fire found that most of the damaged objects were cladding façade panels for decoration and insulation.
British police have said they believe problems with the insulation and cladding system at the Grenfell building in London may have been responsible for the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed around 80 people.
The Williams team has also hinted at a possible return for Massa, despite his retirement announcement.
With only one month left on January 9 before the opening of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the atmosphere of the Winter Olympics in South Korea is getting stronger and stronger as the Olympic flame is being relayed from south to north and various preparations are in full swing.
South Korean public opinion expects that this long-lost inter-Korean meeting can bring an "easter egg" to the one-month countdown to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
On 1 November last year, the Pyeongchang Olympic flame arrived in South Korea.
The enthusiasm for the flame was directly reflected in ticket sales for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, ticket sales for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics hovered at 32 percent, and the Paralympic Winter Games ticket sales rate was only 4.3 percent.
However, as Lee Hee-beom, chairman of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Organizing Committee, predicted to reporters not long ago, "as the Winter Olympic flame passes across South Korea, the Winter Olympics are becoming increasingly popular, and I believe that ticket sales will soon improve."
According to South Korean media reports, as of January 3, ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics have reached 64%, and the ticket sales rate for the Winter Paralympics has also exceeded 50%.
In order to encourage foreigners to go to South Korea to watch the games, the South Korean Ministry of Justice also announced on the 8th that it will extend the stay time of foreigners who visit South Korea to watch the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, up to 120 days.
The survey found that more than one in five U.S. travelers carried prohibited items on board
A survey of airplane passengers found that more than 20 percent of passengers had intentionally or unintentionally carried illegal items on board through a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint, and at least 6 percent of those passengers had unintentionally carried prohibited knives or other bladed objects on board.
Less than 1% of passengers claim that they only found out afterwards that they were travelling with a firearm, ammunition or explosives by mistake.
The survey, which looked at more than 1,000 people and was conducted by charter service Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also found that younger travelers were more likely to blatantly ignore the rules.
19.7% of respondents who admitted to intentionally carrying TSA-prohibited items on board were millennials, compared to less than 15% of Gen Xers.
The most common items that deliberately slip past TSA security personnel are food and beverages.
More than 3% admitted to knowingly carrying a bladed object through security, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also said they had intentionally carried illegal drugs on board.
The company said the survey was conducted to understand the number of people who accidentally carried and deliberately carried prohibited items through plane security to board the plane.
Not surprisingly, the people most likely to carry the contraband through security – intentionally or unintentionally – are those who fly the most.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and difficult to understand.
People are often unsure of what and how much liquid they can carry.
So it's no surprise that the TSA seized the most of the banned liquids.
At one point, it was thought that the TSA might have made books an embargo.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
EPA Administrator Pruitt has changed his mind about Obama-era emissions reduction regulations
A day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era regulations to reduce smog air pollutant emissions.
Pruitt proposed the change because the EPA was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state agencies that regulate the environment than previous administrations.
He did not refer to the legal challenge brought by the Federal Court of Appeal against his former office.
At issue is the October 1 deadline for states to begin meeting the 2015 ground-level ozone standard.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would defer compliance by a year to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decision-making or hindering economic growth."
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Prutt was Oklahoma's attorney general and had long opposed the strictning of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Prutt has repeatedly turned to blocking or delaying regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose.
Wednesday's abrupt reversal is the latest legal hurdle on Prut's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency had overstepped his authority in trying to delay enforcement of the Obama administration's rules requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt offered a U-turn on ozone standards, saying that the Environmental Protection Agency would strengthen its commitment to work with states to adopt a complex process to reach new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet a specified deadline and then waited for activist groups and others to sue before agreeing to an agreement to set a specified timetable," Prutt said. He has filed more than a dozen prosecutions against the Environmental Protection Agency in his previous work.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously. ”
Still, the EPA's statement said Prutt may again use his "extension authorization and all other legally available authorizations" to ensure that the regulations are in line with "good policies and the best information available."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a sweeping overwrite of the ozone layer ordinance.
The House bill, approved last month, seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rule for at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, leading a coalition of states this week to sue the EPA, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal – after we filed the lawsuit – is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with more than 115 million American communities directly impacted by smog emissions," Schneidman said. ”
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia have all joined New York in the case.
Ground-level ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants emitted from automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources in the atmosphere when exposed to sunlight.
The resulting smoke can cause serious breathing problems for sensitive populations and cause thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Prut's astonishing transformation.
Lori Ann Byrd, of the Centre for Biodiversity, said: "It is disturbing that this common-sense measure is under tremendous pressure from the heads of departments who protect the air we breathe. ”
"We must fight the Trump administration's ideological campaign to cater to polluters and special interests to the end. ”
In addition to the external factors of the recovery of steel prices, enterprises are also struggling to reduce costs.
With the large-scale resumption of production of enterprises, steel prices began to fall.
At present, neither the China Iron and Steel Association nor the National Bureau of Statistics have released the profit data of the steel industry in June.

Since the second half of 2009, Xiaoshan flower and tree sales volume (amount) has maintained a high trend, especially this spring, Xiaoshan seedling sales hit a record high, sales volume increased sharply, prices soared, according to statistics, from January to June this year, Xiaoshan District seedling sales revenue increased by 48% over the same period last year, the growth rate is the largest in the past 20 years.
Shi Haiyong, deputy director of the Xiaoshan District Forestry Bureau, said that with the good sales situation, the production of flowers and trees in Xiaoshan has also achieved rapid development.
In the past two years, the planting area of flowers and trees in Xiaoshan has expanded by 30,000 mu, and the total area has reached 180,000 mu; at the same time, it has actively developed outside the area, and Xiaoshan seedling farmers have established flower and tree bases in all parts of the country to reach 80,000 mu, an increase of 30,000 mu over 2008.
At the same time as the planting area is expanded, the quality of seedlings has also been continuously improved, the value of nursery storage has been continuously improved, and large-scale and high-quality seedlings have been retained, and some seedlings have been reluctant to sell.
Shi Haiyong also reminded that in the face of the current prosperity of production and sales, producers should face calmly and objectively analyze, not only to see that the society's demand for flowers and trees will be long-term and increasing, but also to realize that market competition will be more intense.
On the morning of July 13, Beijing time, Somaltus filed a lawsuit with the East Texas District Court, accusing Apple of infringing a battery technology patent it applied for in 2010.
The company has previously sued Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony, and Toshiba with the same patents.
The lawsuit alleges that the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,657,386 under the name Integrated Battery Service System.
The plaintiff expects to receive cash damages or royalties for the infringing device after the judgment is announced.
Judging from the complaint, the plaintiffs appear to believe that the iPhone's fast-charging feature infringes the company's patents.
An iPhone with fast charging quickly charges up to 80 percent and then trickles up.
Somaltus is a so-called "patent troll" because the company doesn't offer obvious products and services, and it's hard to find information online.
However, they have successfully reached out-of-court settlements with automakers such as Ford and Nissan over the patent.
The meeting believed that accelerating the development of informatization, promoting the interconnection and integration of resources, efficient utilization, and improving the level of industrial digitalization and intelligence are of great significance to promoting "Made in China 2025" and mass entrepreneurship and innovation, cultivating new kinetic energy, and improving the quality of life of the masses.

According to leaked phone records, Mr. Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post leaked transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States reportedly expressed his displeasure at his public attack on the wall, to which Puterrand allegedly told him: "You don't tell the media. ”
During his presidential campaign, Trump pledged to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and solemnly announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
A transcript of a phone call between him and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also released, which shows a tense exchange between them.
Trump told Malcolm Turnbull that it was "ridiculous," "annoying" and "stupid" for the U.S. to take on the deal for refugees to be deported to Australia, and that he had suggested that the U.S. ban refugee resettlement would make him look like a "fool" by now insisting on a deal brokered by the Obama administration.
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call of the day."
In his acceptance speech, read by the U.S. ambassador to Sweden, Dylan said that he was still on tour when he received the news of the award, and that "it took me a while to react."

Moore Beach Massacre: Activists recreate racist lynchings to deliver justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury rumbled past a crowd of onlookers in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, toward the tiny Moore Beach Bridge.
The car was carrying four black passengers and a white driver, and before the car reached the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward and blocked the car's path.
The leader of the mob – a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit – took a deep puff on his cigar and glanced into the windshield.
The passengers in the car were full of fear.
"We want - Roger!" the man shouted.
"Drag him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged out of the front passenger seat, screaming to pierce the silence.
Fortunately, this horrific scene on July 22 was just a reenactment.
But when "Roger" put a noose around his neck, almost all of the onlookers let out a real gasp.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore Beach Bridge to recreate the night two black couple—Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Merley Dorsey—were lynched and hanged by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"Even though we know who they are, and even though we've seen them in the community, it's incredible that none of them have been arrested over the years," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the reenactment.
"This is a stain on history, a burden on our souls. ”
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia congressman and lifelong rights activist.
For him, the reenactment is a compelling call to action, reminding the Monroe community every year that injustice has never been redressed.
"We want to prosecute, we want to close the case, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he said.
"Unless we get justice, we will not be healed and reconciled. ”
On July 27, 1946, the coroner covers the body of a Moore Beach lynching victim with a sheet.
According to FBI archives obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of involvement in the lynching.
But none of them have ever been prosecuted.
While the suspects have been at large for a decade, civil rights activists say the dual motives for lynching are well known throughout town: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens of Georgia to vote in the primary for the first time later that summer.
According to the FBI, around the same time, black sharecropper Roger Malcolm assassinated white landowner Barnett Hearst in a fight — what looks like it was for a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hearst slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that her baby wasn't her husband's.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, prominent white landowner Roy Harrison released Malcolm from prison on bail for $600.
Dorothy and his cousins, Mai Merry and George Dorsey, accompany him to prison.
But when they returned from prison and were approaching the Moore Beach Bridge, a group of lynchers surrounded the car.
"It turns out that it was Harrison who organized and ordered the execution of this murder," an FBI report concluded.
"It is clear that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement who not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identities of the witnesses. ”
Brooks is very concise and to the point.
"This is a voting rights tragedy," he said. ”
"They were killed, and it was the killers who sent a message to the black people in this community: 'If you sign up and vote, you're going to do the same.'" '”
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been in charge of leading the annual re-enactment of the Moore Beach Bridge lynching.
Her approach is vivid, gripping, and has a deeply racist background. Many people hope that this racism no longer exists in the United States.
It's hard to watch, and it's even harder not to look, but Green says that's the key.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because lynching puts us in front of the ugly side of everybody," she said.
"But if you don't listen to me, or if you don't hear me talk about my experiences, I can't have a relationship with you. ”
This year's show began in June, with nearly 30 actors on the first day — a dozen whites, the rest black — huddled into a room to hear Green deliver a rehearsed overview of the show.
Wade Malbow served as Green's co-director.
He has played the role of the Ku Klux Klan for years, but he says the role has never been easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not that kind of person," Malbow said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to that era. ”
In the room, actors Darios Bradshaw and Nick Lascone, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hurst, rehearse their lines.
The scene begins with Malcolm yelling and pushing Hearst away, angry that he slept with his wife, Dorothy.
"I say, get out of my place!"
Rascona shot back.
Then they fought.
Then everyone (at least all the black actors) burst out laughing.
Green laughed the hardest.
"What's wrong?!, Lascone asked.
He was panicked and confused.
Am I playing too far?
"No," Green said with a laugh.
"I just don't think white people say 'ah' when they fight back. ”
"Yes," another black actor quipped.
"Your tone has to be tough. ”
In this way, the energy in the room changes, and the feeling of camaraderie drives away the discomfort.
Everyone made an effort to do so, not only to put on a show but also to honor the memory of the four victims.
The scene started again.
This time, Rascona said the "ah" in a sharp and powerful tone.
Not a single one laughed.
The reenactment ended forcefully and quickly.
Screams, gunshots, and then silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black stands next to the actor's body, singing Billy Hallotte's eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Her voice drowned out the others.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators were wiping sweat and tears.
The audience was almost evenly split between black and white.
There was a couple who came from Ithaca, New York, to see the show, and many others lived near the road.
Brooks took them to Malcolm and Dorothy's grave for nearly eight hours, all enduring the uncomfortably hot and humid heat of Georgia.
Until this point, the murderer remained a mystery. But now, standing on the same land where lynching took place, anxiety is in the air.
When the last note of the song disappears, Green asks people to come closer to examine the actor's corpse.
The children leaned down, looked at fake blood and corpses, and whispered to each other.
"They're not really dead," a young boy muttered to himself, as if reminding himself.
After a few minutes, Green thanked the crowd before the show ended.
The actor shook off the lynching rope and wiped away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Malbow, the man in a suit who plays the leader of the Ku Klux Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugged his two colleagues and wept in their arms, and the emotion of the performance eventually caught on to him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispered.
"We know you're not like that in your heart.
You do it for a reason. ”
Afterward, the audience sat down to dinner with the actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted intimately with a black couple they had just met, chatting about the reenactment.
Dennis Duplinsky has a hard time finding words to describe how she feels after watching it.
"It's hard to imagine those horrible words and deeds...... It's people like you who say it and do it, because they look like you," she said.
"It really made me think that lynchings were still going on," she added, "and now it's just called a police shooting." ”
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat at a table watching, tasting and reminiscing about civil rights.
He said he was already planning for next year's performance.
"Reenactment is an inspiring way because it describes the horrors we've experienced, but it's also very educational," he said.
"If you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not study and do not understand their own history are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. ”
For the reform of the natural gas market, the importance of the reform of "pipeline network independence" is self-evident, but the resistance and controversy are also greater.
The reporter learned from Hebei Kailuan Group on the 7th that at 11:25 a.m. on the 7th, an explosion occurred in the emulsification workshop of Kailuan Group Chemical Co., Ltd., located in Guye District, Tangshan City, Hebei Province, and 13 operators were trapped at the scene.
So far, among the 13 people trapped, one has been rescued and rushed to the hospital for rescue, and the remaining 12 people are in intensive search and rescue.
It is understood that the scene has been blocked, and the local public security, fire protection, medical and other departments are rescuing at the scene.
According to eyewitnesses, there was a loud bang at the time of the incident, and in an instant a mushroom cloud rose into the sky.
According to the personnel of Kailuan Group who organized the search and rescue at the scene, Tangshan Kailuan (Group) Chemical Co., Ltd. is located in the north of Zhaogezhuang, Guye District, Tangshan City, Hebei Province, and is a designated production enterprise of civil blasting equipment approved by the state, which was founded in 1958 and was formerly known as Kailuan Mining Bureau No. 6 O No. 2 Factory.

US press: Scientists from the Chinese Air Force Engineering University study laser satellites for the removal of space junk
Reference News Network reported on January 18 that Chinese scientists have put forward a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up the cluttered earth orbit and destroy old satellites and their sky garbage.
According to a report on the website of Newsweek on January 15, researchers from China's Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled "Research on the Orbit Change Model of Space-based Laser Removal of Small-scale Space Debris", which describes how space debris can be irradiated into smaller, less harmful debris by laser through the use of space-based platform lasers.
Space junk has been a concern for the International Space Agency for years, and NASA has considered a variety of options for tracking, detecting and removing man-made debris, the report said.
Large-scale space debris can be removed by means of giant nets used to sweep and collect waste, as well as magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies and came to the conclusion that this would be an effective way to clean up the Earth's orbit.
"[The simulation study] provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based platform laser debris removal technology," the abstract of the paper says. ”
A 2014 study by US defense giant Lockheed Martin found that there are about 200 threats per day for satellites in orbit.
High-velocity debris moving along Earth orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions and has been described by experts from the European Space Agency as a "deadly chain of threats". Over the past year, high-velocity debris has continued to increase.
According to a report on the website of Popular Mechanics on January 17, space is basically empty, but the space next to the Earth is becoming more and more crowded. Every satellite we send into space eventually turns into yet another piece of debris orbiting the Earth, and that debris builds up over time.
The more debris, the higher the chance that a satellite that is still functioning will be hit by debris, damaging or destroying a multimillion-dollar investment.
According to the report, all space agencies have plans to remove space junk in the future.
NASA is considering deorbiting the debris with a jet of gas, Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net to capture the debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan's idea is to capture the debris with an electric chain.
Now, China is also proposing a solution to space junk by using a large laser to knock floating space junk into small, less harmful pieces.
According to a paper published in the German monthly journal Optics by a group of researchers from China's Air Force Engineering University, installing such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean up space, at least according to the simulation results.
The only way to confirm effectiveness is to conduct tests, and there are no arrangements for such a mission, but perhaps sooner or later someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space, the report said.
Once that happens, we can finally start eliminating the problem of space junk once and for all.

Pearson Group cut another 3,000 jobs and slashed dividends to revive the business
Pearson, the UK's education group, said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72% as it began another restructuring project to deal with business pressures.
Chief Executive John Fallon said most of the job cuts would take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, after 4,000 jobs had been reduced in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May plans to cut costs by an additional £300 million ($394 million) in its third cost-cutting program to revive businesses hit by the rapid growth of digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann and reported that its underlying sales rose 1% to £2.05bn in the first half of the year, but said the outlook for the year was unchanged.
A few days ago, the Chinese Athletics Association issued a notice in earnest to crack down on the phenomenon of substitute running, and was ready to impose a heavy penalty of a lifetime ban on violators.
A suicide bombing attack on a convoy in Kabul killed NATO soldiers
According to official sources, a military convoy was hit by suicide bombers in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, according to a NATO statement.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident that occurred in the Karabagh area of the city.
This is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan – the bombing of the Herat Mosque on Tuesday that killed more than 30 people.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO statement, there was an explosion on Thursday night, and a joint patrol of Afghan and NATO coalition forces was attacked by "personal improvised explosive devices".
All the injured are currently in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital located at Bagram Air Base, the statement said.
The growing growth of the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State (IS) group in the Karabakh region has raised serious concerns among NATO forces stationed near Bagram, according to journalists.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, while the capital accounted for about 20% of the deaths.
A suicide car bomb attack in a predominantly Shia area of Kabul in late July killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban claimed that they carried out the attack.
On May 31, more than 150 people were killed in a massive explosion in central Kabul, the deadliest militant attack in the country since the U.S.-led multinational force overthrew the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs whether to bolster troops to support his army and police.
The suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the government and its policies, especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani, according to journalists.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) overturned the resolution after a lawsuit, delaying the smog regulations
During Obama's presidency, 15 states prosecuted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for requiring states to curb all types of emissions that cause smog. A day after the indictment, the EPA overturned the rule.
The EPA on Wednesday announced its decision to continue with so-called "2015 Ozone Compliance Zones" and pledged that the EPA would work with states.
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement, "We are confident in our dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to them." ”
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA plans to delay the implementation of the Ozone Standard for Zones – a one-year delay – a measure of existing smog pollution in some areas to determine which areas should reduce emissions that cause smog pollution to meet air quality standards – until October 2018.
Fifteen major Democratic states, as well as the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, claiming the act was illegal.
As part of a broader agenda, President Donald Trump's administration has been working to reinstate various environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama to spur economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked opposition from both Democrats and conservative groups. They are concerned that more emissions will affect public health.
The EPA's website claims that breathing air that contains ozone "reduces lung function and increases respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.

Mackie Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko met for the first time to discuss a possible showdown ahead
The most high-profile boxing bout under 147 pounds will take place shortly after, with Vasily Lomachenko and McGee Garcia, who are currently in a state of possible clash, meeting for the first time on Thursday.
They were in their separate rooms at ESPN's office in Los Angeles, where undefeated World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion Garcia was the first to walk down the hallway to greet World Boxing Organization Super Featherweight Champion Lomachenko.
At Saturday's Showtime, the judges unanimously ruled that Garcia defeated Division 4 World Champion Adrian Broner to emerge victorious, and both fighters are now in the top five in the heavyweight rankings.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "Champion, how are you?"
Good luck. ”
In the ESPN match on Saturday at 7 p.m., Lomachenko preserved his position by defeating Miguel Mariaga.
When the two of them were photographed, Lomachenko's agent, Egis Klimas, noted that a potential matchup between the two fighters would depend on "perfect size."
"I was a lightweight before," Garcia said.
"I moved up the class to fight Broner (140 pounds), but I wasn't that heavy.
Compared to 140 pounds, I weigh a little bit.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he has to be lightweight (135 pounds) before we can fight.
That's what fans want too.
Then we will satisfy them. ”
Lomachenko agrees.
"The boxing world needs this fight. ”
Klimas asked if he should pay per charge, and part of his strategy was that Lomachenko had to make his promotional debut against a 135-pounder later this year in order to set a date for Garcia (37-0,30 elimination) next summer. Garcia is also interested in facing off against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after the Forum Lightweight Championship on September 23.
"With all the fans asking this question, this matchup could be a pay-per-view fee," Garcia said. After that, he expressed openness to competing on the web that offers the best financial solutions.
"We are the main characters.
No one else can generate that much attention.
As long as they're ready to ......"
Garcia praised Lomachenko as "a fantastic fighter" and could watch him live on Saturday.
But Lomachenko was hesitant about Garcia's praise, saying he thought the three-division winner from Riverside looked "slow." Sorry, McGee...... You're going to be knocked out. ”
Garcia said the focus is on showing the power of the punches and then the punches.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing matches.
"It's a battle that has to be played.
The level of attention and buzz is unmatched by other boxing matches.
I'm more than happy to compete," Garcia said.
"I've been waiting for a top fighter and this time it's McGee's turn," Lomachenko said.
It's going to be a great matchup. ”

China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) officials' statements on the early completion of the 11th Five-Year Plan emission reduction target have given the steel industry a strong expectation of resumption of production, which has been suppressed by power and production restrictions.
Although the steel mills have not received a clear notice from the local government announcing that the energy conservation and emission reduction work has ended, the industry estimates that around December 15, 2010, the steel mills that were originally limited in production will complete the resumption of production, and steel prices may begin to come under pressure.
At present, we have not received the notice of the end of power rationing and production restrictions, but in fact, the pressure on various enterprises has been much less than in September and October, a private steel enterprise in Hebei Province told reporters.
Some places in Hebei have repeatedly issued documents on power rationing and production restrictions, and once adopted the method of forced shutting down to restrict the production of enterprises.
The reporter learned from local enterprises that steel mills in most parts of Hebei have resumed work, and the pressure of production restrictions has been eased.
Zhang Tieshan, an analyst at my steel network, expects that as the north has entered winter, the terminal demand for construction steel will gradually turn from strong to weak.
Coupled with the gradual end of energy conservation and emission reduction, around December 15, most steel mills will basically resume production, and products will arrive in various markets before New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put some pressure on the current rising steel prices.

International Online News (Reporter Liu Pai): On the 18th, the Economic and Commercial Section of the Italian Embassy in China held the China-Italy Environmental Protection Fair, at which people from enterprises and scientific research institutions of the two countries exchanged views on cooperation in the field of renewable resources under the new situation and reached a positive consensus.
It is reported that the Chinese side will mainly participate in the meeting, China Renewable Resources Development Co., Ltd. and China International Technology Transfer Cooperation Network, while the Italian side is composed of the Global Energy and Environment Exchange Organization and the Bologna Regional Enterprise Confederation of Italy.
The representative of Italy said that Italy has a variety of environmental protection technologies and solutions in the field of renewable resources, and proposed to carry out pilot projects with China in three aspects: industrial waste treatment, waste oil treatment and waste incineration treatment equipment, and looked forward to promoting China's environmental cooperation experience to other parts of the world.
The latest results of the Swedish Asylum Asylum Seeker Age Assessment Test have been released
The latest results of the Swedish asylum test, which uses the latest methods to medically assess their age, show that more than 80% of subjects are judged to be over 18 years old, but not everyone is convinced of its accuracy.
The Swedish National Forensic Science Centre (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the test earlier this year.
After allegedly failing to accurately assess the age of some refugees claiming to be minors, the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) designed these tests with a view to providing a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, 6,880 testers have been sent to the Swedish Migration Service, and the Forensic Science Centre has now published the results of a total of 2,481 testers between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
80% (2002) were judged to be 18 years of age or older, although in another 25 tests, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Science determined that the subjects were "likely to be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 tests, the result was that the person was "probably under 18 years old."
The test is only for people whose age is in doubt.
According to John Granson of the Center for Forensic Medicine, these results are consistent with those of previous months.
He told The Local: "The numbers aren't much different from the previous months, the numbers are pretty consistent. ”
The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 years old does not necessarily mean that these asylum seekers have misrepresented their age.
In May, the center published 581 test results and said 442 "indicated that the subject was 18 years of age or older."
News newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of the 581 tests released this time and found that 243 of the subjects had publicly stated that they would turn 18 this year.
X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of joints, followed by analysis by dentists and radiologists, have also been questioned in some areas.
One of those skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Carolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they are experiencing puberty earlier or later than normal age.
He told the newspaper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I don't think the measurement used should be like this.
It is very inaccurate to determine biological age in this way.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can. ”
However, Granson of the Forensic Science Center defends the accuracy of these tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of uncertainty in determining a child as an adult is very small. ”
The biggest risk is that the person happens to be under 18 years old, which is about 10% of cases.
The governor of West Virginia announced a change of party
West Virginia Democratic Gov. Jim Justice announced at President Trump's rally Thursday night that he would change parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats have left me," the governor said.
"Today, after a lot of prayer and a lot of thought, I want to tell you...... Today I'm going to tell you as a West Virginian that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor. ”
The rally erupted in cheers.
"So, tomorrow, I'm going to change my membership to Republican," Justis added.
"As a coach, I'm going to tell it's time to start another game. ”
Trump promised to make a big announcement earlier at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42 percent of the vote in West Virginia, and Justis did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justis was voted the state's only billionaire in 2016.
Forbes notes that he inherited his father's coal industry and owns coal in five states.
Currently, he is worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement late Thursday saying, "Governor Justis' change of party is another blow to the Democratic Party that will not prevent our country from becoming great again, but will make our country great again." ”
"With the Democratic Party currently having only 15 governors and controlling the lowest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justis' statement is the latest rejection of a party that has lost leadership from the top down and has been unable to find a positive unified slogan," Republican National Committee chairwoman Rhona McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Sebastian Coe praised Russia's "frank" apology for the doping scandal
On Thursday, International Athletics Federation President Sebastian Coe praised Russia's apology for the doping scandal, calling it "candid," but reiterating that now is not the time for Russia to rejoin the sport.
The president of the Russian Athletics Federation, Mitry Hiractin, said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country was right to be banned from the sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He expressed his regret that "all the athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were deprived of their medals." ”
Despite his comments, the IAAF General Assembly voted in favor of maintaining the ban. Previously, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report mentioned the discovery of evidence of Russian state-sponsored doping, and the ban was imposed in November 2015.
"I think today's response was very frank, very frank presentation," IAAF president Co told reporters.
"The whole council and the IAAF Congress are very happy...... The Russian Federation admits that it has gone through a very anxious period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can return to the competition. ”
Ko said he was also "happy" that Russia had accepted the criteria for re-entry.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think we have made some progress, but the Athletics Federation supports the recommendations of the task force and now is not the time to reinstate Russia's qualifications," Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can to normalize this situation in the coming months.
Our guiding principle has always been the desire to separate innocent athletes from a contaminated system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes meet the IAAF's strict standards and will compete as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF task force, Funn Anderson, said on Monday that Russia had not yet met several criteria for resuming competition.
He told reporters after a speech to the IAAF Council in London that drug testing was still inadequate and that banned coaches were still coaching.

How do the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris?
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted spending by Europe's biggest football clubs will not prevent Neymar from moving from Spain's FC Barcelona to France's Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) for a record price.
As a result, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has imposed further relegation on Paris Saint-Germain Football Club. The UEFA Union is the governing body of European football competitions and has the power to ban teams from participating in the highly-watched Champions League.
The introduction of the Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP) by UEFA in 2011 meant that Paris Saint-Germain would eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was funded without causing huge losses.
FC Barcelona has already paid €222 million ($262 million) just to cover the Brazilian player's release from his contract, while Neymar's salary will run into the tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Neymar's move to France.
Considering that the team is funded by the deep-pocketed ruling family of Qatar, Paris Saint-Germain could certainly sign Neymar for cash and add him to other star-studded teams.
Clubs can spend huge sums of money on players, but they must use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge sums of money that will allow them to break even on football-related businesses.
The Financial Fair Play Rules were conceived by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
The former Frenchman believes that for clubs that are heavily in debt in pursuit of success, they are actually cheating and risking the destruction of the club if the banks or all the owners withdraw their support funds.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from club debt issues to club loss monitoring.
This change means that Roman Abramovich's business model when he bought Chelsea FC in 2003, which was to buy a club with potential and then spend huge sums of money to improve the team and build a global brand, is now in a more demanding position.
In the three-year Rule evaluation period up to 2018, the club could lose €30 million.
Although Abu was disparaged by the then-president in 2015, UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin remains committed to stopping excessive spending.
"Of course the Rules are not lapsed yet, and we will definitely strengthen the regulations in the future," Andrea Traverso, UEFA's manager for the Rules, told The Associated Press last week.
While Paris Saint-Germain will pay Neymar's buyout clause in a lump sum, it can also allocate the amount for accounting purposes during the term of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could show up as €44.4 million in the annual account for the next five years.
The first wave of Rule sanctions, imposed in 2014, resulted in Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, as well as Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City FC, being the most severe sanctions.
Paris Saint-Germain FC was fined €60 million ($82 million at the exchange rate at the time), which was later reduced to €20 million, and asked for the 2014-15 Champions League season when the team reduced the number of players to 21 instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is eyeing clubs that try to increase their revenues by tying up their owners, defrauding financial regulators.
While companies in Qatar can sponsor Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, UEFA will not consider the sponsorship as legitimate income if the amount of the sponsorship is deemed to exceed the standard market price.
This is what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that Qatar Tourism's sponsorship of Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was overstated.
According to reports, a portion of Neymar's income at Paris Saint-Germain could come from payments from the Qatar 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
However, both Paris Saint-Germain and the organising committee have denied that Neymar will be an ambassador for the World Cup, and it would have been easy for UEFA's regulator to make such a move.
The recent sanctions imposed on Paris Saint-Germain mean that UEFA will be more vigilant against any attempts to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not held pre-discussions with Paris Saint-Germain about Neymar's transfer, according to people familiar with the matter on Thursday.
All of the above individuals were contacted by the Associated Press only in an anonymous capacity, as they were not authorized to discuss the situation at Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
The last published accounts showed that Paris Saint-Germain FC had an operating income of €542.4 million in 2015-16 and a profit of more than €10 million.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not yet been published.
Paris Saint-Germain expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship campaigns, franchises and jersey sales.
The club expects revenue to grow by at least 30% after signing Neymar.
Apparently, the Spanish league was furious to see the departure of one of the most famous players, trying to block Neymar's move and claiming that Paris Saint-Germain FC had violated the Rules.
La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS that "this is a clear example of 'financial doping', that the club and the country are the same", referring to Qatar, which has ultimate ownership of Paris Saint-Germain football club.
Arsene Wenger, the head coach of the Arsenal team, which is owned by an American sports mogul, has reservations about the attitude of the state-funded club and La Liga.
"It's a consequence of ownership, and it's completely changed the whole ecology of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once the country has a club, then anything can happen.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, as there are many different ways or various interests for a country to require big-name players to represent a country. ”
Rokid, a developer of intelligent interactive robots, has received new investment led by Temasek
In recent years, startups in the field of artificial intelligence have continued to be popular with capital.
Artificial intelligence Rokid recently completed a new round of financing, led by Temasek, followed by Credit Suisse, CDIB (an investment arm of Taiwan's China Development Financial Holding Corporation), old shareholder IDG Capital and other institutions.

Nostalgic contagion takes the market by storm – "Hala Summer Camp" and "Detective Couple"
The story is retold as a nostalgic nostalgia for the actors' '80s and the '90s garbage era (before and after David Wayne and Michael Huwart made the sketch comedy "The Nation" for MTV), but also nostalgia for nostalgia itself, nostalgia for 2001, a year before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Luther were not yet in the limelight.
As a cultural artwork, it is an imitation and embodiment of the permanent memories of our Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is running out.
"Day One of Camp" was a great hit, but not just because of its absurd humor (the plot is an original story about a talking canned vegetable, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
The plot doubles down on the use of a central joke – a middle-aged actor playing a mischievous kid – which makes the inability to go back in time part of the hilariousness.
In "Ten Years Later," adults actually play adults, and the emotions are less ingrained and the imitations are more loose, including improvisations on 90s tracking films like "The Hand That Pushes the Cradle."
At one point, a character gets caught up in an Apple notebook, some straight skates, and "some other stuff from 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Mr. Sweetheart (Mr. Hughwart) has now become a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie (Margaret Morrow).
Victor (Ken Marino) remains a virgin.
There is another sinister conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Hughwart), played by George W. Bush. H· W. Bush (Michael Ian Black, impressive) instigated.
As always, the best part of this series is the interjection.
It's especially interesting to see the eternally young Mr. Luther, who showed off Matt Dillon's soul patch in the movie "Single Aristocrat", and Andy from the previous "School Giant" now feels like a giant.
It's a random moment of madness that might power the film, like the recursive Seven Years of Life series, until I come to what I think is the logical conclusion that Hala Camp: Twenty Years Later, and its final act is for the cast to see the movie premiere of Hala Camp.
At the same time, Amazon's "Detective Two" tells a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalist "American Spy Dream," the movie "Bitter City," and even "GLOW: Gorgeous Women's Wrestling League," which imaged wrestling between the East and the West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatwood and Alessandro Tanaka, was pushed onto the television screen by director Reece Thomas: a comedy set in Romania in the 80s and tells the story of two Bucharest officials who struggle for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist line.
The main characters – the hard-core Grigor and the idealistic Athef – are played by Florin Pierschi Jr. and Cornelius Ulic, respectively, with dialogue voiced in English by Channing Tatum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not just an idea.
There are some nice visual gimmicks (cops watch chess on TV to pass the time, because Americans like to play football).
And with a host of celebrity voice actors – including Jenny Slater, Nick Offerman, Mahthalah Hashbaz Ali and Chloe Sevigny – it makes for a great sonic extravaganza.
But "The Detective Two" is so committed to creating a raucous and realistic propaganda comedy — featuring a killer in Reagan's mask — and it usually plays such a role.
The six-episode TV was a little dragged, and the comedic effects weren't released quickly or often.
The length of "The Detective Pair" is more rigorously edited, and it takes on a better incendiary satire during Gregor's repeated visits to the U.S. Embassy, where there are always two fat men gobbling up a bunch of burgers.
For an imaginary communist audience, this message means that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.
The creators of this Romanian fictional story are not wrong, and we even tell stories with our own recent history and their history.
The reporter recently learned from an interview that the efficiency of steel, rail transit, shipbuilding, machinery manufacturing and other industries in Northeast China has generally declined, and even suffered losses.
Some experts believe that under the current situation, a new round of industrial revitalization in Northeast China is not only related to the current round of economic recovery of the country, but also has an impact on the long-term development and international competitiveness of China's manufacturing industry, so it is urgent to adjust and transform.
The general decline in the efficiency of enterprises, the loss of traditional industries, the serious decline in the efficiency of the raw material industry and the heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing industry, and even losses, is the primary manifestation of the industry in the Northeast in this round of economic downturn.

(Hao Qingshun, director of the Metallurgical Department of the Liaoning Provincial Commission of Industry and Information Technology, said that metallurgy is the third pillar industry in Liaoning, with an annual output of 60 million tons of steel production capacity ranking third in the country.
From January to May this year, Liaoning Province's crude steel output was 21.54 million tons, and the production and marketing situation of products required for projects encouraged by national policies and local government construction efforts was better, and the products with fierce market competition declined significantly, which is another feature of the manufacturing industry in Northeast China.

The Bank of England will maintain an interest rate of 0.25%.
The Bank of England will announce that interest rates will remain unchanged at a later date, after weak economic growth and easy inflation dashed hopes of an upward revision.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be "weak" as it reinforces the household income crunch while reining in interest rates.
Policymakers at the bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to maintain interest rates at 0.25%, while a handful of members this month called for higher rates, even as weak economic growth has weakened the upward boost.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England scaled back its growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, and warned that the household income crunch would continue, while inflation would skyrocket to nearly 3% in the autumn.
But it said interest rates will need to rise over the next few years to curb inflation from Brexit, while borrowing costs may need to rise more sharply than expected in financial markets.
A year ago, Brexit led to a large-scale economic promotion policy, and members voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce the end of its term funding scheme and provide cheap funding to banks from February next year, although it says it will now need an additional £15 billion on top of the £115 billion under the scheme.
In the minutes of the interest rate decision, the Bank of England said: "Gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term in the MPC's core projections, as a tightening of household real incomes will continue to weigh on consumption." ”
Regarding interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for "a certain amount of monetary policy tightening" to tame inflation, and that it needs to be done "to a greater extent" than the market expects.
The market is now expecting its first growth in the third quarter of next year and its second in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be "slow" and "restrained".
The bank's growth forecast for this year and next year is trending downward, compared to 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
The bank maintained its forecast for 1.8% growth in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar, followed by the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 against the dollar and 0.4% to 1.11 against the euro.
The unchanged decision comes after rising upward expectations were dashed by recent dismal growth figures. GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter, compared to 0.2% in the first three months.
The bank said growth in the third quarter is likely to remain at 0.3%, although it will end the year with a slight increase.
Ordinary households have been hit by skyrocketing inflation and negligible wage growth, and the Bank of England's recent inflation report did not bring good news to them, as the bank said that tightening would get worse before it got better.
He also said that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the blow to incomes in the next few years, but that wages are expected to recover "massively" by the end of the three-year projection.
At the same time, demand for British goods will increase sharply due to the depreciation of the pound, which will stimulate the economy, offsetting some of the impact of low consumption.
The decision came a year after a shocking EU referendum sent the pound tumbling, with interest rates cut to 0.25% in August.
The Bank of England estimates that it could take up to four years for it to fully affect prices and the UK economy.
Ahead of the bank's latest ruling, calls for interest rate hikes have been loud as inflation has exacerbated the already stressed average household, while three policymakers have called for a rate hike to 0.5% in July.
Inflation eased to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank of England said this was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that the excess is the last bottom line of the weak pound relative to its 2% target.
Andrew Monterey, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent drop in swap rates, it looks set to become more competitive again as lenders are strongly calling for more business and looking to end the year on a positive note."
Such a market looks particularly favourable for those who may be nearing the end of existing deals, as remortgages (many of which are commission-free and have low interest rates) are growing in popularity.

The UK's National Health Service (NHS) has given the green light to controversial HIV medications
After the dust settles on the High Court's decision on NHS drug funding, patients will be able to access "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS England has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a medication that can be taken before sex, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by around 86% in high-risk groups. Health services will now deliver the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year initial trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's ruling last year. The ruling said the NHS was entitled to pay for PrEP despite NHS claims that local authorities should fund the drug.
The move, announced on Thursday, was called a "major new intervention" by NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "pivotal moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to register. More clinics will join in October, followed by full implementation across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a type of HIV medication that is taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Trials have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before having sex means that there are enough specific medications in the body to prevent HIV infection.
This medication can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay, gay, bisexual men, transgender people, and positive HIV carriers who have not been successfully treated.
The clinic will identify eligible participants who have consented to the trial, including males, females, transgender individuals, and those whose sexual partners' HIV status is unknown on antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and are registered with a GP can also sign up for a sexual health clinic in their local area.
The scheme will cost £10 million, while the NHS England branch has signed a contract to procure the medicines this week following an international competitive purchase.
The trial aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is localized, absorbed, and administered on a large sample basis.
"This major new intervention should complement and strengthen HIV prevention broadly and successfully," said Mr. Stevens.
This is another milestone in more than 30 years of actions worthy of progress in addressing major human health challenges. ”
Deborah King, chief executive of the UK AIDS Trust (NAT), said: "This is a critical moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target people in need and at risk, then PrEP offers the potential to change the AIDS epidemic in the UK.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to a new and approved tool that can be implemented on its own, without consultation with a sexual partner, through this NHS-funded trial in England, which will make a difference in the lives of many people.
We applaud this announcement with both hands. ”
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrance Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now is to ensure that trials roll out quickly across the country and that no one is left behind.
Now that we've purchased the PrEP trial, we're ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk for HIV. ”
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "After months of postponement and government delays, the start of the PrEP trial is welcome and should have arrived sooner.
Evidence shows how transformative this drug can be made as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the spread of this deadly infection.
This trial will give us a closer look at the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this trial be rolled out nationwide as soon as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us go one step further to ending the spread of HIV in society. ”

High quality of living: Applying lofts and clever design to transform a small apartment at Earls Palace into a spacious home
Joanne Ray is a former banker who is passionate about renovating her home, and in 2014 she moved from her big house in Knightsbridge to a small apartment at Earls Palace.
The apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace – Joanne sold it without packing her bags, which is a testament to the new design.
"Before that, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a bigger house in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for a house with the right offer.
I saw this apartment at the Earls Palace and it also has high ceilings.
I liked it and made an offer on the same day. ”
Since its first viewing, the 1,000 sq. ft. apartment has now been completely renovated.
The apartment was originally a studio with a complex layout – one had to walk through the kitchen to the bedrooms – and Joanne wanted to add storage and a loft to make the most of the ample ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, plenty of light.
That's what I'm asking for," she said.
To do this, she hired Erfan Azadi from Duck&Shed Architecture and Design Studio (in Notting Hill) to take advantage of the 12.5-foot ceilings to create a home. This home is not only a development but also where Joanne lives.
The height of the ceiling was not high enough to add two upper and lower spaces, so the challenge was to create an attic that was tall enough for people to stand on.
Erfan had to think creatively in order to solve this problem.
"The steel structure is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to arrange the space so that it was displayed up and down without shrugging our shoulders and hunching our backs.
It's not just about building a simple platform, it's about starting the steel so that it's about the right height for the function. ”
With this arrangement, Erfan was able to acquire two full-length rooms in the space – which could add a lot of interesting elements.
The attic features vintage copper windows by the Retrouvius brand and overlooks the charming living area.
Gold furniture with mirrors, small silver pieces of furniture and Serge Mouille vintage lighting set the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in adding atmosphere, space, and light.
Installing mirrors at both ends of a short hallway can make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a mirrored splashback is like a window to another room.
In the entryway, a small compartment with a mirror provides Joanne with storage space for cutlery and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an inviting sense of space and the ability to put away the kitchen when it is not in use.
Folding kitchens are not new.
But the uniqueness of this folding kitchen is a garage-style lift door.
"There's some engineering knowledge involved here," Erfan explains of the reinforcing veneer MDF door.
"It's a balancing principle, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide. ”
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom, and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you're selling the size of the house -- or the valuation of your property is based on the size of the house," Erfan said.
"Basically, a real estate agent walks into a room and calculates it based on the size of the floor. ”
They will manage to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials, which will give the space a luxurious feel.
"The materials are hand-picked by you, so it helps create an emotional bond in your home." ”
"You won't fall in love with the power supply on the wall.
These things are important, but they won't tug at your heartstrings. ”
It turns out that with good design and the addition of extra square footage, a standard apartment can be transformed into a wow one.
In fact, you might choose to live like Joanne.

News on July 26: On July 22, the reporter learned from Hongqiao District that the largest riverside ribbon park in the city's urban area, the green landscape improvement project on both sides of the South Canal in Hongqiao District, was completed and opened to the public free of charge.
With the help of the advantages of the original natural ecology and historical and cultural resources, the entire landscape belt has been re-planned and upgraded on both sides of the South Canal, creating five riverside landscapes of Tianzi Jindu Ruins Park, Wellington Plaza, Xintiandi Style Street, West Station Corridor, and Shuixi Heritage Green Corridor.
About 1,500 meters of plastic roadways have been laid in the riverbank green space between Jinhua Bridge and Xinsansanshi Bridge, and distance signs are inscribed on the road.
In addition to planting a variety of flowers and trees on both sides of the road, a children's playground has also been built, and a number of groups of sculptures have been set up.
During the walk, it can be found that seats, corridors, small bridges, water platforms and sand pools for children to play are also built on the shore, so that the green landscape and water system on both sides of the strait are integrated, providing another good place for leisure, fitness and entertainment for the public.

The two brothers staged a battle for a $500 million real estate empire
Forty years after the Italian family founded their dynasty, the two brothers battle it out for more than $500 million, one of Victoria's largest real estate empires.
Colin De Lutis, a former director and developer of Carlton Football Club, lives in a mansion in the Tukara district, three doors away from his brother Paul. The latter took him to the Supreme Court over the division of their immovable and business assets.
Paul had wanted to break away from the family business since 2014, but the two brothers had a heated argument in the Supreme Court over the split.
Together, the brothers and their mother own 38 real estate properties valued at more than $500 million, which the family has built since the family bought Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded the Westco Jeans company, which grew to a retail chain of 160 stores.
In 1999, the company sold for $85 million.
After that, that money is put into real estate. Currently, the de Lutis family's portfolio includes city office buildings, Brunswick and Sorrento developments, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, whom his brother Paul called the "main promoter and dominant figure" of the de Lutis family, owned about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul accounted for about one-third.
Documents filed with the court say that Colin owned property valued at $316 million, while Paul owned property valued at $176 million.
Paul argues that the division of immovable property and cash proves to be the crux of the negotiations.
"Colin's proposed property division left him with what I consider to be the best property », he wrote in a first court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several failed mediations.
Now, the two brothers are still fighting for control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has kicked him out.
Colin denied this and accused Paul of poor management of certain properties.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed a desire to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian tradition dictates that family is the most important option. My Italian origin dictates that family is the most important ", he wrote.
The cost of the case continues to climb, and there are also hundreds of pages of affidavit, emails, and corporate reports filed by firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, top law firms such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Ms. de Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were both Italian immigrants. They started running mass eateries and delicatessens from the late 50s of the 20th century and bought a shop in Braunschweig in the early 70s of the 20th century.
They used collateral to buy Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin said, "When I was a junior in high school," he founded Westco, "Paul was very young (about 10 years old) at the time." ”
Ana de Rutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to pass on the property to their son in peace
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted his brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of the De Rutis Group, and Colin said Mark paid him $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Paul said that both Luke and Mark were "unhappy with the terms of their division of property."
According to TV star Eddie McGuire's biography published in 2015, Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former member of the AFL club's board of directors.
Fairfax Media reached out to Colin and Paul, along with their lawyers, on Friday.
However, only Colin replied via text message. Because the case has already been brought to court, he said, "I can't really say much." ”
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and take our family affairs to court", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he had tried to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father didn't want to see Paul and I end up in a dispute like the one we have now," he said, adding that he "still has hope that the dispute will be resolved." ”
On Friday, that hope seemed dashed.
"Our problems will be resolved through the courts in the near future", Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media time
Others have tried, but failed.
John S. F. Kelly might be able to do it.
If that's the case, then he's the first.
According to the American political news website Politico, the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump — including news media reports — in an effort to ensure greater stability for the big boss.
Here's an excerpt from journalist Josh Dawsey:
"When the new White House chief of staff, John J. Bush, became the new White House chief of staff. When F. Kelly began his first day of work with senior officials to discuss it, he noted that he wanted to address one of the main problems with President Trump's arrival in the White House: the bad information that flowed into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information helps the president make better decisions, so the information needs to go through him — whether in writing or in the form of briefings.
Kelly's diagnosis looks similar, but others have tried to tame him by spying on Trump's media time, but all have failed.
President Trump has a long history of TV addiction — and now in the White House, his TV habits are still deepening.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Naberg told Politico, "If candidate Trump is frustrated by unfair reporting, it would be helpful to let him know that he has received positive coverage from credible sources as well."
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time, "Based on the experience of six former campaign officials, the point in controlling Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that the media messages he personally receives consistently contain some praise." ”
That's totally fine.
But the notion that Trump's Twitter habits were once "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know — and that's that if it weren't for their interference, Trump's tweets would have been even more flamboyant.
We probably never knew about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff can save him from the fire, even if only a few times, their efforts will be worth it.
But no one can keep Mr. Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House of competing blocs, people are pushing their careers by handing Mr. Trump information that may or may not be reliable to promote their worldview.
Politico — all about the story — reported in May on advisers' penchant for strategically providing dubious information to the president.
Here's an example from what journalist Shane Goodman describes:
Current and former Trump officials say that Mr. Trump's reaction to negative news footage is like a volcanic eruption, especially when it comes to damaging information leaks, and he is frantically trying to find out where it came from.
At the end of February, someone maliciously named the online instigator Charles J. An article on C. Johnson's website, GotNews.com, was copied to the president accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the White House's "source of a massive information leak," as Trump did at the time.
Even though Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, he has not provided any concrete evidence, and he has blown up a large number of false accusations, all of which he has since publicly denied.
Trump read the article and then began to ask officials about Walsh. ”
Goodman also said that then-chief of staff Reyns Prebus and White House secretary Rob Porter "tried to set up a system to manage and record documents received by Trump."
The result?
Kelly was going to do the same in three months.
He may prove to be a more efficient manager than Prebas, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his aides are still competing with each other for influence.
These eternal influences will make Kelly's task even more difficult.

In Zhejiang, there are many small towns with unique customs like Anchang Ancient Town: the rippling waves of Xitang in Jiaxing flow with the warmth and grace of the water towns in the south of the Yangtze River; the white walls and tiles of the twenty-eight capitals of Quzhou tell the vicissitudes of the thousand-year-old town; and the fishermen's paintings in Shitang Town of Taizhou outline the life of fishermen who are both traditional and modern...... These small towns are the "treasures" of Zhejiang tourism, and they are also the "favorites" of tourists from all over the world.
In recent years, with the advancement of the construction of all-for-one tourism in our province, the potential of Zhejiang towns has been gradually awakened.
In 2016, the General Office of the Provincial Government officially issued the "Implementation Measures for the Creation of Tourist Towns in Zhejiang Province", proposing to name about 100 provincial-level tourist towns with rich folk customs, beautiful ecological environment and rich tourism formats in the province in about 5 years.
Nowadays, these small towns have become important destinations for tourists to Zhejiang to appreciate the landscapes of Zhejiang, taste and read Zhejiang culture, and feel the nostalgia of Zhejiang, and will also provide an important boost for our province to strive to build the most beautiful tourist destination in China of "Poetry and Painting Zhejiang".
According to the relevant person in charge of the Provincial Tourism Bureau, under the creation of tourist towns, towns and villages in our province are now paying more attention to the creation of personalized tourism industry, and new tourism projects and formats are emerging one after another, bringing rich experience to tourists and winning a good reputation.
It's all about promotion
Recently, sponsored by Zhejiang Provincial Tourism Bureau and Zhejiang Daily Newspaper Group, and hosted by the Tourism Omnimedia Center of Zhejiang Newspaper Group, the "Town × Future Artists" sharing meeting and the closing ceremony of the 2017 Zhejiang Tourism Style Town Promotion Season was held in the Zhejiang Provincial Exhibition Hall.
"The style town has the beauty of art and the temperature of life.
The style of the town lies in the original juice, original flavor, original hometown, a kind of original ecological purity.
Xie Hanfeng, a teacher of the Film and Television Department of the School of Film and Television Animation of the China Academy of Art, and a first-line film and television advertising director in China, and Professor Xu Xianghong, Dean of the School of Art and Communication of China Jiliang University, told the cross-border stories of small towns such as "The Town in the Lens" and "The Reconstruction of a Small Village".
Many tourist towns in Zhejiang have profound cultural resources, and Dong Xinjian, a town representative from Nanxun, Huzhou City, interpreted the Chinese painting Nanxun for everyone on the spot.
The water town style of Jiangnan has been loved by calligraphers and painters since ancient times, and now, Nanxun Ancient Town has carried out in-depth cooperation with art academies such as the China Academy of Art.
The must-have elements of customs, tourism, service and environment in a tourist town.
Among them, the service facilities and environment of tourism are also very important contents.
If you hand over a timely umbrella on a rainy day, it can also allow tourists to better experience the atmosphere of the town.
In this era of sharing, the tourism all-media center of Zhejiang News Group has joined hands with the hottest sharing umbrella company to customize a batch of "poetry and painting Zhejiang" version of the sharing umbrella, hoping to advocate the concept of "sharing and green", enhance the civilized tourism awareness and public morality of tourists and town residents, and create a beautiful tourism environment for sharing.
This has become a highlight of the 2017 Zhejiang Tourism Town Promotion Season.
Looking forward to the excitement
Up to now, Zhejiang Province has released the first batch of 21 provincial-level tourist towns and 115 provincial-level tourist towns.
As a key area for the priority development of rural tourism during the "13th Five-Year Plan" period, the town will eventually be built into a tourist attraction above 3A level, and become a new model of diversified tourism products, outstanding tourism benefits, and win-win industrial integration.
The key to the attraction of a touristy town lies in its authenticity.
The beauty of the tourist town not only comes from the misty small bridges and flowing water, but also from the long cultural tradition, and the rural revitalization comes from cultural self-confidence.
Internationally, Liser Town in the Netherlands, Hallstatt Town in Austria, and Pumpkin Town in France attract a large number of tourists from all over the world every year with tulips, "salt" and pumpkin as the core attraction, and realize tourism to promote the economic take-off of the town.
For the style town, the focus of "highlighting the characteristics and retaining the nostalgia" makes the town have obvious personality and soul, and it is more important to provide cultural infiltration, carry the local context, and highlight the local civilization.
The tourist style town, with culture and nostalgia as the link, and the humanities and scenery as the carrier, connects tourists from all over the world, so that the traditional customs and culture can be inherited and innovated in the co-construction and sharing.
In essence, the tourist town is a complex and open tourist attraction, and it should be a shared living space for local residents, foreign tourists and even sojourners.
As the main battlefield for the growth of tourism in the future, the tourist town may not only change the rural ecological outlook, economic and social development mode, and the direction of industrial factor flow, but also be an important force to bridge the gap between urban and rural infrastructure and awaken the recovery of rural culture.
In the tide of accelerated rural revitalization, Zhejiang tourist style towns will deduce richer wonderful stories.
According to data, 70% of China's travel demand is concentrated within 3 kilometers, so the entire short-distance travel market will sooner or later be the world of shared bicycles.
The Nippon Financial News reported that inflationary pressures will intensify due to the fiscal expansionary policies of the next Trump administration, and the pace of interest rate hikes in 2017 will also accelerate.

Compared with the huge output of 13,000 episodes of TV dramas broadcast by satellite TV every year, these "waist cut dramas" are just a drop in the ocean.
RV riders negotiate ditches to return to "Regal Street"
Some of the wealthiest owners of the West Midlands are again at loggerheads with determined motorhomeowners who have negotiated over a government-dug ditch to return land outside the mansions.
RV riders park their 20 trailers in a vacant lot just outside the bustling Solihull Street, which has been dubbed Regal Street.
The motorhome riders, with their horses, babies in their arms and a motorhome convoy, returned after being driven away in May, and the "moat" dug by the municipality did not stop them from entering.
The sleek and sophisticated team found a gap in the defensive line, and although there was a section of the road that was not barricaded to pass through, their vehicles squeezed through the gap.
Angry residents lashed out at the Solihull Council, saying it had "done a poor job of dealing with the issue."
One resident, who asked not to be named, said: "They arrived there on Monday night before coming to Heath Street in Bingley and throwing stones at passers-by.
The committee should be ashamed of what they have done, because they are simply useless in dealing with the problem.
The motorhome riders arrived in May and were chased away, and now they're back.
Quite a few came last night, and there may be more today. ”
She added: "Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with it by imposing a long-term ban to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I am not willing to continue paying council tax if the council can't stop it.
One local resident, who asked not to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last group of motorhome guests leave, just for another group to come and destroy."
This time the number has increased again, and some people have even seen horses grazing on the park lawn. ”
A spokeswoman for the Solihull committee said: "We are aware of unlicensed camping on a vacant lot on Stottsbrook Road, and now we are cooperating with the Solihull police and taking the necessary legal action to get them to move out as soon as possible."
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps us to give a general picture of the situation when we refer our case to the court for the court to look at. ”
On March 15, the closing session of the Fifth Session of the 12th National People's Congress was held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
This is an interview with Ma Junsheng, director of the State Post Bureau.
Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Yehua international online report: At 9 a.m. on March 15, the fifth session of the 12th National People's Congress held its closing meeting in the Great Hall of the People.
Before the closing, Ma Junsheng, director of the State Post Bureau, said in an interview with the "Minister's Channel" that this year, in view of the outstanding problems such as express delays and loss and damage in the express delivery industry, the state will strengthen supervision and guide the strengthening of industry self-discipline.
This year, efforts will be made to solve the outstanding problems of the four major express delivery industries, Ma Junsheng said, the development of China's express delivery industry has now entered the fast lane.
In 2012, China's express delivery volume was 5.6 billion pieces, and 10,000 express tricycles were on the road, implementing unified standards, unified identification, and unified insurance, which not only facilitated delivery, but also ensured safety.
This is not the first time that the United Nations has experimented with virtual roles as honorary ambassadors. Angry Birds, Tinker Bell, and Winnie the Pooh have all previously served as honorary ambassadors for the United Nations.
By the end of the day, light crude oil futures for August 2016 delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $2.04, or 4.56%, to close at $46.80 a barrel.
London Brent crude futures for September 2016 delivery rose $2.22, or 4.80 percent, to settle at $48.47 a barrel.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.10% on the day to 96.479 at the end of the session.
A weaker dollar increased the investment attractiveness of dollar-denominated oil, supporting oil prices on the day.
The plan proposes that by 2020, the added value of strategic emerging industries will account for 15% of GDP, forming a new generation of information technology, high-end manufacturing, biology, green and low-carbon, digital creativity and other five new pillars with an output value of 10 trillion yuan, and forming a large number of new growth points for cross-border integration in a wider range of fields, driving more than 1 million new jobs on average every year.
Stanford University has launched the One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100) to provide a long-term assessment of the future of AI.

According to an actor in the crew, Zhang Mo is a delicate person at the scene, from extras to costumes, all aspects must be personally watched in place.
Italy has taken a tough stance on the NGO migrant rescue boat
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue their rescue operations without signing the new operational norms.
In an interview with the daily newspaper La Presse di Torino, the Minister of the Interior, Marco Minetti, said: "It is difficult to see how NGOs will continue if they do not sign the new code of conduct. ”
Minneti's warning came a day after Italian officials seized the German aid group Youth Aid on suspicion that the crew of a ship was actually colluding with human traffickers to assist illegal immigrants.
The aid organization has only been in operation for a year and has declined to comment on the specific subject of the charges against the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"Saving lives is and will be the most important thing for us, so we regret that we are not able to operate in the search and rescue zone at this time," the group said in a social media statement. ”
"Once all the information has been gathered, we can only assess all the allegations and the situation at this time. ”
Italian officials have been monitoring the ship Iuventa since October.
Its crew is suspected of carrying migrants transported directly by human traffickers in small boats, and allowing smugglers to flee in a hurry to repurpose the ship.
According to prosecutors' records, at least one such meeting allegedly took place at sea 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya. The content of the document was published by the Italian press.
Its crew is suspected of blatant disregard for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area out of humanitarian fervor and not for any other motive.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa clearly need an Italian police officer on board to supervise their activities.
Currently, only three of the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue operation have agreed to abide by the Code of Conduct: Save the Children, the Malta-based Migrant Sea Aid Station and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday that it did not consider the new rules necessary but acceptable because they would not bring any "significant changes or obstacles" to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minnety, meanwhile, said the number of migrants arriving in Italy has plummeted in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal guards and unite local mayors are beginning to pay off.
"In recent days, we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said. “
He unveiled plans for this month's in-depth talks: discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development activities, and discussions with Chad, Niger and Mali on how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave those countries for Europe.
Lian Ping, chief financial scientist of the Bank of Communications, said that due to the year-end upward trend of industrial added value in the first three quarters of 2017, it is expected that the growth of industrial added value may accelerate to 6.6% in December.
It is expected that the cumulative growth rate of fixed asset investment in December will be 7.2%, the same as the previous month and lower than last year.
Industrial production, although weaker than in October, is broadly unchanged from November.
In December, China's manufacturing investment was running at a low level, but infrastructure investment improved slightly, so it is expected that the fixed asset investment in the month will be flat in November.
More than 200,000 people in Changle, Fujian Province, have entered the United States, most of them smugglers, and similar scenes are constantly being staged in a foreign country, where there is no time to return home and relatives who have been separated.
Beijing's new measures of "university relief": tens of thousands of teachers and students of Beijing Chemical Industry will settle in the new campus in Changping
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Beijing University of Chemical Technology was held in Changping District, Beijing on the 2nd, and the green campus covering an area of 1,800 acres was officially put into use.
The reporter learned from the ceremony that in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and control the "big city disease", in recent years, in the context of the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the relief of non-capital functions, Beijing has accelerated the promotion of colleges and universities in the central city to the suburbs, and teachers and students of some colleges and universities are moving to new campuses in Shunyi, Daxing, Fangshan and other suburbs in batches.
Located in Nankou Town, Changping, the new campus covers an area of 1,800 acres and is 40 kilometers away from the city.
The construction of the new campus is divided into three phases, the first phase of construction has been completed, and the second phase of construction is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year, which is planned to meet the needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduates, graduate students and faculty members.
Looking back at this year's film market, we find that the original text of the film and the two groups of fans of the participating stars have become an important part of the intended audience of the film.
At 17:10 today, the 119 command center of Shaoyang City received an alarm that a fire broke out in the tetrahydrofuran stored at the Hongzhi Chemical Plant in Longxutang, Shuangqing District, the city.
The Shaoyang City Fire Detachment immediately dispatched 5 squadrons and 20 fire trucks to the scene with heavy chemical protection clothing, chemical protection decontamination vehicles and other equipment.
After preliminary investigation, the fire started in a small storage tank storing chemicals such as tetrahydrofuran, and there was a large amount of smoke at the scene.
As of press time, the firefighters were in a tense rescue, and the municipal departments of health, safety supervision, environmental protection, public security, and transportation had rushed to the scene one after another, and no casualties were found.
Michelle Carter was sentenced for texting Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months in prison, which can be converted to probation. An additional 5 years of probation is added.
Carter was convicted in June of whether or not to commit intentional non-premeditated murder against Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son is my best friend. ”
While awaiting appeal, Carter was granted personal liberty.
She faces up to 20 years in prison, but her team of attorneys believes both she and Mr. Roy are mentally ill.
At the time of the sentencing, Carter was standing, wearing red trousers and a beige blouse, his hands clasped, his eyes tearful and his gaze downward.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," prosecutors told the court.
"She ended his life in order to live better for herself.
She did not take responsibility ", said the prosecutor.
She didn't show any remorse. ”
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence, and she deeply regretted it." ”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, would have had any significant impact on her conduct." ”
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said, "Not a day goes by that I don't grieve the loss of my beloved son."
I want him to be proud of me and what I've done. I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my pain that will stay with us forever", the statement said.
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "in a trance" because she realized she could never attend her brother's wedding or be his child's aunt.
"Losing someone who has been with me since I was born is a pain that I will live with for the rest of my life. She said.
This case seems to set a legal precedent because Massachusetts law does not make it a crime to encourage others to commit suicide.
Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his car in 2014, the year Carter was 17 years old.
Carter's text message revealed that she had encouraged him to commit suicide, and the case sparked national attention.
"There are many ways to hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself. She said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was on vacation with his family.
In the period before he committed suicide, she wrote, "You need to do this, Conrad," and "all you have to do is start the generator, and then you will be free and happy." ”
Judge Moniz said Carter used Mr. Roy's death to garner attention and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There was a divergence of legal opinion in this case.
One of the few people who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and acquitted two years later.
In an op-ed published in the Los Angeles Times, Ms. Knox, 30, said, "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not imprisonment." ”
Zhang Yimou is destined to be a controversial film artist, and since he began to shoot his first film "Red Sorghum", he has been leading the trend of Chinese cinema while also receiving a lot of criticism.
The reporter learned from the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club on the 2nd that recently, the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth Team won the fourth place in the finals of the National Youth Basketball League held in Beijing.
The Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth Team consists of 11 local players, and the head coach is Tsering Sangzhu, assistant coach of the Lhasa Pure Land Men's Basketball Senior Team.
A Tibetan "basketball kid" before heading to Beijing for the finals.
Photo by Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club Liang Junchao, general manager of Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club, told reporters that compared with last year, the team's results have improved, and the players' self-confidence and grasp of the field have been significantly improved. The communication between the players and other teams is also more comprehensive, and the communication on and off the field is more and easier.
After the game, team captain Jiang Cuo said that he hoped to accumulate experience by participating in the game and do his best for Tibet's basketball career.
It is understood that in the Beijing game, the players overcame factors such as low-altitude drunken oxygen to show the image of Tibet.
Although track and field is a big gold medalist in the Olympic Games, and those who win track and field win the world, track and field celebrities are at a disadvantage in the competition to attract gold.
Automakers are under shock, and Audi will convert up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before Audi announced the conversion, BMW said it would offer software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW's chairman said that BMW believes that "there are more intelligent choices than restrictions on driving", meaning that major European cities – including Munich, where BMW is headquartered – are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will retrofit 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed that the move was a recall.
European automakers are promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emission regulations.
But nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset diesel emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to keep diesel vehicles competitive.
As German automakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has been accused of being too laissez-faire with these powerful car companies and ignoring all signs of the problem.
The car companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistake of Volkswagen by covering up its use of so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions to comply with regulations when cars are tested and returning to normal under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, while others are under investigation by countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine R&D department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zachero Giovani Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected by extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was embroiled in a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, with the German government accusing Audi of installing systems to evade European emissions requirements, expanding the scope of the investigation that was previously limited to the United States.
The Audi being investigated could have a significant impact on Volkswagen: luxury automakers have a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
It is common for a movie to take a year, two or even years from preparation to release.
The animated film "Big Fish and Begonia" recently announced that it will be released on July 8, and the film lasted 12 years from preparation to release!
Liang Xuan, the original author of "Big Fish and Begonia", graduated from Tsinghua University at the age of 21 with a major in thermal power, and founded the other side of the sky with his friend Zhang Chun, and in 2008, he received a million-dollar venture capital from Lianchuang Ceyuan and launched his animated film debut "Big Fish and Begonia".
The film has won many national and international awards in the creative sample stage, and has been included in the Centre Pompidou for contemporary art in France and praised as "one of the most outstanding works of art".
Because it took six years from idea to production, the film was called "Shenkeng" by millions of fans who were looking forward to its release.
"Big Fish and Begonia" tells a fantasy story that belongs to the Chinese. With the announcement of the finalized trailer, it has brought new expectations to all audiences.
Liang Xuan said: "I have only done this one thing in the past 12 years, and now it has turned from a dream into a reality, and I am both nervous and excited."
Zhang Chun said: "I always want to use one-fiftieth of other people's budget to make the exact same picture effect as others, and the team will be driven crazy by me." ”
Dongguan, the "world's factory" that once relied on contract processing and a large number of general workers, is looking to high-level talents who can lead the city's repositioning.
Recently, at the high-level talent activity week held by the Dongguan Municipal Government, the first financial reporter saw that some local enterprises with considerable strength participated in the talent fair.
On the billboards, which are particularly bright against the orange backdrop, they each mark a lot of price tags.
Therefore, the China TV Drama Production Industry Association decided to unite the national TV drama production industry and sign a self-discipline convention.
Lavender in Provence is threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in the south of France, but now the bad news is that it is under threat from climate change.
Lavender is decaying due to ongoing drought and the emergence of virus-carrying insects, causing headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute of Agricultural Research (CRIEPPAM) in Provence, said: "The lavender of Provence is under great threat, as the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with a significant reduction in rainfall in the spring and a rainy autumn.
This affects the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a species of cicada with smaller individuals, a leafhopper that can transmit tiny bacteria, and in very dry weather, they are abundantly present. “
The point is that there are so many of them.
In addition to the elegant lavender fields that can attract vacationers, lavender oil is also sought after by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric Chases said: "Contrary to plants that can produce many large flowers and have very long ears of grain, ours has the problem of small individuals, stunted, missing or inadequate.
So we have less essential oils. ”
Solutions being studied include better irrigation techniques and slowing soil moisture evaporation, spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and developing more drought-tolerant varieties.
Compared with the sci-fi elements in the movie, the two leading actors have said that what attracts them more is the story in the film.
On the afternoon of September 5th, a reporter from West China Metropolis Daily interviewed a number of well-known figures in the cross talk industry, as well as two cross talk performance artists, and surprisingly, they were almost unanimous and silent.
One is a Berlin actor, the other is a rising young actor, and "Psychological Crime" is also the first partner of Liao Fan and Li Yifeng.
Mexico is in danger, journalists are killed
The entire staff of Riodoce usually rallies on Wednesdays to review their plans to report on the Sinalo state riots, sparked by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and the endless war on drugs.
But today, the shadow of tragedy looms over them, and they come together to discuss security.
It is important that they are told to change their daily habits.
Two veteran journalists discuss what makes people feel safer: whether to bring their children to the office, which was attacked by a grenade in 2009, or to leave them at home.
The security expert wrote three words on the blackboard at the front of the room: enemy, neutral, and ally.
They asked these journalists to list their names under each column — no evidence required, just observation and intuition.
There are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists, or cartels, who are suspected of being on the government's list, and these are the villains who make reporting in Mexico dangerous.
The violence never stops, and the country is littered with corpses, including a growing number of journalists: the Committee to Protect Journalists has recorded the deaths of at least 25 journalists since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 journalists are under federal protection after being attacked and threatened, and at least seven journalists have died in seven states so far this year.
The last one to die was their editor and inspiration, Javier Valdez Cárdenas, who was also the co-founder of Riodoce.
In one of the many books he has written about drug violence, Valdez wrote, "The biggest mistake was living in Mexico and being a journalist." ”
There was a strong sense that he was gone, even though he was everywhere — a huge photograph hung on the front of the Riodoce office building, with Valdez holding his middle finger and the word "justice," and Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, two journalists in their 30s, wearing his smile on a T-shirt and wearing glasses or his trademark Panama hat.
The symposium was held less than two months after his death, and journalists discussed their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
While a special federal prosecutor's office was created in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, the office prosecuted only two, according to the records of the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Most of the thousands of crimes committed each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they insisted on reporting on the violence in Sinalo, even though they were heartbroken, even though the land was in ruins.
Ibarra said that without information about the killer and without justice, it would be of little use to hold a security seminar.
"It's stupid to waste time attending a seminar like this," he said.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone. ”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the capital city of Culiacán.
His red Toyota Corolla drove only a few blocks before he was stopped by two men, who forced him out of the car and fired 12 shots, presumably because of the name of the newspaper — which translates to "Twelve Rivers."
The gangster drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
He left behind his wife and two adult children.
Rumors swirled in Culiacán.
But on the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzmán's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinalo has become the bloodiest battlefield in the country, with rival forces fighting each other.
It has become commonplace that one or several people are shot dead every day on the streets of Sinalo, and cemeteries are filled with ornate two-story mausoleums of drug lords.
Forgetting for a moment that the state of "calm" is when there is only one cartel in control of this coastal state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdez is well aware of the dangers of the job, Ismael Pohokwe, 60, co-founder and director of Riodoce, feels guilty for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes caused the tragedy.
First, an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a cartel that plays against Guzmán's sons, was published in February.
The report may have angered the sons, as the newspaper was bought off by suspected gang members as soon as it arrived at the newsstand.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper covering the same story was confiscated.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is significant for violence against journalists in Mexico.
His spirit lives on, and his friends and colleagues believe that he is always with us.
He was also a senior reporter for Novoeste in 2003, when he co-founded Riodoce with five colleagues and sold a $50 stake.
In Sinalo, Pohokui said, "it's impossible to get into journalism without dealing with drugs." ”
Over time, the newspaper earned a decent reputation for its bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Journalists love being able to publish investigative stories that hit the nail on the head without fear of censorship, and readers love newspapers that publish stories that others dare not report.
Five years after its founding, Riodoce won the Latin American María Moscapo Journalism Award.
That same year, the Association of Journalists to Protect Cinema honored Valdez with the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing the most truthful Mexican drug reporting.
He admits that he is also scared.
In presenting the award to the Society of Journalists Preservation, he said, "I want to keep living." ”
Later, in late October, in an interview with the local television station Rompeviento TV, he stated that "in Sinalo, drug trafficking is a way of life,
You have to take on the tasks that fall on your shoulders as a journalist – either you do it or you play deaf and dumb.
I don't want to be asked, 'What have you done in the face of so many deaths...... Why don't you speak up about what's happening?'"
The entire staff at Riodoce misses Valdez, his cursing like a docker, his friend who never hesitated to hug and give advice, and the teacher who knew how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
I often go to the El Guayabo bar across the street from the office, and I always sit at the same table.
Now, they ask: Was it his daily habits that caused his downfall?
His death also forced them to think about how to do a good job and live well.
"They don't like it when you get into trouble with their women and children, and they don't like it when you influence their legitimate companies and secret airports used to transport drugs."
These have crossed their bottom line. ”
The result is a high level of self-censorship and self-protection, even when it's safest to do so.
Trust your instincts.
If you smell danger, stay away.
Andrés Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, said the problem was that "the breath is a feeling that can be deceived...... And then something like Javier happens. ”
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply to Sinaro — just as Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states have lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, corrupt government officials, and a miasma.
The situation is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were suddenly not allowed in rooms where Riodoce employees attended security training, and a few days ago, spyware, allegedly sold only to the government, had been used in Mexico to spy on journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers took a dip in the shade of a tree and escaped the 104-degree (40-degree Celsius) heat.
They were sent by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacán.
Some reporters half-jokingly joked that they wondered if the cops would fall under the 50 percent of what the governor himself said he couldn't believe.
It has been several months since the journalists went to the mountains, where the drug cartels are under the control of a real existence.
This week's edition of Riodoce features three major events.
Among them was the killing of the brother of the great former boxer of Sinalo, Julio Cesar Chavez,
There is also the disclosure of government funding in the governor's hometown,
and the kidnapping inside an expensive restaurant in Culiacán, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
There is no official information about who was kidnapped or how it took place, so it's important to be cautious about writing about what the city knows: The restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and officials alike.
A journalist learned from public archives that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated all political classes for almost the entire last century.
Recently, several PRIP governors have been accused of corruption in several high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous events at the site of the incident, including the incident in which one of the sons of Mexico's number one drug lord, Guzmán, fled a military attack.
A few months ago, readers would have looked at Valdez's column for the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
Villarreal, 46, known as "The Thin Man" because of his thin stature, said: "We already knew what was going on.
Now all our sources of information and communication channels have been cut off.
Valdez's office is now used to store signs and stickers for protesting the killing of journalists, as employees become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez walked out of the room grabbing a handful of signs and went to the local prosecutor's office to participate in a march related to another journalist.
Salvador Adamé disappeared in the western state of Michoacán three days after his killing in Valdez.
Officials found a charred body and said it was his body according to DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists have become more outspoken, organizing protests and scribbling "Save the Media" on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, Director Bojoqua was not in Washington, D.C., and he was trying to get justice and international support for the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez was killed, in a meeting with the governor of Sinalo, Ramirez accused the official of spying on journalists and killed them for telling the truth.
Given that her anger had affected her objectivity, she also asked to resign from her position covering government affairs.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials, and an apathetic society.
In his last book, "Drug Journalism," he wrote that journalists are not only murdered by drug cartels, but are also on lists of politicians and security forces who are complicit in organized crime.
Articulo 19, a media monitoring group, blamed police and public officials for more than half of last year's attacks by journalists.
"In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up," Ramirez said. ”
Obviously, these murders are chilling.
No one forgets that six years ago, blogger Maria Elisabeth Macias died on the border north of Tamaulipas.
Next to her body was a note allegedly signed by Zetascartel: "I came for my report. ”
Her head was cut off, and next to it was a computer keyboard and headphones.
After Miroslava Bretch was killed in March, some newspapers chose to close, such as the newspaper El Norte on the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others continue, in 2014 the director of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo was killed, but they continue.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke openly about drug cartels with a front-page news story headlined "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their hometowns or even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still need to be cautious and vigilant on the streets.
Sometimes they are arrested, and in 2015 photographer Rubén Espinosa was reportedly killed in a Mexican city along with four women three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind the scenes and continue to work, it's a daily dance step for high-risk decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that reporting on the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico was turning into hell, so I became a journalist," he said. ”
In the middle of the night on a recent Friday, when the latest issue of the newspaper had gone to press, the editors of Riodoce were sitting in the hallway outside their offices drinking beers when suddenly their cell phones rang.
A series of shootouts between gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan has confirmed 19 deaths.
The fighting is still escalating, as predicted by a series of cartel messages found in the area.
They uploaded the news to Riodoce's website on their mobile phones on the side of the road.
The headlines for the next day had to be changed.
Sirens sounded nearby - another shootout in the area in a life-and-death duel.
Pohoqua glanced at the policemen standing there to see if they were alert.
If they were the slightest bit afraid, then they didn't show it either.
The newspaper's founder has died, and in his large portrait, his middle finger points to the place where the whole of Sinalo needs to be seen, and the entire staff of the Riodoce follows in his footsteps.
"How can you even want to shut it down?" said Bohoquay: On the same day that Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her out on the street to participate in the reporting. ”
The market size of China's self-driving tourism in 2020 may exceed one trillion yuan
In the context of consumption upgrading and the prevalence of independent travel, self-driving travel is encouraged by national policies and loved by more and more consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving travel market, which is expected to exceed the trillion scale, is also facing double challenges.
In the context of consumption upgrading and the prevalence of independent travel, self-driving travel is encouraged by national policies and loved by more and more consumers.
However, at the same time, the self-driving tour market, which is expected to exceed the trillion scale, is also facing a double challenge: on the one hand, the development of the self-driving tour industry is not proportional to the market demand, and the self-driving tour organizers such as self-driving tour clubs and travel agencies are facing the dilemma of meager profits, and on the other hand, the infrastructure and services faced by self-driving tours are still in their infancy.
It accounts for 60% of the total number of domestic tourists, and the market size is expected to exceed one trillion yuan
In 2016, there were 4.44 billion domestic tourists, and self-driving tours accounted for about 60% of the total number of domestic tourists, and the market size of self-driving tours is expected to exceed one trillion by 2020.
According to the statistics of the number of self-driving trips by the China Tourism Vehicle and Cruise Association, the number of self-driving trips has continued to grow in the past five years, and the proportion of the number of trips in the number of domestic tourists has remained stable at more than half.
At the same time, the emerging field of self-driving travel has shown more attention and support at the regional and national levels, and from 2016 to 2017, policies and regulations related to self-driving, motorhomes and camping tourism have been intensively introduced.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourism Administration and the General Administration of Sports of the People's Republic of China, jointly issued the "Development Plan for Automobile Self-driving Sports Camps", and in the same month, 14 departments including the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance jointly issued the "Action Plan for Promoting the Development of Rural Tourism (2017)", in which self-driving tours were highlighted.
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self-driving tourism.
The self-driving tour club has a meager profit, and the complete industrial chain is the key
Although the domestic self-driving tour market has huge potential and the national policy is actively guided, the self-driving tour industry is still in its infancy.
According to the "2016-2017 China Self-driving Tour Annual Development Report", there are thousands of domestic self-driving clubs, car clubs, car clubs, etc., but the proportion of tourists who arrange self-driving travel accounts for the majority, and the proportion of tourists participating in various institutions such as car clubs and self-driving tour clubs is only about 15%.
At the same time, there are only a handful of online travel companies and traditional travel agencies that independently develop self-driving travel products, and many online travel platforms only sell self-driving travel products provided by some suppliers, and some self-driving travel clubs are also important suppliers.
From the perspective of organizing self-driving tours, it covers many aspects of "eating, living, traveling, traveling, shopping and entertainment", with a high degree of fragmentation, heavy upstream supply chain, and large randomness of tourist consumption.
Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of Beijing Xingtianxia Automobile Club, believes that self-driving tour clubs are similar to travel agencies in nature, and the main profit models in the early days were mainly offline activities, and the core point was self-driving tour line products and tour leader services.
However, in the field of self-driving tours, the homogeneity of route products is serious, and the service level of tour leaders is uneven, and self-driving tour clubs are facing the need for transformation again.
It can be seen that self-driving tourism itself is not an independent industry, but with the displacement characteristics of self-driving tourism, it has formed a cross-regional and industry-specific ecosystem, and it is very important to form a complete industrial chain.
Experts point out that in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important consumption element.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving tour industry, the experience characteristics should be enhanced, and the theme of "self-driving tour +" and the IP of self-driving tour products should be developed.
Scenic byways are more than just roads, and car camps should not be just about food and lodging
In the face of the rise of self-driving tours, the basic development of self-driving tours is also relatively rudimentary.
Li Guanjie pointed out that the tourist scenic road is not just a road, but the need to integrate the elements of traffic and tourism in it, but the road repair and tourism itself are two departments to be responsible, the transportation department to increase the tourism elements, but also stay in the construction of toilets, consultation centers, propaganda columns and other facilities, and the combination of tourism is not high.
Compared with the well-known self-driving tour route "American Highway 66", the construction experience is worth learning.
The design of the scenic byway is no longer the most direct and fast path between the departure place and the destination, but follows the design concept of "experiencing the fun of driving", providing self-driving tourists with the best enjoyment of enjoying the beautiful scenery along the road;
In addition to scenic byways, the campsite is also an important supporting facility for self-driving tours.
However, among the self-driving tourists that the Beijing News reporter knows, there are not many consumers who choose to stay in the camp.
They believe that many camps are biased towards infrastructure construction, which can only meet the needs of food and housing, and the grade is not high, and the products are single, which cannot meet the needs of self-driving tours, which contain many elements.
Some industry insiders who did not want to be named said that many enterprises in the camp in the past few years were for the purpose of taking land, and after taking the land, the supporting infrastructure construction and services in the later stage have not kept up, and many of the operating conditions are losses, and there is no capital injection in the later stage, so it is difficult to do some corresponding supporting products.
Consumer groups
According to the data released by the China Tourism Automobile and Cruise Association in 2017, from the perspective of age, the self-driving travel group is concentrated in 21-40 years old, especially 31-40 years old, this part of the population has a certain economic foundation, and the demand for personalized tourism is high, and most of them are parent-child travel customers.
According to the accommodation survey, self-driving travelers are relatively more likely to prefer non-standard accommodation.
From the perspective of self-driving travel types, surrounding self-driving is the most important type of self-driving travel, accounting for 84.32%.
Outbound self-driving is the yearning of many people, but the proportion is still small.
At the same time, with the increase of consumer demand, tourists who used to like to "visit scenic spots" by car have begun to change their concepts, no longer "getting off the bus to take pictures, getting in the car to sleep" in the process of self-driving travel, but paying more attention to the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs use camouflage to evade enemies
At first glance, it looks scary, but it looks like a statue.
Researchers have unveiled the first study of an unbelievable rhinoceros-sized fossil found by Canadian miners, noting that the fossil is so well preserved that experts have dubbed it the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world."
The fossil is so well preserved that it can even be concluded that its scaly skin is reddish-brown in color. This indicates that it has had some "troublesome experiences".
A report in the journal Current Biology described it as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever discovered and one of the finest dinosaur specimens in the world." ”
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurus that lived in the Middle Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its state of preservation has shocked researchers, who described it as "truly breathtaking".
According to National Geographic, the herbivorous armor dinosaur fossil is the best-preserved dinosaur of its kind ever discovered.
The fossil was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk while mining at the Suncol Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
At that time, he came across something that didn't seem quite like the rocks around him, so he decided to take a closer look.
The fossils he found were then sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology in Canada.
It took researchers six years to reveal the beast hidden inside a 2,500-pound (1,100-kilogram) clod of dirt.
After all this hard work, the final results are only now being announced.
"If you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping," says Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum and lead author. The creature is on display in the exhibition hall
"It will be one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science - the Mona Lisa in the world of dinosaurs. ”
Researchers studying its skin found that the herbivore, while wearing armor and resembling a walking tank, could have been under significant threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaurs used red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a technique known as "anti-shading", which is also used by many modern animals.
Experts say that in this way, it is better able to integrate with its surroundings and thus avoid enemies, suggesting that it was preyed upon by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, a member of the nodulosaurus family, first made headlines in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
After 7,000 hours of meticulous unmasking of the behemoth, a museum technician who was part of the team, researchers are now studying it and naming it "Borealopelta markmitchelli."
The specimen was so well preserved that Dr. Mitchell, along with an international team of scientists, was able to document the patterns and shapes of the scales and armor on his body.
They discovered "anti-shading", a common form of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the creature's back is darker than its sides.
Although "anti-shading" is common, the results of the discovery are surprising because the size of this dinosaur far exceeds that of existing animals that have undergone anti-shading.
This dinosaur was under pressure to be hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs and thus evolved in an advantageous direction, allowing it to hide in the confrontation as a means of survival.
However, most of the animals that survive to use anti-shading, such as deer, zebra or armadillo, are as small and fragile as their prey, suggesting that the creature is under real pressure to survive.
"The frenzied predation of large, heavily armored dinosaurs shows how dangerous carnivorous dinosaurs were in the Cretaceous," says Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in its scales also indicates that the dinosaur's skin was reddish-brown in color.
Scientists are continuing to study the creature's life cues, including the stomach contents it retained, to find out what it was going to eat last.
They believe that the dinosaurs fell into rivers when they died, were subsequently washed into the sea, and finally sank to the bottom of the ocean in a back-down fashion.
At the time, Alberta's climate was as warm as it is in southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans may have gone deeper inland than they do now.
"This nodular dragon is truly amazing because it is completely covered by preserved scaly skin, and it has been preserved in dimensional space to this day, allowing its original shape to be preserved," Brown said. ”
As a result, the shape of the organism is almost identical to that of the Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it, and if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping. ”
The Cretaceous period was the period when large, bipedal theropod dinosaurs roamed the earth.
Although the Tyrannosaurus rex was the king of dinosaurs, it did not appear until millions of years after the armored dinosaurs. The armored dinosaurs may have been hunted by some of the ancestors of the Tyrannosaurus rex.
They include the tall spinosaurus, a giant beast that weighs up to 6 tons and is 38 feet (11.5 meters) long.
The latest findings of scientists appearing in the journal Current Biology believe that the nodular dragon was washed into the sea after its death, after which mummies formed in the dirt.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink excavated the creature at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, with the skin and armor in the area from the nose to the hips intact.
The creature is about 18 feet (5 meters) long on average and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch-long sharp corners that protrude from the shoulders.
Researchers believe that the herbivorous armored dinosaur was active in what is now Western Canada before being washed into the sea by a flooded river.
However, the dinosaur's burial at the bottom of the sea allowed its armor to be preserved.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remaining skin is still covered with the bumpy nail pieces on the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko writes in National Geographic, this level of preservation, like winning the lottery, is rare.
The more I looked at it, the more I thought it was incredible.
Fossilized skin remains still covering the mottled armor on the dinosaur skulls.
Its right forefoot is located on its side, and its five toes are spread upward.
I can count its nails. ”
The reporter learned that the addition of natural or plant-derived alginic acid, humic acid and amino acid synergistic carriers to the urea production process can modify the traditional urea and increase efficiency, and the nitrogen utilization rate of alginate urea, zinc humic acid urea, and granulin urea is increased by 5~10 percentage points compared with ordinary urea.
Environmentally friendly, crop yield increase potential is obvious, especially large particles of value-added urea is a high-quality raw material for BB fertilizer.
This is double the number of security personnel for the London 2012 Olympic Games.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest security linkage program in its history.
Earlier, the Brazilian government said a total of 85,000 people from the army and police would work together, including 20,000 soldiers and 65,000 police.
Most of the military will be responsible for defending the Olympic venues, while the additional 3,000 troops will be responsible for the security of international airports, subway stations and streets.
Police patrol other parts of the city, including the subway, buses, and streets.
It is reported that 6,000 military personnel have arrived in Rio for the Olympic security service.
In addition to the four competition areas of the Rio Olympics, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport and the main road connecting the airport to the Olympic venues.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service industry is not new, and in order to make the evaluation mechanism effective, it is important to make supervision more effective and not just a formality.
How do activists learn to answer the question: "Whose street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was in turmoil.
On the first day of her trip to New York City, the St. Louis native sat in her Airbnb rented bed and browsed Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from a high school student.
It reads "Police just killed an 18-year-old child who was still lying on the street".
She was confused when she noticed that no one else had posted the message on the feed. She closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
An @TheePharoah user kept pushing her a dynamic times.
The St. Louis area rapper tweeted live about Michael Brown's death. Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's body, which had lost his vital signs, lying on the street for four hours.
"Crazy," Ferrer thought to himself.
But death is nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone and didn't open Twitter again until that evening and read a tweet about a crowd gathering on Canfield Avenue.
There were police footage and photos of people shouting, and a photo of someone claiming to be Brown's father that read, "Police in Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed message of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer held up his rifle and screamed, "I'm going to kill you all...... Beast. ”
"It wasn't normal," Ferrer recalled.
"It's not what we take for granted and what we can call typical murders. ”
At that moment, I shuddered.
I was angry and cried. ”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrer and Ferguson over the next three years was the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Street?", which was released in theaters on August 11.
It's a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the perspective of the people who live in this neighborhood and fill the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrer drove to Ferguson with his daughter (in a floral dress and tiara accessories), the two revisited a topic they had discussed countless times before that morning — "about the black experience and the black condition."
"Do you remember when I taught you when blacks had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is not right.
I had to take her with me," Ferrer said later.
"What happened today is what happened in the past...... High tide.
She wants to know, to see, and to rise from it.
Not only does she need to be well-developed in terms of activism and organizing, but she also needs to understand the different dimensions of the Black experience and the Black condition, and understand what we must do to be free and liberated.
Even though I had the privilege of providing her with experiences of racism that she hadn't experienced firsthand, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I feel like I'm hurting her. ”
Their first stop on arrival in Ferguson was at a venue opposite the police station on South Florisan Road. The activists waited until Officer Darren Wilson finally did not charge the case, and the site became their camp.
Ferrer and her daughter got in touch with a local business owner who made bagged lunches.
They prepared the bags and were responsible for passing them to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to develop a new type of activism.
"My activism changed completely after August 9. As an undergraduate at Missouri State University, St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Nurse-Student Association, focusing on food justice and health disparities in the Black community.
"I have no organizational experience.
That's how it all came. ”
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with the film's co-director, Sabah Fleiyan, at a night parade.
Fleiyan said she and her director of photography, Lucas Alvarado Faller, "just wanted to document" what happened.
A question crossed Ferrer's mind: "Do you want to record or find a story that you can use to your advantage?"
This suspicion stems from many of these cases: people — often white — enter a community to benefit from its pain and tenacity.
As Fleiyan explained in a recent interview, "We've heard that people born and raised in Ferguson aren't focusing their voices, and we wanted to do it differently. ”
Fleiyan has been linked to co-director Damon Davis. Daemon Davis is a regional artist known for his activism against death row inmates.
His involvement led Ferrer and six other locals to join the "Whose Street?" project team, which remained with Brown for years after his shooting.
"This documentary is not about someone speaking for us or talking to us, it's what we say. Davis said.
"I mainly focus on how these characters are presented, because that's how I'm presented. ”
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrer's experience — but to show that the movement was "not about messianic leaders, but about community cohesion," Fleiyan said — she proved to be the most open among the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Street?" surprisingly chronicles Ferrer's personal life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt naked," Ferrer laughed when he first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that there has to be a certain level of vulnerability to do this work and humanize black people. ”
In addition, Ferrell's story reaffirms and reorients the role of Black queer women in the broader Black Lives Events movement.
Two of the movement's three founders — who created #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 shooting of Black teenager Trevone Martin — identified as queer.
"Black queer women in leadership in general underpin the movement," Ferrell said, "and that's because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts."
Black queer women have to endure it all. ”
Fleiyan agreed, mentioning that "this movement really has the support of Black women and a lot of Black queer women." ”
Because of her identity, Ferrer was chosen as the centerpiece of the film. However, she insisted that "this is not an affirmative action for the sake of things".
"She's the one who inspires that energy," she said.
"Although she is on the front line, it is no coincidence. Because in life at these crossroads, you have a lot to do as a Black queer woman.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy. ”
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, the press cameras are long gone, but the tense racial tensions between the community and the police remain.
Ferrer was sentenced to more than two and a half years of probation for trying to block a highway during a march.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area she calls home: "It's a mess. ”
Still, since taking to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has stuck to the hymn she has worked so hard to remember.
"We have a responsibility to fight for freedom.
It's up to us to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We have nothing to lose, except the shackles on our bodies. ”
In fact, online translation services have been available online for a decade, and in fact, long ago, there was a lot of talk that machines were about to replace humans in translation.
Similarities: The artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the center of the pavilion at the Friedman Museum of Art in New York are multiple faces: white, black and brown, each with an almost imperceptible resemblance to each other, which are tied by cords hanging from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg using cheek swabs and hair scraps sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent hair crumbs from Fort Leavenworth prison where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to serve 35 years for leaking classified diplomatic cables through the WikiLeaks website.
The exhibition opened on August 2 with the title "Similarities".
It was the culmination of two years of correspondence between Dewey Hagberg, a well-known dissident who had been imprisoned and had sex reassignment surgery in prison, with Manning, who combined his discipline with his own in technology, computer science, and the arts. Former U.S. President Barack Obama pardoned the rest of her sentence three days before the end of his term.
Algorithmically analyzed from Manning's DNA, 30 portraits of "probable appearances" were created. Heather-Dewey-Harburg made a scathing and slightly unforgiving comment on this. His comments are as much about the polymorphic nature of DNA as they are about the concept of identity itself.
Manning, who was born by the name Bradley Edward, has publicly admitted to identifying himself as a woman during puberty. He was convicted in 2013 on 20 counts, including six counts of espionage law violations, computer fraud, and theft.
In prison, her image is suppressed, with only one photo, a grainy black-and-white selfie, looking visibly uneasy, sitting in the driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig.
In 2015, Heather-Dewey Harburg achieved great success with her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
In that work, she used DNA extracted from detritus from forensic evidence such as cigarette butts and chewing gum to create 3D portraits of people who might look similar.
That's when she happened to receive an email from Paper Magazine.
"They wanted to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and needed a portrait," Heather Dewey Harburg told the press at the opening of the exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea Manning couldn't visit or take pictures, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she would be interested in making a DNA portrait.
As a result, the artist and her imprisoned muse became impossible pen pals, exchanging many letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, The Depressed Headshot, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo. The comic book envisaged that the president would grant Manning privileges in the future, and that she would be able to see the exhibit while she was in prison.
And Obama demanded her release just days after the book was published. It may have been a coincidence, as Manning was in his seventh year at the Kansas Military Penitentiary.
In addition, this exhibition has another layer of deep meaning. Because in contemporary America, the Trump administration is constantly declaring war on government leakers and transgender military personnel, while looking for new ways to hype up on Twitter to blatantly incite division, and this exhibition is designed to bridge that division.
When asked about the special timing of all this, Heather-Dewey Harburg said, "Everything happens for a reason."
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's oversized signature underneath (the "i" in the name is drawn with a heart) calls for an end to "partisan mess based on gender, sexual orientation, and culture." ”
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, written in pencil twists with Cs, Gs, and As symbols.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleotides, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heather Dewey Harburg hopes to show that at least physiologically, everyone is like this, by creating these strikingly similar portraits.
"I want people to get out of this predicament, that our genome doesn't care who we are, how publicly available genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is," said Heather Dewey Harburg, whose 2007 video "False Memory" is also on display.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so these are 30 of them. ”
The last work in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page from the preceding illustrated novella.
Manning, in the shape of King Kong under a megaphone held by American soldiers is shown.
"When they stop your speech, they win", the wall reads.
"So, don't shut up. ”
"These are straight out of a letter she wrote to me," said the Philadelphia-based artist.
"No matter how scared I am, I still have to say it. ”
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person, as foreseen in the comics, but when she does, she'll be covered in a portrait mask of her own DNA, like a crowd of protesters getting cheers in the center of the pavilion.
This is also purposeful, as with all of the objects in the exhibition, reaching the height of the genetic haplogroup information she wrote in pencil (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
"In the past, I hung them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a bunch of people," says Dewey Hagberg of the portrait.
"But I wanted them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting for her release. ”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee are wanted for homicide
Police said a man was found fatally stabbed in a luxury Chicago apartment, a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were subsequently wanted, and a nationwide search for suspects is underway.
Wyndham Lessham, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were convicted on Monday of their involvement in Trenton W. H. James Cornell Duranlow's death warrant was issued for first-degree murder without bail.
According to documents, 26-year-old Cornell Duranlo died as a result of multiple stab wounds.
A community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
The police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment after receiving the call and found the victim with multiple lacerations.
Police said Cornell Duranlow died at the scene, detectives are investigating the homicide, and police are actively searching for the two suspects.
Lessham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Deputy Director of Campus Relations, Alan M. In an emailed statement, K. Cobage said that Lysham has now been removed from his job and has been barred from the Northwestern campus.
"Now this is a criminal case, the relevant authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation," Cowbage said. ”
Warren is a Senior Finance Assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesperson for Somerville College, University of Oxford, said in an emailed statement: "We have been in constant contact with the UK police and stand ready to assist US investigative agencies as needed. ”
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped he would turn himself in.
Chicago Police Department Chief Liaison Officer Anthony Guglielmi said the suspect was strongly encouraged to turn himself in to the authorities.
"The police already have a rough idea of their whereabouts and we are working to locate possible locations," Guglielmi said. ”
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are fully assisting in the search for the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment, who had just received a secret tip that something was going on at apartment 1008.
Police said the situation was dire.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also happened on July 27.
He said that according to security cameras, it was confirmed that Lessham and Warren were in the building at the time.
"We believe that Professor Lessham has some relationship with the victim," Guglielmi said.
"Police are currently studying the victim's timeline and background and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident," said Grand Plaza's management team in a statement to residents. ”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said that "we will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutterko said it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"The implementation of the roadmap standards has reached a certain stage and RUSADA has been granted the right to work with UKAD (British Anti-Doping Agency) on planning and testing.
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko made the above remarks when commenting on the second part of the WADA Roadmap on Compliance. This section sets out the criteria for the restoration of RUSADA rights and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the criteria do not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
He added, "Everything has to be announced, everything will be implemented."
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future. ”
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency must publicly accept the findings of an investigation approved by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on the incident of Russian state support for doping in sports in the country, as approved by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.
Speaking about the matter, Mutko said: "We are investigating, and there is no doubt that our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no state plan behind this, and we will not admit what does not exist. ”
Mutko's words echoed the words of the head of the Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission of Russia, Vitaly Smirnov.
Smirnov acknowledged the problems with the Russian Anti-Doping Agency in the past in an interview with the media outlet RSport earlier in the day, but added: "We have said on many occasions that the report contains controversial positions and provisions.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally, "said Smirnov.
Following the doping scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended RUSADA's right to conduct doping tests on Russian territory.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
During a visit to the group's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivia Negri said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it's checkers or national chess, beating humans was no problem a few decades ago.
The president of the Croatian Football Association, Davo Suker, said in an interview that participating in the China Cup is very meaningful for Croatian football, and the prize money number of the China Cup is very large.
There is no need to find a purchasing agent anymore! These more than 8,000 products have zero tariff
At a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, Gao Feng, spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce, said that up to now, China has 15 free trade agreements that have come into effect, involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 kinds of zero-tariff imported products.
At the same time, we import cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean red wine, and tropical fruits from ASEAN...... You don't have to spend a lot of money on these products anymore.
At present, China has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, and 15 have come into effect, covering more than 8,000 kinds of zero-tariff imported products.
Taking agricultural products as an example, with the implementation of the free trade agreement, consumers can taste agricultural products from different origins all year round, with high quality and low price.
For example, in ASEAN, tropical fruits such as durian, lychee and dragon fruit have been reduced from 15% to 30% to zero tariffs.
The import duty on Icelandic salmon has been reduced from 10% to 12% to zero;
For Georgian and Chilean red wines, import tariffs have been reduced from 14% to 30% to zero tariffs;
In addition, New Zealand's beef and milk powder and other special agricultural products have been significantly reduced.
Take industrial products as an example, for example, the import tariff on some cosmetics in Switzerland has been reduced to zero;
Import tariffs on some watches have been reduced by 50% and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years;
South Korea's import tariffs on refrigerators, rice cookers, massagers, beauty instruments and other products have been reduced by 40% and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years;
There are also consumer electronics products that have been significantly reduced.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the free trade zone also include many intermediate products and raw materials required for the manufacture of domestic end consumer goods, which also promotes the structural upgrading of domestic consumer goods to a certain extent.
Gao Feng, spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce, said that nearly one-third of China's total imports can enjoy the preferential tariff treatment of the free trade agreement, most of which are terminal consumer goods, which has brought tangible benefits to consumers.
Further reduction of import tariffs on consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted the import tariffs on some consumer goods to further reduce the import tariffs on consumer goods, covering food, health products, medicines, daily chemical products, clothing, shoes and hats, household equipment, culture and entertainment, daily necessities and other consumer goods, involving a total of 187 8-digit tax codes.
The average tax rate of this batch of consumer goods will be reduced from 17.3% to 7.7%, which is almost "cut in half"!
Since January 1, 2018, China has also made partial adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
The import tariff on some cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shadow and perfume has been reduced from 10% to 5%;
After the tariff is reduced, it means that consumers do not have to buy on behalf of consumers, let alone travel all the way abroad to buy their favorite foreign products.
2018 Yiwu Imported Goods Shopping Festival: Imported Red Wine, Snacks, Fruits... It's all cheaper!
Foreign report: At the end of the year, the regulations of American shopping malls vary greatly, and shopping returns need to be cautious
Chinanews.com, December 29
According to the American "World Journal", just after Christmas, there was a wave of returns.
According to ABC, more than half of the items sold last Christmas were returned for exchange.
In addition, some readers have repeatedly reported that online shopping has been deceived, and consumers need to be more careful when shopping on informal websites.
Generally speaking, large shopping companies have a formal and reasonable return process, but you must be careful if you buy gifts from some small stores or make e-commerce purchases.
Ms. Hou from Rolandon bought a coat for more than 60 yuan (US dollars, the same below) at an online store specializing in printed jackets on December 1, local time, but it has not been sent to the public.
She emailed customer service and didn't get a reply.
Another netizen broke the news that he traveled to the United States last year and bought a mobile phone from a third-party seller, but found that it was a box of plasticine inside.
After knowing that I had been scammed, I applied for a refund from the website, and fortunately I got a full refund.
However, there are also customers who believe that the website's refund service is not 100% perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese-American resident of Northern California, said that he had purchased an expedited delivery service from a website twice, and the expedited service was four yuan once, but both times it was not delivered on time.
I then applied for a refund and received no reply.
Large shopping malls or shopping malls have good return policies.
Macy's offers a full refund within 180 days for most items.
However, the product must remain in its "as is" condition and must be accompanied by proof of purchase such as a receipt or bank purchase record.
If you don't have a voucher, you can also earn mall points that can be used to purchase other items.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for general products and 15 days for electronic products.
However, the return period for electronic and entertainment products purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017 has been extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day refund period starts on December 25, which means that the return must be made before January 25, 2018.
The ultimate shopping experience, a new era of shopping development in the business district is coming
More than 10 years ago, China was still in a seller's market in general, with limited choices and limited needs.
But after a decade of development, the market has already realized the transformation from a seller's market to a buyer's market, and today's consumers have become more discerning, and they are no longer satisfied with the simple shopping behavior of "paying with one hand and delivering with the other".
Therefore, how to make consumers get the ultimate shopping experience has become the next competitive point for real estate developers.
Among the many factors that affect the shopping experience of consumers, shopping malls in business districts have the most significant impact.
See how city builders everywhere are focusing on the shopping experience.
There are no two identical leaves in the world, and there are no two shopping malls that are exactly the same, and a famous shopping mall must have its own characteristics.
For example, Turkey's world-famous Kanyon shopping mall, its unique wave-shaped architectural design is inspired by the Grand Canyon (Canyon), hence the name of the homonym Kanyon, walking in the 200-meter-long trail in the middle of Kanyon is like being in the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon-like design, there is also a large oval performance venue in the center of the mall, which has a unique shape and often hosts special performances.
Because of the open platform design, visitors can walk on each floor to look down on the activities carried out in the "canyon", and have the effect of changing the scenery step by step.
In China, Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, known as China's first forest-style strolling consumer market, perfectly combines shopping, ecology and fairy tales.
7,000 square meters of green square, 3,000 square meters of roof water platform, the project is composed of 9 single buildings, the air corridor between the buildings is connected, the overall sunken courtyard design, take the French plane tree on the edge of the ground as the building skin, the roof water roof, to create a forest-like feeling.
Walking into the forest Moore is like accidentally falling down the rabbit hole in Alice's Adventures, climbing along the tree trunk to surround the building, and the grass and spring are set against each other, bringing people into the forest full of life and vitality.
In addition, in Chongqing, the Lijia waterfront business district built by Longfor plans to introduce more than 50 international top flagship stores, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 famous brands at home and abroad in the future, so as to build a commercial center with a concentration of service industries and distinctive themes.
Not only that, Lijia waterfront business district also integrates ecology into architecture, TOD public transportation as the guide, and integrates fashion shopping, life services, catering, entertainment, education, and sports, bringing consumers the ultimate shopping experience while leading them to enjoy Chongqing's unique "waterfront culture", which perfectly integrates shopping with water entertainment and leisure.
To sum up, it can be found that at present, some real estate companies have insight into the discovery trajectory of this new urban business, and industry insiders said that this kind of consumer experience-centric, how to combine shopping and experience consumption mode will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
Today's business district is not only a distribution center for goods, but also a comprehensive place that integrates art, culture and creative themes, and also carries people's responsibility for urban living.
Therefore, while satisfying the one-stop material needs of consumers for eating, drinking, and playing, it is bound to maximize the multi-level spiritual needs of culture and art, and give full play to the needs of livable living, which will inevitably be the commanding heights of the future development of the business district.
In Chongqing, the north bank of Guoxing, located in the north of the Yangtze River, near the Guanyin Bridge, gathers the essence of the world's commerce, surrounded by international giants, and first-class brands gather to connect with international fashion in close proximity.
It is prosperous step by step, gathering the essence of the world;
Dongyuan Jinyue has a better shopping environment, Dongyuan Jinyue is close to the Nanping business district, and enjoys the leading four-layer three-dimensional transportation system in the west and even the country, which improves the shopping comfort.
In addition, the landscaping and landscape paving of the two pedestrian streets of Huigong Road and Wanda Plaza have been upgraded, about 300 trees have been planted, and 40,000 square meters of ground shops have been renovated, which has enhanced the image of Nanping business district;
Longfor Yuhu No. 1, near Chongqing's first low-density waterfront business district - Lijia waterfront business district, is surrounded by nine parks, with low density and high degree of openness in commercial blocks, making people more willing to stay, stop and enjoy the fun of shopping when shopping, rather than being coerced by the flow of people behind and rushing forward, truly realizing "walking shopping".
Today's business competition will only become more and more fierce, how to fight a bloody way in the homogeneous market, and win the reputation of "shopping mecca" in the hearts of future consumers, it is worth all real estate developers to think seriously.
It is not enough to rely on the differentiation strategy alone, only those developers who really put consumers in their hearts, are anxious about what consumers are anxious about, think about what consumers think, and provide consumers with the ultimate and simple shopping experience can be proud in the stormy market.
Of course, in the end, I think the people of Chongqing are the happiest people, with such a good shopping experience and business district, no one could have imagined today's prosperity 10 years ago.
Monophoria: The carnival of consumerism obscures real environmental prices
168.2 billion yuan, which is the turnover of Tmall users within 24 hours of the "Tmall Double 11 Global Carnival" on November 11, 2017.
Specifically, after the start of "Double 11", the turnover of Tmall exceeded 10 billion in just 3 minutes, exceeded 20 billion yuan in 6 minutes and 05 seconds, and exceeded 100 billion in 9 hours.
On this day, the total number of payments made by consumers worldwide through Alipay reached 1.48 billion, an increase of 41% over last year.
These purchases will result in 812 million logistics orders.
Whether it is the Tmall online shopping platform or the Alipay payment platform, they all belong to Jack Ma's Alibaba Group.
Ten years ago, no one would have imagined that on November 11, the "Singles' Day" subculture created by single young people out of self-deprecation would be co-opted by e-commerce and become the phenomenal "Double 11" shopping carnival today.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used the marketing gimmick of "Singles' Day Sale" for the first time: no one is in love with you, so "single dogs" come and shop online.
The result was surprising, and the transaction volume of Taobao Mall (the predecessor of "Tmall") exceeded 52 million yuan on this day, which was 10 times the daily transaction volume at that time.
Since then, "Double 11" has become a shopping carnival created by Alibaba, from the beginning of domestic buyers and sellers to entertain themselves, to the current influx of global merchants, nine years have passed, Tmall "Double 11" 100 billion transaction volume has been more than 3,200 times that year, so that "Black Friday" is beyond reach.
Following Tmall's "Double Eleven" promotion, there are many e-commerce companies, among which "Jingdong" is the strongest.
"Jingdong" has its own shopping festival "6.18", but it is not as big as "Double 11", which lasted from November 1 to 11 this year, and the cumulative sales of "Jingdong" reached 127.1 billion yuan.
After the "Double 11", it was followed by a similar "Double 12" discount carnival and Christmas and New Year shopping schedule.
After the New Year, waiting for Chinese consumers is also the New Year's goods procurement schedule before the Spring Festival, Valentine's Day shopping schedule, consumption, no holiday.
The environmental problems brought about by instantaneous mass consumption have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua Daily Telegraph, according to the industry's usual standard of 0.2 kilograms per box, at least 300,000 tons of garbage will be generated during this year's "Double 11".
Liu Hua, director of Greenpeace East Asia's pollution prevention and control program, told China Dialogue that Tmall orders alone will generate 160,000 tonnes of packaging waste during this year's 11.11.
The State Post Bureau issued a report in 2016, pointing out that during the "Double 11" period (November 11 to 16) in 2015, the volume of express mail was about 780 million, using more than 3 billion woven bags, 9.922 billion packaging boxes, and 16.985 billion meters of tape, and the length of the tape could circle the earth's equator 425 times.
This year, the State Post Bureau expects that the express business volume of "Double 11" is expected to exceed 1.5 billion pieces.
Wang Shi, manager of a waste incineration center in Beijing, told Xinhua that more than 2,000 tonnes of garbage were coming in every day after 11.11, which also exceeded the capacity of the incineration station.
Courier companies have realized that the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry cannot be underestimated.
Some e-commerce logistics companies, including Suning, have launched recyclable plastic express boxes and reusable plastic express boxes and reusable packaging bags that can be reused as shopping bags and garbage bags before "Double 11", but the acceptance of consumers who are troublesome is not high.
Jack Ma also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics" in Weibo.
This Weibo has received more than 68,000 "likes".
What kind of mobile payments do Germans want?
Zhang Dongfang: The mobile payment war in Germany is not expected.
WeChat Pay and Alipay have just moved the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, and the grabbing positions has not changed - Chinese, this is also globalization?
Where there is Alipay, there must be WeChat payment.
According to the agreement with Wirecard, a German electronic payment service provider, WeChat Pay officially began to land in Germany in November this year, and gradually deployed merchants in Europe.
This exotic reunion of the two "fellow countrymen" took place in Europe.
For a long time, Alipay and WeChat Pay have been singing all the way on the road of globalization.
For the globalization of China's mobile payment, iResearch's "China Third-party Mobile Payment Industry Research Report 2017" summarizes into two types: one is through strategic investment, experience output, and equity investment and support for foreign local mobile payment companies.
The second is to promote mobile payment services to foreign merchants through the consumption behavior of Chinese tourists abroad, and then change the perception and acceptance of China's mobile payment in foreign countries.
Indeed, the Chinese win the world.
China's rapid economic growth and large population base make it an attractive figure for Chinese tourists to spend in Europe.
But this is also destined to be the unexpectedness of China's mobile payment war in Germany.
WeChat Pay and Alipay have just moved the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, the position of grabbing has not changed - or the Chinese, this is also globalization?
A more groundbreaking question is, can China's mobile payments expand their territory in Europe?
Take Germany, for example.
Enchanted "New Retail"
Chen Xinlei and Yang Kaihan: Amazon's announcement of its entry into bookstores and grocery stores when it squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers is interesting in terms of timing and motivation.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first brick-and-mortar bookstore in Seattle, followed by two more in Portland and San Diego.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened stores in New York and plans to have at least eight storefronts by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced the trial operation of its unmanned supermarket (Amazon Go), customers do not need to queue up when they arrive at the store, and they do not need to check out, they can scan the code at the door, take the desired goods and leave, and the shopping amount will be automatically deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, it is very unexpected that it has suddenly made frequent moves in physical stores in recent years.
Because as early as 2007, in the "Open Letter to Shareholders", CEO Jeff Bezos emphasized that Amazon will not easily open a physical store unless the following four conditions are met at the same time:
1. We must be confident that this new opportunity will give shareholders a return on their investment;
2. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great significance to the company as a whole;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is being ignored by the market;
4. We must be convinced that in this market, we have enough resources to make customer-facing differentiation.
Bookstores and grocery stores are the most shaky of the two brick-and-mortar retail categories, and they are also the first rivals to fall after Amazon's rise.
Amazon's announcement of its entry into these two physical markets at a time when it is squeezing into the top 10 retailers in the world is interesting in terms of timing and motivation.
Does Amazon's approach contradict the assurances in the shareholder letter?
A similar sound was heard on the other side of the globe. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Apsara Conference, Jack Ma, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Alibaba, delivered a keynote speech.
"Starting next year, Alibaba will no longer mention the term 'e-commerce'," he said.
The era of pure e-commerce will soon come to an end, and there will be no e-commerce in the next ten or twenty years, replaced by 'new retail'.
The combination of online and offline and logistics will produce new retail. ”
For a while, the three words "new retail" seemed to have been magical, and they were frequently on the lips of people in the industry.
But what exactly does "new retail" mean?
If it only refers to the combination of online and offline, then the concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked 180 of the largest e-commerce companies and estimated that total e-commerce sales were about $200 billion, with the top 25 accounting for more than $159 billion.
Of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers that have only started online in the last five years (such as Macy's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
Alibaba Group's 28.3 billion yuan stake in Suning Cloud Business is also vivid.
Globally, retailers and e-commerce companies are moving from a single channel to an omnichannel retail system that spans brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce, mobile and social media.
Could it be that Ma Yun's "new retail" is more of a summary than a prospect for the future?
If not, then what is the difference between the concept of omni-channel and "new retail"?
Perhaps, the key to the problem is not whether online and offline will be integrated, but how.
Looking back at the past 20 years in the retail industry, the rise of e-commerce, like the rise of discount retailers in the early years, has focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, e-commerce has moved products with a very high degree of standardization, such as books and CDs, from offline to online.
With the development of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, e-commerce has extended its tentacles to other categories and began to improve efficiency.
In the words of Daniel Zhang, CEO of Alibaba, "Using the ideas and technologies of the Internet to comprehensively reform and upgrade the existing total of about 30 trillion social retailers, so that the escalating consumption needs of Chinese consumers can be effectively satisfied, and the entire process of commodity production, circulation and service becomes more efficient because of the extensive use of the Internet and big data." ”
Therefore, the road of e-commerce is a road that is asset-light on the surface and asset-heavy on the ground.
"Light" refers to the fact that the burden of fixed assets, staffing, and management processes is not as large as that of the traditional retail industry, while "heavy" refers to the huge investment required in logistics and warehousing.
The change of logistics mode ensures the high efficiency of e-commerce.
According to the Chinese government website, Premier Li Keqiang presided over an executive meeting of the State Council on April 28, which believed that expanding domestic consumer demand is an important measure to stabilize growth and adjust the structure.
The meeting decided that the departments concerned should get a good grasp of coming up with specific plans on the basis of scientific assessments.
For some foreign consumer goods with large demand from domestic consumers, a pilot project to reduce import tariffs will be carried out before the end of June this year, and the scope of goods subject to tariff reductions will be gradually expanded;
Combined with the tax reform, improve the consumption tax policy for mass consumer goods such as clothing and cosmetics, and coordinate the adjustment of the scope of taxation, tax rates and collection links;
We will increase and restore duty-free shops at ports, reasonably expand duty-free varieties, and increase a certain amount of duty-free shopping, so as to facilitate domestic consumers to purchase foreign products in China;
We will further promote the facilitation of customs clearance and tax refunds for overseas tourists, and strictly implement the requirements for voluntary declaration and tax payment of imported goods in accordance with the law.
Formulate inspection and quarantine policies to support cross-border e-commerce imports, and clean up unreasonable fees in the import process;
Accelerate the promotion of Chinese product brands, support the development of physical stores, and achieve online and offline interaction.
Regulate market order, crack down on counterfeit and shoddy products, and promote the survival of the fittest.
So that consumers can shop nearby comfortably and conveniently.

On January 18, Alibaba held an e-commerce poverty alleviation summit in Chongqing, announcing that it would explore a new model of "Internet + poverty alleviation" to promote targeted poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
This is another "increase" in Ali's poverty alleviation after proposing the rural strategy, launching the rural Taobao project, launching the Xingnong poverty alleviation platform, and establishing the Alibaba Poverty Alleviation Fund.
Poverty alleviation is one of China's most important national strategies.
Poverty alleviation has not been achieved in China for thousands of years.
"E-commerce poverty alleviation is an innovative measure for a new round of poverty alleviation and development, and an important starting point for achieving targeted poverty alleviation and poverty alleviation.
The central government attaches great importance to and points out that the role of the Internet in boosting poverty alleviation can be brought into play, and targeted poverty alleviation and poverty alleviation can be promoted, so that agricultural products can go out of the countryside through the Internet. ”
Therefore, as early as 2014, Ali put forward the rural strategy, which is listed as Alibaba's three core strategies in the next 20 years, along with big data, cloud computing and globalization.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Taobao (Village Taobao) project, recruiting "village juniors" in the countryside to lead farmers to get rid of poverty and become rich through e-commerce.
In 2017, Alibaba cooperated with the Ministry of Commerce to create a channel for poverty alleviation, which has been connected to 13 provinces and 120 national-level poverty-stricken counties across the country.
There are already 2,118 Taobao villages spawned by the Ali platform.
Among them, nearly 400 are in provincial poverty-stricken counties, and 33 are in 13 national poverty-stricken counties.
In 2017, on Alibaba's China retail platform, the sales of Taobao villages across the country reached 120 billion yuan.
Daniel Zhang said that in the face of the national strategy of poverty alleviation, Ali has been thinking about how to make good use of the innovation capabilities of Ali economy, such as science and technology, big data, and cloud computing, to create a new way for poverty alleviation.
Among them, Village Tao is the main carrying platform for Ali's e-commerce poverty alleviation, and has opened a new Internet poverty alleviation link of direct supply and direct sales.
In the planting process, Cuntao and Ant Financial jointly carried out agricultural materials and tools and micro-loan support.
In 2017, Ant Financial served 795 of the 832 national-level poverty-stricken counties, providing them with convenient payment, credit and other services.
Cainiao solves warehousing and logistics, Tmall is responsible for sales, and Alibaba Cloud's big data feeds back to guide agricultural production and further improve the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of e-commerce poverty alleviation requires not only products, sales channels, and industrial planning, but also talents.
Ali has set up e-commerce courses through Taobao University to teach farmers standardized, high-quality and large-scale planting methods, realizing the combination of "poverty alleviation + mental support", so that farmers can get rid of poverty in a sustainable way.
These courses have covered about 92% of the national poverty-stricken counties.
The poverty alleviation idea of "public welfare mentality and commercial means" can also ensure that Ali can achieve "real poverty alleviation" when poverty alleviation.
Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba's board of directors, has said that poverty eradication should be divided into three stages: poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation and prosperity.
Poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish, poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish, and getting rich is to build a "fish pond" for farmers, so that farmers can have fish to raise.
The industrial poverty alleviation driven by e-commerce is to build fish ponds.
In terms of industrial poverty alleviation, the Luochuan apple industry poverty alleviation model created by Ali and Shaanxi Luochuan has been replicated and promoted by relevant departments as a model across the country.
Ali's e-commerce poverty alleviation work has also been recognized by the decision-making level.
E-commerce companies represented by Alibaba have been told to ensure that farmers increase production and income through online and offline channels.
Some of the village juniors and Ant Financial employees were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experience in poverty alleviation through e-commerce.
At present, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) China Office has worked with Muratao to carry out poverty alleviation in the e-commerce industry in Anhui and other places.
Sina Financial News The "3rd New Economy Think Tank Conference" jointly organized by Ali Research Institute and China Vision Think Tank Nontan was held on January 16, and Zhang Li, director of the E-commerce Institute of the Ministry of Commerce Research Institute, attended and spoke.
She believes that our globalization has actually ignored the most important issue, that is, the question of the body and application of globalization, as well as the stage of globalization.
In this way, many people think that globalization has stagnated, and that many developed and developing countries have different attitudes towards globalization and different models in the new stage.
The second concept is the question of the middle stage of globalization, what are the constraints of the middle stage of globalization?
Constrained by the basis of the economic environment, globalization is constrained precisely because the economic basis has changed.
Zhang Li believes that the global economic adjustment at the end of 2017 is basically over, and after 2018, it will enter a new round of growth, and the next round of growth must be driven by production products.
JD.com's first fresh supermarket, 7FRESH, recently officially opened, and plans to open more than 1,000 stores across the country in the next 3 to 5 years.
In addition to Alibaba's Hema Fresh, Yonghui's Super Species, Suning's Su Xiansheng, Meituan's Zhangyu Fresh, etc., "new retail stores" began to emerge in clusters, and "shouted" each other in terms of innovative models and even prices.
The escalation of the competition for fresh supermarkets has become a phenomenal topic in the field of new retail.
"In 2018, we will quickly enter the country, and a large number of stores will be opened in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival. ”
Hou Yi, CEO of Hema Fresh, revealed the "new way of playing" in 2018 at the second new retail summit on the 10th.
"Since 2018, Hema has not only been a fresh food e-commerce, but also a lifestyle e-commerce company that satisfies consumers' immediate services.
The core model is offline is drainage and experience, and online is real sales. ”
Different from traditional hypermarkets and supermarkets, Hema Fresh is a fun and delicious "Internet celebrity store" in the eyes of many consumers, and some intermediaries have even played the concept of "box area room".
Online e-commerce platforms and offline retailers have their own advantages and disadvantages, but consumers are present in multiple channels, so both sides are experimenting with omnichannel models.
The industry believes that in the context of consumption upgrading, there will be more and more "Hema like stores" in 2018.
Hema continues to explore more consumer areas from the initial fresh food, indicating that there will be more innovation in the retail market in the new year.
"For example, the combination of online and offline business models has attracted the attention of consumers, and the fresh supermarkets opened in various places have been applauded and applauded. ”
"But no matter how much these relationships are said, no matter how dazzling they are, in the end, it comes down to whether you have brought a good experience to consumers, and I am willing to pay after I have experienced it. ”
In the view of Yuan Bin, co-CEO of RT-Mart Feiniu.com, in the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed, and purchase needs have also changed.
It turns out that pure online and offline are separated, offline has to defeat online, online has to counterattack offline, and now they are holding hands together, because consumers no longer have a distinction between online and offline.
The rush of capital to enter the game has made the new retail represented by fresh supermarkets full of gunpowder.
According to the analysis, the current competition of new retail in first-tier cities is far from the pattern of the Red Sea, and there are still large second-tier cities to be explored, and there are still great opportunities and space in the market.
The layout of new retail in different types of industries will bring the development of new retail into a diversified development state.
CCTV Financial Channel and the Institute of Financial Strategy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences have sorted out a dry product for you, which is this heavy annual development report of China's e-commerce.
In the past year, what kind of report card has China's e-commerce produced?
What are the development trends of global e-commerce?
Let's reveal them one by one.
The total sales volume broke the record again, and the growth rate returned to the acceleration track
Since 2006, China's online retail sales can be said to have been showing a super rapid growth, it is estimated that at that time I felt that online shopping was very fresh, and I could buy things without going out, which was so cool!
However, since 2013, the growth rate of online retail has begun to drop below 50%, in 2015, the growth rate was below 40% for the first time, and in 2016, the growth rate actually became 26.2%.
But this year, the situation is different, online retail sales accelerated again, and from January to September this year, the growth rate rebounded to 34.2%.
Much higher than the growth rate in 2015 and 2016.
Maybe everyone is going around and around, and you find that it is more pleasant to buy and buy.
Among them, the online retail sales of physical goods were nearly 5.08 trillion yuan, and the online retail sales of services were nearly 1.49 trillion yuan.
It accounted for 13.6% of the total retail sales of social goods, an increase of nearly 3 percentage points year-on-year.
Students, don't doze off, focus on the key points, serving online retail sales is definitely a big contributor!
Secondly, French netizens who love to chop their hands have an average online shopping volume of 1,925 US dollars per capita, and the goods they buy the most online are clothing, which is worthy of being a country that loves fashion.
Do you have to be young people who love online shopping the most?
Helping your company avoid becoming the next Uber startup
Amy Ehret once wanted to investigate employee happiness at her e-commerce startup, but the survey didn't help.
The responses are often vague, unhelpful, or even worse, deceptive.
Even though she promised anonymity, some employees still don't trust the process.
Madison Reed, a San Francisco-based e-commerce hair care company that manages 75 people, says "the responses she gets are lacking consistency and objectivity."
So she called for help.
A new wave of HR startups has sprung up to help companies understand how employees are feeling.
They built and licensed software specifically designed to measure employee engagement, allowing companies to quickly conduct polls for specific teams and demographics, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass executives and report directly to the board.
"Now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's Fitbit?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint. Glint software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Ehret says within three years, she has used Glint to gain more insight into what her employees are thinking and feeling.
In addition to quick surveys and polls for specific teams, Glint also provides company heatmaps of which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores at a glance – which allows her to drill down into why.
Companies are starting to realize that they have to master their workplace culture so they don't become the next Uber. Uber was embroiled in a scandal after former Uber employees published a blog post describing the harassing environment and the speakers were punished by the company.
For a startup like Glint, this oversight desire is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to Let's Talk Payments, a financial technology analytics website, the global governance, regulatory, and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a Denver, Colorado-based start-up dedicated to helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity during Uber's reputational damage earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "diagnostic" surveys, collect confidential responses in real-time, and view heat maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also offers an anonymous text hotline for employees to report bad behavior.
If the chairman is implicated, then the complaint will go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent, said: "The Court of Public Opinion usurped the power of regulators.
If a company is found to have mistreated or behaved unethically towards its employees, even if regulators don't intervene, the company could face high consequences of consumer boycotts, employee turnover and involvement in lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in more than 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees understand work guidelines and procedures, and provide an easy way to contact the company's headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, they had to find the company's headquarters phone number or email, file a formal complaint, and expect the headquarters to take it seriously.
It's often a daunting and unsettling experience, says James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who doesn't think there's a good way to track employee complaints.
But now with Convercent, the company can more quickly identify and address issues that executives in remote offices, cities, or states didn't know about — such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair wage practices.
"I get a closer, 360-degree view of the work experience," says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment lawsuits. ”
After Andorra's accounting firm collapsed due to the Enron scandal for ethical violations, companies began to place greater emphasis on ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media came into its own world" that companies realized they couldn't stop their revelations from going viral online.
"Before technology was used to monitor ethics, people looked at hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge companies recurring fees for the use of their products.
This business model and business opportunity is supported by venture capitalists who are already supporting the two startups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million in funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness of companies, cultures, and ventures, these investments can hardly come as a surprise.
A growing body of research shows that today's employees expect more from the workplace than ever before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued, and feel that their time is spent with a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be part of the company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work they do is beneficial, they are more committed to making the company successful," said Nina McCartney, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn. LinkedIn uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors realize returns when their portfolio companies perform well, and companies perform well when their employees are loyal and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it's no surprise that they'll look for financial support.
Workplace culture experts say it's important to have employee engagement data.
However, this data is useless unless the company's administrators take action.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can expect change to be underway.
If change doesn't progress fast enough, or if it doesn't progress at all, it can lead to disappointment and cause employees to leave the company.
Russell Ruth, head of consulting at Kotte International, a business management firm, said: "If you want to ask for 4,000 pieces of advice, then you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations. He's seen the mistake of companies that rely too heavily on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow up all the way, employees are like, 'Did you really hear me?'
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I care?'"
Ehret said Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action on the day Glint reported the issue.
After gathering feedback from employees about their frustrations due to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to resolve the issue by restructuring the company's internal team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees, and in the long run, they want to make a shift in an industry known for its high turnover rate to better retain employees.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose talent," Vitrano said.
"If you lose talent, you lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose companies. ”

The NCAA canceled twice-daily practice sessions and extended the Bears' daytime practice hours
It was nearly 11 p.m., and UCLA football players lingered and chatted next to the team's new campus practice range.
Some of the players have taken off their jerseys, revealing their sweaty bodies after the first day of hard training at camp.
For a large part of the team, those free minutes are a break.
Players participating in the summer program will return to their dormitories to prepare for their final exams after three hours of practice, before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning for the session.
"The next three days are a run-in for these guys," Bears coach Jim Mora said as Monday heading into Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminated twice-a-day practice (designed to lighten the load on players) but actually extended their daytime training hours — at least until the end of Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three training sessions are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate an already jammed schedule of players.
From eliminating twice-a-day training sessions to more one-a-day training, the Bears began training almost a week before last season, with Mora training at summer school for the first time in six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to start training for 18 sessions Aug. 20 before they begin preparing for their first race against Texas Farm Workers in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule changes, even though it would add another item to the players' busy schedules.
"For three or four days, we'll give them a huge amount of training, which is very challenging," says Moura.
"They also just passed. They're grinding and they're all great kids.
I thought about Saturday and we'd have more time, which was really great. ”
As soon as the camp ends, UCLA stops training. Considering the adjacent parking lot and the clear line of sight from the Luskin Center, this is not an easy task. The Luskin Center has been bruised by a soccer ball thrown through the protective net behind the goalpost.
Starting this weekend, the Bears will be staying at a hotel. But Mora admits that problems could arise once those rooms become vacant during the season.
"We're going to put security measures in place," Mora said.
"This is a real concern. It's not far-fetched to think that someone might rent a room and sit in the room and record a training session.
If you have a training tape, that's pretty good too.
However, we will have security measures in place there, as well as in car park 8.
We will use the resources we have to do our best.
I don't worry too much about that.
We've got a plan in place. ”

Feng Xiaogang explained: "This theme is very similar to "Qiu Ju's Lawsuit" directed by Zhang Yimou, and it is easy for everyone to associate it together, so I want to use how to shoot it in a way that everyone has never used." Actually, I don't have any special ideas, I just think it's fun and I want to do something out of the ordinary. ”
Feng Xiaogang said that he regarded his work as his debut, learned how to shoot circular pictures from the photographer, and even spent millions of yuan for the photographer to shoot a 10-minute test film.
Facebook will launch a fact-checking feature to combat fake news
Facebook announced on Thursday that it would send more potentially hoax articles to third-party testing agencies and display the results below the original post. Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to crack down on so-called fake news.
Facebook Inc. said in a statement on its website that Facebook will begin using updated machines to learn to detect possible hoaxes and send them to a fact-checker, and may display the results of the fact-check below the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main spreaders of so-called fake news, and many believe that Facebook influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, with voters suffering from a flood of false stories ahead of France's presidential election in May, and Germany being the first to pass support for a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hate posts in a timely manner.
Facebook said in a separate statement in Germany on Thursday that it was launching a new fact-checking test in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Sarah Sue, product manager for Facebook News Feeds, said in a blog post: "In addition to seeing which stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to help them make informed decisions about what they read and share."
She added that Facebook will continue to test its "related articles" feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Create a graphic novel: The Story of an English Castle
More recently, the tiny Scottney Castle has been the protagonist in a compressed version of the music film, and for a time became a refuge for Mrs. Margaret Thatcher during the seventies and eighties.
But Scottney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from the comfort of his comfortable location in the Belle River Gorge in Kent, and now it's the inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire with a mop head with a penchant for historical documents.
"I can see the handwriting of the ancients 300 years ago, and I find it so beautiful," he says, with a wistful look in his eyes.
"What kind of interpersonal fate is it that makes this letter fall into my hands. ”
Spanning the Middle Ages and Edwardian times, The "An English Castle" book chronicles the various families that lived in Scottney, each with a story written by a different, future British artist such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book in Rhodes to use archives as a raw material: he also wrote 2014 The Teeth of the Dead and Other Stories, a book inspired by British library documents, a work he completed with an uncontrollable creative passion.
"I couldn't restrain my urge to write from the moment I saw the thumb mark on the side of the letter, written by a double agent working for the Jacobites in the 18th century," he said. ”
"That's his fingerprint!
And the letters always smelled of smoke, because at that time, you needed to light a fire to have a light.
For us 300 years from now, the smell makes it feel like they're all around us.
Oh, I love archival documents!"
For those who are struck by the old paper, having the support of the National Trust and Arts Council of England and living in the castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I've been a bit long") seems too fantastic to believe it's true.
Rhodes spent several days touring Victoria's "new" castle, rummaging through archives and researching the estate's many treasures and curios, such as hyena heads hanging on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered the grounds and ruins of the old castle, chatting with wanderers, gardeners, and sometimes with the artists who drew illustrations for his books.
Then in the evening, he would "drink some whiskey and write." ”
Scottney's hidden history is not well understood, as the "National Trust" was only fully accessed after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff began to process the archives, which he described as "the aristocracy of hundreds of years ago was leaving: 'Oh, put it in the attic'." ”
Diaries, letters from the British imperial era, maps of the borders of various countries: "You would think that land disputes would be boring," Rhodes said, "but there would be two families fighting over a birch tree."
Let it go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the work use castles as a starting point to study English history more broadly, including The Labourer, which follows a man who left the newly built castle to participate in the peasant revolt of 1381.
"The story in the book, 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,' chronicles a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes said.
"The peasant uprising started in that area, and I think it was a good place to start an uprising.
Maybe there's a connection between the two?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the castle's history, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family's seven years of hiding a Jesuit priest during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, in which the protagonist of the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell is credited with giving himself a funeral by filling his coffin with stones (his coffin was discovered years later when it was revealed to the ground).
The Darrells is Rhodes' favorite family of Castle Scottney: "These gentlemen seem to be scoundrels, always borrowing money and paying for things they can't afford.
Generations of Darrell men have settled their debt problems by marrying wealthy older women, and I think they should be a handsome bunch of lads who know how to pursue women. ”
As his mission in the castle ends, Rhodes begins to look for other bizarre writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness writing a graphic novel about "El?¤m?¤nm?¤ki," an early 20th-century sanatorium that was slowly abandoned.
But Scottney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"It's like, 'Oh, I've got to deal with the real life of the trough cake. '”

Large energy companies are all "rich", so who is the most profitable among the many energy companies in the world?
Yesterday, the well-known PFC energy company announced the ranking of the top 50 listed energy companies in 2011, and US oil and gas producer ExxonMobil won the championship with a market value of $406.3 billion, followed by PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell.
In this list of PFC, PetroChina has won the top spot twice in 2007 and 2009, and ExxonMobil has occupied the top position in other years.
In the 2011 Top 50 list, a total of three companies from Chinese mainland were shortlisted, in addition to PetroChina, which ranked second, Sinopec ranked 9th, and CNOOC ranked 15th.
However, although the current oil price is much higher than it was four years ago, the CEO of PFC Energy pointed out that there are many reasons for the low total market capitalization, mainly including the decline in natural gas prices in North America and the low activity of the global stock market.
According to Xinhua News Agency, the heavy pollution weather in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding areas from the 16th to the 19th further intensified, and the AQI in the three cities of Shijiazhuang, Xinji and Handan in Hebei Province "exploded".
The U.S. changes the green card rules
The media quoted President Donald Trump as saying that the United States will launch a new immigration program and revise the green card rules.
The plan aims to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 per year, with stricter restrictions on temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications.
The new rules were proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars, and do so by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries," Trump was quoted as saying by U.S. media.
The law would replace the current scheme to reduce chain migration.
This new application process benefits applicants who speak English, have financial support, and have skills that are beneficial to economic development. ”

In order to optimize the environment of the scenic spot and build a beautiful Nanyue, recently, the "636" Volunteer Service Brigade of the Nanyue District Tobacco Bureau (Branch) carried out the environmental protection activity of "Mountaineering and Forest Protection, Caring for the Homeland".
The activity not only received the support of all cadres and employees of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also attracted retired cadres and employees' families to participate in environmental protection practices.
This volunteer service activity aims to protect the scenic resources of Nanyue, promote the volunteer service concept of "caring for others, caring for society, and caring for nature", and also let the next generation receive edification from an early age and inherit the virtue of volunteer service.
It is reported that since its establishment in early April this year, the "636" volunteer service brigade has developed a total of 16 members, and has successively carried out a series of volunteer service activities such as visiting disabled retail customers, helping tobacco farmers care for tobacco leaves, and making donations for the Ya'an earthquake, becoming a volunteer force that transmits positive energy with heart.

Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be cautious
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't be weirder, a new report on technological developments was released in the field of sex robots.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal these days.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) released a report that looks ahead to the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start getting serious about the rise of sex robots.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape, and nail type.
"People are laughing behind their backs, but companies do have a lot of sex robots, and we're going to see more," Sharkey said at the release of the new report. ”
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots, with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and deliberately using artificial intelligence to set up human-like sexual responses.
Users can also "customize" their robot to suit their preferences, with options ranging from eye color and nipple shape to nail type or color.
But what's even more disturbing is that many robots with "personalities" will make the "copy wife" look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
RealBotix bots, for example, can be customized based on characteristics that the user finds attractive, such as shyness.
There's also the Roxxxy Gold sex robot, developed by True Companion, that presets personality traits, including the slightly shy "Cool Farrah" and the "adventurous" "Wild Wendy."
"The Roxxxy Gold bot has a personality that is as appropriate as possible to you," says True Companion's website.
So she loves what you love and hates what you hate.
She also had a little mood in those days just like normal people!
She can be laid-back, she can be talkative, and she can be 'sexually aroused'!"
There's a lot of uneasiness with the rise of sex robots — not just in place of real human relationships — but also the groveling feminity and the hint of rape twitching on the glamorous (interpreted: resistant) Farah are the most worrisome.
True Companion likens Roxxxy to a man's vibrator on its website.
The website says "If a woman has a vibrator, then why can't a man have Roxxxy?"
However, these sex robots are not just fetishes, nor are they just sex toys.
Their emergence and growing sophistication points to a darker, deeper part of our culture: an escape from perfect gender equality to sex with submission as an add-on.
Of course, most men don't have sex robots, and while FRR notes that sex robots are growing in popularity, they are still on the fringes of consumer culture.
But what seeps through the periphery allows us to see the course of our time.
A lot of people weren't weird or aggressive until the free market gave them the opportunity to be like that.
It's no coincidence that these delicate sex robots are coming at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, and that there's also a president in the White House who brags about sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the TV series "The Handmaid's Tale" is not the realistic picture, not the hanging corpse, nor the pair of gouged out eyes, but the overly real imagination.
The Republic of Gilead was a jump, but now it looks like it's not far off.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as much of a body as technically possible that resembles a real woman's body (albeit in the proportion of a star).
The creators of these robots wanted them to have a human sense of touch and mimic real human movements.
But to put it bluntly, their "personalities" are not representative of real women.
They can't break up and they can't run away.
They have no recourse and no follow-up stories, no independence at all, and no possibility of breaking the illusion of total slavery.
In other words, they are sex slaves.
Or as the saying goes, in 2017: The Handmaid.
"The Great Wall" tells the story of an elite Chinese army in ancient times who fought monsters on the world-famous Great Wall to defend humanity.

Deng Chao said, "In performance, I won't do the same thing, I have to keep updating." ”
Trump's great exploits?
Let Mitt Romney be the epitome of common sense
Political divisions polarize the American electorate and, from a micro perspective, undermine American family harmony. This is no surprise for the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, major newspapers in the United States have been flooded with opinion columns about how to deal with the fear of voting for Trump's relatives.
It is generally believed that we are doing everything we can to puncture our "filter foam".
Even less vocal is Trump's power to bring his family together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has a long-standing feud with Republicans in our family, is coming to visit me in New York this week.
She reminded me that coming together against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
As a result of working with Mr. Trump in the White House, everyone she knew, even Republican relatives who had been in a political altercation for decades, were now suddenly and strangely on the same page.
If it's all at the table, that's certainly a good thing. But what strikes me is that from a broader perspective, this poses a significant risk.
While leftists have been egged on by Trump, the warping effect of his presidency has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the possibility of worrying that his outlandish behavior may one day stop.
There is, however, a more worrisome long-term scenario in which Trump wants to "normalize" relations with right-wing Republicans who previously opposed Mr. President's standards and now suddenly look like a symbol of reason.
I've found myself nostalgic lately for Mitt Romney's version of the madness: putting the dog in the car, the 14 percent income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), both of which seem too minor for the offense compared to Trump.
After the Trump era is over, the next Republican candidate will only need to be sensible enough to qualify for immeasurable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town, we took the kids to the New York Park Carousel, the largest carousel run by the New York Central Park Administration, and if you don't need coffee, the three-dollar ticket is the best value you'll have in the city.
The sound of the Trojan horse was as loud as thunder, the central cylinder was made of fiberglass, all the clowns and animals turned their heads and looked at their shoulders in horror and sinisterness, and the tinkling music sounded strangely.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: the landscape from the high-rise buildings has become old-fashioned, the skyline has become too familiar to provide much excitement, and the reality of the city does not support the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I still haven't quite forgotten that day, I discovered that the "Swiss Cottage" was not actually a Swiss Cottage, but a themed bar "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage", which I don't remember exactly, but near an intersection in North London.
However, the carousel in Central Park is still a magical experience, and everyone has a lot of fun with the activities that two 2-year-olds, one 11-year-old, and four girls in their 40s can participate in.
If I could rate the merry-go-round, I would give it full marks, but thankfully no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before swiping my credit card, I was asked to rate my transaction "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, the same is true, in addition to the option to rate with a 15% tip, which is to buy something at the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a gender-neutral trade, but also puts pressure on the waiter, adding personal factors to unwanted situations.
The poor woman in the department store smiled apologetically while I was exhausted, and the credit card transaction experience gave her five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has left prison and transferred to hospital.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for treatment of a cut on his wrist, which prison officials said was the result of a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the initial manslaughter verdict.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he shot Steenkamp several times through the toilet cubicle door at his home in Pretoria, killing him.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder hiding in a cubicle at night.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius's six-year sentence, which they consider too merciful.
The National Prosecution Service said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, which could be heard this year.
If the prosecutor wins, Pistorius faces an increased sentence of up to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

On May 18, the Ministry of Finance announced the "Measures for the Management of Special Incentives and Subsidies for the Structural Adjustment of Industrial Enterprises", which will arrange special awards and subsidies to promote the resolution of overcapacity in the coal and steel industries, with a total amount of 100 billion yuan.
Recently, many local governments such as Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Heilongjiang have successively put forward reform opinions on resolving excess capacity.
Among them, many provinces have even proposed to actively strive for the central government's financial support for their provinces to reduce production capacity.
One proof of this is that only eight provinces have announced coal capacity reduction targets that stand at 90% of the national coal production reduction plan.
Lin Boqiang, dean of the China Energy Policy Research Institute of Xiamen University, said in an interview with reporters that the steel and coal industry's "de-capacity" is far from enough to rely on the central government's 100 billion yuan, and more funds need to be solved by local governments and enterprises. How to fix it?
Shanxi Province recently announced the implementation rules for coal capacity reduction, which proposes to reorganize Shanxi Coking Coal Group into a state-owned capital investment company, reorganize and integrate the company's assets and business, and build a new business model.
The actual funding gap may be three times that of the subsidy Previously, Yin Weimin, Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, said that preliminary statistics show that the number of employees to be diverted and resettled in the coal system is 1.3 million, and the steel system is 500,000.

Do pork, dairy, and chocolate help with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
Meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study shows the opposite: diets rich in meat, protein, and dairy can help relieve symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease affects the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 Britons, causing stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
Researchers at the University of Washington typically advise patients to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but researchers have found that tryptophan, a key amino acid for protein, helps promote the growth of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explains that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microorganisms hidden in food do not sneak into the body.
Maintain a balance between the cells that trigger inflammation and the cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body from damaging sensitive and delicate tissues.
Inflammatory bowel disease can occur when the equilibrium is too inflammatory.
In experiments, an immune-boosting cell was found to appear in mice carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need tryptophan, one of the building blocks of proteins, to form the appearance of cells.
"We have made a link between a bacterial population (Lactobacillus reuteri, which is a normal part of the gut microbiota) and a population of cells that promotes tolerance," Professor Colonna said.
The more tryptophan a mouse consumes in their diet, the more immune cells they have.
He suggests that if humans use the same approach, the combination of Lactobacillus lucii and a tryptophan-rich diet might result in a more tolerated, less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studied a tolerant immune cell when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain was not kept separately.
She suspects that the difference has something to do with the gut microbiome (the bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract) community of mice.
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice showed that 6 bacterial populations were present in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
Mice are housed in a sterile environment, so they lack gut microbes and cannot present such immune cells, which are produced in the presence of Lactobacillus luci.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultured Lactobacillus luciferi in liquid and then transferred a small amount of bacteria-free fluid to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
This immune cell develops into a tolerant cell.
When the active ingredient is purified from a liquid, it can be proven that the active ingredient is a by-product of tryptophan metabolism called indole-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in rat feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50%, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us have Lactobacillus luciferi in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from Lactobacillus luciferi can be induced into cell development in humans like mice in experiments, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
"The development of these cells may be exactly what we want because these cells can control the inflammatory response on the inner surface of the gut," she said.
It can be said exactly, the presence of high levels of tryptophan in Lactobacillus lucii may lead to an increase in the number of this species.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed the "genius" Nemanja Matic
After Nemanja Matic made his Sampdoria debut on Wednesday night, Jose Mourinho decided United had signed a 'talented' midfielder.
Nemanja Matic from Chelsea, who signed a whopping £40 million, won the favour of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira on Tuesday in the final pre-season league game before Dublin's UEFA Super Cup tie against Real Madrid.
However, in Bruce's pre-season Asian Tour tour, Nemanja Matic was woefully informable, completing just 45 minutes, with Mourinho admitting that improvements were needed before the start of the Premier League season.
'He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence and a genius to think – he thinks about football,' Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get ready as soon as possible. ”
Jose Mourinho started his starting line-up at the start of the season. Like Nemanja Matic, new signings Viktor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at Aviva Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Jose Mourinho still wants to bring in three more signings, but insists the club has a "great job" and has four first-choice signings in mind, three of which the club have already brought in.
'I'm very grateful that the club has brought in three of these signings. He added.
'I would be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they have worked hard for me. ”
The world is building a corvette climax If China does not build this type of warship, will it lag behind?
With the recent announcement of the construction plan of new frigates by the world's major naval powers, it seems that the frigates have become the focus of attention of the navies of the major powers overnight, first Japan determined the purchase of two new frigates in the 2018 annual defense budget, which made the Japanese DEX frigate program finally have a substantial breakthrough, and then the United States Lockheed Martin recently announced the latest plan of the American FFG frigate program, so where should China's new frigates go?
With the launch of a latest Type 054A frigate at the end of 2017, it marks that as many as 29 054A frigates have been built, which is close to the sum of the 053H series frigates, and from the launch of the first 054A in 2006, the construction process of 054A has been 12 years, even in the world, the construction of such a large number of high-performance general-purpose frigates, in addition to China, there is only the United States built in the 7th and 80s of the last century "Perry" Class frigates can be compared.
And the reason why so many 054A are built is also very simple, that is, it is affordable, easy to use, and it is to supplement the Navy's arrears for many years.
054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese Navy for many years with its high cost performance and good combat effectiveness, its displacement of about 4000 tons, equipped with a 76 mm main gun, 32 units of Haihongqi-16 and Yu-8 anti-submarine missiles launched by the vertical system, 8 YJ-83 and a Zhi-9 helicopter, although it was built in 2006, the design time is a very early kind of ship, but its combat effectiveness is not too bad even today, looking at the frigates around the world can also reach the upper level.
But after all, this is a type of ship designed at the beginning of the 21st century, the weapon configuration aside, its power system and electronic radar equipment compared with the current mainstream frigates in the world There is already a big gap, like the same type of frigates in Europe has been equipped with all-electric propulsion, small multi-functional phased array radar, large-size helicopter deck, it is time to develop a new model.
So how China's new frigates should be developed is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic policy of our Chinese Navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will be completely a blue-water navy, and the future will also be to go to the ocean, with the ability to quickly deploy in areas closely related to China's vital interests, demonstrate the presence of force, and if necessary, have strong combat effectiveness to ensure that China's vital interests in the region are not damaged, then it seems that the new Hu Weijiang will inevitably develop towards large-scale and ocean-going development.
Looking at the positioning of the new frigate in the future sequence of the Chinese Navy, the future Chinese Navy should be similar to the US Navy, in addition to the necessary coastal defense ships, other capital ships will form an aircraft carrier battle group or amphibious assault ship strike group according to the needs of the situation.
The role of the new frigate in the future aircraft carrier battle group should be the main anti-submarine force and the positioning of the medium and near area emptying, and in the amphibious assault ship strike group should be used as a frigate, so according to such needs, the new frigate must have a strong anti-submarine capability and a good medium-range area airing capability.
Based on the above positioning, we can boldly envisage the approximate appearance of domestic frigates in the future.
First of all, the displacement will be greatly increased compared with the current Type 054A frigate, and it is estimated that the displacement of the new frigate will reach about 5000-6000 tons; The power system will use an integrated electric propulsion system composed of a QC280 improved gas turbine and two diesel engines, which is expected to reach a maximum speed of about 30 knots, and the endurance will also be greatly increased. As for the armament configuration, the 76 mm main gun and the 1130 close defense gun should be retained, but a Hongqi-10 launch system will be added, and there should be a 32-48 unit Hongqi-16 improved and Yu-8 co-frame vertical hair system behind the main gun, and a large vertical hair system of 8-16 units should be installed in the rear of the hull for launching YJ-18 and new cruise missiles; The hangar and parking platform will also be enlarged to accommodate two 10-ton helicopters; As for the electronic radar system, the high-end configuration should be equipped with a small four-sided fixed phased array radar based on the 346A, and the low-end configuration can use a multi-functional rotating phased array radar similar to that on European frigates.
In this way, the overall level of the new frigate will reach the current first-class level in the world, even compared with the American FFG.
Of course, the above concept is just the author's conjecture about the new domestic frigate, and we can only wait until the new frigate is launched to find out, so let's look forward to it.

According to the data in the article, in November 2017, the National Finance and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Center released the "Report on China's Deleveraging Process in the Third Quarter", which pointed out that the leverage ratio of the residential sector continued to rise, from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter , up 1.3 percentage points, and 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The proportion of debt in the residential sector in the total real economy has increased, and the leverage ratio has risen rapidly.
Relevant studies have shown that the liabilities of Chinese households in financial institutions are mainly consumer loans, accounting for about two-thirds of residents' liabilities and about twice that of operating loans.
Among them, among the consumer loans, the medium and long-term loans mainly housing loans account for about eighty percent, but in terms of increment, short-term consumer loans have grown rapidly, which is higher than that of medium and long-term loans.
In addition, China's household debt ratio only counts the total amount of credit obtained by the household sector from financial institutions, and Chinese households also have a lot of private loans, including borrowing money from relatives and friends, and there is a large amount of hidden debt.
According to the statistics of the Suning Institute of Finance, the leverage ratio of Chinese residents was only 3% in 1996 and only 18% in 2008, but since 2008, the leverage ratio of residents has begun to show a rapid growth trend, doubling to 36.4% in just six years. By the third quarter of 2017, the household leverage ratio had reached 48.6%.
Let's compare another data, in May last year, HSBC released a survey report spanning nine countries with nearly 10,000 respondents.
The report surveyed young "millennials" (born between 1980 and 2000) in nine countries.
According to the report, China's homeownership rate among post-80s and post-90s youth is as high as 70%, far ahead of the second place Mexico (46%), and twice the level of the United States (35%).
These data tell us that there is a very likely problem, that is, the biggest potential "gray rhinoceros" of Chinese residents at this stage is estimated to be unable to repay their debts compared to those who cannot afford to buy a house.
2. Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have analyzed before, although we have been saying that China's housing prices are high, compared to other countries in the world, China's homeownership rate is actually quite high, so instead of saying that housing prices are high and you can't afford to buy a house, I'm afraid that the question to ask many friends now is can you afford to take out a loan?
If we look at the real estate market around the world, China's real estate market started late, except for Hainan, which we mentioned earlier, there has not been a major real estate crisis, but just ten years ago, in 2008, the origin of the world's financial tsunami was the real estate crisis in the United States.
The cause of the U.S. housing crisis has been attributed to two houses: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
At that time, in the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold houses to low-income people in the United States with a very low down payment in order to expand sales, and when the American economy was good, the real estate market was also thriving, but the good times did not last long, as the growth of the American economy stagnated, causing the income of home buyers to decline, so a large number of household consumption expenditures began to decline.
However, at that time, the current situation in the United States was that the financial assets and real estate assets of the United States were the components of American household assets, and almost all the household assets of the low-income group in the United States were real estate, while most of the assets of the top 20% of the high-income groups were financial assets, so the more poor the real estate debt ratio in the United States.
A serious fact is that these people bought houses when the economy was better, so the money to pay the mortgage was also calculated based on their better income, and when the income declined, the pressure on the mortgage not only did not decrease, but even increased because some subprime mortgage plans became floating, so the real estate problems of these American families gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
When the bank reclaims the property from the buyers who default on the loan, they will sell it at a very low price, which leads to a gradual decline in housing prices in the area, which in turn triggers a further decline in housing prices, forming a vicious circle, when housing prices fall to a certain extent, more and more buyers find that the value of their houses is even lower than their loans, so more people stop continuing to repay their mortgages, and cause more bad debts。
As a result, a huge vicious circle is formed:
"The economy is sluggish – incomes are falling – some people can't afford to pay their mortgages – banks are selling houses at low prices – house prices are falling – more people are stopping paying their mortgages – banks are selling again – house prices are falling again ......"
And the problem is not only that, because of the continuous decline in housing prices, everyone stops repaying the loan and gives the house to the bank, it is not that you have no debt, if the money you get from auctioning the house cannot repay the loan you owe to the bank, then you still need to repay the money, simply put, suppose you use a down payment of 600,000 yuan, a loan of 2.4 million yuan to buy a house worth 3 million at that time, when the house price falls to the house is only worth 2 million, you no longer repay the loan and give the house to the bank, after the bank auctions the house, you not only lose your down payment of 600,000, but also owe the bank 400,000 debts, you still have to continue to pay back。
As a result, under this vicious circle, the US economy gradually collapsed, which eventually triggered the US financial crisis in 2008.
Therefore, at this stage, the level of China's household debt ratio has reached a high level of 46.8% is a very vigilant problem, this data is still lower than the level of developed countries at present, but the signs of problems have begun to appear, the country has repeatedly emphasized the issue of deleveraging since last year, which is a very prescient judgment, if the household debt ratio is allowed to continue to rise, it will inevitably lead to huge risks, so we must strictly guard against the emergence of financial risks.
Therefore, with the positioning that the house is for living, not for speculation, the state has accelerated the establishment of multiple measures such as multi-subject supply, multi-channel guarantee, and simultaneous rental and purchase to further resolve potential risks.
For our individual families, we must give up real estate speculation thinking, buy a house within our means, to avoid their families falling into a huge burden, only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt level is a healthy family wealth development path.

The British inventor implanted a chip in his body and waved his hand into the house and car
A British inventor installed a chip for himself, and with a wave of his hand, he could open the front door of his house, enter the office and even start the car, becoming the first person in the country.
Steven Northam, 33, has a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and is now offering this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology from his company, BioTeq.
He has worked with Dr Jeff Watson, Senior Consultant Anaesthetist at Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure that the implant process meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to microchipping in dogs and cats and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also replace the locks on individual rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, costing £300 per lock.
The married father, who has a child, has now installed the technology for both his home and his BMW Z4, and he can start the car by simply putting his hands on the steering wheel.

White House props cost thousands
Last month, the White House decided to transport a Marine Corps helicopter to the South Lawn to showcase the great glory of American manufacturing at a cost of up to $24,000, according to military records published by Time magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One when the president rides, is a key exhibit at the White House's July 17 event highlighting U.S. construction projects.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and other senior White House officials toured manufactured products from all 50 states.
Exhibits include a Connecticut-made helicopter, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire engine, and a Mississippi forklift.
According to records from the Marine Corps Helicopter First Flight Team (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House Military Office asked the helicopter to show up on daily order (FRAGO), i.e., just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for this "special" event.
The day before the event, the HMX-1 commander stated in an email to the senior Marine Corps flight deputy commander, "I just want to make sure you know because this event is highly regarded." ”
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive at the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event and will leave only after the lawn is cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. that day.
The message also said that in the event of a postponement of departure from the White House, a second crew would be required for the return voyage due to duty time constraints.
The original crew was on standby by the helicopter during the event, while the security forces were on standby nearby while the aircraft was on the ground.
The records obtained by Time magazine do not clearly indicate whether a second crew will eventually be needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record states that HMX-1 had inquired about whether the event violated the Act.
"One of the questions we asked was whether this violated the Hatch Act and were told there was no violation," the commander wrote. ”
"Sounds like you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The White House defined the "Made in America" event as an official event and therefore not governed by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president pursued health care reform, which was an issue in the Senate at the time, and touted control of government regulations.
The use of Marine One or Air Force One aircraft for propaganda purposes is nothing new.
Successive presidents have been required to travel on these planes.
However, it is not common to requisition it just for the purpose of taking pictures.
Trump was in the spotlight in February, in Melbourne, Florida, when the presidential plane slowly taxied and eventually stopped at the backdrop of his first campaign rally, while his Twitter account was flooded with complaints about the previous president's use of the plane.
"The White House is thrilled by this 'Made in America' exhibit, which showcases products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said Deputy White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters. ”
HMX-1 crews often conduct flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn, practicing accurately placing the President of the United States in the White House.
During Trump's G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 practiced 58 landings at the White House.
The U.S.-made event flight counts toward this month's crew training requirements, an official said.
The helicopter unit also flew an additional 11 hours of "non-presidential support missions" that day.
The White House said taxpayers did not cover the cost of any of the other props at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging the South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 did not keep budget records for presidential flights, so it was difficult to determine the exact cost incurred by the event.
However, according to the Department of Defense's FY 2017 Hourly Cost Record, the VH-3D's DoD reimbursement is $24,380 per flight hour.
Force records recorded the duration of each flight of the aircraft from the base at the Marine Corps airfield in Quantico, Virginia, for 30 minutes.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower than the fee.
"It is very misleading to estimate what a taxpayer will pay based on reimbursable expenses," Walters said.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs that are included in the annual allocation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that DoD reimbursable expenses do not include personnel costs, but do include fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spike defended the use of the helicopter for the event,
and said that "the idea is to show what is made in the United States this week,
And I know that both Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of that, and they both contribute to our national security, and I guess there are hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, the result of the hard work of countless Americans.
So it's certainly not out of place to show that. ”
It's unclear if Trump interacted with the helicopter during his tour of the South Lawn at the event, but he did get in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Mr. Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about the company's planes he owned.
He said: "I know the Sikorsky aircraft very well. I have three. ”

Neighbors also say that the fortune tree is in bloom, which is really rare. The residents of the community thought that this was a very auspicious event, and they all came to watch it with great interest after learning about it.
The scientific name of the fortune tree is "Malabar chestnut", which is a tropical plant, native to Mexico, and likes warm and humid, and must be suitable for many conditions such as sunlight, water, and nutrients before flowering can occur.

According to the Market Star, from 2005 to 2011, the GDP of our province rose from the central part of the province to the second place.
However, the economic growth of our province still has the dilemma of low investment efficiency and lack of core competitiveness of the industrial economy. To this end, the latest issue of the "Economic Blue Page" of the Provincial Economic Information Center proposes to improve the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
Based on some representative indicators of the province's economy in 2005 and 2011, it is compared with the whole country and the central region.
In terms of industrial economic benefits, in 2011, in our province occupies a considerable proportion of industrial energy, raw materials and other high-energy-consuming industries, affected by market fluctuations and overcapacity "double pressure", at the same time, home appliances, automobiles and other leading industries lack of innovation, resulting in meager profits.
However, a large amount of investment has not brought corresponding economic benefits, which is an important reason for the low quality and efficiency of economic growth in our province.
In this regard, experts suggest that effective measures should be taken to encourage enterprise innovation, and the scientific and technological achievements of universities and scientific research institutes should also be "transferred" to enterprises in a timely manner.

The General Labor Union (GMB) is looking at the investment in McVitie's Glasgow facility
The union wants the management of biscuit manufacturer Macrovita to commit to production at the Lasgow plant for the long term.
The Scottish branch of the CGT said it had been silent about the future of its investment in the Tollcross plant.
The plant employs more than 500 people and produces products such as hobnobs and rich tea.
Pladis, owner of Macrovita, said the company had invested more than £5 million in the plant over the past few years.
He added that if there is a change in factory operations, employees and union representatives "will be the first to know".
In a letter to the company's director, the Scottish branch of the CGT called on McVita to "resolve the problem of uncarried funds for the modernization of the production line." ”
Drew Duffy, senior organiser of the CGT union, said: "We were deeply concerned to our members because we were unable to get a clear picture of Tollcross's future business needs and investment plans from the general manager of the plant.
Generations of families have worked here, and the high concentration of labour in the local community and Greater Glasgow is an important pillar of decent employment in areas with high levels of unemployment and social deprivation.
So, from a job, pay and economic prosperity perspective, against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and a prolonged manufacturing recession, the eastern Glasgow region is in dire need of a growing Microvita production network. ”
A Pradis spokesperson said: "Tollcross's factory manager received a letter from the Scottish branch of the CGT yesterday and will be responding immediately as we value our ongoing engagement with our employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with staff and CGT representatives in Tollcross to openly discuss a number of issues.
We had discussions with our employees, and then, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and economically uncertain environment, we conducted a review of our ongoing operating model applied to our businesses and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross plant, particularly in line and operational improvements.
We are fully aware of Tollcross's historical position as a production site, and employees and union representatives will be the first to know about any changes to our operations at the site. ”
Tibet, 11 May (ZXS) -- Nima Tsering, deputy director of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Sports Bureau, said at the base camp on the north slope of Mount Everest on 10 May that in the future, the cleaning up of domestic garbage on the north slope of Mount Everest will move from a public welfare action in the past to a normalized behavior led by the Chinese government and with the participation of all sectors of the international community.
On May 10, environmental volunteers loaded sorted garbage into trucks.
Photo by China News Service reporter He Penglei In the past ten years, with the sharp increase in the number of mountaineering explorers and tourists on Mount Everest, the environmental protection problems in the location of the mountain have become increasingly prominent.
In the spring of 1997, the Tibet Autonomous Region Mountaineering Association launched its first clean-up campaign on the north slope of Mount Everest, cleaning up a batch of oxygen cylinders and other household garbage left over from the sixties and seventies of the last century. The video was also specially shown at the Tokyo World Climate Conference that year, attracting the world's attention.
According to Nima Tsering, after 1997, the charity team has successively cleaned the north slope of Mount Everest, but most of the participants are non-professionals.
Did Paris Saint-Germain warn Barcelona about signing Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret throwing an olive branch to Marco Verratti
PSG won't give up on signing Neymar after making a £189million offer to try to get him to exercise his waiver clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about attacking the world record raider?
This sensational approach has opened the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club poised to break the world transfer record for more than double the previous transfer record. Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season for a whopping £89 million.
Once the transfer is completed, Neymar will make the leap to become the world's most valuable player and the world's highest-paid professional athlete – with PSG offering an after-tax salary of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are furious at Neymar's attacking style and the way out, with sources close to the Catalan team's board insisting that the club have gone out of their way to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the president of Paris Saint-Germain make such a prediction about the world of football three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matedi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to any club that wanted to sign PSG's best player.
'I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we're going to go toe-to-toe with them and we're going to contact their players as well,' said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign our players, they're going to suffer the consequences. ”
Earlier this summer, the Spanish club appeared to have crossed the line when Barcelona threw an olive branch to Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain have made it clear that they will not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona are likely to be affected by the loss of their talented Neymar.

London, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- The British Sports Council announced on the 9th its goal to participate in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea next month: to win at least five medals, which is the "most ambitious" goal in the history of the British delegation to participate in the Winter Olympics.
The British Sports Council is responsible for the allocation of funds for the Olympic sports and, of course, for the medal-winning targets for each event.
British athletes are expected to challenge for medals in snowboarding, curling, skeleton and short track speed skating.
In the past Winter Olympics cycle, the British Sports Council allocated a total of 32 million pounds (about 280 million yuan) of training funds for the Winter Olympics, which is double the Sochi Winter Olympics cycle.
Most of this money comes from the national lottery, and the rest comes from the state treasury.
Great Britain's hopes of winning gold are mainly pinned on two people, Alice Christie, a three-time gold medallist at last year's World Short Track Speed Skating Championships, and Liz Arnold, the women's skeleton champion last year.
At Sochi 2014, the British team won one gold, one silver and two bronze medals, their best record since the first Winter Olympics in 1924.
