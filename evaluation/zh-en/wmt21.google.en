Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26th: Turn outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiong, 34, lives in Guoyuan Village, Meishan City, Sichuan. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands to return to his hometown to start a business.
After several years of hard work, the annual income of the grape-growing family farm he runs now exceeds one million yuan. He has become a well-known leader in getting rich. He has also been selected to join the village&#39;s &quot;two committees&quot; team.
In recent years, inspired by a series of national policies to support agriculture and benefit farmers, such as poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return to their hometowns to start businesses, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a most populous province in western my country and a major labor exporter, took advantage of the situation and implemented the &quot;Excellent Migrant Workers Reintroduction and Training Project&quot;. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were produced from the outstanding migrant workers who were introduced back to the country, cultivating village reserve forces. 61,000 people and more than 20,000 party members have been developed, providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
Whether you are well-off or not depends on your fellow villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in my country&#39;s rural areas have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have established their own businesses through hard work.
However, objectively speaking, it has also led to the emergence of &quot;hollowing out&quot; in rural areas to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grassroots organizations. The village party branch secretaries and party members all show the characteristics of &quot;one old and one young&quot;, that is, aging, low academic qualifications, and the village party The team of organizational leaders is not strong and the problem of lack of support is prominent.
If rural talents and other factors continue to flow to cities in one direction, the countryside will be in a state of &quot;blood loss&quot; and &quot;anemia&quot; for a long time, and revitalization will be empty talk.
Attracting those migrant workers who are capable, aware, and determined to serve their hometowns, guiding them to return to their hometowns to start businesses and become leaders in getting rich, selecting the best among them to train them into party members and rural cadres, and enriching the team of grassroots cadres is the solution to the problem of rural party members. and grass-roots party organizations are in a state of insecurity.
To attract outstanding migrant workers back, we must also ensure that they can stay and work well.
In recent years, Sichuan has begun to pay close attention to the construction of the migrant workers&#39; party. On the basis of strict selection standards, it has established institutional mechanisms such as targeted return of outstanding migrant workers, service guarantees, training and improvement, selection and employment, so that they can improve their abilities and work. There is security in school, hope in life, true roots in the countryside, and a sense of accomplishment in starting a business.
This year is the final year of the decisive battle against poverty. Talent is the key factor in connecting poverty alleviation with rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels must attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, build them into a work team and a new force that can be retained, can fight, and cannot be taken away, so as to provide support for rural poverty alleviation and development and revitalization. Strong organizational guarantee and talent support.
Due to the epidemic, this year&#39;s college graduates are a very special class.

Data shows that the peak live broadcast popularity of this 2.5-hour concert exceeded 35 million.
&quot;Follow your heart, seize opportunities, and don&#39;t care about the consequences. Sometimes you will get unexpected rewards.&quot;
Although it was a graduation concert, many of the songs also moved non-fresh graduates.
&quot;Watching the whole scene, I really wanted to cry. Everyone&#39;s youth is full of beauty and regrets, but they are all worth remembering, and we must all go on bravely.&quot;
Beijing&#39;s natural ecology continues to improve, attracting more than 500 species of wild animals to &quot;settle&quot; in the city - China News Service

The capital’s natural ecology continues to improve, attracting wild animals to “settle” in the city
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
Report from our newspaper (Reporter Wang Bin) A reporter from Beijing Youth Daily learned from the Municipal Landscaping and Greening Bureau that in recent years, as the natural ecological environment of the capital continues to improve, the types and numbers of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals inhabiting Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including national first-level protected animals such as brown-eared pheasants and black storks, as well as national second-level protected animals such as gorals, whooper swans, gray cranes, and mandarin ducks.
Whether it is planted in urban forests everywhere within the Second Ring Road or in small wetlands embedded between buildings, it not only brings the wild charm of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to &quot;settle&quot; in the city.
In midsummer, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of life.
A raccoon dog was playing leisurely next to a mountain stream, while two badgers were playing with each other.
Looking back, I saw a wild boar that couldn&#39;t help but scratch the bark of a tree. Hu Qiaoli, director of the Songshan National Nature Reserve Management Office, said that as of the end of 2019, in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, there were living species including the golden eagle, a national first-level protected animal, and the spoon pheasant and goral, a national second-level protected animal. There are 178 species of wild animals in the park, and nearly one-third of the city’s wild animal species can be seen here.
&quot;In Songshan, wild animals are the real &#39;owners&#39;, and our staff can only be regarded as their &#39;bodyguards&#39; at best.&quot;
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the situation of wild animals and plants in the reserve on the spot, more than 30 professional rangers patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day, and there is also a &quot;big circle&quot; every month. It took a full day to cover almost the entire reserve.
&quot;During inspections, we not only check and record biodiversity, but also check and install artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install field infrared cameras, etc.&quot;
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that as the biodiversity of the reserve has continued to enrich in recent years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the camera. Leopard cats, raccoon dogs and pig badgers have become &quot;resident guests&quot;, and the goral, a national second-level protected animal, has The &quot;appearance rate&quot; is also getting higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Department of the Beijing Municipal Landscaping Bureau, said that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals in Beijing has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 species now. The types and numbers of wild animals in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years. .
The sight of wild animals in cities is becoming more and more common, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of greening in the capital city in recent years.
In particular, the new round of afforestation and greening construction of one million acres starting in 2018 proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological functions of woodlands and green spaces, and highlight the concept of &quot;close to nature&quot;.
The planning strives to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green spaces to facilitate wild animals to &quot;visit relatives and friends&quot;. The trees planted are also plants that are favorite nectar and food sources for animals.
Agricultural modernization is &quot;sown&quot; in black soil - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26th: Agricultural modernization is &quot;planted&quot; in black soil
In midsummer, two pesticide-spraying planes flew over the 10,000-acre high-yield demonstration field at the second operation station of the fifth management area of Youyi Farm, forming two white lines. The &quot;first in the world&quot; was planted with black rice seedlings in the green field. Several large characters are particularly eye-catching.
Kong Lingqiang, the director of this operation station, said that this kind of aircraft can spray pesticides on more than 6,000 acres of cultivated land in a day, and its efficiency is about 8 times that of drones and hundreds of times that of manual labor.
This farm is located in Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, my country&#39;s largest grain-producing province. From the &quot;swish&quot; sound of rice harvesting in the past to the &quot;rumble&quot; sound of motors today, traditional Chinese farming and farming have undergone transformation in this black soil belt.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in modern agricultural production at Youyi Farm.
Kong Lingqiang said that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precise fertilization, reduce agricultural input and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standardization of agricultural machinery in the field.
During this year&#39;s rice production, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation driverless rice transplanting technology from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
This technology enables seedlings to be planted more evenly, maximizes the utilization of sunlight and cultivated land resources, and saves labor costs of 16 yuan per acre.
Farms are experimenting with new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming my country&#39;s largest agricultural machinery group from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, there are currently 49,000 agricultural machines in the farm, and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field reaches 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations achieve 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision sowing in dry fields, and 100% high-horsepower locomotive operations in dry fields.
“Green agriculture, smart agriculture, and digital agriculture are the directions for exploring agricultural modernization.”
Liu Hualian, director of Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role in modern large-scale agriculture in recent years, and has initially established a modern agricultural industry system dominated by large-scale planting, standardized production, and industrialized management.
In the suburbs of Youyi County, there is an agricultural machinery expo park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
More than 140 pieces of agricultural machinery and tools introduced and used by Heilongjiang Farm Reclamation over the years are on display here.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development process of my country&#39;s agricultural modernization.

Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu and Liu Xiacun
At around 4 p.m. on July 25, Fu Kunbao, wearing muddy rubber shoes, walked back and forth from the front room to the back room, busy packing his things with his wife Zhou Yan.
&quot;I was still weeding in the field when I received the call from the village cadre to transfer.&quot;
Fu Kunbao said that he transferred more than 60 acres of land and planted rice, which is now growing well. &quot;I sprayed medicine yesterday, and I haven&#39;t packed away the tools or anything else.&quot;
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner, &quot;No one wants their home to be flooded, so let&#39;s sacrifice our small home for everyone.&quot;
In response to the continued high water pressure in Chaohu Lake and possible heavy rainfall, Hefei City, Anhui Province is preparing to activate the flood diversion and storage of the Jiangkou River Lianwei where Fu Kunbao&#39;s home is located on the 26th.
Jiangkou River Lianwei is located in Feixi County, close to the Chaohu Embankment.
Thousands of villagers from Yandian Township and Sanhe Town need to be relocated.
As of 16:00 on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, my country&#39;s fifth largest freshwater lake, remained at a high of 13.2 meters, 0.7 meters above the guaranteed water level.
The kitchen of Fu Kunbao&#39;s house is clean and tidy. There is a pot of pumpkin head vegetables on the table, and there are eggs and some braised vegetables in the refrigerator.
&quot;I didn&#39;t expect to move it. The water in Jiangkou River looks fine so far. &quot;
Zhou Yan said that her home is a bungalow and she has not yet decided where to put some large items.
&quot;Pack away your valuables first. Large items such as refrigerators and TVs can be temporarily placed at the homes of neighbors or relatives on higher ground.&quot;
Village cadre Wang Liwen gave Fu Kunbao advice.
Wang Liwen was responsible for the relocation and resettlement of 13 households of villagers. He notified each household one by one to confirm the resettlement plan for each person.
The nearest resettlement site to Fu Kunbao&#39;s home is Su Xiao Primary School in Yandian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to large items, Fu Kunbao and his wife also have more than 1,000 kilograms of grain and some newly purchased furniture that give Fu Kunbao and his wife a headache.
&quot;The food is going to be hauled to relatives&#39; houses, but there is no way to move the furniture.&quot;
After discussion, the couple put a stool under the newly purchased bed and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6 p.m., Fu Kunbao started transporting things to relatives&#39; houses on a tricycle, while Zhou Yan continued to pack at home.
At about 11 o&#39;clock in the evening, the couple looked around at home, turned on the power switch, and prepared to go to the resettlement site.
&quot;I hope the water will recede soon.&quot;
Fu Kunbao said.
At 9:30 a.m. on July 26, reporters at the Jiangkou River Lianwei site saw that the local area had made preparations for flood diversion.
Zhang Ji, Kelin and Xiaozhai form a team to support muscular boys - Xinhuanet
The passionate sports show &quot;Sports Boys&quot; officially launched on Hunan Satellite TV on July 11.
Sports team leader Zhang Jike and sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai share the stage across borders. Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui have their own styles of commentary, and the hard-core appearance of the &quot;monster&quot;-like power pull-up device makes the program even more &quot;burning&quot;.
In the first episode, 11 athletic teenagers appeared on the strength track. While their appearance stunned the audience, the &quot;strong conflict&quot;, &quot;strong confrontation&quot; and &quot;strong heart&quot; on the arena also attracted attention.
Among them, the &quot;strong conflict&quot; came from Qiao Wenyi, a super-A sports student. Before the competition, he openly provoked Xu Zhibin, known as the &quot;flower boy&quot; in the same track, saying that Xu Zhibin&#39;s appearance conditions should make him sing and dance, and even released &quot;Losing&quot; Stop crying and ruin your makeup.”
These remarks made the teenagers and sports leaders on the field take a breath.
The &quot;strong confrontation&quot; is more like a fight between gods. Sun Jianqi, known as the &quot;Big Devil&quot;, meets Zhang Xindong, who is equally strong, and stages a strong showdown.
Their identities are also unexpected. Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, and Zhang Xindong is a retired special forces member and a three-time Warrior Medal winner.
At the beginning of the game, the two teenagers tried their best to quickly pull out the small pole, and their long-lasting confrontation on the big pole made the audience sweat for them.
Under the tense competition conditions, Zhang Jike, as one of the sports leaders of &quot;Sports Boys&quot;, was also watching the game carefully.
During the review session, he was also very attentive, patiently encouraging the teenagers who lost the game and helping to review every mistake in the process.
As for sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai, she made every effort to provide assists. She made no secret of her admiration for the young people who are good-looking and capable.
When I learned about the overloaded daily training of young athletes, I felt even more admiration.
Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports team leaders, have their own styles. One is a calm and leisurely &quot;prophet&quot;, and the other is a &quot;prehistoric girl&quot; who dispels the tense atmosphere with a smile.
In addition, Jike Junyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, also created a lot of hilarious topics around sports teenagers.

On the 26th local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer responsible for security work in the cathedral had been charged with &quot;arson and destruction.&quot;
He has admitted that he lit the fire in the church.
According to the report, local prosecutor Senas said that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he lit three fires in the cathedral at night.
The man&#39;s lawyer said the arsonist now regrets what he did.

The prosecutor pointed out that he recently tried to renew his visa and was in dialogue with the police station about this.
But the church said it still couldn&#39;t believe that this believer, who was usually very kind and smiling but didn&#39;t talk much, would destroy the church he loved so much.

The picture shows firefighters performing rescue operations at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, as professional engineers from the Paris Central Police Laboratory obtained new evidence, this person was interrogated again.
This time, the man admitted to setting the fire.

Ali Yusuf, executive director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, said that the countermeasures China was forced to take were legitimate and necessary responses to the unreasonable actions of the United States, which were in line with international law and basic norms governing international relations, and were also in line with diplomacy. convention.
Previously, the US demanded the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which seriously violated international law and basic norms governing international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will revoke its previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the relations between the two countries to return to normal.
Singapore&#39;s &quot;Lianhe Zaobao&quot; published an editorial saying that the United States&#39; greater strategic intention is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
Faced with the increasing pressure of the United States, although China is very reluctant to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Poland to withdraw from European treaty to prevent violence against women
Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women, the Ministry of Justice said on Saturday.
Poland&#39;s right-wing government cabinet said the treaty violated the rights of parents by requiring schools to teach students about gender issues.
Polish Justice Minister Djoblo held a press conference and said that his Ministry of Justice will submit a request to the Ministry of Labor and Family on Monday to begin withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.

Poland&#39;s ruling Law and Justice party and its coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Andrzej Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
Thousands of Poles, mostly women, protested in Warsaw and other cities on Friday against withdrawing from the convention.
Lempart, one of the organizers of the protest, said at a protest march in Warsaw that &quot;the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence.&quot;
Some protesters held banners that read &quot;Law and Justice is hell for women.&quot;
Law and Justice has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland&#39;s previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice government says the treaty does not respect religion and requires liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
But so far the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

FAA urgently orders inspection of 2,000 Boeing passenger planes due to possible engine stalling - Xinhuanet
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring emergency inspections of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737 Classic passenger aircraft registered in the United States. The reason is that corrosion of the air check valves of the above-mentioned passenger aircraft may cause the engine to fly in the air. parking.
The FAA said it has received four reports of in-flight engine shutdowns of 737NG and 737 Classic passenger aircraft so far, and therefore issued emergency inspection requirements. The inspection targets are passenger aircraft that have been parked for seven consecutive days or more and those that have flown less than 11 times after being put back into flight. passenger plane.
The FAA warned that if the fifth-stage check valves on both engines of a passenger plane become corroded, they could become stuck in the open position, causing the plane to completely lose power and be unable to restart the engines.
The aviation regulator ordered that if corrosion is found in a check valve, air operators must replace the critical component before the aircraft can be put back into service.
Boeing responded later that day that the COVID-19 outbreak had led to reduced travel demand and that many passenger planes had been mothballed or used less often, making &quot;check valves more susceptible to corrosion.&quot;
Boeing also said that it has recommended that air operators inspect the passenger aircraft involved in the directive. If problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in repairing and replacing check valves.
The Associated Press reported that passenger planes owned by major U.S. airline operators usually fly multiple times a day, but after the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, a large number of passenger planes were grounded; as passenger travel demand has slowly increased recently, some passenger planes have returned to service.
The FAA did not release details of the four mid-air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The airline operator said in a statement that one of its passenger planes was en route from Seattle, Washington to Austin, Texas, on July 15 when an engine suddenly stalled and the plane eventually made a successful emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the engine on that plane and had inspected the engines on six other planes in compliance with FAA orders.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines respectively said on the 24th that there were no engine stalls related to air check valves on their passenger planes.
Four passenger planes owned by American Airlines will be inspected, and 28 passenger planes owned by United Airlines will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect 20 of its passenger planes, but did not say whether engine stalls had occurred.
Multiple media reported that the FAA’s emergency airworthiness directive is another blow to Boeing.
A Boeing 737MAX passenger plane of Indonesian Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
This series of passenger planes were subsequently grounded globally. Production was suspended in January this year and resumed in May.

&quot;Fortress Jiangnan&quot; pursues the poetic &quot;Yellow River Dream&quot;-China News
(Story of Poverty Alleviation in China) &quot;Crossing the Yangtze River&quot; pursues the poetic &quot;Yellow River Dream&quot;
China News Service, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) &quot;The Yellow River has thousands of miles of sand, and the waves and winds blow from the end of the world.&quot;
The Yellow River, which aroused the passion of countless literati, gave birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Today, Ningxia, known as the &quot;Fortress of Jiangnan&quot;, is adhering to the concept of &quot;ecological priority, green development&quot; and pursuing the poetic &quot;Yellow River Dream.&quot;
The &quot;Dream of Blue Waves&quot; with Clear River and Beautiful Water
&quot;The Yellow River in the world enriches Ningxia&quot;. The Yellow River flows through Ningxia for 397 kilometers and is the &quot;mother river&quot; that nourishes the country.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization, management and protection of rivers and lakes are out of balance, and chaos such as excessive sewage discharge, lake reclamation, and water encroachment have emerged, resulting in black and smelly water bodies, excessive water quality, dirty environment, and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting diversified restoration of water ecology and striving to make the Yellow River beautiful and clear.
Water control must start from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government adopts the approach of &quot;raising standards + pollution control + strict management&quot;. All sewage in industrial parks has been treated centrally, all urban sewage treatment plants have achieved Class A discharge standards, and black and odorous water bodies in urban built-up areas have been basically eliminated. The application was successfully submitted. The third batch of China’s black and smelly water body demonstration cities.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake chief system in 2017, and now has achieved full coverage of the five-level river and lake chief responsibility system in districts, cities, counties, and villages, and long-term river and lake patrols have become the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, lives in a village beside the Yellow River. He has witnessed the changes in the Yellow River: &quot;The water used to have a smell, but after treatment, the smell is gone.&quot;
Gu Jincheng said that with the improvement of the ecological environment, his life has become more comfortable. Now he and his family often go for walks along the Yellow River to feel the clear water and blue sky.
The “wetland dream” of flying sand gulls
Birds, green trees, plank roads, clear water... the beautiful scenery of &quot;Gathering of Sand Gulls&quot; written by Fan Zhongyan has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, and various wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands, and swamp wetlands have been formed along the way. It plays an important role in promoting the rational utilization of water resources and aquatic ecological balance. It has also become an internationally important bird migration channel.
Since 2009, relevant departments in Ningxia have invested a total of approximately 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. Currently, Yinchuan wetland area is 19,200 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%. There are nearly 200 natural lakes and swamps, and There are 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks, and 8 municipal-level parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of the Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds. “The relict gull is an endangered bird, with only more than 20,000 in the world, among which Yinchuan Wetland has More than 2,000 live there.”
At the same time, Ningxia has delineated a 500-meter red line for the wetland protection areas on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law. It is stipulated that except for public welfare projects, no unit or individual is allowed to carry out development, construction and business activities within the protection scope.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through pollution source control, comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology, and construction of terminal wetlands, the water quality of Ningxia’s nine main drainage ditches has now reached 100% Class IV standards. “The water is now clear. The fish are swimming and the flowers are blooming.”
The “drinking water dream” that benefits people’s livelihood
Yinchuan City in Ningxia once had an &quot;embarrassing&quot; title: it was the only city along the Yellow River that &quot;guarded the Yellow River for lack of water.&quot;
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing a persistent water shortage problem during the peak summer period. The &quot;pain of water shortage&quot; in the past ten years has become a painful summer experience for many high-rise residents. However, major water sources are at a super high level. With the mining limit and a large area of groundwater over-exploitation funnel area formed underground in the urban area, water source shortage has become a problem plaguing Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking purified Yellow River water has become a good solution to the drinking water problem of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of the Yinchuan Municipal Water Affairs Bureau, said that in order to improve the demand for living and production water for urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia promptly launched the urban and rural western water supply project in the Yinchuan metropolitan area to replace the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River water.
&quot;On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially opened water to the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank Yellow River water. &quot;
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan water conservancy department will make overall plans to integrate the transformation of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply. “In the next step, we will integrate the scattered water supply points in rural areas and connect them all to the western water supply project. It is expected that by the end of this year, the Yinchuan area will be basically completed. Integrated water supply for urban and rural areas.”

Lewis family: John Lewis was a &#39;fighter for the weakest&#39;
US Congressman and civil rights fighter John Lewis was remembered as a warrior who &quot;fought for the most vulnerable&quot; at a memorial service held for him on Saturday (July 25).
Public memorial services for Lewis began Saturday in Alabama.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis&#39; five siblings and a grandnephew spoke of him as a loving, fearless, family-oriented man.
&quot;He dedicated his life to helping others,&quot; Lewis&#39; youngest brother, Henry &quot;Grant&quot; Lewis, said at the meeting.
Samuel Lewis said his mother warned John to &quot;stay out of trouble, stay out of trouble.&quot;
He added that John had not heeded his mother&#39;s warnings, saying: &quot;We all know John is always going to get into trouble, always getting into trouble, but that&#39;s because he stands up for what&#39;s right, and that&#39;s a good trouble. .”
Lewis&#39; siblings reminded people at the memorial service that John&#39;s most famous argument was to cause &quot;good trouble,&quot; that is, he would not shy away from stirring up trouble as long as it was for justice.
John once applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born. However, Troy University, which was an all-white school at the time, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his family farm as a boy, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Sen. Doug Jones, R-Alabama, said current protesters &quot;are protesting peacefully and nonviolently,&quot; just as Lewis did during the civil rights movement.
&quot;President Trump is wrong even though he is calling all protesters thugs,&quot; Jones said.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move toward a more equal country. &quot;
A six-day series of events honoring Lewis will culminate this week with a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis&#39; casket lay at a public memorial at Troy University on Saturday as people came to pay their respects to the civil rights pioneer.
He was honored later Saturday at a private ceremony at a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial.
On Sunday, Lewis&#39; body will travel across Selma&#39;s Edmund Pettus Bridge.
In 1965, he and demonstrators demanding black voting rights were beaten by Alabama police in front of this bridge, and the police also fired tear gas at the demonstrators.
Lewis was nearly beaten to death.
This day later became known as &quot;Bloody Sunday.&quot;
Lewis&#39; body will be transported to Montgomery, Alabama&#39;s capital.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk and join Lewis on his final journey.
At the same time, officials require the public to wear masks and maintain social distance when participating in activities.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey ordered flags to be flown at half-staff on Saturday and Sunday in Lewis&#39; honor.
During the nearly week-long commemoration, Lewis&#39;s body will be placed in temporary state at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington for people to express their condolences.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people can pay their respects to Lewis at the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, public events honoring Lewis will be held outdoors.

Hoh Xil Tibetan antelope enters migration season - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Conservation Station of the Hoh Xil Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration that monitoring showed that Tibetan antelopes had previously migrated to the Zhuonai Lake area in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth. The birthing process is ending and the cubs are returning to their original habitat.
Surveillance footage near the Wudaoliang Conservation Station shows that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led three Tibetan antelope calves through the 3002-kilometer Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudaoliang North Bridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The Tibetan antelopes have begun to migrate back. .
Experts analyze that in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope calves in the migrating sheep has accounted for one-quarter to one-fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelopes.
Lian Xinming, associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: &quot;In the early stages of migration, Tibetan antelopes face a higher risk of being predated, so the number of cubs in the flock will be relatively small, or there may even be no cubs at all.&quot;
According to statistics from the Hoh Xil Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelopes migrating back is generally increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelopes migrating back was 4,860, an increase of 338 from 2018.
Lian Xinming said: &quot;This year&#39;s migration of Tibetan antelopes is expected to end in early September, and the number of Tibetan antelopes migrating back is still expected to continue to increase.&quot;
Tibetan antelope is a national first-level protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet, Altyn Mountains in Xinjiang and other places go to Zhuonai Lake in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth to lambs.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert on the protection of Tibetan antelopes in my country and a researcher at the Shaanxi Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said: &quot;The migration of Tibetan antelopes is a process in which female Tibetan antelopes return to their habitats with their cubs after giving birth. At first, they leave the country after giving birth. The migration group from Zedi is relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelopes will return to their respective habitats along different routes according to different geographical populations.&quot;
In order to ensure the safe return of the Tibetan antelope herds, the reporter learned that the Hoh Xil Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged staff to continue to carry out video monitoring and patrols in the main relocation areas.
If a herd of Tibetan antelopes is discovered trying to cross the highway, the mountain patrol team will immediately conduct temporary traffic control to allow the herds to pass through the wildlife passage safely and ensure that they are as little disturbed by humans as possible during their return journey.
So, how to relieve the heat in daily life?
Experts recommend that you try to avoid hot periods when going out in summer, and it is best not to walk or work under the scorching sun around noon, because the sun is strongest during this period and the possibility of heat stroke is higher.
If you must go out during this period, be sure to take protective measures, such as using a parasol, a sunhat, and sunglasses. If possible, apply sunscreen to prevent sunburn.
Try to choose light-colored, breathable cotton, linen, and silk clothes, and wear less chemical fiber clothes to avoid heat stroke due to inability to dissipate heat in time when sweating a lot.
In hot and muggy weather, prepare enough water and drink it in time. Do not wait until you are thirsty before drinking water, because once you feel thirsty, it means that your body is already dehydrated. Drink water at a temperature of 150 ml to 200 ml each time. Boil water, don’t drink ice water.
Depending on the temperature, the average person should drink 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day, and those working in high temperatures should drink 3 to 5 liters of water per day.
When you sweat a lot, you can add some salt water to make up for the salt your body loses due to sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to potassium deficiency in summer, making people feel tired and fatigued. Potassium-containing tea is an excellent summer drink.
In summer, eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc.; fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, etc., with a water content of 80% to 90%, can be used to replenish water; dairy products can both replenish water and water. , and can meet the nutritional needs of the body.

New drug developed by an Australian university is expected to treat blood vessel blockage caused by COVID-19 - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Australia&#39;s Monash University are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that this drug can be used to treat blood vessels caused by the new coronavirus. clogged.
Researchers have discovered that an enzyme in platelets speeds up platelet clotting before a heart attack or stroke occurs.
From this, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet aggregation, thereby avoiding blood vessel blockage and preventing heart disease and stroke.
Researchers say the drug only inhibits platelet clotting when there are signs of heart attack or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar blood vessel blockage is one of the leading causes of death in patients with severe COVID-19, researchers hope that this drug can be used to treat such severe patients in the future.

China News Service, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26th: Xinjiang deeply cultivates &quot;sunflower fields&quot; and makes good use of clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal heliostats, each 48 square meters, are neatly arranged in a circle, like a silver &quot;sunflower field&quot;. They rotate with the sun and reflect sunlight to the more than 200-meter-high heat-absorbing tower in the center to generate electricity. .
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the China Power Engineering Hami Molten Salt Tower Solar Power Plant in Naomaohu Town, Yiwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
&quot;The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation is to concentrate sunlight through mirrors to the heat absorption tower to form heat energy, and then convert the heat energy into electrical energy through traditional power generation technology.&quot;
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of China Electronics Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd., said that its design principle is similar to the solar cookers used in rural areas of northwest China, which must concentrate sunlight.
The power plant started construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year. It covers an area of 6,600 acres and plans to install a total of 14,500 heliostats.
&quot;Compared with traditional solar power generation technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the accumulated thermal energy and generate electricity at night.&quot;
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured in the project can keep the generator set running continuously and stably without being affected by changes in light; it can also quickly participate in grid peak regulation according to the peak and valley demand of the grid load.
After the project is fully completed, it can achieve an annual power generation of 198 million kilowatt-hours, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal every year, and reduce emissions of more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot, and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide. Provide a steady stream of clean energy to the local area.
In addition, there is another silver &quot;sunflower field&quot; in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hamilton Foguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 acres. The 714 power generation equipment that have been built also follow the rotation of the sun and always maintain a 90-degree right angle between the sunlight and the concentrating panel.
&quot;We use dual-axis tracking concentrated photovoltaic power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust its angle according to the height of the sun to maintain power generation efficiency.&quot;
Duan Mengqi, director of the power station, said that under good weather conditions, this power generation technology can increase the power generation efficiency by about 20% compared with traditional photovoltaic power generation.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million kWh of electricity, supplementing local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest photovoltaic industry demonstration park in Xinjiang with the most complete types of photovoltaic modules. It has a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects and a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, the power generation capacity exceeded 110 million kilowatt-hours, an increase of 6% compared with the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the areas with the best solar energy resources in China.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted &quot;sunflower fields&quot;.
More than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power generation capacity has been built. In the first half of this year, the city&#39;s photovoltaic power generation exceeded 1.4 billion kilowatt-hours, a year-on-year increase of about 14%.
Currently, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang, with an installed capacity of over 10 million kilowatts.
It is expected that photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion kilowatt-hours this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.

US media revealed the truth behind the US’s unwarranted demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the U.S. Embassy in China that China has decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu and put forward specific requirements for the consulate general to cease all business and activities in response to the sudden U.S. request on the 21st that China should close Countermeasures taken by the Consulate General in Houston.
This behavior of the US government has attracted much attention, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is China asked to close the Consulate General?
Many foreign media said that it was unclear why the United States selected the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but the purpose of this move was bluntly stated by foreign media: for the general election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the United States’ request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston has raised questions about its political motives.
The article stated that the U.S. government’s disastrous response to the COVID-19 epidemic caused President Trump’s relatively low approval rating in polls before the election.
White House officials privately said that the tough strategy adopted against China was to save Trump&#39;s approval rating and to deflect responsibility for the White House&#39;s failure to respond to the epidemic.
The article believes that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a &quot;politically driven and very cautious&quot; target chosen by the United States. The US government selected it &quot;to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflicts.&quot;
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that as the U.S. election season approaches and the U.S. economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that &quot;playing the &#39;China card&#39; has political advantages.&quot;
The current situation is &quot;a spiraling, tit-for-tat struggle,&quot; which is driven in part by the U.S. government&#39;s domestic considerations and will only worsen tensions between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump’s re-election prospects are under pressure due to the outbreak, and he has repeatedly blamed China for the epidemic.
Almost every day, the United States takes new actions against Trump&#39;s ridiculous assertion that &quot;China exploits the United States.&quot;
“The Consulate General in Houston is very important in establishing connections between the two countries”
The Associated Press commented that the United States&#39; request for China to close its Consulate General in Houston has exacerbated tensions between the world&#39;s two largest economies.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to the diplomatic impact, Chinese citizens in the southern United States will face difficulties in obtaining consular services, and American citizens seeking visas and other services will also face difficulties.
A Houston business group expressed regret over the U.S. request that China close its Consulate General in Houston, saying the Consulate General has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of China&#39;s economy.
The website of the US magazine &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; believes that this move by the US &quot;is part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen US-China relations.&quot;
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an East Asia expert at the Brookings Institution, an American think tank, as saying that since the United States and China established comprehensive diplomatic relations in 1979, he could not think of any move comparable to the U.S. attack on the Chinese Consulate General in Houston. This operation is comparable.
Hong Kong&#39;s South China Morning Post reported that this move by the United States was unprecedented in the more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe the move could cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 and was the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
Currently, China has one embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

Free nucleic acid testing in most areas of Urumqi has basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas - China News Service
China News Service, Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen and Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, reported on the latest epidemic situation and nucleic acid testing situation in Urumqi on the 26th that at present, most districts in Urumqi have basically completed free nucleic acid testing. Finish.
The State Council expert group and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi City are further evaluating the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.

According to him, from 0:00 to 24:00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of new coronavirus pneumonia in Urumqi (5 of which were asymptomatic infections converted to confirmed cases), and 38 new asymptomatic infections.
As of 24:00 on July 25, Urumqi currently has 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections.
The new asymptomatic infections on the 25th were basically all detected through the city’s free nucleic acid testing and active screening.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th that the free nucleic acid testing work in most districts of Urumqi has been basically completed.
He also said that judging from the experience of other regions in the country, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the testing reagent, the infection time and detoxification time of the person being tested, and the cooperation of the person being tested when collecting specimens (poor cooperation may cause the specimen to be not taken in place) as well as the testing environment, the operating proficiency of the inspection personnel, etc.
For various reasons, nucleic acid tests can also produce false negative results.
The so-called false negative means that the person being tested is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, for people who have had close contact with confirmed cases or suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to rule them out.
For people who have been to high-risk areas for the epidemic, if they develop fever and respiratory symptoms, a negative nucleic acid test may be a false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are needed to rule out the problem.
He said that in view of the above situation and for the health of people of all ethnic groups in the city, starting from today, Urumqi will conduct a second free nucleic acid test in key areas such as Tianshan District and Sayibak District, and at the same time carry out &quot;checking for omissions&quot;.
It is reported that Tianshan District and Sayibak District are high-risk areas for the epidemic.

U.S.-China trade negotiators rumored to meet in August
Hong Kong&#39;s South China Morning Post reported on the 25th, citing an anonymous source, that the head of China&#39;s trade negotiation team, Vice Premier Liu He, and the co-leader of the US team, Trade Representative Lai Haizhe, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the progress of both sides&#39; implementation. The status of the first phase of the U.S. trade deal.
The report said that although China has significantly increased its purchases of U.S. agricultural products in the past few months, due to factors such as the new coronavirus epidemic, China&#39;s purchases are still far from the amount promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say recent mutual consulate closures between the United States and China, along with other disputes, could undermine any progress on trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the China-U.S. trade agreement came into effect one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulated that the trade framework group composed of high-level officials from both sides should hold talks every six months.
People familiar with the matter revealed that the meeting will be &quot;an important turning point&quot; and allow both sides to evaluate the progress of the agreement.
However, this person also said that if tensions between the United States and China lead to low willingness for talks at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He will have met the terms of the trade agreement for biannual talks.
Since the beginning of this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. Disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of the new coronavirus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea, and ideology.
Although U.S. President Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at the White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record-breaking amount of U.S. corn in a single day and also bought a lot of soybeans, &quot;this trade agreement means less to me now than when it was originally reached.&quot;
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that due to the poor relations between the United States and China, a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place. &quot;Trade issues have lost their weight in Sino-US relations.&quot;
However, he revealed that relevant Chinese economic and trade units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States. &quot;We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult.&quot;
Peng Jiening, vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said that maintaining the momentum of the first-phase agreement is &quot;more important than ever&quot; and pointed out that China has made progress in further opening up its financial markets to U.S. companies this year.
Analysts at independent research firm Plenum said: &quot;Talk is better than no talk, even if it may only be regarded as routine.&quot;
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Wei Yukun) The reporter learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management on the 26th that the National Defense Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management, together with the National Grain and Material Reserves Bureau, once again urgently transported 1.35 million woven bags and 1.2 million square meters to Anhui. Six types of centrally reserved flood control materials, including 130,000 square meters of woven fabric and 130,000 square meters of geotextile, support Anhui&#39;s flood fighting and rescue work.

Hao Yusheng, Chief Representative of Nasdaq China: Now is the best time for Chinese companies to IPO in the United States - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website
Economic Observer Network reporter Zhang Bin. Due to the Luckin Coffee fraud incident, the U.S. market has implemented stricter supervision on Chinese concept stocks. Coupled with long-term pressure on valuations, Chinese concept stocks listed in the United States are feeling the pressure. NetEase, JD.com and other Chinese concept stocks are under pressure. Recently, many stocks have begun their journey back to Hong Kong for listing.
Recently, companies such as Shell and Li Auto have become more enthusiastic about listing in the United States.
Amid the epidemic and the crisis of Chinese concept stocks, is now the best time for Chinese companies to list in the United States?
&quot;As far as recent IPO cases and the situation of companies going to be listed in the United States are concerned, IPOs in the United States have not been affected at all. On the contrary, the market is very good now. Even now, this time is the worst time for Chinese companies to IPO in the United States in the past 10 years. Good timing.”
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of Nasdaq Stock Exchange China, said at the &quot;2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit Chinese Concept Stocks Branch&quot; hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued a &quot;Statement on Audit Quality and the Important Role of Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information - Regarding the Current Current Situation for U.S. Listed Companies with Substantial Business in China&quot; A discussion of the challenges of information acquisition.
The statement stated that although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, problems with U.S. regulatory authorities in obtaining information still exist, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; corresponding to the document, the PCAOB website A detailed list of listed companies and their audit institutions that have encountered audit obstacles is listed. A large number of Chinese concept stock companies are on the list.
In addition, in May this year, the U.S. Senate passed the Foreign Companies Accountability Act, which imposes additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies listed in the United States.
In Hao Yusheng’s view, the crisis in Chinese concept stocks has not affected investors’ appetite.
&quot;When this news first came out, everyone panicked. Everyone was asking whether we could go public in the United States in the future. But later we found that these problems were not a problem on the investors&#39; side. During the recent road show for the IPO in the United States, investors These questions may be asked and even become standardized questions, but they are not considered by investors as an important factor in whether to invest in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that everyone try to view the current situation with a normal mind.
Of course, this time may appear to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but in terms of investor appetite, it has not been affected in any way.
Therefore, from now until the end of this year or before the US election, the craze for IPOs in the United States will continue. &quot;
On May 9 this year, Kingsoft Cloud was officially listed on NASDAQ in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to IPO in the United States after the epidemic.
&quot;The listing of Kingsoft Cloud has given great confidence to Chinese companies preparing for IPOs later.&quot;
Hao Yusheng said.
The Chinese concept stock data report released by Snowball for the first half of 2020 shows that in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese companies went to the United States for IPO, an increase of 17.6% compared with the same period last year; judging from the total amount of initial financing, the 20 companies raised a total of 2.725 billion, It has rebounded compared with the same period last year, rising by more than 52.4%; in terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the healthcare industry in the first half of this year was outstanding, with an increase of 100% compared with the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the Chinese companies that went to the United States for IPO in the first half of this year are of higher quality. High-quality companies with strong fundamentals and growth potential will be more favored by investors.
From a short-term, medium-term and long-term perspective, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about Chinese companies&#39; IPOs in the United States.
&quot;In the short term, the craze for IPOs in the United States continues; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, such as A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, and U.S. stocks. People will consider the U.S. election and Sino-U.S. relations as factors in market selection and timing; in the long term, , everything will return to normal. Market fluctuations are all cycles, both political and economic. They will eventually return to the normal stage. The stock market has always moved forward with volatility.&quot;
Hao Yusheng also said, “There are many uncertain factors this year, but for high-quality companies, no matter whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary. Yes, investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies.&quot;

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25th (Xinhua) People&#39;s Daily commentator article on July 26th: Concentrate on running your own affairs well to create new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and world economic situation are still severe and complex, and my country&#39;s development faces unprecedented challenges.
Maintaining strategic focus, enhancing confidence in winning, and concentrating on running our own affairs well are the keys to us coping with various risks and challenges.
At a recent entrepreneur symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, sluggish world economy, and shrinking global markets, we must concentrate on running our own affairs well and give full play to the advantages of the domestic ultra-large market , gradually forming a new development pattern with the domestic cycle as the main body and the domestic and international dual cycles reinforcing each other, improving the modernization level of the industrial chain and supply chain, vigorously promoting scientific and technological innovation, accelerating the research on key core technologies, and creating new advantages for future development.
He who observes the situation is wise, and he who controls the situation wins.
In the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the market and resources &quot;outside&quot; have played an important role in my country&#39;s rapid development.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is encountering headwinds and backlash.
To make mental preparations and work preparations to respond to changes in the external environment for a longer period of time, and to promote our country&#39;s economy to ride the wind and waves and achieve steady and long-term development, an extremely important aspect is to take expanding and meeting domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, and pass Prospering the domestic economy and smoothing the domestic circulation will add impetus to my country&#39;s economic development and drive the recovery of the world economy.
We must deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to our country&#39;s long-term development and long-term stability.
The Party Central Committee assessed the situation and clearly proposed to resolutely implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand. This is the need to respond to the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term, sustained and healthy development of our economy, and to meet the people&#39;s growing needs for a better life.
The advantage of a large country&#39;s economy is that it is internally recyclable.
Our country has the world&#39;s most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, and complete supporting capabilities. It has more than 100 million market entities and more than 170 million talents with higher education or various professional skills, including more than 400 million The ultra-large domestic demand market formed by a population of 1.4 billion, including middle-income groups, is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, and has huge potential for investment demand.
With public ownership as the mainstay and various ownership economies developing together, distribution according to work as the mainstay and multiple distribution methods coexisting, the socialist market economic system and other basic socialist economic systems can not only stimulate the vitality of various market entities, liberate and develop social productivity, It can also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness and continuously achieve common prosperity.
We must firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make all links of production, distribution, and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous cycle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote total supply and total demand to a higher level. Achieve dynamic balance.
It is necessary to speed up the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote technological innovation and other innovations, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, and form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form A new development pattern with the domestic cycle as the main body and the domestic and international dual cycles reinforcing each other.
Openness brings progress, while isolation inevitably leads to backwardness.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has emphasized many times that China&#39;s door to opening up will not be closed, but will only open wider.
With the domestic circulation as the main body, it is by no means operating behind closed doors, but by leveraging the potential of domestic demand to better connect the domestic and international markets, make better use of both international and domestic markets and resources, and achieve a stronger and more powerful economy. sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up. The smoother the domestic circulation, the more conducive it is to building a new pattern of opening up and forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionist thoughts are on the rise internationally, we must stand on the right side of history, persist in deepening reform, expand opening up, strengthen open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the construction of an open world economy, and promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many hardships in history, but it has never been crushed. Instead, it has become more courageous with every setback, constantly growing and rising from the hardships.
On the way forward, we have the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization capabilities and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity of the entire Party, the entire military, and the people of all ethnic groups in the country. By working hard, we will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the good momentum of my country&#39;s economic and social development, build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, and successfully start a new journey of comprehensively building a modern socialist country!
Yu&#39;e Bao&#39;s income is declining. Are &quot;post-90s&quot; people saving money &quot;revengefully&quot;?
As the income of Yu&#39;e Bao declines, the &quot;post-90s generation&quot; not only did not escape Yu&#39;e Bao, but began to save money in a &quot;retaliatory&quot; manner?
The &quot;Yue Bao Post-90s Savings Report&quot; (2020 Edition) recently released by China New Economic Research Institute and Alipay shows that in the first half of the year, &quot;post-90s&quot; are more fond of saving money: the per capita amount of money saved increased by nearly 40% compared with 2019.
Interestingly, the post-90s generation is more likely to start saving with small sums of money, with 60% of them averaging less than 20 yuan per sum...
Saving money with Yu’ebao has also become a money-saving habit for the “post-90s generation”.
Data shows that among the 700 million Yu’E Bao users, 134 million are born in the 1990s.
There are 174 million &quot;post-90s&quot; in China, which means that about 3 out of every 4 &quot;post-90s&quot; in the country are using Yu&#39;E Bao to save money.
Currently, the 7-day annualized rate of return of monetary funds such as Yu&#39;e Bao has dropped to around 1.5% from a level above 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it has not affected the pace of saving money for the &quot;post-90s generation&quot;.
In the context of the increasing &quot;money-saving effect&quot; of Yu&#39;E Bao, many young people who are accustomed to using Yu&#39;E Bao have directly transformed into &quot;basic citizens&quot;.
Alipay data shows that as of July 13, the number of new “basic citizens” on Alipay has more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and more young people are achieving “advanced” financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the inflow of funds from Yu&#39;ebao into the stock market was also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of money funds in June.
The report also shows that girls born in the 1990s are more likely to save more money, with an average amount of money saved 20% higher than that of boys; among users who hold funds on the Alipay platform, 60% are men, and women tend to choose A more prudent way to manage your finances.
After saving money, what are the plans for those born in the 1990s?
Alipay data shows that the &quot;post-90s generation&quot; has the habit of saving money for goals, and the largest number of users regard travel as a goal of saving money.
Affected by the epidemic, many &quot;post-90s&quot; people are saving money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; the resumption of business of movie theaters also provides a new way to shift from saving money to consumption.

France increases investment in space military - Xinhuanet
French Defense Minister Florence Parly said on the 24th that France will increase its space defense budget by hundreds of millions of euros and develop space military capabilities to prevent other countries from &quot;unfriendly actions&quot; that may be carried out in outer space.
Parly told Le Provence that day that between 2019 and 2025, France’s space military project expenditure budget will increase from the previously proposed 3.6 billion euros (approximately 4.2 billion U.S. dollars) to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion U.S. dollars).
According to the &quot;French Military Planning Act 2019 to 2025&quot; approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update existing observation satellites and communication satellites in the future, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites, and improve the modernization level of space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that a space military command and an &quot;aviation and space force&quot; would be established within the French Air Force.
Parly said she would formally announce the establishment of the space force when she visits a military academy in Salon-en-Provence later in the day.
Parley said that this space force is affiliated with the Air Force and will have a strength of 500 personnel by 2025.
She said: &quot;The previous idea that space served the common interests of science is gone forever. Today, space is a place where countries compete for global hegemony.&quot;
Parly reiterated Macron&#39;s previous statement, saying that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
&quot;We are in no way engaged in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to be thoroughly aware of the threats we may face.&quot;
Parly reiterated the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said it was a Russian satellite that was &quot;peeping&quot;.
Russia denies this statement.
Parly said France would &quot;soon&quot; have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and targeting &quot;those behind unfriendly actions&quot;.
French media believe that France is seeking to establish a Space Force because U.S. President Donald Trump asked the U.S. Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish a Space Force in February last year.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act in December last year, approving the establishment of the Space Force, the sixth largest military branch of the United States.
Some experts worry that these US measures have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

China News Service, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd. on the 26th that the 18.9-kilometer-long Zhengdu-Wanzhou High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel was fully completed on the same day.
It is understood that the Little Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed rail tunnel within the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, but also the longest single-hole, double-track high-speed rail tunnel currently under construction in China with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour.
The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway is located in the three provinces and cities of Henan, Hubei and Chongqing. It connects the Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan high-speed railways in the north of Zhengzhou, and connects the Chongqing-Wanzhou high-speed railway in the south of Wanzhou to Chongqing. It is a channel along the river and part of my country&#39;s &quot;eight vertical and eight horizontal&quot; high-speed railway network. An important part of the Hunan Channel.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel of the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-speed Railway was fully completed on the 26th.
The picture shows the penetration site.
The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-speed Railway starts from Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, and Xiangyang City, Hubei Province to Wanzhou District, Chongqing City. The newly built line is approximately 818 kilometers long, with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and is approximately 184 kilometers within Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou to Xiangyang section was put into operation in advance on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up construction.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which was fully completed on the 26th, is a control project for the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-speed Railway. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing City. It has a total length of approximately 18.9 kilometers and a maximum burial depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel started in February 2017 and was fully completed on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Guojun, the person in charge of the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway tunnel design of China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the surveyor and designer, the terrain and geological conditions of the location of the Little Three Gorges Tunnel are very complex, and it faces risks such as karst, sudden mud and water, and large deformation of soft rock. Class I high-risk tunnels are extremely difficult to design and construct.
&quot;During the construction of the project, we used geological survey methods, geophysical prospecting methods and advance drilling methods to conduct advanced geological forecasts, and adopted special design plans for more than 30 caves of various types. For example, we designed and built a 24-meter-long bridge across the tunnel. Large karst caves with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters can prevent tunnel settlement,&quot; Wang Guojun said.
According to the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, the construction company, during the construction of the tunnel, a combination of dredging and blocking was adopted. By building horizontal tunnels and horizontal guides, grouting and water blocking, strengthening tunnel structural support and building sewage treatment stations, it ensured the orderly progress of the project. , it also avoided construction drainage damage to the water body of the Little Three Gorges Scenic Area, and at the same time successfully overcame construction problems such as 7-kilometer-long soft rock major deformation and other unfavorable geology, and multiple muddy water inflows with a maximum daily water inflow of 157,000 cubic meters. .
After the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger transportation channel from southwest my country to the Central Plains, North China, and Northeast China. It will play an important role in improving the capacity and quality of the northeastern railway channel in southwest China, improving the layout of the regional road network, and accelerating tourism along the route. It is of great significance to promote resource development and urbanization process, promote coordinated regional development, and promote the implementation of the Western Development Strategy.
Experts say collecting immigration data through U.S. Census for use in apportioning House seats is unconstitutional
Civil rights groups and several U.S. cities and counties have sued the U.S. federal government, saying the Trump administration&#39;s attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the apportionment of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sarah Brannon, executive attorney of the American Civil Liberties Union, told VOA, &quot;It just doesn&#39;t work.&quot;
She went on to say that Trump&#39;s requirement to determine the citizenship status of people under the census in the census is difficult to do and &quot;not very reliable.&quot;
Common Cause, another civil liberties group, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump&#39;s executive order.
Cities in New Jersey and Georgia have joined the lawsuit.
Virginia&#39;s Arlington County joined the lawsuit Friday.
Arlington County Governing Board Chairman Garvey said, &quot;The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count every person living in Arlington County and cannot let this illegal attempt scare us away. People and the squeeze on our immigrant communities has succeeded.&quot;
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump&#39;s executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a &quot;victory&quot; for the state.
He said, “When allocating seats in the House of Representatives and Electoral College seats to each state, it must be based on the number of residents living in each state and the number of residents who are legally residing.”
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including a citizenship question on the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to submit data on undocumented people from the census so the administration can exclude them from state censuses. Numbers are used to determine whether each state gains, loses, or maintains seats in the House of Representatives.
Every 10 years in the United States, seats in the House of Representatives are redistributed based on population changes.

Respond to the trend and promote the construction of industrial projects-Viewpoint Headlines-Hunan Daily Network-Huasheng Online
In Hunan in midsummer, the heat wave hits our faces.
The enthusiasm released by the on-site observation meeting for the promotion of industrial project construction in the province overshadowed the scorching summer heat in the dog days of summer. The clear orientation of &quot;compare strength with industry and judge heroes with projects&quot; inspired the three Hunan and four rivers.
Hunan&#39;s development has always relied on building projects and cultivating industries.
Faced with the extremely unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province adhered to a game of chess, went all out to fight the two tough battles of epidemic prevention and flood control, and regarded industrial projects as an important part of the implementation of &quot;six stability&quot; and &quot;six stability&quot;. The &quot;first move&quot; of &quot;Six Guarantees&quot;.
From a year-on-year GDP decline of 1.9% in the first quarter to a year-on-year growth of 1.3% in the first half of the year, it is self-evident that the period was difficult and the effort was huge.
In this precious report card, industrial project construction is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery and achieve stable and positive development.
The trend can be smoothed but irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects must be placed in the context of the overall situation. We must be good at accumulating momentum, gathering momentum, and planning for momentum, as well as recognizing, seeking, and adapting to changes.
Against the background of the current complex and severe international situation, in addition to working hard to attract investment, we also need to calm down and study the current new situation and new characteristics, better understand the rules, be more scientific and precise, and better integrate into the domestic cycle as the main body, domestic and international A new development pattern in which dual cycles promote each other.
Pay more attention to improving the basic capabilities of the industry.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries break ground and sow hope in our province, but also enterprises in traditional advantageous industries accelerated their deployment in digital, intelligent, and green industrial transformation.
The Yiyang Aoshicon Third Science Park project renovated the existing production line, and the high-end printed circuit board intelligent production line took the lead; the new factory area of Hunan China Tobacco Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to intelligent transformation and the process of building a modern factory, which is also a &quot; A vivid portrayal of &quot;old trees sprouting new shoots&quot;... Focusing on the major national strategies and &quot;two new and one important&quot;, we must focus on consolidating and upgrading advantageous industries, actively cultivate and develop emerging industries, and comprehensively increase scientific and technological innovation and localized substitution, in order to continuously consolidate basic conditions and Accumulate momentum for transformation.
Pay more attention to cultivating and developing new economies, new business forms and new models.
The sudden COVID-19 epidemic has brought about the popularity of the &quot;cloud economy&quot;, stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation: in the first half of the year, our province&#39;s computer and office equipment manufacturing industry, electronics and communication equipment manufacturing industry grew by 12.6% %, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above designated size increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal revenue of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to cultivate new opportunities in crises, open up new prospects in changes, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integrated development of the digital economy and the real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain and supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan&#39;s industry, but two-thirds of the supporting companies are outside the province, and there is still room and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen industrial chain thinking and grasp projects, it is not only necessary for leading companies to continue to accumulate and achieve technological breakthroughs in key links of the industrial chain; it also requires local efforts to cultivate, strengthen the chain, supplement the chain and extend the chain to stimulate the &quot;chain&quot; lock reaction and promote the coordination of related supporting industries. layout and accelerate the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain and supply chain.
Overcoming difficulties and supporting enterprises, Hunan remains a hot and happy land with a good business environment and emerging market opportunities.
All parts of the province frequently make moves, new moves, and practical moves, believing that the &quot;burden reduction&quot; of enterprise bailouts will lead to the &quot;acceleration&quot; of high-quality development; Shaoyang implements &quot;shareholder-style&quot; services, serving enterprises without shirk and policy implementation without discounts , The problem cannot be solved overnight... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, various &quot;leave no stone unturned&quot; to identify shortcomings and pain points, and achieve vivid stories of turning crises into opportunities.
Focusing on researching industries, cultivating industries, developing industries, and optimizing the business environment in a down-to-earth manner will surely win the favor of more investors.
There are still storms ahead, but the state of riding the wind and waves has become the norm for the whole province to focus on the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
At this critical period, we must learn and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s series of important instructions, effectively respond to external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, persist in promoting the construction of industrial projects, share enthusiasm and sweat, and ensure that &quot; The 13th Five-Year Plan and the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects have come to a successful conclusion.

Employment and prices are generally stable, showing that the economy is &quot;warm&quot;
Economic Daily·China Economic Net reporter Lin Huocan
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, our country has coordinated efforts to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The situation of epidemic prevention and control has continued to improve, the economy has been recovering steadily, and the performance of employment and prices, which are closely related to people&#39;s livelihood, has been generally stable. , the Chinese economy has handed over a warm economic performance report card.
The surveyed unemployment rate rose in the first two months of the year.
Especially in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically suspended. Enterprises&#39; labor demand decreased, recruitment was delayed or canceled, and the urban surveyed unemployment rate increased.
As the epidemic prevention and control situation gradually improves, the production and living order of the whole society continues to restore.
The Party Central Committee adheres to the general tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, further intensifies macro-policy hedging, comprehensively strengthens employment priority policies, and actively promotes the work of assisting enterprises to stabilize jobs and expand employment.
my country has stepped up policies to stabilize jobs, implemented a policy combination of &quot;reductions, exemptions, deferrals, repayments, and subsidies&quot;. It has phased in reductions and exemptions for three social insurance unit payments, allowed deferral of social insurance premiums, and expanded unemployment insurance reimbursements for small, medium and micro enterprises to stabilize jobs, and work-for-work services. In order to benefit from the training policy, enterprises will be provided with recruitment subsidies and trainee subsidies for recruiting key groups into employment.
With the implementation of various employment stabilization policies, corporate labor demand has steadily rebounded, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the urban surveyed unemployment rate has gradually declined. In June, the surveyed unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Population and Employment Statistics Department of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to bear fruit, and the labor force that had withdrawn due to the impact of the epidemic in the early stage gradually returned. The urban labor participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February, which is consistent with It was close to the same level last year.
Data show that total urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached pre-epidemic levels; the average weekly working hours of enterprise employees reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than February, and slightly higher than January by 0.1 hour.
Prices are also related to thousands of households.
In January this year, the CPI increased by 5.4% year-on-year, setting a new high in many years.
Entering February, although the year-on-year CPI increase has declined slightly, it is still in the &quot;5 range&quot;.
The year-on-year increase in CPI is at a high level, which is due to factors such as consumer demand before the Spring Festival, as well as factors such as the wrong month of the Spring Festival and a low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the new coronavirus epidemic on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by the epidemic prevention and control, logistics delays, untimely supply of materials, and increased transportation costs occurred across the country in January and February. In addition, some citizens hoarded and rushed to buy, and the prices of some daily necessities increased significantly.
In response to the disruption to the price situation caused by epidemic prevention and control, relevant departments have included important daily supplies into the scope of emergency transportation support to ensure smooth transportation of materials.
Under the influence of a series of policy measures, the market supply of vegetables and fruits has been effectively guaranteed.
In response to the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government introduced policies to ensure supply and stabilize prices, all regions and departments quickly implemented them. The supply of pork reserves has significantly improved, pig production capacity has been restored in an orderly manner, and production and marketing order has gradually become normal.
Since March, pork prices have continued to decline, driving the year-on-year increase in food prices back to 10.6% in May. In June, affected by factors such as the slowdown in pig slaughter, reduced imports, and a rebound in collective consumer demand, pork prices rose slightly month-on-month.
Fresh vegetable prices have obvious seasonal changes, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the high comparison base in the same period last year, fresh fruit prices continued to decline year-on-year, with an average decrease of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The people&#39;s basic life is effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation remains stable and orderly.
As transportation and logistics gradually recover, various regions have stepped up efforts to ensure supply, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Since March, the CPI has declined for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase has also dropped from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June. The overall price level has returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, my country&#39;s prices will continue to remain at a moderate level and the overall inflationary pressure will be small. However, it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order on the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in the main production areas of grain, fruits and vegetables, and other agricultural products, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on hoarding, price gouging and other behaviors that disrupt market order.

China News Service, Qinghai and Hainan, July 26th: Title: &quot;Sea of Flowers Live Broadcast Room&quot; by Qinghai Lake: &quot;Sweet&quot; sales help farmers increase income
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
“In midsummer, Qinghai Lake is full of golden flowers and thousands of bees flying around. The altitude here is high, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and there is less air pollution. The strong light breeds the most tenacious and generous bee colonies, creating Qinghai royal jelly with high activity, high protein, and richness. Contains nutritional value, low sugar and low fat features.”
Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industrial and Information Administration Bureau of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, said on the 26th.
On the same day, the bee products live broadcast event &quot;Fighting the Epidemic Together to Help Farmers&quot; was held on the banks of Qinghai Lake. The China Bee Products Association, entrepreneur representatives, beekeepers and other parties gathered to promote Qinghai&#39;s characteristic bee products, with a total online and offline sales of nearly Ten thousand bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly, with a total value of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows beekeepers displaying bee products on site.
It is reported that this live broadcast event uses the Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry chain store network, Kuaishou, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee product retail companies, live broadcasts, and e-commerce platforms to promote exchanges and cooperation between &quot;enterprises + beekeepers + growers&quot;, and &quot;Qinghai Plateau Spring Jelly Consumption Vouchers&quot; are continuously issued to consumers through online and offline channels, and the company is expected to make a total profit of nearly 5.28 million yuan throughout the year.
In this regard, Wu Na, president of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Co., Ltd., believes that it is &quot;very worthwhile&quot;: &quot;This move can expand the popularity of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like pure and natural bee products without additives, and drive the popularity of bee products.&quot; Increase agricultural income.”
At present, the company has signed a production cooperation strategic agreement with Qinghai Yun Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd., hoping to jointly promote the rapid development of Qinghai’s local bee industry.
The picture shows the sea of rapeseed flowers on the banks of Qinghai Lake.
This spring, due to the need to set up road barriers for epidemic prevention and control, beekeepers&#39; pursuit of flowers and nectar was blocked. Many bees died due to missing the flowering period and lack of food, and beekeepers&#39; income was seriously affected.
“Throughout the year, beekeepers travel long distances to follow the flowering season, moving all the way north from Yunnan and Sichuan to the northwest region. They live in the open and have no fixed residence, which is very hard.
As businesses, we have a responsibility to help them. &quot;
Wu Na said.
&quot;Little bees are &#39;environmental scouts&#39;, and bees cannot survive in heavily polluted areas.&quot; Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of the China Bee Products Association, said that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an important role in protecting plant diversity and improving ecology. The environment plays an irreplaceable role.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase crop yields and improve quality. Especially in areas with extensive planting and poor management conditions, pollination is of greater significance.
Research data shows that pollination can increase rapeseed production by about 15% - 30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of the China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai bee products.
&quot;The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has huge potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction, and ecological protection, but people have always known very little about it.&quot;
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Nowadays, there are fewer and fewer beekeepers. In addition to beekeepers who travel all year round, there are also many poor households with limited mobility who choose to use beehives to invest in cooperatives.
&quot;The state has financial support, and we contacted technical personnel for help and guidance. Beekeepers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment. To open up sales, we need help and coordination from the government, enterprises, and industry associations.&quot;
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
&quot;I hope everyone will pay more attention to and help beekeeping groups in the future,&quot; Wu Na said. &quot;Our bee products are also screened and controlled strictly in accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect the rights and interests of consumers while helping beekeepers.&quot;

U.S. White House adviser “fights back” against states resuming work too early - China News Service
U.S. White House adviser accuses states of resuming work too early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
For months, U.S. President Trump repeatedly asked states across the country to resume work and school. Only recently did he change his attitude and proactively wear masks in public. His advisers even &quot;bitten back&quot; and said that some state governments resumed work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some state governments did not comply with the resumption standards and reopened places such as bars prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that the previous statement that the president has &quot;absolute power&quot; to decide on the resumption of work in various states is a false rumor.
&quot;The president is a federalist and he believes in the autonomy of the states.&quot;
she defended Trump.
However, the &quot;rumors&quot; spoken by Conway were actually spoken by Trump himself at the White House epidemic briefing on April 13.
This self-slapping operation was ridiculed by netizens as &quot;rewriting history.&quot;
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history, she&#39;s a liar.
Trump called Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a shutdown.
Trump wants to push for reopening so he can hold rallies.
This isn&#39;t the first time Kellyanne Conway has caused controversy.
On April 15, Conway blurted out during an interview with Fox News: &quot;This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!&quot;
She seemed to understand &quot;19&quot; as a version number, and was ridiculed by netizens: If you don&#39;t have common sense, just read the newspaper!
A 3-year-old child was hit while playing on the college playground. Is it reasonable to sue the school after receiving compensation?

The playground was smashed, the children will sue the school after receiving compensation
□ Our correspondent Zhao Yifan
When 3-year-old Xiao Wen was playing on the playground of a university, he was accidentally hit in the head by Chen from the softball team while pitching.
After Chen paid compensation, Xiaowen&#39;s father, Mr. Wen, acted as Xiaowen&#39;s legal representative and sued the school to the court, demanding that the school where the playground where the incident occurred apologize, apologize, and pay a total of 20,000 yuan in medical expenses and solitary payments for mental damage.
Recently, the Beijing Haidian District People&#39;s Court heard the case and held that the school had set up a protective net on the playground at the time of the incident and had fulfilled its appropriate safety obligations, and that Chen had paid compensation. Based on this judgment, the plaintiff&#39;s case was dismissed. Claims.
Mr. Wen complained that during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Xiao Wen to play on the school playground, while the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the risks caused by this, Xiao Wen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents stayed in the safe area designated by the softball team.
But then Chen, a member of the softball team, let go while throwing the ball, causing the softball to fly over the protective net into the above-mentioned safe area and hit the back of Xiaowen&#39;s head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment, and he was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes that the school’s stadium facilities do not comply with relevant safety regulations, and the team and related facilities are not effectively managed.
The school&#39;s negligence led to the occurrence of the above incident, which caused Xiaowen to suffer great physical and mental pain and also brought great pain to his family. The school should bear legal responsibility for this.
In this regard, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net on the playground and posted management regulations and training notices, informing them that they must keep a safe distance from the training ground when entering the playground and reminding them to pay attention to their own safety. The plaintiff could not prove that the school &quot;failed to do so&quot; &quot;Safety protection obligation&quot;, so we do not agree to compensation.
After the trial, the court held that the venue where the incident occurred was a venue open to the public free of charge by the university involved. Although the school had safety guarantee obligations for the management of the playground, this safety guarantee obligation only required a general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net on the playground and fulfilled its appropriate safety obligations. Chen also compensated Xiaowen for more than 2,000 yuan in medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses in accordance with the previously reached compensation agreement. Both parties It was agreed that the dispute would be resolved once and for all.
Afterwards, Xiaowen&#39;s parents once again claimed compensation from the school, but there was no legal basis for it. The court ruled to reject all the plaintiff&#39;s claims.
After the verdict was announced, neither party appealed, and the verdict is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of my country&#39;s Tort Liability Law, as the manager of a public place, the school has the obligation to ensure safety; if the behavior of a third party causes damage to others, the third party shall bear tort liability and fails to ensure safety. Managers of public places with obligations shall bear corresponding supplementary responsibilities.
The judge said that as the manager of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the entire place, foresee possible dangers and damages, and is therefore most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or reduce the extent of the damage, and to avoid and mitigate the damage. The cost of damage is the lowest, so the law stipulates that they should bear the corresponding protection obligations when engaging in social activities.
In this case, for unspecified groups of people entering a playground that is open to the public free of charge, the school’s safety protection obligations should be commensurate with the social activities it engages in. Specifically, it should take basic safety measures and protect against hidden dangers. Have a duty to inform.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive safety and security obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has set up a protective net and fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be determined that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for third-party infringement, even if the managers of schools and other public places fail to fulfill their safety protection obligations, the liability they bear is a supplementary form of damage compensation. According to the newly promulgated Civil Code, after the managers bear supplementary liability, You can also seek compensation from a third party.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should not expand the scope of claims after having received compensation from the direct tortfeasor.
With the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people&#39;s enthusiasm for exercise and fitness has increased.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is about to recover.
Fujian Province resumed inter-provincial tourism business on July 21. On the first weekend after the opening, Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in a peak passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer season, while the airport&#39;s passenger flow is mainly students, tourists, and visiting relatives.
The tourism market is gradually recovering. In July, Xiamen Airport operated an average of 440 flights per day, and domestic flights have returned to 80% of pre-epidemic levels.
Airlines have increased the number of air express routes from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi&#39;an and other major cities to seize the recovering tourism market.
At present, many travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a batch of summer domestic inter-provincial travel products, and group itineraries mainly focus on outdoor attractions.
In response to the peak summer passenger traffic in railway stations and airports, relevant units have deployed additional manpower at check-in counters, security check passages and other areas where people tend to gather to provide guidance. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the &quot;Bamin Health Code&quot; to achieve the same goal as 31 Health data sharing and mutual recognition between provinces promote the orderly recovery of the tourism market.

Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated epidemics
In the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, Israel&#39;s prevention and control measures were effective.
However, as prevention and control measures are gradually lifted, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Israel has increased significantly recently, and the Israeli government has taken emergency measures many times to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Israel. It quickly took measures to close all entry and exit ports, suspend non-essential industries, switch schools to online teaching, restrict public transportation and non-essential social activities, and blockade cities with severe epidemics. Military and police jointly maintain prevention and control measures, etc.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results. By mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of new coronavirus pneumonia in Israel in a single day dropped to single digits.
With the epidemic under control and various prevention and control measures in Israel being fully lifted, the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 has gradually rebounded since June.
Especially since July, the spread of the epidemic has continued to accelerate.
In recent days, the daily number of new cases in Israel has exceeded 1,500 on eight days. As of press time on July 25, the number of new cases that day reached 916.
As of July 25, Israel had 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths.
Faced with the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has taken emergency measures many times to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment venues, and also introduced a policy to restrict public transportation, stipulating that each bus should not have more than 20 passengers. .
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictive measures, including the implementation of &quot;city closures&quot; on weekends, stipulating that the &quot;city closures&quot; will be implemented from 17:00 every Friday to 5:00 every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping malls, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic service places such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open. .
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited on all dates and periods, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes are prohibited from dine-in, and only takeaway services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and failed to form a joint force with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After the recurrence of the epidemic in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest because the government&#39;s prevention and control measures affected their economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, believing that anti-epidemic policies would affect the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands more protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu’s promulgation of prevention and control measures such as banning dine-in restaurants and cafes without providing corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people do not comply with regulations such as wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters during outdoor activities. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chins or hang them on their wrists.
During the recurring epidemic, schools were hardest hit by the spread of the new coronavirus. According to a recent visit to this kindergarten, reporters found that teachers and students in the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other. This caused a large number of teachers and students to Infection with viruses poses hidden dangers.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the Israeli National Security Council’s Expert Advisory Group on Combating the Epidemic, believes that Israel is heading towards a “dangerous situation” and points out that the current epidemic prevention and control measures taken by Israel are not enough and that all leisure and entertainment venues and summer holidays should be closed. schools to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to fight the epidemic. The parliament and various government departments should abandon their own interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on fighting the epidemic, and formulate clear steps including relevant restrictions in different departments.
Tel Aviv, July 25: Our reporter in Tel Aviv Wang Jiong
Wu Fengfang, a farmer from Guyuan, Ningxia, couldn&#39;t resist his wife Dai Tianfu. The two of them drove from their home 20 miles away to the Liangyun Cultural Compound in a car.
Despite the inconvenience of his legs and feet in the past two years, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu still hopes to &quot;come here every once in a while to enjoy his addiction to tricks.&quot;
This is an inconspicuous courtyard in Yuanzhou District, Guyuan City. Different from ordinary farmyards, the melodious Qin Opera is often heard in the courtyard, as well as wonderful shadow puppet shows, embroidery works, traditional Qin Opera, eyebrow and Hu operas, etc.
The owner of the courtyard is Liang Yun, who used to be a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he, who loves shadow puppets and singing opera, began planning to build a cultural compound.
With the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
Before the reporter entered the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the tunes of Qin Opera were already playing.
Bai Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village, was singing excerpts of Qin Opera for the villagers.
She has loved Qin Opera since she was a child and is now well-known in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform for the villagers.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also started live streaming.
Bai Lixiang said: &quot;It is a very happy thing to have a stage where more people can see me perform.&quot;
On the stage, the singers were precise and the players were precise. Although they were amateurs, their enthusiasm was not diminished at all.
Just like the rustic style of the farmyard, in addition to Qin Opera, the &quot;grassroots&quot; art and intangible cultural heritage in Liangyun Cultural Courtyard are all there.
The compound also collects more than 300 pieces of farming equipment from different eras, traditional and handmade tile sculptures, paper-cuts, embroidery, shadow puppets and other physical objects.
Liang Yun led reporters into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which displayed his collection of old objects, such as old wine pots, three-stringed instruments, spinning wheels, etc.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
&quot;Shadow puppetry is my family&#39;s craft. I started learning this craft when I was 15 years old.&quot;
Liangyun Cultural Compound was established in 2012 and has become the first rural &quot;intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall&quot; in Ningxia. It is also a demonstration compound for intangible cultural heritage protection in Guyuan City.
In addition to Liangyun Cultural Complex, more than 120 cultural courtyards and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural courtyards of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Complex, Wang Yonghong Cultural Complex Hospital, Yanglang Cultural Courtyard, etc., covering all towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and satisfying their spiritual needs.
&quot;As life gets better and better, traditional culture cannot just be left behind.&quot;
&quot;Liu&#39;s Spy Drama&quot; returns again in &quot;The Chance of Winning&quot; to watch Liu Yunlong and Li Liqun&#39;s rivals &quot;act&quot; - Xinhuanet
The 40-episode spy drama &quot;Odds&quot; will be launched on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16.
&quot;Odds&quot; is adapted from real historical facts and is based on Soviet military archives that have been dusty for many years and have been released for the first time.
Actor Liu Yunlong, who is well-known to the audience for his &quot;spy war dramas&quot;, breaks through his image in the drama and challenges a comical &quot;stuttering agent&quot;.
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as &quot;The Pretender&quot;, &quot;The Mask&quot; and &quot;Kite&quot; have proven that spy dramas have strong vitality.
Different from previous spy war works, &quot;The Chance&quot; takes a global view and extends the story background to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
It is set in the final stage of the Anti-Japanese War in 1944. It tells the story of Tang Fei (played by Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Chinese Communist Party, who, under the leadership of the Secretary of the Linhe Provincial Committee of the Chinese Underground Party and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau, carried out the tasks of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau. The story of the &quot;Mudanura&quot; strategic operation.
In many spy dramas, the male protagonist, as a senior spy, appears handsome, highly intelligent, and mature.
But in Liu Yunlong&#39;s view, such a person is not suitable to be a spy. &quot;A spy should be the kind of person who can&#39;t be found in the crowd. If he appears with a very handsome image as soon as he appears, everyone would like to have him,&quot; he said. Pay attention to you, can you still lurk? There is a line in &quot;Kite&quot;, &#39;If you don&#39;t come to arrest me, I will forget that I am a Kuomintang&#39;. Spies need to be elite.&quot;
Therefore, in &quot;The Chance of Winning&quot;, Liu Yunlong uniquely designed his protagonist Tang Fei to be a &quot;stuttering agent&quot; with a sense of humor.
The other camp in &quot;The Chance&quot; is supported by the Japanese Fukuhara, played by Liang Guanhua, and Fang Shibao, the director of the Police Department, played by Li Liqun.
The two powerful actors, one in the south and the other in the north, add many highlights to the whole drama where masters compete with each other.
Director Yin Fei used the word &quot;drama&quot; to describe the rivalry between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play, &quot;It is definitely a drama. The two of them have a special tacit understanding. This kind of tacit understanding between them is very impactful to me. Many times their The scenes were all &#39;live&#39;, for example, we only wrote half a page in length, and if I didn&#39;t stop during filming, the two of them could keep acting.&quot;
The masters do not compete with each other, and the director does not interfere with the drama. When the actors are in the role and ensure their own character status, they can not only shape the role from the perspective of the character, but also bring more viewing to the audience. Possibility, Yin Fei said that only such a play would be outstanding.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces from &quot;Ryu&#39;s Spy Drama&quot;. The famous and majestic &quot;Mountain City F4&quot; in &quot;Kite&quot; also gathers three of them in &quot;Odds&quot;.
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who have played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again play Tang Fei&#39;s right-hand man.
Director Yin Fei said, &quot;These two people have no bad qualities. They just drifted with the flow in that era and that environment.&quot;
Liu Yunlong also took the initiative, &quot;We need to be humane. This human touch means that there must be good and bad people around me, and bad people are enemies, but we must also develop them and our team must also grow.&quot;
The ending of the two people in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong. He believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed up to the patrol target point, took out the national flag on the mountain pass, and solemnly swore an oath.
Behind them are the snow-capped mountains, and in front of them is dozens of kilometers of no-man&#39;s land. They are the safest guardians of the country.

When the epidemic recurs, the first priority is to strictly prevent imported cases and deal with and interrupt the virus transmission chain as quickly as possible; when the epidemic is under control, economic activities should be resumed in a timely manner.
He pointed out that in the face of the new wave of epidemics, business transactions and economic activities that had shown signs of recovery have also been hit.
For the business community, in addition to the spirit of the contract, social responsibility is equally important, especially for those groups that have received large government subsidies under the &quot;Employment Guarantee Scheme&quot;.
He mentioned that Hong Kong&#39;s economic conditions were still very severe in the second quarter of this year, but the contraction seemed to have slowed slightly.
In terms of exports, he believes that Hong Kong&#39;s external situation is still severe.
Paul Chan said that Hong Kong&#39;s development over the past few decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities, and every difficulty hides the key to future development.

Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers for the anti-epidemic heroes, Bona Film Group Chairman Yu Dong and director Liu Weiqiang (pictured left) held a discussion with Academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the filming and production of the anti-epidemic film &quot;Chinese Doctors&quot; comminicate.
Bona Pictures hopes to use &quot;Chinese Doctors&quot; to pay tribute to all medical and epidemic prevention workers fighting on the front lines of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
Currently, under the arrangements of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Film Administration, and with the support of the Guangdong Provincial Film Bureau and the Hubei Provincial Film Bureau, Bona Pictures is organizing the original cast of the film &quot;Captain of China&quot; to prepare the film &quot;Chinese Doctor&quot;. This is a film that reflects the unity of the people of the country in fighting the COVID-19 epidemic under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee.
The film focuses on the front line of the fight against the epidemic in Wuhan. It will use Wuhan medical staff and medical teams from various provinces and cities as the background of the characters. From a human perspective, it uses a unique narrative and highly impactful lens language to give a panoramic view of the front line of the fight against the epidemic, which is full of dedication and courage. A touching story of the sacrifice of Chinese medical staff.
It is understood that as soon as the Wuhan lockdown was lifted, Bona Company overcame many difficulties and sent a photography team to the front lines of the epidemic to communicate face-to-face with hundreds of medical workers and collect information. So far, they have interviewed academicians including Academician Zhong Nanshan I, the first person from Guangzhou to help Wuhan, the medical team from Guangdong to aid Hubei, and the angels in white at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front such as Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Medical College Hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan Central Hospital, etc., took a lot of precious first photos. Hand video information.
Academician Zhong Nanshan also expressed his expectations and hopes for the filming of the movie during this symposium: &quot;I am looking forward to it. I hope you will not only interview some experts who are more visible, but also interview more medical staff who are working hard on the front line.&quot; , they are the majority.”
He said that he had watched &quot;My Motherland and Me&quot; and &quot;The Captain of China&quot; before, and thought it was a good way to tell big-picture stories from the perspective of ordinary people.
&quot;Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China.&quot;
When talking about the spread of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people abroad like to label the virus as a political label. He hopes that the film can impress the audience from a human perspective: &quot;In addition to being screened in China, it is best for this film to be When screening abroad, we must use a way that domestic and foreign audiences can understand, and impress the audience with the true humanistic spirit.”
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the film &quot;Middle Age&quot; in the 1980s, &quot;After all these years, the film that impressed me most after the reform and opening up was &quot;Middle Age&quot;. At that time, my foreign doctor friends I cried watching it, if &quot;Chinese Doctor&quot; can play such a role, that would be amazing.&quot;
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if &quot;Chinese Doctor&quot; can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control, &quot;I believe that people are always smarter than viruses.&quot;
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although viruses are difficult to predict, human beings have overcome many difficulties and dangers since primitive society.

Telecom network fraud crimes increased by 70% in the first half of the year, the highest prosecutor summarized the characteristics-China News
China News Service, July 26 (Xinhua) According to the website of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, in the first half of this year, procuratorial organs across the country prosecuted a total of 58,101 people for fraud crimes, a year-on-year increase of 35%.
In particular, among crimes that impede epidemic prevention and control, fraud crimes are frequent. The number of people prosecuted by procuratorial organs for fraud crimes accounted for 43.4% of all crimes that impeded epidemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. Among the ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control that have been released, a total of 9 cases involve fraud.
Judging from the handling of cases by the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many types of fraud crimes, ranging from national macro policies to people&#39;s basic necessities, including epidemic-related fraud, &quot;medical care&quot; fraud, &quot;health product&quot; fraud, &quot;admissions agency&quot; fraud, &quot;Routine loan&quot; fraud, state subsidy fraud, national assets unfreezing fraud, etc., are constantly &quot;innovating&quot;, covering education, medical care, employment, pension, social security, land acquisition and demolition, targeted poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, not only to provide The victims caused economic losses and seriously affected economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network frauds break through national boundaries, regions, and personnel restrictions, and have characteristics such as involving multiple parties, cross-border, remote, and electronic payments. They have many unspecified victim groups and cause great harm.
For example, some set up specialized companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or positions, use legal online platforms to promote and recruit, train and assess recruiters, adopt enterprise operation models for management, and disguise themselves as &quot;legal&quot; to confuse people. Stronger sex.
It is the unshirkable responsibility of the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to issue early warnings to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In handling judicial cases, the procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high-pressure posture against fraud crimes, but also detailing various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance by formulating and issuing procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures and application of laws in arrest and prosecution fraud cases, based on facts and the law as the criterion, so as to ensure that no wrongdoing is done in vain.
Especially for telecommunications network fraud crimes, we focus on the core role of electronic data in fact determination, and strive to build an evidence chain that corroborates each other between electronic data, verbal evidence, and documentary evidence.
For example, in the epidemic-related fraud case handled by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorate intervened immediately and took only 5 days from the occurrence of the case to the settlement, which reflects the fast and strict handling and maintenance of overall social stability. attitude and determination.
In the process of reviewing arrests and reviewing prosecutions, we focused on the investigation and prosecution of missed criminals, corrected the failure of public security organs to arrest 733 people, and corrected the failure of public security organs to review and prosecute 1,113 co-defendants.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs across the country issued 298 procuratorial recommendations on fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting in-depth governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes in telecommunications network supervision discovered by communication companies, banks, intermediary organizations, etc. during case handling, the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate and Dongguan Municipal Procuratorate of Guangdong Province promptly put forward procuratorial suggestions and urged relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and promote the development of telecommunications networks. Effective system construction.
The fourth is to make every effort to recover stolen goods and recover losses.
Procuratorates in various places have grasped the important links of intervention in investigation, guidance of evidence collection, review and prosecution, etc., urged the investigative agencies to actively recover the stolen money, cooperated with relevant departments to recover the stolen money, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate handled the routine loan case involving Lin Moumou, which involved 22 properties waiting to be seized. When the properties may be disposed of first by other cases, the company first issued a &quot;Letter of Suspension of Execution&quot; and delivered it to the relevant court in a timely manner. It is recommended that the court that previously seized the property involved in the case suspend the execution of the case and deal with it uniformly after the criminal facts are ascertained, so as to make the greatest efforts to recover the property involved and recover the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded everyone to be very vigilant against fraud crimes, not to expect &quot;pie in the sky&quot;, and not to be gullible because it is cheap, and to keep your &quot;money bag&quot;.
Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Shortened apple trees widen the road to poverty alleviation-China News
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Net Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the scorching heat, reporters from Economic Daily-China Economic Net walked into Zhonghai Village, Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Under the scorching sun, villager Li Yuanzhong was hoeing at the base. Although his face was red from the sun, he hummed a few songs from time to time.
Weining County, where Yina Town is located, has a certain reputation in the surrounding areas due to its low latitude, high altitude, sufficient sunlight, and large temperature difference between day and night. The apples it produces have high sugar content and good taste. However, they have always been popular in the surrounding areas because of their small size and many spots. It failed to sell at a good price and failed to form an industrial scale.
Yina Town was once a poverty-stricken town where &quot;you can spend the Spring and Autumn Period with corn and potatoes&quot;. Ten years ago, the local poverty incidence rate was as high as 25.8%.
As the fight against poverty enters a critical period of decisive victory, it is urgent to change traditional planting habits, adjust industrial structure, and increase farmers&#39; income.
After many visits, Chen Chao, Secretary of the Party Committee of Yina Town, and a group of people in the town believe that industrial development cannot continue to follow the old path.
To this end, Yina Town has introduced leading enterprises to grow apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Chaoyue Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Yina Town from Shaanxi for investigation in 2015. He took a fancy to the local planting conditions at a glance and started planting apple trees there in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees. Li Yuanzhong and his wife muttered in their hearts: &quot;After growing apples for so many years, no one in the village has made a fortune growing apples.&quot;
&quot;The apples planted are dwarf apples and will not make the apple trees grow too tall.&quot;
What Li Yuanzhong didn&#39;t expect was that a new method was used in apple planting this time. Irrigation pipes were laid under each apple tree, and water and fertilizer were poured to the roots of the trees. When harvesting the fruits in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and stood there. Can pick fruits.
At present, the apple base has gradually entered the peak production period, and the market is as Hou Jianwen expected. Apples are not worried about selling and are deeply loved by consumers in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong&#39;s life. Although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong&#39;s family has transferred more than 9 acres of land to the Apple base. In addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee every year, there are also profit dividends after the fruit is harvested. The couple usually works in the base. &quot;Each person can earn 80 yuan a day, and they have work all year round.&quot; &quot;.
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year he received more than 2,800 yuan in profit dividends. Including land transfer fees and the couple&#39;s work income, the family&#39;s income was more than 80,000 yuan. &quot;We don&#39;t have to worry about food and clothing, and we have lived a well-off life.&quot;
&quot;Initial results have been achieved so far. The annual output value of one mu of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn.&quot;
Chen Chao told reporters that Yina town currently has 20,000 acres of apples planted, 6,000 acres in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 households and 17,200 people, including 656 registered poor households and 2,952 people. The annual salary payment exceeds 6 million yuan, which truly realizes that the base is built at home, and you don’t have to go out to work.
Li Yuanzhong, whose pockets are getting bigger day by day, also begins to realize his &quot;wish&quot;.
During the Lunar New Year this year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle and now drives it to and from get off work today. “I still have more than ten acres of land at home. When the Apple base expands in the next step and all is transferred to them, the income will be even more.”

Membrane separation technology helps crack the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; - China News Service
Membrane separation technology helps crack the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;
Schematic diagram of new mixed matrix membrane preparation technology
Our reporter Shang Rui reported: Recently, the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team of Tianjin University has made significant progress in &quot;membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide&quot; and successfully developed a new mixed matrix membrane preparation technology, which greatly improved the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
Relevant results have been published as a cover article in the international journal &quot;Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology&quot;.
The &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; is a major environmental problem that plagues human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit.
How to efficiently capture and utilize the carbon dioxide emitted by humans is the focus of scientists.
&quot;Membrane separation method&quot; is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology. It separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials. It has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to make the membrane material &quot;breathe deeply&quot; and improve the gas separation efficiency is the bottleneck and difficulty in using the membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide.
The scientific research team of Tianjin University developed innovative ideas and explored the impact of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance through repeated experiments.
Experimental results show that using N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the carbon nanotubes in the generated membrane material are more uniformly distributed and &quot;more breathable&quot;, effectively improving the gas separation efficiency and speed of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of the mixed matrix membrane prepared with this new technology is close to the theoretical separation upper limit of current such membrane materials.
&quot;The new technology provides new ideas for membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide.&quot;
Li Run, a member of the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team of Tianjin University, said: &quot;We hope that this technology can provide strong support for the treatment of flue gas from coal-fired power plants and chemical companies in the future, and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions and other fields.&quot;
Before filling in the volunteer application form, you should first understand what the professional level difference is - China News Service
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning News Author: Yu Xiao Editor: Yu Xiao
Before volunteering to fill in the application form, first understand what the professional level difference is.
Every year when filling in the college entrance examination application form, there are students or parents who do not understand the terms involved in the application form, which in turn affects the application process.
This year, five universities, Beijing Jiaotong University, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing University of Chemical Technology, jointly released the 2020 admissions policy to eliminate professional differences.
What does professional level difference mean, and what is its significance in filling out volunteer applications?
There are three ways to assign majors
Experts remind you that before filling in your application, you must carefully read the &quot;Admissions Regulations&quot; of your favorite school and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including transfer ratios, major allocation rules, etc.
The major allocation rules refer to the three main methods for major admissions after colleges and universities adjust their grades: major priority, score priority, and major grade difference.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be specified in the &quot;Admissions Regulations&quot;.
However, there are also some colleges and universities whose admission principle is based on total score priority, and there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, candidates within the admission range will be queued according to their total scores. When the scores do not reach the admission score for the first major, it will be seen whether they have reached the admission score for the second major, and so on until the last major is admitted. There is no level difference between them.
The so-called &quot;major level difference&quot; means that when the school arranges the candidates&#39; majors, it determines the admission majors for candidates in different majors based on one or several scores published in the admissions regulations. This score is the &quot;major level difference.&quot;
That is, the difference in scores between colleges and universities when admitting candidates’ first major preference and non-first major preference, and the grade difference scores between each major preference, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
for example.
Assume that student Xiao Ming applies for college A and scores 560 points. His major preferences are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, and e-commerce. The major admissions of college A adopts the professional grade difference method. The grade difference is 2 points and 1 point. , 1 point, 0 points.
When making major assignments, if Xiao Ming’s first major choice meets the major admission requirements and the major has planned balance, then Xiao Ming will be admitted to the “Computer Science” major; if Computer Science is not admitted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points , ranked according to the score of 558 points with the candidates who applied for the first major &quot;International Trade&quot; to determine whether they meet the major admission conditions; if they still cannot meet the major admission requirements, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 557 points) for the third major &quot;Automation&quot; &quot;Admission; if it still cannot be satisfied, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 556 points) for admission to the fourth major. If the subsequent major still cannot satisfy the professional preference, no points will be reduced, and so on.
Different university majors have different settings
With the popularity of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have now abolished the professional level difference, but this year some colleges and universities still retain this method. Judging from the &quot;Enrollment Regulations&quot; announced by each school, this year there are mainly more than 20 universities that have set up A professional level difference.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Academy, etc.
Among these universities, each university has different professional levels.
Some colleges and universities have grade differences for each major, such as Ningxia University. Candidates whose files have been submitted to the school will be admitted according to the order in which the candidates fill out their major preferences by 1 point in descending order.
Some universities have set different professional levels between different majors.
For example, at Jimei University, the total score difference between majors is 4 points, that is, the difference between the first major and other majors is 3 points. There is no gap between other majors and is regarded as a parallel choice. The majors between other majors and transferred majors are The grade difference is 1 point.
When filling in the application form, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the school they are applying for to see if there is any professional grade difference and what the form of the grade difference is. While fully considering the scores, they must also reasonably analyze the school and major they intend to choose. , if the institution clearly adopts the grade difference method for admission in the admissions regulations, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between majors when choosing a major to increase the chance of admission.
