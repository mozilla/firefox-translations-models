According to British media, Admiral William Moran, US Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, said that even as the US Navy is reinvigorating its forces to deal with Russia's growing concern on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States continues to focus its Navy on the Asia-Pacific region -- the Pentagon's expansion of the region -- to include the Indian Ocean, Asia, and the Pacific.
According to a report on the website of Britain's "Jane's Defense Weekly" on 24 September, the United States listed China and Russia as strategic competitors in its new national defense strategy announced at the beginning of the year.
After that, the US Navy restored the Second Fleet in order to more directly counter the activities of Russia.
The moves have raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts who fear that the U.S. Navy may move away from the "Asia-Pacific rebalance" strategy that marks the Obama administration, the report said.
But Admiral Moran said the U.S. Navy's focus remains on the western Pacific.
Speaking at a roundtable discussion titled "Addressing the High Seas Challenge" hosted by the National Asian Research Agency in Washington, D.C., on January 24, 2018, he said: "For us, there are no major changes. ”
Moran said: "The focus is still on rebalancing, shifting the center of gravity or whatever you want to describe it. ”
He acknowledged, however, that the United States has close ties with Europe.
"We will continue to focus on growth on the West Coast and balance what we can," he said. ”
While Moran noted that the general policy regarding Russia falls within the purview of the US Secretary of Defense, he warned: " Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has shown that if we come into conflict with them, they will be very tough . ”
As part of the U.S. comeback against Russia, China and other competitors, the U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying forces into a "new mode of warfare" that will help catch adversaries off guard against where U.S. carrier battle groups or other assets will be deployed at any given time and place, Admiral Moran said.
He said: "We in the Navy and the Marine Corps support it -- the concept of unpredictability of operations, not to be in the same place again and again, almost like clockwork -- that's how we do it." ”
The first to try this new approach was the USS Harry S. Truman, whose early deployment included working visits to ports and patrols in areas that would normally only pass through, the report said.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is working to make sure allies know that the ships will still patrol traditional areas and is also addressing logistics and family liaison issues for new deployment procedures.
Vice Admiral Michael Noonan, commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also spoke at the event, saying that the Australian military could work seamlessly with the U.S. aircraft carrier battle group.
He said that situation will continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase nine more frigates equipped with the Aegis combat system.

Lucky Air, Okay Air and other companies announced that from 0:00 on October 5, 2018 (the date of ticket issuance), the fuel surcharge standard for domestic routes below 800 kilometers (inclusive) will be increased from 10 yuan per person to 20 yuan per person, and the fuel surcharge standard for domestic routes above 800 kilometers will be increased from 10 yuan per person to 30 yuan per person.
Children and military police disabled persons are both 10 yuan per person, and infants continue to be exempted.
According to the relevant person in charge of Ctrip's air ticket, the airline has indicated in the notice that the fuel surcharge will be charged based on the original ticket issuance date, and the fuel surcharge will not be refunded or compensated when the ticket is reissued.
This means that domestic tickets issued before October 5 do not need to pay the fuel surcharge according to the new standard if they are changed to October 5 (inclusive) or later.
Since June 5, 2018, many airlines such as Air China, China Eastern Airlines, Hainan Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, Spring Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, West Airlines, Okay Air and many other airlines have resumed charging fuel surcharges for domestic routes that have been cancelled for three years, at a standard of 10 yuan per person.
This time, Lucky Air and Okay Air took the lead in announcing an increase in fuel surcharges, and as of press time, there has been no news of the four major domestic airlines announcing follow-up adjustments.
It is also understood that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department stipulates that airlines can decide whether to charge fuel surcharges at their discretion from November.
Cathay Pacific first announced on September 27 that it would reintroduce fuel surcharges from November 2.
According to the Cathay Pacific website, all tickets issued or reissued by Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon on or after 2 November will include a fuel surcharge of $652 for long-haul flights between Hong Kong and the South West Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India and Africa, and $146 for short-haul flights.

Japan's Itochu Corporation on Friday recognized a $1.3 billion impairment loss on its investment in China's CITIC shares, writing down its largest corporate investment deal as it was affected by trade tensions between China and the United States.
A man walks past the headquarters of Marubeni Corporation in Tokyo, Japan, May 2016.
Marubeni, for its part, said the trade war had hit its U.S. grain unit, Gao Hong, who had suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers and telecommunications companies have warned about the impact of Sino-US trade frictions when they announced their latest results, and now these Japanese trading companies have also joined the ranks.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods, and US President Donald Trump has threatened to expand the tariffs to cover all more than $500 billion of Chinese goods exported to the United States if the dispute cannot be resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, ITOCHU Corporation's chief financial officer, said the impact of the trade dispute on China's economy next year could be even greater.
ITOCHU Corporation and Thailand's C.P. Group invested US$10 billion in CITIC in 2015 for a 20% stake.
Hachimura said ITOCHU posted a 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) loss on the stake because it did not believe that CITIC's share price would recover in the near future.
ITOCHU Corporation maintained its profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 at JPY 500 billion.
China imposed a 25% import tariff on U.S. soybeans in July to counter Washington's efforts in the trade friction.
"Our grain business has been hit by the U.S.-China trade friction," said Marubeni Finance Chief Officer, Nobuhiro Yabe.
He said that Gao Hong had stopped financial transactions in his account since September.
In a statement on Friday, Mr. Pat Burke, a spokesman for Mr. Gao, said the company's move was "in accordance with internal policy restrictions and due to a lack of market opportunity." ”
He also said that the suspension of financial transactions will not lead to a loss of jobs.
Marubeni maintained its annual profit forecast of 230 billion yen, supported by its pulp and paper and power generation businesses.
Sumitomo Corporation on Thursday reported a 16 percent increase in profits between April and September, stressing that "U.S. trade issues with China have led to uncertain prospects." ”
Mitsubishi Corporation on Friday raised its annual profit forecast to a record level, attributed to higher coking coal production and higher commodity prices such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Corporation also announced a new business plan to increase its profit for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 to 900 billion yen (US$7.98 billion) from an estimated 640 billion yen this year.
Chinanews.com, November 5 Comprehensive report, the vote in the US midterm elections has entered the countdown.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic opponents aggressively "pumped votes" from their core voters.
Both parties point to voter turnout as the key to determining the outcome of the election.
According to reports, 48 hours before the vote in the United States, Trump was busy attending the Republican candidate's campaign, and former President Obama went to Indiana to stand for the Democratic Senate candidate Joe Donnelly (Joe Donnelly), who was in a hurry to win the election, and shouted to the crowd the last demand before the election.
On Nov. 4, Trump went to Mayhill, Georgia, to stand for Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, saying, "You have to go to the polls on Tuesday, you have to vote. ”
"The contrast in this election could not be clearer. ”
Voters' political enthusiasm has reached an unusually high level, with early voting in some states far greater than usual.
Successive U.S. presidents face their first midterm elections, and their party's number of congressional seats tends to decrease.
According to a new poll released by the Washington Post and ABC News on the 4th, although the Democratic Party still maintains an advantage in the U.S. House of Representatives, Republicans can benefit from economic assessments and Trump's strict focus on border security.
Polls show that registered voters prefer Democratic House candidates more than Republicans, 50 percent to 43 percent, but this is still down from August's 14-point lead.
Another poll conducted by NBC and the Wall Street Journal also showed that Democrats still lead Republicans by 7 percentage points.
It is reported that Obama told the crowd on the occasion of Senator Donnolly's campaign: "When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer mean anything, there are bound to be bad consequences."
Democracy cannot work when people can only tell lies to themselves. ”
"The only way to stop these Republicans right now is you and your votes. ”
Democrats face the toughest election in decades in the Senate, with Republicans now holding a majority of 51 seats.
But the House of Representatives is more favorable, with Democrats needing to win another 23 seats to take control of the 435-seat House.
Analysts at the election forecasting website FiveThirtyEight.com estimate that the Democrats have an 85 percent chance of winning the House of Representatives.
The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a seminar on General Secretary Xi Jinping's important ideas and theories on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC.
The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a seminar on General Secretary Xi Jinping's important ideas and theories on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC in Beijing from 29 to 30.
Wang Yang, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attended the meeting and delivered a speech.
He stressed that General Secretary Xi Jinping's important thoughts on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC have profoundly expounded the status, role, goals, tasks, responsibilities and missions of the CPPCC, and practical requirements, and scientifically answered a series of directional, overall and strategic major questions, which are a powerful ideological weapon to guide the work of the CPPCC in the new era.
It is necessary to conscientiously study and implement this important thinking, grasp its great significance, rich connotation, and spiritual essence, earnestly make efforts to study, understand, and do a solid job, promote the improvement of the quality of the work of the CPPCC with theoretical study and ideological arming, and earnestly undertake the new mission of the CPPCC in the new era.
From September 29 to 30, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a seminar on General Secretary Xi Jinping's important ideas and theories on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC in Beijing.
Wang Yang pointed out that since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping has put forward a series of new ideas, new views and new assertions on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC, and for the first time proposed that the CPPCC is an important channel and special consultative body for socialist consultative democracy, an important part of the national governance system, and an institutional arrangement with Chinese characteristics. The fact that the affairs of the people are discussed by the people reveals the logical connection between the "rule of China" and China's political system, and condenses the profound theoretical thinking of upholding and developing the CPPCC system, which is the latest achievement of the party's theory of the CPPCC.
Wang Yang stressed: CPPCC at all levels should take theoretical study and discussion as an opportunity to further find out the weak links and deficiencies in CPPCC work, and make efforts to strengthen and improve them and seek breakthroughs.
It is necessary to comprehensively strengthen party building in the CPPCC system and ensure that the decisions and arrangements of the party Central Committee are implemented to the letter in the work of the CPPCC.
It is necessary to strengthen ideological and political guidance, improve the system, procedures and mechanisms for "two-way force" of advice and information and consensus building, and implement ideological and political guidance in all aspects and the whole process of performing duties.
It is necessary to focus on the central task to fulfill its duties, better obey and serve the overall situation of the party and the country, improve the quality of advice and information, and enhance the effectiveness of performing duties.
It is necessary to strengthen the building of the CPPCC itself, do a good job in the education and training of CPPCC members and cadres, give play to the basic role of the special committee, and consolidate the foundation for the CPPCC to perform its duties.
It is necessary to strengthen the guidance of the local CPPCC work, set the direction, set an example, solve difficult problems, and improve the overall level of the CPPCC work.
In order to thoroughly study and implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) has carried out the study and discussion activities of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important ideas on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC since May, held 8 regional forums and 7 expert and scholar symposiums, identified 18 key topics and 6 basic theoretical topics, and a total of 793,800 CPPCC members at all levels and 279,000 cadres of government agencies participated in the study and discussion, and more than 36,000 research papers were formed.
People's Daily Online, Beijing, November 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) Under the current wave of "mass entrepreneurship and innovation", more and more technology companies have begun to attach importance to patent research and development and related protection, dig deep into the potential value of patents, and occupy a leading position in the market.
Similarly, many technology companies have encountered a lot of infringement in the licensing of patented technology and the use of patented technology.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong, and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province filed a lawsuit against Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiaoju Technology), the developer of the "Didi Chuxing" app, the operator Didi Chuxing Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Chuxing), and the seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court on the grounds of patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order the three defendants to immediately cease manufacturing, selling, offering to sell, and using the plaintiff's patent.
On October 30, 2018, the China Judgments and Judgments Network published the "Civil Ruling of the First Instance of the Invention Patent Infringement Dispute between Tan Wei, He Zhanghong et al. and Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. and Others", disclosing some details of the patent infringement case sued by Didi Chuxing APP.
The three plaintiffs argued that the patentee and inventor of the patent "ride-sharing service system and method based on mobile terminals", and that the entire operation process of the "ride-hailing" application in the "Didi Chuxing" app corresponded to the technical solution protected by the patent in question, which constituted patent infringement.
However, during the court's ruling, Xiaoju Technology held that Guangdong Pacific was not a qualified defendant, and that it only provided a free download of the APP "Didi Chuxing" on the Internet, and did not implement the patented method in question, and there was no direct or indirect infringement, so it should not be listed as a defendant in this case.
Second, the place of infringement in this case was not in Guangdong.
In accordance with the law, the place of infringement of the patent in question should be the place where the patent in question is fully implemented, so it raised an objection to the jurisdiction of the court and requested that the case be transferred to the court where the defendant is domiciled, that is, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the allegedly infringing Didi Chuxing APP products on its online platform, and it was not improper for the plaintiff to name the defendant Guangdong Pacific as the defendant.
In addition, the domicile of the defendant Guangdong Pacific is in Guangzhou City, which is within the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant Xiaoju Technology proposed to transfer the case to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial, and rejected the objection raised by the defendant Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. to the jurisdiction of the case, and assumed the costs of accepting the jurisdiction objection case.
At present, the other trial status of the case has not been announced, and the reporter will pay close attention to the follow-up details of the Didi Chuxing patent infringement case.
Interview with the CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation of Australia: Australia-China science and technology cooperation has achieved remarkable results
"China's science and technology have developed rapidly over the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve great results when they work together in the field of science. ”
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Australia, said in an exclusive interview with a reporter from China News Service in Beijing a few days ago that from the response to climate change to the cooperation of the "Sky Eye" project, Australia-China cooperation in the field of science and technology has shown great vitality.
As the largest national scientific research institution in the Australian Commonwealth, CSIRO has made many innovative research achievements in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials, astronomy and other fields.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"It's a long-lasting friendship that encompasses trust in partners and a tradition of long-term cooperation. Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-meter aperture spherical radio telescope -- "China Sky Eye" -- installed the world's first 19-beam L-band receiver.
This is currently the most advanced 19-beam feed receiver in the world, which was jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on CSIRO's years of technology accumulation, and after it is put into use, the speed of the FAST survey will be increased by 5 to 6 times, and at the same time, more scientific observation targets will be expanded.
"This is what CSIRO is doing for FAST. ”
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO also cooperates closely with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of the square kilometer array radio telescope, research and development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.
"In the past, scientific research often focused on problems hundreds of years from now, but now more scientific research is needed to solve the problems in front of us. ”
Marshall believes that Australia and China complement each other in the field of scientific development, and both countries face a series of challenges in development.
For example, extreme weather is frequent around the world, and droughts and floods have led to reduced food production, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, problems such as population explosion, aging, and chronic diseases are also serious challenges.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has been focused on solving these current challenges. ”
Marshall said that the International Southern Hemisphere Marine Research Center, jointly established by CSIRO and Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, focuses on observing El Niño and La Niña, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather.
"In the current environment, scientific and technological innovation is difficult to complete alone, requires extremely high costs, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today. ”
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it is to achieve breakthroughs, which is also the significance of strengthening cooperation between Australia and China under the framework of the "Belt and Road".
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly scientific and technological cooperation for us. ”
For example, Marshall said that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide, because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, and many countries hope to find a gold purification method that is less polluting to the environment.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology to China, which is one of the results of our participation in the Belt and Road Initiative. ”

For Northeast China, innovation is to grasp development, and innovation is to seek the future.
Whether or not the vitality of the old industrial base can be re-energized and released affects the heart of the general secretary.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued imposition of sanctions deepens North Korea's distrust of the United States and that North Korea cannot unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Mr. Ri told the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea had taken "very friendly approaches" over the past year, including halting missile and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we haven't seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"If we don't trust the United States, we won't have confidence in our national security, and in such a situation, we can't unilaterally give up our weapons first. ”
While Ri was repeating North Korea's complaints about the United States' opposition to "phased" denuclearization, his speech was significant because it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea had done before.
Mr. Lee referred to a June 12 joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Mr. Trump, in which Kim agreed to work toward the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Mr. Trump pledged to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says it must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also rejected demands to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on 'denuclearization first,' and increases the pressure of sanctions, uses high-pressure methods to achieve its goals, and even refuses to issue a 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Mr. Lee said.
"The idea that sanctions will make us beg for mercy on our knees is a daydream for people who don't know us.
But the problem is that this ongoing sanction is deepening our mistrust. ”
Mr. Lee did not mention the plan for a second Trump-Kim meeting that the U.S. president mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months, saying: "If the other side of denuclearization were South Korea and not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have become so deadlocked." ”
China announced that it will reduce import tariffs on 1,585 tariff items from November 1, 2018.
Since the beginning of this year, China has taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs one after another.
On May 1 this year, the import tariff on drugs was reduced across the board, and the import tariffs on all ordinary drugs, including anti-cancer drugs, alkaloid drugs with anti-cancer effects, and Chinese patent medicines with actual imports, were adjusted to zero.
At the same time, it has also greatly reduced the value-added tax burden on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs.
On July 1, the tax on automobiles and parts of 218 tax items was reduced.
After the tax cut, China's automobile tax rate has been lower than the average level of developing countries, which is in line with the actual situation of China's automobile industry.
This tax cut will promote the structural adjustment of the industry and the optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the survival of the fittest, help improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to promote the adjustment of automobile prices to a certain extent, so that consumers can get more benefits.
On July 1, the tax on daily consumer goods under 1,449 tax items was reduced.
The tax reduction of daily consumer goods is closely related to the people's needs for a better life.
The tax reduction is not only large in number but also in force, with an average rate of 56%.
The tax reduction on consumer goods will directly benefit consumers and promote the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On November 1, 1,585 tax items such as mechanical and electrical equipment, parts and raw materials and other industrial products will be reduced.
Appropriately reducing the import tariffs on some industrial products that are urgently needed in China can attract more foreign investment, which is conducive to increasing effective domestic supply and helping industrial upgrading, and at the same time helps enterprises allocate resources on a global scale, reduce production costs, and also help reduce the pressure on the domestic environment.
According to a person in charge of the Office of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council, the above four voluntary tariff cuts, as well as the third step of tariff reduction implemented on July 1 this year in accordance with the results of the negotiations on the expansion of the scope of the information technology agreement, will reduce China's overall tariff level from 9.8 percent last year to 7.5 percent.
The adjusted overall tariff level is slightly higher than that of the European Union, lower than that of most developing countries, and at a moderately low level, which basically matches the status and development stage of China's developing countries.
According to the person in charge, as one of the important indicators of the degree of openness in China's trade in goods, the overall tariff level should be adapted to the stage of China's economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China has the largest scale of trade in goods in the world, and already has an economic foundation for further opening up, but there is still a gap between the quality and efficiency of trade development and that of developed economies, so the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately reduced.
Tariffs are a means of protection for compliance, and the level of tariffs should be commensurate with industrial competitiveness, and healthy competition should be encouraged, and excessive protection is not conducive to industrial development and quality improvement.
The adjustment of tariff rates should take into account the needs of production and consumption.
Priority will be given to reducing the tax rate on commodities with greater domestic demand and conducive to industrial transformation and upgrading, and efforts will be made to increase the import of characteristic and advantageous products where the people's demand is relatively concentrated, so as to continuously enhance the sense of gain of enterprises and the public, and meet the needs of upgrading the industrial structure and consumption structure.
The intensity of tax reduction should take into account the affordability of fiscal revenue and industrial development.
In the selection of specific commodities and the scope of tariff reduction, it is necessary to make overall plans and coordinate the relationship between the two markets at home and abroad, the upstream and downstream aspects, and the relationship between production and consumption, so as to maintain the momentum of China's steady and positive economic development.
The person in charge stressed that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, and China's initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure made in accordance with China's own needs to achieve high-quality development, which is conducive to the overall use of international and foreign resources, promoting the improvement of the quality of the domestic supply system, and meeting the needs of the people's consumption upgrading.
This action and measure shows that China will unswervingly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening-up, firmly support economic globalization, resolutely uphold the principle of free trade and the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, and continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the world, so that China's development can better benefit the world.
Serbia Announces Highest Combat Readiness Serbian and Russian presidents will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
The Nantong news agency quoted the Serbian presidential office as saying that in view of the fact that the Kosovo special forces occupied the passage of the Gazivoda hydroelectric power station reservoir lake in northern Kosovo controlled by the Belgrade side, Serbian President Vučić ordered the country's armed forces to enter the highest combat readiness.
On September 29, Serbian Defense Minister Vulin declared that the Serbian army had entered a state of full combat readiness.
Vulin stressed that as long as the order issued by Vučić is still in force, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo, and the Serbian army will respond no matter which direction the situation develops.
According to Russia's TASS news agency, on September 29, Vučić said in an interview that he had informed the United States, Russia, Europe and other parties of the current situation, and would go to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Putin and seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When asked if Serbia needs Russian military support like Syria, Vučić replied in the negative: "I don't want a major military conflict on our territory. ”
Vučić also said that the Serbian army has entered a state of full combat readiness only to form a deterrent to prevent the conflict from happening, but it is also a clear warning: there will be absolutely no tolerance for any violence in Kosovo.
The reason why the Serbian army has increased its combat readiness is related to two major moves by the Kosovo side.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, Albanians have been arresting ethnic Serbs who have lived there for generations in the northern part of Kosovo, and these arrested Serbs have not violated any laws.
Vučić said that since March 26 this year, when the head of the Serbian government's office for Kosovo and Metohija, Marko Juric, was beaten and detained by Kosovo Albanian troops, ethnic Albanians have escalated the situation in the region, carrying out inhumane arrests and expulsions of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the ROSU special forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, armed police and snipers, who had been proclaimed themselves, occupied positions near the Gazivoda hydroelectric reservoir lake, entered the ecological and sports centre near the embankment in the northern part of the Kosovo region, and blocked all roads in the vicinity, which were originally controlled by the Serbian side.
Vučić pointed out that this military adventure in Kosovo was made at the instigation of Western countries, and that the Kosovo army's move was made without prior notice to the Serbian side, violating the first paragraph of Chapter IX of the "Brussels Agreement" and also violating UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military-technical agreement between Serbia.
Vučić has already shouted to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, criticizing the hypocritical rhetoric of Western countries on the Kosovo issue.
The root cause of the current conflict remains centuries-old historical feuds between the Serbs and Albans in Kosovo.
Serbs and Albanians have their own accounts of Kosovo's affiliation.
Serbia regards Kosovo as the birthplace and cradle of culture, as Serbia established its strongest state here in the 12th century, while ethnic Albanians only moved in large numbers after the Ottoman invasion and the defeat of the Serbian army to the north.
The Albanians, for their part, insist that the Illyrians, the primitive tribe that inhabited Kosovo in the 4th and 5th centuries BC, are the ancestors of the Albanians and that Kosovo has therefore been Albanian territory since ancient times.
Subjective political divisions have led to fierce clashes between different ethnicities, religions and cultures, as well as fierce antagonism between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo.
In 1912, the Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of ethnic Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, and the proportion of Serbs increased relatively.
Kosovo became a "powder keg" in the Balkans.
In 1999, armed clashes between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by NATO forces against Serbia and Montenegro, and the Kosovo War broke out.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.
Since then, although there has been news that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, due to historical and national grievances and geopolitical constraints, the agreement constrained by the United States, Europe, Russia and other forces has not been signed.
Just a month ago, Vučić made it clear for the first time that he advocated the separation of Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo, once again making the contradictions between the two communities public.
Power and communication are still interrupted, and the strong earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia are difficult
According to the figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early morning of the 30th, the strong earthquake and the resulting tsunami that occurred in Donggara County, Central Sulawesi Province, the country on the 28th, have killed 420 people.
Wilem Rampangilei, head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, said that the figure was only a preliminary figure for Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi province, about 80 kilometers from the epicenter, because of the lack of large search and rescue machinery, many hotels, shopping malls, warehouses and other densely populated buildings damaged by the earthquake have not yet been searched and rescued.
On September 29, 2018 local time, a bridge damaged by an earthquake and tsunami collapsed and broke into several knots in Balu, Indonesia.
Due to severe damage to power and communication facilities, Donggara County, the epicenter, and the neighboring Xiji region are still "isolated islands" that cannot be contacted, and it is impossible to count the number of victims.
According to media reports here, Indonesian Vice President Kala said that the death toll may be in the thousands.
Power outages, communication outages, road blockages, airport damage... Rescue efforts in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami were difficult.
As a result of power outages, some hospitals and relief settlements in Palu rely on oil to generate electricity.
Roads in and out of the city were blocked by landslides, making it impossible for large transport vehicles, including fuel tankers, to enter, making fuel supplies very tight.
Indonesia's Social Affairs Minister Agus said that due to road damage, emergency relief materials such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food, and household kits from South Sulawesi and Gorontalo provinces, which are close to the earthquake zone, have not yet arrived in the disaster area.
Relief supplies from the capital, Jakarta, are being transported to the affected areas by Air Force transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to the control tower and runway at Palu Airport in the earthquake, all commercial flights have been grounded to ensure safety and security, and only military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel can take off and land.
Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, Wiranto, who commanded the rescue efforts in the earthquake zone, called for the restoration of power supply and commercial flight services at the airport as soon as possible to ensure the operation of hospitals and other relief agencies, so that more rescue workers, volunteers and aid supplies can reach the disaster area.
On the 28th, a number of strong earthquakes occurred in Dongara County, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, among which a strong earthquake of magnitude 7.7 at 17:02 local time triggered a tsunami, causing major disasters in Palu City, Dongara County, and Siji District.
China News Service, Beijing, October 1 (Reporter Yin Li) The blue sky is like a wash, the sky is clear, and the sky is full of colorful clouds. Recently, Beijing has continued to open the most beautiful blue sky mode, attracting thousands of people in Beijing to show pictures on social platforms, and continue to swipe the screen to show their happiness, saying that "under the blue sky and white clouds, 'drunk' the beautiful skyline, this is the best business card of Beijing".
Since August, Beijing has ushered in the "bluest sky".
In the capital, people can be seen taking pictures anytime and anywhere, holding smartphones or holding SLR cameras.
On social platforms such as Weibo and WeChat Moments, you can see the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, Bird's Nest, Hutong in the lens of netizens everywhere... All kinds of buildings show different beauty against the blue sky.
Some netizens said that such a "scenery blockbuster" is the best city propaganda film in Beijing; some netizens joked that if such a blue sky swipes the screen for a long time, people with cervical spondylosis can be cured; and some netizens hope that "this blue can survive the winter and welcome spring and summer, so that the sky in the capital is blue all year round".
Why do the people of Beijing love to bask in the blue sky?
Just because the people who lived in the city in the past suffered from smog, so they were particularly eager for the blue sky, and after the "blue sky defense war" was launched in Beijing, the air quality continued to improve, the smog became less, the blue sky increased, and the people were happy in their eyes, and the happiness obtained was also extraordinarily weighty.
On the day of the National Day, the weather in Beijing was fine.
At 8 a.m., the vast majority of the city's 35 air quality monitoring stations were shown to be "first-class" green.
The "Blue Sky" themed photo contest spontaneously launched by the public on social platforms is still ongoing.
Why is the sky so blue in Beijing recently?
According to an official from the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, in August this year, the average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 micrograms per cubic meter, setting a record for the same period in the past five years.
In September, real-time PM2.5 concentrations were in the single digits.
One of the major factors for the emergence of the "bluest sky" is the overall favorable meteorological conditions in recent times, and more importantly, Beijing's persistent air pollution control, vigorously promoting the clean air action plan in the past five years, and the continuous release of environmental benefits, so that the total amount of pollutant emissions in the region has been reduced, which has laid the foundation for continuous improvement of air quality.
In 2013, Beijing officially released and implemented the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017.
According to the plan, the government will continue to guide the non-capital functions to be relieved, promote clean energy substitution and pollution reduction, and eliminate a total of 4,923 coal-fired boilers.
As a result, Beijing has become the first major city in Chinese mainland to realize the full network of natural gas.
Data shows that between 2013 and 2017, the annual average PM2.5 concentration in Beijing dropped by 35.6%. The number of days meeting air quality standards increased by 50 days, the number of first-class excellent days increased by 25 days, and the number of heavily polluted days decreased by 35 days, and the incidence of heavy pollution decreased significantly.
While the air quality continues to improve, Beijing officials issued the "Three-Year Action Plan for Winning the Blue Sky Defense War in Beijing" in September this year based on a new round of PM2.5 source analysis. Resident in the capital, it is no longer "scarce and expensive", let it return to the background of people's photo albums instead of the protagonist.
During this year's National Day Golden Week, the Municipal Tourism Commission, industry and commerce, urban management, public security and other relevant departments will strengthen the law enforcement inspection of the "one-day tour" market, focusing on the chaos of the "six blacks" in tourism.
Yesterday morning, the city government held a special meeting to crack down on illegal "one-day tours" to make arrangements for the special action to further crack down on illegal "one-day tours."
At the meeting, it was revealed that focusing on the "six blacks" chaos of black ticket mention, black guides, black clubs, black cars, black shops, and black network interest chains, the city has launched a special action to crack down on illegal "one-day tours" since July 28.
Since the launch of the special action, the city has accepted a total of 39 complaints about "one-day tours", a year-on-year decrease of 63%; Since the beginning of this year, the city has accepted 270 complaints about "one-day tours", a year-on-year decrease of 62%.
In the past two months, the city has seized 248 "black cars", investigated and dealt with 158 violations of tourist passenger transport business, closed 29 shopping "black shops" and performing arts venues, investigated and dealt with 13 "black clubs" and 27 "black guides", confiscated 26,000 illegal advertisements, removed 31 illegal "one-day" billboards and 3 fake bus stop signs, investigated and dealt with 1,789 cases of various travel-related violations, 181 cases were filed by various functional departments, a heavy fine of 4.48 million yuan, and 111 people were detained for travel-related violations.
After rectification, the chaotic phenomenon of illegal "one-day tours" has been basically curbed, and the "one-day tour" market order has shown a steady and improving trend.
According to reports, in recent years, the city has continuously increased the intensity of rectification of illegal "one-day tours".
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission accepted 1,612 and 897 complaints about "one-day tours", a year-on-year decrease of 79% and 44% respectively.
Specifically, illegal solicitation of tourists on the street is called "black ticket picking", illegal websites that publish false tourist information are "black networks", travel agencies engaged in illegal "one-day tours" or institutions or individuals without travel agency business qualifications are "black companies", tour guides without tour guide certificates or illegal practices employed by "black companies" are "black guides", vehicles without tourist passenger transport qualifications used by them or vehicles with tourist passenger transport qualifications that provide passenger transport services for illegal "one-day tours" are "black cars", and finally the designated tourist shopping stores they bring tourists into are "black shops".
In this special action, the city continued to increase the illegal "day trip" fixed inspection and mobile inspection, for the illegal "day trip" high incidence and high impact of the tourist routes, the relevant departments sent a team to the car every day to accompany the group to make an unannounced visit, found evidence of violations of laws and regulations after strict investigation and punishment in accordance with the law.
Among them, "black cars" and "black shops" have become the two key points of the special operation.
According to reports, without black cars, illegal "day trips" can not be made, black cars are easy to find, remember and investigate, but also a single high value of fixed assets.
Relevant departments use road traffic monitoring probes to increase the supervision of key "one-day" routes of tourist buses, and use technical defense, physical defense and other scientific and technological intelligent means to timely discover, investigate and deal with "black cars".
Due to the small number of tourist shopping "black shops" and the fact that they operate on the ground, they have also become the focus of the crackdown.
In order to strengthen the deterrence and crackdown on illegal "one-day tours", once it is verified that there are violations of laws and regulations in the special operation, all functional departments will be given heavy and severe superimposed punishments in accordance with the law.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to cracking down on illegal "one-day tours" to discuss the means and measures for combining administrative punishment with criminalization and conviction.
The Municipal Tourism Commission said that in the future, it will encourage more regular travel agencies to carry out "one-day tours" in Beijing and increase the supply of regular "one-day tours" to further occupy the living space of illegal "one-day tours".
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has also continuously improved the electronic itinerary information system for tour groups to ensure that each team is included in the supervision of the electronic itinerary platform.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economy symbol, what Wuzhen has experienced over the years
As the permanent site of the World Internet Conference, Wuzhen has attracted much attention on how to undertake the dividends of the summit.
Since the first World Internet Conference, in the past five years, the changes in Wuzhen have been obvious to all.
In 2014, there were only 12 enterprises related to the digital economy and the Internet in the town, but by the third quarter of this year, there were more than 500.
This is a microcosm of Wuzhen's development of a digital economy.
The convening of the Internet conference allows local enterprises to accept the inspiration of the digital economy and digital wave at zero distance, and the desire for enterprise transformation and upgrading is very strong.
Jiang Wei, Secretary of the Party Committee of Wuzhen Town, said that Wuzhen will build a new economic empowerment center in the future.
The development of the digital economy is inseparable from the support of infrastructure.
This year, Wuzhen launched a 5G pilot on the basis of achieving full coverage of 4G communication network and free WiFi.
At the same time, Tongxiang City, where Wuzhen is located, has become a hot spot for the development of the Internet industry, as the first county-level city in the country to build a dedicated channel for international Internet data.
Since the first World Internet Conference, Tongxiang has introduced a total of 565 digital economy projects, with a total planned investment of 37.725 billion yuan, and the total output value of the core manufacturing industry of the digital economy in the first three quarters of this year was 8.73 billion yuan, with a year-on-year increase of 13%.
"In the past, Wuzhen was a tourist symbol, but later it was a theatrical and cultural symbol. Because of the Internet Conference, it has now become a symbol of the Internet and the digital economy. ”
Sheng Yongjun, secretary of the Tongxiang Municipal Party Committee, believes that the dividends of the World Internet Conference have accumulated over time, so it is more necessary to build a platform to undertake the superimposed introduction of talents, projects, technologies and other elements from all parties.
Shen Yi, a native of Tongxiang, has been working outside for 20 years, and returned to his hometown to start a business because of his association with the Internet conference.
On December 2 last year, he walked into the 4th Internet Light Expo with high-capacity anti-tampering digital technology solutions, which were favored by many customers.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in Wuzhen not only because of his hometown complex, "In Wuzhen, it is easier to recruit people than I imagined, and our application has also landed quickly, and our application is in the Wuzhen smart parking project. ”
A Wuzhen Avenue presents the spillover effect of the Internet conference.
This avenue that runs through the north and south of Tongxiang is not only a string of tourist attractions, but also an industrial avenue.
Relying on it, the Wuzhen Avenue Science and Technology Innovation Cluster came into being.
The reporter learned that in the future, Wuzhen Avenue will become the main position of Tongxiang's industrial development, taking the lead in applying a large number of achievements such as smart medical care, smart pension, and smart government affairs, and gathering industries accounting for 80% of the city's GDP and many high-level talents.
At least 410 people have been killed in the tsunami triggered by the strong earthquake in Indonesia
According to the director of the Public Information Bureau of the Jakarta Police in Indonesia on the evening of the 29th, the earthquake in Central Sulawesi Province has killed 410 people, of whom 97 have been identified.
Another 29 people are missing and 540 injured.
Palu Airport remains closed at this time.
With active treatment, the survival rate of preterm infants born at 29 weeks and above in China has reached 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries.
Chinanews.com, Shanghai, September 30 (Chen Jing, Luo Yanqian) The National Children's Medical Center and the Children's Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University disclosed on the 30th that they introduced advanced Canadian methods in the "China NICU Inpatient Prematurity Infant Prognostic Quality Improvement Project" led by them.
The results of the project showed that the survival rate of preterm infants at 29 weeks and above in China reached 98% after active treatment, which has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still great room for improvement in the survival rate of preterm infants of very small gestational age and preterm infants without complications.
For nearly 20 years, the Chinese government has been concerned about the treatment of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71 per thousand, which is significantly lower than the national average and has reached the advanced level of developed countries.
The "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project for Preterm Infants in the China NICU" has greatly improved the quality of life of preterm infants through four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the Children's Hospital of Fudan University, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature infants, it is of great significance to pay attention to reducing the quality of survival of premature infants, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the prognosis of neurodevelopment, and improving the overall outcome of children.
Through four years of unremitting efforts, the "China NICU Prognosis Quality Improvement Project for Premature Infants" has included tens of thousands of premature infants with a gestational age of 33 weeks and below, which has reduced the mortality rate of preterm infants with small gestational age and small birth weight by 1/3 in China, and the incidence of serious complications in preterm infants has been significantly reduced, which has greatly improved the quality of life of premature infants.
Through the establishment of a national neonatal quality improvement cooperation network and the introduction of collaborative quality improvement concepts, the project radiates 25 cooperative hospitals in China to establish a complete, systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement method suitable for domestic national conditions to improve the prognosis of preterm infants and improve the level of neonatal treatment.
The Children's Hospital of Fudan University is working with the national neonatology department to formulate guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the experience accumulated in the project, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in the "China Premature Infant Prognostic Quality Improvement Project", the pediatric hospital introduced the EPIQ method into 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces across the country, and is committed to solving the problem of infection of premature infants that plagues neonatal intensive care units in China.
After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, the uncomplicated survival rate of preterm infants in Canada has increased by about one-third, and Canada is now one of the countries with the best prognosis for preterm infants in the world.
The EPIQ method has now been used in all NICUs in Canada and has been adopted in six countries.
According to the pediatric hospital, the results of the study showed that after two years of EPIQ intervention, preterm infant infections decreased by 35%, and antibiotic use decreased by 20%.
In the future, the Children's Hospital of Fudan University will continue to promote and implement this method nationwide, focusing on comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications of preterm infants and improving the quality of neonatal treatment across the country.
At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are differences and heterogeneity in the level of treatment in different regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important construction unit of the National Children's Medical Center, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role, and this study covers Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and other western provinces, in order to gradually promote the homogeneity and standardization of neonatal treatment nationwide.
It is understood that the Children's Hospital of Fudan University is working with the national neonatology department to formulate guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the experience accumulated in the project, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
According to reports, in 2019, the China Neonatal Collaboration Network, which is located in the Children's Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, will work with 63 hospitals across the country to carry out the next stage of national quality improvement, in order to promote the development of the equalization of China's neonatal treatment level.
Wu Jinglei, director of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission, said that Shanghai can become the center of Asia, not only in research, but also in the construction of the entire service system, and the service quality and service results should have a place in Asia, so as to truly reflect China's medical level.
Xin Zhiping: Building a "Monument to Heroes" in my heart ———— written on the Fifth Martyrs' Day.
On September 30, on the eve of the 69th birthday of the People's Republic of China, we ushered in the fifth Martyrs' Day, and Xi Jinping and other party and state leaders came to Tiananmen Square to attend the ceremony of laying flower baskets to the people's heroes.
At this moment, no matter where you are, please pay tribute to the martyrs.
Anniversaries are revisited, but also awakened.
Turning over the thick history, behind the name of every martyr is a fresh life.
They also have fiery youth, sincere love, and concerned families.
However, because they firmly believe that "the doctrine of our faith is the truth of the universe," they are willing to sacrifice everything they have in order to "save the next generation from suffering."
"Every day I live, I have to shout for China for a day."
Through time and space, the heroes and martyrs set up spiritual signposts to guide the way forward.
"Where do you come from, where are you going" and "what kind of person should you be", it is not difficult to come up with the answer when you understand the martyrs.
To commemorate the martyrs, the most important thing is to build a "heroic monument" in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the years of the revolutionary war, about 20 million martyrs have bravely sacrificed their lives for national independence, the liberation of the people, and the prosperity and strength of the country.
For various reasons, many martyrs did not even leave their names.
Countless heroes and martyrs have watered their ideals with their blood, practiced their beliefs with their lives, remembered their heroic names, and inherited their spirits, which is to protect the roots and souls of the nation.
This "monument to heroes" does not tolerate any defacement or destruction.
For some time, there has been an undercurrent of historical nihilism and pan-entertainment.
All kinds of practices that distort history and belittle heroes and martyrs challenge the conscience of justice and confuse value judgments, and arouse public indignation and vigilance in the whole society.
Heroes and martyrs cannot be desecrated, and heroes cannot be forgotten.
We must dare to show our swords and defend the dignity of heroes and martyrs with the rule of law and justice.
On May 1 this year, the Law on the Protection of Heroes and Martyrs came into effect.
Judging from judicial practice, the verdicts in some cases are very satisfying, which not only effectively safeguard the glorious image of heroes and martyrs in accordance with the law, but also release the positive energy of advocating heroes and admiring martyrs.
A nation with aspirations cannot be without heroes, and a country with ideals cannot be without pioneers.
Remembering the martyrs and calling for heroes has become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are more than one million commemorative facilities of various types across the country, and more than 100 million people visit the martyrs' cemeteries every year.
The human heart is the strongest cornerstone.
Let advocating heroes, defending heroes, learning heroes, and caring for heroes become a common practice, and let the spirit of heroes and martyrs be integrated into the blood of the nation, and the "Heroes Monument" will stand majestically between heaven and earth and in the depths of people's hearts.
BRUSSELS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The European Union took a non-confrontational stance against Italy on Friday after it flouted its demands and surprised markets with a massive budget deficit plan, but it may take a more aggressive stance if Italy sticks to too bold targets.
Italy's Eurosceptic government is targeting a budget deficit equivalent to 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) over the next three years, suggesting that there has been no debt reduction despite deficit reduction requirements.
"We have no interest in the crisis between the European Commission and Italy," said Moskovisi, the European Commission's executive committee member for economic affairs, and his cautious response as the EU's proposals and sanctions are likely to have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats remain hopeful that market forces will persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before it formally submits it to the European Commission in mid-October.
The euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday after the government announced its plans, and Italian bond yields hit their highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged by the October deadline, the European Commission is likely to veto Italy's draft budget, something it has never done to any country.
European Commission Vice President Dombrovsky later told a meeting in Riga, Latvia, on Friday that Italy's current fiscal plan "does not seem to be in line with the Stability and Growth Pact," referring to the EU's fiscal rules.
But he did not say what the EU's reaction would be.
Bidders have until October 26 this year to submit their applications to participate in the public tender.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture made China one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
Russia's Agricultural Supervision Service announced in May that Russia's grain exports to China this agricultural year exceeded 1 million tons for the first time, setting a new record.
The bureau predicts that China could be among the top 10 importers of Russian grain.
China News Service Sapporo, September 30 After defeating the Cuban team 3-0 in the first game, the Chinese women's volleyball team defeated the Turkish team 3-0 again on the 30th, winning two consecutive victories in the group stage of the 2018 World Championships.
But compared with the first game, the Chinese women's volleyball team is more difficult and dangerous.
A total of 24 teams participated in the 2018 Women's Volleyball World Championship, and the Chinese women's volleyball team was in Group B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
Judging from the world ranking and overall strength of the teams in Group B, Turkey and Italy are the main opponents of the Chinese team.
After the start of the day's game, the Chinese team entered the state quickly, took the lead at the beginning, maintained the advantage throughout the whole game, put a lot of pressure on the opponent on serve and blocking, and won the first game 25:18 relatively smoothly.
In the second game, the Turkish team served very fiercely, and took a 6:2 lead at the beginning, the Chinese team adjusted the formation after requesting a timeout, and gradually chased the score to 7 draws, and then blocked the net many times to score, playing a 7:0 scoring tide; at the end of the game, the Turkish team once chased the score to 15:19; after the Chinese team got the game point at 24:20, the tenacious Turkish team chased 2 points in a row; after the Chinese team asked for a timeout again, with Zhu Ting's running attack score, won the second game 25:23.
The situation in the third game was very stalemate, and the scores of the two sides rose alternately, and it was once tied at 19.
At the critical moment, the Turkish team made a mistake, and after the Chinese team led 21:19, it won the match point at 24:21 with Zhu Ting's strong smash and Zhang Changning's attack, and then the Turkish team chased the score to 23:24, after the Chinese team asked for a timeout, Zhang Changning scored an attack, and the Chinese team locked the victory with 25:23.
Lang Ping, head coach of the Chinese women's volleyball team, admitted frankly after the game that the whole game was not easy.
"We are well prepared, we have a good block, the Turkish team is more technical, we have to reduce our mistakes and try to win by scoring on our own. ”

In addition, the National Development and Reform Commission has carried out special inspections on the recent media reflection of the problems such as the price reduction of individual scenic spots is too small and the actual drop is not reduced, requiring all localities to deal with it seriously, respond to social concerns in a timely manner, and effectively implement the price reduction in place.
IPIM has carried out short-, medium- and long-term optimization work in an orderly manner
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Institute (IPIM) has submitted a report on the short-, medium- and long-term optimization of "major investment immigration" and "skilled immigration".
IPIM will brief the community on the enhancement work as soon as possible.
Among them, 5 are short-term measures to be implemented this year, 5 are medium-term measures to be implemented in 2019 and 1 is a long-term measure.
In addition, IPIM has also conducted a comprehensive review of its internal management system under the direction of the Secretary for Economy and Finance, Leong Vai Tac.
The five short-term measures to be implemented this year include:
1. Carry out review work. Priority will be given to the review of cases that are about to expire for 7 years, those mentioned in the ICAC report, and new renewal cases. If a case is found to contain any inappropriate circumstances or signs of violating the law, it will be referred to the relevant judicial authorities for follow-up handling.
2. On-site inspection of projects involving "major investment immigration". By the end of September, more than 20 investment projects had been inspected;
3. Conduct a comprehensive review of the existing assessment system. In the assessment of applications for "major investment immigration", the six principles for the analysis of investment projects have been re-established, and in the assessment of applications for "skilled immigration", the relevant approval mechanism will be improved by clarifying the elements conducive to Macao's development and the conditions for giving priority to attracting talents. At the same time, a list of "five industries and 10 types of trades" has been formulated to give priority to the introduction of talents for the year, so as to tie in with the policy direction of the HKSAR Government and attract talents in a more targeted manner.
4. Increasing information transparency. These include plans to gradually announce the vetting criteria, scoring criteria and weightings from the fourth quarter of this year, and further refine and make public the vetting data;
5. In terms of improving the recognition mechanism, it has been required to check the work in Australia before confirmation, and major investments must be inspected and submitted on site.

Experts from the national film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities walked into the test field and listened to the introduction of the team of academician Yu Shuxun of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Chinanews.com, Shaya, Xinjiang, September 30 (Geng Dandan, Wang Xiaojun) Located in Shaya County, Xinjiang, the film-free cotton planting test base, the growth of film-free cotton is gratifying, compared with the mulch cotton next to it, "not inferior", clusters of snow-white cotton compete to "open", hanging full of branches.
From September 27th to 28th, the national film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
The reporter learned at the observation meeting that the film-free cotton technology system with "Zhongmian 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body has initially achieved the goal of film-free planting in cotton fields, reduced the pollution of Xinjiang cotton field residual film to the ecological environment and raw cotton, and made significant progress in the research and demonstration of film-free cotton comprehensive technology.
Academician Yu Shuxun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, famous cotton geneticist breeder, and chief scientist of the cotton system of the national modern agricultural industry technology system, introduced the growth of film-free cotton to Zhou Guomo, Secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University.
"The film-free cotton comprehensive technology we developed can completely realize the planting of cotton without mulch, which can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and achieve green cotton planting. ”
Yu Shuxun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton-producing region in China, and according to the National Bureau of Statistics, the cotton planting area in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of plastic film into China in 1982, the area of various crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million mu, and the annual use of plastic film is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, the coverage rate of cotton mulch film reached 100%, and cotton field mulching accounted for about 60% of the use of mulch film in Xinjiang.
The yield of non-film cotton can be measured and the cotton yield can be 320 kg to 350 kg per mu.
With the continuous increase of plastic film input in Xinjiang, the recovery rate of residual plastic film is low, the amount of residual film in the soil is gradually increasing, and a series of problems such as soil structure damage caused by residual film have seriously affected the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great impact on the quality of cotton fiber.
At present, more than one-third of Xinjiang's cotton fields have been harvested by mechanization.
In 2017, the area of machine picking cotton in Xinjiang was about 14 million mu.
In the process of harvesting cotton harvesting, a large number of broken films on the surface and cotton plants are collected, and the broken films doped in the raw cotton are difficult to remove in the raw cotton processing process, and cannot be completely removed in the subsequent textile processing process, which seriously affects the quality of textile products.
On September 28, the national film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
In order to solve the problem of plastic film pollution in cotton fields, simplify cotton planting technology, and improve the efficiency of cotton fields, Yu Shuxun led his team to implement the "Zhongmian 619" film-free cotton technology planting in 8 years, adding wings to the green development of Xinjiang's agriculture.
Yu Shuxun introduced that through innovative breeding ideas, a new strain of upland cotton "Zhongmian 619" with ultra-early maturity, salt and alkali tolerance, low temperature resistance and high yield has been cultivated.
"Under the condition of filmless cultivation in southern Xinjiang, Zhongmian 619 has realized a series of supporting measures such as film-free seeding machinery, improvement of seeding depth, shallow burial of dropper belt under film-free conditions, suitable seeding density screening, and reasonable chemical regulation. ”
At present, Aksu, Korla, Alar and other places have established film-free cotton demonstration bases, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Film-free cotton planting has achieved high yield, cost saving, environmental protection, and improved comprehensive benefits.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at the Agricultural Science Institute of the Third Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through the research and demonstration of film-free cotton cultivation technology in the past six years, the yield of film-free cottonseed cotton can fully achieve a yield of 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, or even higher.
"There is great prospect for the promotion of film-free cotton cultivation technology. ”
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, the film-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is still a certain gap between the current economic benefits and the plastic film cultivation.
"The support of cotton purchase price will be conducive to future promotion. ”
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and large-scale promotion and application of film-free cotton, make the film-free cotton industry bigger and stronger, and completely solve the problem of soil pollution caused by plastic film.

Former foreign aid accused of match-fixing, Beijing Enterprises responded to "unwarranted" - Chinanews.com
Yesterday afternoon, Beijing Enterprises Football Club (hereinafter referred to as Beijing Holdings) made an official response to the news that the team's former foreign aid Anichebe accused the team of being suspected of playing match-fixing, and Beijing Enterprises issued a statement saying that there is absolutely no match-fixing on the club's side, which is completely a lie fabricated by Anichebe himself in the arbitration process in order to cover up the fact that he blatantly violated the contract and for his personal improper economic purposes.
At the same time, Beijing Enterprises said that it would reserve the right to take all means to investigate the responsibility of relevant parties.
According to the British "Daily Mail", Nigerian player Anichebe accused FIFA that the Beijing Beikong team he played for last year was suspected of match-fixing, including the Beijing derby in the 21st round of the 2017 season.
At that time, it was the critical stage of Beijing Renhe and the overtaking, and in that game, Beijing Control finally lost 0-2 away to Beijing Renhe, and Anicheby started.
In response to the Nigerian player's statement, the club issued an official response yesterday.
The statement said that after the club's previous internal investigation, there was no match-fixing in the matches the team participated in.
Anichebe joined Beijing Beijing Enterprises in June 2017, and in December of the same year, Anichebe refused to return to the team for winter training without a valid reason, and still refused to return despite repeated reminders from the club.
At present, the dispute between the two parties has been submitted to FIFA and arbitration is ongoing.
The statement also mentioned that the much-talked-about "match-fixing allegations" were actually lies fabricated by Anichebe in the arbitration process in order to cover up the fact that he blatantly violated the contract and for his personal improper economic purposes.
The only purpose of slandering clubs and slandering Chinese football is to obtain improper economic benefits.
The club does not accept any organization or any individual to make unwarranted accusations, slander, slander and slander against the club for its economic interests and personal grievances.
Therefore, BEWG said that it would reserve the right to take all means to investigate the responsibility of the relevant parties.
The Agricultural Development Bank of China will invest 20 billion yuan to support the purchase of autumn grain in Jilin.
Since September, crops in Jilin Province have ushered in the peak harvest period.
The reporter learned from the Jilin Branch of the Agricultural Development Bank of China that the Agricultural Development Bank of China has prepared enough credit funds of 20 billion yuan to ensure that the supply of funds for the purchase of autumn grain in Jilin is sufficient.
It is understood that the grain production situation in Jilin this year is generally stable, and some grain processing enterprises have increased their grain market demand due to the expansion of production capacity and the increase in operating rate.
In order to ensure the supply of funds for grain policy purchases, the ADB has actively carried out bank-enterprise matchmaking meetings for autumn grain purchases by visiting farmers, processing enterprises, trading enterprises and other purchasing entities.
At present, the Agricultural Development Bank has invested 5.2 billion yuan to support the purchase of 11.58 billion catties of autumn grain by various grain purchasing entities.

According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the UK answered a reporter's question on the 1st about a Chinese journalist being taken away by the police during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party.

A reporter asked: On September 30, during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party, the party's Human Rights Committee held a side meeting on the Hong Kong issue and invited the Hong Kong opposition to speak at the meeting.
A Chinese journalist was taken away by police during the side meeting.
Do you have any comment?
In response, the spokesperson said that in the 21 years since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the practice of "one country, two systems" has achieved great success, and Hong Kong's development achievements have been recognized by the whole world.
Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs.
The Conservative Party's Human Rights Committee used the party's annual meeting to hold a side event to show the attention of anti-China separatist forces, and the Chinese side expressed its grave concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We firmly oppose any person or organization interfering in Hong Kong's affairs in any way.
Any attempt or act advocating "Hong Kong independence" will be futile.
The spokesman said that the UK has always flaunted freedom of speech, but when Chinese journalists asked questions and expressed their views at side meetings, they were obstructed in every possible way, and even physically violated, which is completely unacceptable.
We demand that the Conservative Human Rights Commission stop interfering in China's internal affairs and meddling in Hong Kong affairs, and that the conference organizers apologize to Chinese journalists.

Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations on Friday that China-US relations have once again reached a crossroads, and if the two sides can look at each other positively and inclusively, expand and deepen positive cooperation, and properly manage differences and contradictions, they can open up better prospects.
"The U.S.-China relationship is our common asset and needs to be taken care of together. ”
He expressed the hope that people of insight from all walks of life in the two countries will take concrete actions to safeguard the healthy and stable development of Sino-US relations and jointly push Sino-US relations forward in the right direction.
Wang Yi also stressed once again that China will definitely embark on a different development path from that of traditional major countries.
This path with Chinese characteristics determines that China will not and cannot repeat the mistake of being a strong country and must be hegemonic, and it also determines that China will neither become the United States, nor will it challenge the United States, let alone replace the United States.
In his speech entitled "Opportunity or Challenge, Partner or Adversary," Wang Yi said that the deep-seated crux of the current problem lies in the fact that some American friends believe that China will also become a strong country and will become hegemonic, and will even challenge and replace the United States as a leader in the world.
"This is clearly a major strategic miscalculation. ”
But this self-imaginary suspicion is spreading, he said, amplifying existing contradictions, creating new doubts and making it more difficult and more difficult and resistant to resolving specific issues between China and the United States.
Wang Yi pointed out that China is following a path of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had the genes for external expansion.
We believe that all countries can live in harmony and learn from each other.
In the past, at present, and in the future, China will neither copy foreign models, nor will it ask other countries to copy China's practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in New York, he said that Sino-US cooperation will be a win-win situation, and confrontation will inevitably be a lose-lose situation.
China is committed to developing long-term, healthy and stable China-US relations, and achieving non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.

On September 30, local time, Indonesian President Joko Widodo inspected the city of Palu, Central Sulawesi, where the earthquake occurred.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the disaster area on September 30 and said that the army had been sent to assist in the search and rescue, and called on the victims to be patient.
Jokowi pointed out that the rescue operation was very difficult due to the lack of heavy machinery and manpower.
He learned that there was a shortage of water, food and fuel in many parts of the affected areas, and that many businesses had been closed after the earthquake, and that airplanes had been dispatched to drop supplies.
He appealed to the victims to be patient and stay where they were and wait for help.
Search and rescue workers in Palu said they heard cries for help from a collapsed hotel in the city, but were helpless because there was no heavy machinery to remove the rubble, and some people needed to save people with their bare hands.
Indonesia's vice president, Kala, said that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami could eventually rise to thousands due to the lack of information due to power and communications cuts in some areas.
Shenyang, 5 Nov (Reporter Xu Zhiqiang, Correspondent Yan Yina) This reporter learned today from the Liaoning Provincial People's Court Dispatch Meeting on Basically Resolving the Difficulty in Enforcement that the Liaoning Provincial People's Court severely cracked down on refusal to enforce the law during the six-month "storm" campaign of enforcement, and transferred a total of 241 people for the crime of refusing to execute, thus maintaining a high-pressure situation of cracking down on the crime of refusing to execute.
It is understood that in accordance with the unified deployment of the Liaoning High Court, from the beginning of April to the end of September, the Liaoning court launched a six-month "storm" campaign to basically solve the difficulty of enforcement, gathering superior forces to launch a comprehensive general offensive against the basic solution of the difficulty of enforcement.
At the same time, the courts of the province organized and carried out the "five batches" activities in accordance with the law, including a batch of fines, a batch of detention, a batch of restrictions on consumption, a batch of punishments for dishonesty, and a batch of transfers for the crime of refusing to execute.
At the beginning of the event, there were more than 132,000 pending enforcement cases in the courts of the province, and at the end of July, the cases were cleared to the bottom.
During the activity, the provincial courts fined a total of 12.0607 million yuan to the person subject to execution, detained 4,146 people, restricted 162844 people from consumption, punished 55,128 people for dishonesty, and transferred 241 people for refusal to execute.
From January to October this year, Liaoning courts accepted a total of 297438 enforcement cases, a year-on-year increase of 13.28%; 226558 cases were executed, a year-on-year increase of 83.18%; The implementation was 31.236 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 74.94%.
Where can I take a taxi?
We want to go to the Golden Bauhinia Square to see the National Day flag-raising ceremony! "
The Song couple, who deliberately flew from Ningxia to Shenzhen and transferred to the first train of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link on the National Day in Shenzhen, asked this reporter when they were interviewed by a reporter from China News Service at Hong Kong's West Kowloon Station on the morning of October 1.
On the morning of October 1, to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region held a grand flag-raising ceremony at the Golden Bauhinia Square.
According to the statistics at the immigration control points, as at 30 September, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via the West Kowloon Station of the High Speed Rail had exceeded 300,000.
On the occasion of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the motherland, the West Kowloon Border Checkpoint predicts that there will be a peak of visitor arrivals to Hong Kong on October 1 and 2.
At about 7 o'clock in the morning of the 1st, the reporter saw in the arrival hall that many mainland tourists took advantage of the National Day Golden Week to take the high-speed rail and tour Hong Kong.
Mrs. Song, who walked briskly, told reporters that the National Day holiday is a rare long holiday in the year, and it has always been her wish to come to Hong Kong's Golden Bauhinia Square to see the flag-raising, and she feels very happy and excited to achieve this wish on the National Day.
However, the current flights between Ningxia and Hong Kong are inconvenient, but fortunately, the Hong Kong section of the high-speed rail is open, and Mr. Song checked the train timetable and found that the first train can arrive at 7:03 in the morning, connecting the city with transportation to Golden Bauhinia Square, just at the right time.
He sighed to reporters: "The high-speed rail is so convenient, fast and punctual!"
The 70 daily short-distance trains between Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North and Futian and West Kowloon within one hour have greatly facilitated residents in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to come to Hong Kong.
After arriving in Hong Kong, Mr. Lau, who lives in Shenzhen, was preparing to go to the Peak of Central to meet his Hong Kong friends who were hiking in the mountains.
Mr. Lau said, "The Mainland and Hong Kong are both closed on the National Day, and we plan to challenge ourselves to see if we can complete the 50-kilometre Hong Kong Island Trail!"
He explained that if it weren't for the opening of the high-speed railway, which is convenient and has enough time, they would not dare to try such a long-distance hiking activity easily.
Mrs. Yang from Dongguan took her 10-year-old son to Hong Kong to participate in the piano competition by high-speed rail, and she proudly told reporters that her son has been learning the piano for three years, and she feels very meaningful to spend the National Day in this way.
She has been taking the bus to Hong Kong before, but it is time-consuming and labor-intensive, she is worried about affecting her son's state, this time through Shenzhen to take the high-speed rail, customs clearance is convenient, the time is halved, the Hong Kong section of the itinerary is more impressive to her, she told reporters: "It seems to take the subway, it is very fast, I didn't have time to take pictures to arrive!" "
At 6:44 on September 23, the G5711 "Harmony" high-speed rail train departed from Shenzhen North Railway Station, galloping all the way, and a few minutes later the train entered the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong high-speed railway, which was the first officially operating high-speed rail train ushered in by the Hong Kong section.
The Hong Kong section of the high-speed rail, which is integrated into the country's 25,000-kilometer high-speed rail network and has direct access to 38 long-distance stations across the country, also welcomes mainland passengers from different provinces in the south and north of the country.
Mr. Gao, who came to Hong Kong from Changsha to visit relatives during the long holiday, told reporters that before the high-speed rail could only sit in the north of Shenzhen, take the subway to cross Hong Kong, and then travel to the city's transportation, which was troublesome and time-consuming, but now he can sit directly in the center of Kowloon, and he can eat the lunch made by his children when he arrives at home, and he feels very happy.
He said that the convenience of the "co-location and two clearances" customs clearance process is beyond imagination, "In less than 10 minutes, both customs clearances have been passed. ”
The West Kowloon Station, which is close to the Airport Express and connects to land and air transportation, has also become the first choice for many transit passengers.
Miss Wu from Fujian Province was going to spend the Golden Week with her girlfriends from Hong Kong to the Philippines, and she pushed her luggage when she went out of the gate on time in West Kowloon, and said to reporters unhurriedly: "I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to catch the plane, but I didn't expect it to be so fast, and there was more than enough time!"
The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal would preserve U.S. President Donald Trump's ability to enforce his threat of 25 percent tariffs on imported cars, while essentially exempting passenger cars, pickup trucks and auto parts imported from Canada and Mexico, according to a trade deal ancillary arrangement unveiled Monday.
If Trump imposes so-called "Chapter 232" tariffs on cars for national security reasons, both Mexico and Canada will have a quota of 2.6 million duty-exempt passenger cars exported to the United States each year.
Under the ancillary arrangement, pickup trucks manufactured in both countries will be fully exempt from tariffs.
If Trump imposes tariffs on automobiles, Mexico will receive a $108 billion annual auto parts exemption quota, and Canada will receive a $32.4 billion quota.
Both quotas are well above the current production levels of both countries, providing room for growth in both countries' exports.
WASHINGTON/Mexico, Sept 28 (Reuters) - After days of debate, US President Donald Trump's administration and Canada are making concrete efforts to resolve trade policy differences, raising hopes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is expected to maintain its tripartite format, Mexico said on Friday.
While details are lacking, the apparent progress is enough to prompt the Mexican and U.S. governments to abruptly halt plans to publish the text of a trade agreement between the two countries, giving Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government has made a new counter-proposal to the Canadian government and said he will continue to push for all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said the submission of the text of the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement to Mexico and the U.S. for legislation had been delayed as the Canadian and U.S. governments tried to reach an agreement "very seriously."
"In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we will reach a text of a tripartite agreement or if we will have to publish the text of the bipartite agreement," Guajardo said. ”
Guajardo said his U.S. and Canadian counterparts "specifically requested" that the release of the text be delayed.
A spokesperson for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement or U.S.-Canada negotiations.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Canada did not respond to requests for comment on counterproposals.
According to foreign media reports, in a nursery center on the outskirts of Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, two lion cubs are playing together, and it is difficult to see anything unusual, but they are actually unique.
The University of Pretoria announced: "This is the first ever artificial insemination of a lion cub – the first couple in the world. ”
Scientists at the university are studying the reproductive system of female African lions.
Gans Wintert, director of the Institute of Mammal Research at the University of Pretoria, said the two lion cubs, one male and one female, were quite healthy and normal, born on August 25.
His team finally achieved this breakthrough after 18 months of intensive experimentation.
Speaking to the media, Ganswinter said: "We collect sperm from a healthy male lion. ”
Next, the researchers waited for the lioness to reach the right level of hormones before artificially inseminating it.
Ganswinter said: "Fortunately, it turned out to be a success. ”
The researchers, he said, "made several attempts, but unexpectedly, didn't take much effort."
He said the breakthrough was reproducible, and scientists hope to use the technology to save endangered big cats.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, lions have become extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of lions surviving in the wild has plummeted by 43% in the past 20 years to only about 20,000.
African lions are classified as vulnerable by this organization.
"If we don't do something about these animals, they're going to go extinct," Ganswinter said. ”
He said the new technology does not require lions to be reared, but simply sperm is injected into fertile lionesses, as is the case with captive elephants in North America and Europe.
South Korea's exports fell by the most in more than two years in September, but analysts blamed the decline on fewer working days and said global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
Indeed, South Korea's average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, the preliminary data released earlier showed double-digit growth in exports in the first weeks of September before the long holiday.
South Korea's exports fell by the most year-on-year in September since July 2016, larger than the 5.7 percent decline estimated by 11 analysts polled by Reuters.
Preliminary data released on Monday showed exports of $50.6 billion in September, down from $51.2 billion in August.
South Korea's exports to China rose 7.8 percent in September, the 23rd straight month of expansion, despite fears that the growing U.S.-China trade dispute could hurt other export-dependent Chinese neighbors as well.
South Korea's exports to the U.S. fell 11.8 percent due to a decline in sales of petroleum products.
Overseas sales of memory chips and petroleum products in South Korea increased by 28.3% and 13.5%, respectively, despite concerns that the so-called chip "supercycle" may have peaked.
"However, the impact of the trade conflict will be difficult to avoid, as South Korea is heavily dependent on the U.S. and Chinese markets for its exports. ”
Imports fell 2.1 percent to $40.8 billion, not as good as the 3.1 percent increase estimated in a Reuters poll.
The preliminary trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
According to the Ministry of Industry, thanks to the United States and European Union countries, the global manufacturing industry will remain strong, which is a favorable factor for South Korea's exports.
The statement pointed out that "the increase in export prices caused by the rise in oil prices will also be beneficial to exports in the second half of this year." ”
"However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with the increased market volatility following the US interest rate hike, is a negative pressure on exports. ”
Exports increased to $2.6 billion per working day in September, compared with $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea's Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26 this year, so there are only 19.5 working days in September, four fewer than the same period last year.
South Korea's exports from January to September increased by 4.7% from the same period last year.
South Korea's manufacturing activity picked up in September, according to the Nikkei/Markit PMI, but was supported by domestic orders, which could cloud the outlook for exports as orders from China and Japan fell.
North Korean media criticized the United States for not relaxing sanctions against North Korea
On September 30, the DPRK's Rodong Sinmun published a signed op-ed criticizing the United States for not relaxing its sanctions against the DPRK while seeking dialogue with the DPRK, calling it a "self-contradictory" approach.
The article said that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on the 14th that "the key to realizing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is to fulfill sanctions against North Korea", stressing that the United States' position on continuing to implement UN sanctions resolutions remains unchanged.
In the DPRK-U.S. joint statement in Singapore, the two sides pledged to establish a new DPRK-U.S. relationship that is compatible with the aspirations of the DPRK and US peoples for peace and prosperity.
It is undoubtedly contradictory for the United States to increase the pressure of sanctions on the one hand and demand dialogue on the other.
The article says that if we want to establish a new DPRK-U.S. relationship, build a permanent and consolidated peace system on the Korean Peninsula, and realize the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, we should put confidence-building in the first place, start with what can be done, and solve it in stages one by one.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions and suppression will not work for North Korea.
The article says that even the "Severodvinsk" before the "Kazan" amazed the US military.
The National Interest magazine quoted the US Navy as saying: "We will encounter a strong potential adversary. It is enough to look at the submarine 'Severodvinsk'. ”
Fogo, the current commander-in-chief of the US Navy in Europe, also praised the "Severodvinsk" submarine.
He said: "The submarine is impressive. If you look at the development of the Russian Navy and how it uses its resources, you will know that its main efforts in research and development are, first of all, to strengthen the submarine fleet. ”
But The National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this area.
Fogo said: "I believe that Western countries still have an asymmetric advantage. ”
Earlier it was reported that the Russian Navy will equip the submarine "Kazan" in 2019.
The "Kazan", "Novosibirsk", "Krasnoyarsk" and "Arkhangelsk" multipurpose submarines are all "Ash-M" modifications, with a displacement of 13,800 tons, a diving depth of 520 meters, a crew of 64 people, an underwater speed of 31 knots, and will carry mines, torpedoes, and "Caliber" and "Onyx" cruise missiles.

The circular requires that all levels of administrative departments for radio and television should handle all kinds of advertisements that violate laws and regulations discovered during supervision and inspection in strict accordance with the State Administration's "Measures for Handling Violations by Radio and Television Broadcasting Institutions".
Where the circumstances of the violation are serious, they should be given serious punishments such as admonishment talks, circulating criticism, suspending the broadcast of advertisements or even suspending the broadcast of frequency channels, and publicly expose them to the public in light of the circumstances.
In recent years, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television has repeatedly stopped illegal advertisements.
This year, the State Administration of Radio and Television issued a notice to publicly stop advertisements with serious violations such as "0 bubble fruit milk", "sava cocktail" and "Bangruite plant anti-hair loss lotion", which have serious violations such as bias and exaggerated and exaggerated propaganda and misleading audiences.
The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television has formulated a number of regulations and notices to regulate radio and television broadcast advertising.
The "Notice on Further Strengthening the Management of TV Shopping Short Advertisements Broadcast by Satellite TV Channels" stipulates that all satellite TV channels are not allowed to broadcast TV shopping short advertisements from 18 o'clock to 24 o'clock every day.

Manturov said: "For the first time, we have adjusted the format of the MAKS International Aerospace Salon. We propose China as the Guest of Honour. The Chinese counterpart agreed and accepted our invitation. ”
Not long ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the Fourth Eastern Economic Forum at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
This was his first attendance at the forum.
Ignore the US threat!
The EU may reach an agreement with Iran to purchase crude oil
The U.S. government recently announced that it would reimpose a new round of sanctions on Iran in November, and even urged other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
America's allies, however, don't seem to be listening.
According to the New York Times, on the 29th, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif revealed in an interview that Tehran is close to reaching an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil, despite the threat of sanctions from the United States to sanction any country that does business with Iran.
The core purpose of the agreement is to attempt to establish a new payment mechanism that will replace U.S. dollar transactions in barter or local currency.
The purpose of this method is to hopefully bypass the United States and prevent the United States from hindering financial transfers.
At the same time, while the European Union is working to broker the deal, some French and British officials are concerned that if the deal materializes, it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States, which opposes the US withdrawal from the JCPOA.
According to the US media, in an hour-long interview, Zarif sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the deal has the ability to "strip" the traditional allies of the United States, effectively breaking the American side's attempts to cut Iran's revenues.
"This will ensure that we can sell our oil and make a profit," Zarif said, adding that countries have the legal right to trade with Iran under the 2015 agreement.
Federica Mogherini, the head of EU foreign policy, also said a few days ago that "no sovereign country or organization can accept other people to decide with whom they can trade." ”
However, she also predicted that before the U.S. government launches the next step of sanctions in November, U.S. leaders are likely to use a series of financial measures aimed at targeting banks, businessmen and countries that do business with Tehran.
In May, the U.S. government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the JCPOA, citing flaws in the deal, saying that the deal could not permanently ban Iran's production of nuclear fuel.
The U.S. then threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other commodities from doing business in the U.S.
The threat caused some companies to withdraw from Tehran and Iran's currency plummeted.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Total have canceled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said the U.S. government could "gain the upper hand."
Sure enough, according to a recent Turkish media report, the US sanctions do not seem to have had a great impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh recently revealed that no other country except South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani believe that the purpose of the US series of actions is to "entic" Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also dismissive of the U.S. rhetorical attacks, and even laughed when asked if the U.S. would overthrow the current Iranian government with mounting financial pressure, "It's a regime change strategy, and that's what the U.S. really aims." ”
"Revisiting the Fort and Remembering Fanghua": Xiamen Hulishan Fort Cultural Tourism Market opened
At that time, Chen Feifei, the first announcer of Fujian Frontline Radio Station to broadcast Hokkien Mandarin, came to the fort to recall and tell the history of the fort.
The famous tourist scenic spot, Xiamen's Hulishan Fort Scenic Area, which is separated from Kinmen by a water, was once the former place where the Chinese People's Liberation Army set up a "front-line broadcasting station".
On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the establishment and broadcasting of the "Frontline Broadcasting Station", on the 30th, the scenic spot held the activity of "Revisiting the Fort" and invited several historical witnesses of the Frontline Broadcasting Station to talk about the historical changes of the Forts and witness the development and changes of cross-strait relations.

The "Hear the Sound of the Sea" concert has become a major attraction of the Fortress Cultural Tourism Market.
Wang Yong, director of the Hulishan Fort Management Office, said that the "Revisiting the Fort and Reminiscing about Fanghua" activity held to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the opening of the Hulishan Fort Frontline Radio Station of the People's Liberation Army invited several old broadcasters of the Fort to tell the history of the Fort and let people recall the eventful years of the past.
In addition, the series of activities of this tourism market also include the choral concert activities of the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, the selection of old photos, and the 2018 cross-strait "Rabbit Concubine" large-scale single art installation public welfare exhibition.
Among them, the "Hear the Voice of the Sea" concert, as a major attraction of the Fort Cultural Tourism Market, is an exclusive cultural brand activity created by the scenic spot, and invited the Phoenix Flower Women's Choir of the Xiamen Youth Palace to help sing the chorus concert of the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up in the ancient fort surrounded by mountains and seas, showing the collision and integration of "ancient forts" and "new era".
The cross-strait "Rabbit Concubine" large-scale single art installation public welfare exhibition was carried out in the Fort Scenic Area during the National Day, focusing on creating an "eyeball effect", attracting a large number of tourists and citizens to visit, take group photos, forward the circle of friends, and shoot Douyin, so that Xiamen added another "Internet celebrity" factor.
The "Xiamen, 40 Years, You, Me and Him" ― Old Photo Selection Activity will set up an exhibition of award-winning works in the scenic area, and dig deep into those happy and moving moments through a warm photo.

The executive meeting of the State Council of China decided last week to expand the scope of the temporary exemption from withholding tax on foreign reinvestment from encouraged foreign investment projects to all non-prohibited projects and fields, so as to further strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights.
The reporter learned from the National Health Commission that compared with a few decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in China has decreased, but the incidence of overweight and obesity has increased significantly.
Experts pointed out that the most important concept of maintaining a healthy weight is to "cure the disease before it happens", and vigorously promote scientific fitness and reasonable diet.
According to the "Core Information and Interpretation of Health Education for Chinese Adolescents (2018 Edition)" recently released by the National Health Commission, the key to maintaining a healthy weight is a reasonable diet and scientific exercise.
Overweight, obesity, and blind weight loss are all bad for your health.
The health hazards behind the "little chubby dun" cannot be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, director of the Institute of Nutrition and Health of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight and obesity endanger the normal growth and development of adolescents, adversely affect their psychology, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and even lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood lipids in children.
At the same time, overweight and obesity in adolescents tend to continue into adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes in adulthood.
Ding Gangqiang said that the 2010-2012 nutrition and health test of Chinese residents showed that the overweight rate of children and adolescents aged 6-17 in China was 9.6 percent, and the obesity rate was 6.4 percent, and the sum of the two was 16 percent.
At the same time, the overweight and obesity of children and adolescents are higher than that of boys and girls, and that of urban children and adolescents is higher than that of rural areas, and the rate of overweight and obesity has increased significantly in recent decades.
How can adolescents cope with overweight and obesity?
Zhang Li, deputy director of the Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of the General Administration of Sports, pointed out that the main reasons for obesity among adolescents are excessive caloric intake and insufficient physical activity.
For this simple obesity, we should pay attention to scientific exercise and reasonable dietary control.
Zhang Li pointed out that the most important concept of maintaining a healthy weight is to "cure the disease before it happens", and a very important part of it is to carry out all-round science education for schools, parents and students, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity, and improve the awareness of teenagers.
Adolescents should have regular physical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight, and detect and scientifically judge whether overweight and obesity occur as early as possible, so as to take timely interventions.
For adolescents who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gangqiang suggested that in addition to actively and scientifically arranging meals and exercises, adolescents are in a special physiological stage, and should avoid using hunger or semi-starvation therapy to control and lose weight, and must not blindly take weight loss drugs.
Sep 28 (Reuters) - Facebook (FB. O) said Friday that hackers stole digital login codes that gave them access to nearly 50 million user accounts, an unprecedented security breach in its history.
Facebook, which has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, said it had not yet determined whether attackers were abusing any accounts or stealing personal information.
The company also did not find the location of the hackers and was not sure if the hackers targeted specific victims.
Initial analysis suggests that it was a widespread attack.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg called the incident "really serious" in a media conference call.
A spokesman for the company said his account, as well as that of Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, was also affected.
Facebook shares fell 2.6 percent on Friday, dragging down major Wall Street stock indexes.
U.S. lawmakers said Friday that the attack could increase calls for data privacy legislation.
"This is yet another sad piece of evidence that Congress needs to step in to protect the privacy and security of social media users," Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner Rohit Chopra tweeted that I would like to receive an answer to Reuters' coverage of the security breach.

Zhu Jianjun, vice chairman of the Changsha CPPCC and chairman of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, pointed out in his speech that in recent years, the "Care for Anti-Japanese War Veterans" project has provided caring services for Anti-Japanese War veterans through living subsidies, free pensions, free burials and other forms, and has become an excellent brand in the social service work of the Changsha Civil Revolution.
He believes that only by instilling history in our hearts can we pass on the spirit of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.
At 11 o'clock in the morning, in the solemn and heavy music, the people who came to participate in the event stood solemnly.

Yichang, October 1 (China News Service) -- The newly revised "Three Gorges-Gezhouba Water Conservancy Hub Navigation Dispatching Regulations" (hereinafter referred to as the "Scheduling Regulations") was officially implemented on October 1, and the Three Gorges ship lift was officially dispatched with the ship lock after two years of trial navigation.
On the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, the waters of the Three Gorges-Gezhouba were in good order.
The Three Gorges Navigation Administration of the Yangtze River issued the first security inspection plan at 21 o'clock on September 30, and conducted security inspections on 160 ships, and a total of 124 ships passed the security inspection.
At 14 o'clock on October 1, the general aviation department arranged the first gate crossing plan after the implementation of the new regulations.
After the implementation of the new regulations, the security inspection plan will be issued once a day at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., and the dam crossing plan will be released once a day at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. each day, so that ships can flexibly arrange the dam crossing plan.
The "Dispatching Regulations" adds the principle of "classified control" for ship dam crossing scheduling, clarifies the priority order of ships passing through the dam according to the functional positioning of the lock and ship lift, and adjusts the short-line passenger ship passing through the lock to the same priority level as the demonstration ship and the integrity ship.
This is also the second year after the trial operation of the ship lift, and it is officially unified with the lock.
The large-length-wide demonstration ships and new energy powered ships in the Sichuan River and Three Gorges reservoir areas have also been ranked as priority for the first time.
At the same time, the "Dispatching Regulations" adjusted the "navigable dispatching and management waters" from the previous 180 kilometers of near-dam waters to 541.8 kilometers of waters from Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to Shishou Yangtze River Bridge, and divided into "core waters, near-dam waters, controlled waters, and dispatching waters".
This is conducive to the selection of suitable water areas to be locked, and to reduce the backlog of ships waiting for locks in the dam area.
According to the current characteristics of ships crossing the dam and waiting for the lock, the "Dispatching Regulations" also put forward integrity restraint measures such as canceling the declaration of ships that violate the rules and delaying the dam crossing for 24 hours.
After the impoundment of the Three Gorges, the navigation conditions in the reservoir area have been improved, which has promoted the rapid development of shipping on the Yangtze River.
According to the data, the annual cargo throughput of the Three Gorges Locks and Gezhouba Locks increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons in 2017, respectively.
In the two years since the Three Gorges ship lift was put into trial operation, 5,767 ships, 162,200 passengers and 1,712,800 tons of freight have been passed.
Chen Dongyuan, deputy director of the Three Gorges Navigation Administration, said that the "Dispatching Regulations" have a positive effect on promoting the management of honest gate crossing, maintaining the navigation order of the two dam hubs, relieving the pressure of ships waiting for the gate in the dam area, and improving the navigation capacity.

China's composite PMI rose month-on-month in September, and the manufacturing PMI fell month-on-month.
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China on the 30th, in September, China's composite PMI output index was 54.1%, 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points higher than the previous month and annual average, indicating that the production and business activities of Chinese enterprises remained stable overall.
In the same month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which constitute the composite PMI output index, were 53.0% and 54.9% respectively, down and rising month-on-month.
Among them, China's manufacturing PMI was 50.8%, down 0.5 percentage points from the previous month.
Zhao Qinghe said that this month's manufacturing PMI has five main characteristics:
First, the fundamentals of the manufacturing industry are generally stable.
Among the 21 industries surveyed, the PMI of 14 industries is located in the expansion range, of which the PMI of manufacturing industries such as medicine, special equipment, and electrical machinery and equipment are all at a high operating level of more than 53.5%, with a rapid growth rate.
Second, supply and demand fluctuate slightly.
The production index and new orders index were 53.0% and 52.0%, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points respectively from the previous month, and supply and demand continued to maintain a boom state, but the expansion slowed down slightly.
The new export orders index and import index were 48.0 percent and 48.5 percent, respectively 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points lower than the previous month, and the prosperity fell to the low point of the year.
Fourth, the cost of raw material procurement has increased.
The purchase price index of major raw materials was 59.8 percent, up 1.1 percentage points from the previous month, and the ex-factory price index was 54.3 percent, the same as the previous month, both of which were the highest points of the year.

NAGOYA, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday that the central bank is aware that a prolonged ultra-loose monetary policy could squeeze financial institution profit margins and could destabilize the country's banking system.
But he said the BOJ needs to maintain its massive stimulus program while keeping a close eye on the pros and cons of its policies, given low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies.
"The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected by continued monetary easing," Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions were more risk-taking to compensate for years of low interest rate shrinking margins, there was a risk of turmoil in the banking system in the event of a severe negative shock.
"Although these risks are not significant at the moment, the central bank will closely monitor the situation and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures," he said.
The minutes of the BoJ meeting, released earlier on Monday, showed that at the September meeting, the BOJ's policy committee discussed the rising costs of long-term easing.
According to the minutes, one member said that if the economy continues to expand, "the Bank of Japan has more room for policy flexibility in the future." ”
Another member said that the committee should discuss how long the BOJ can maintain its stimulus, given the limits of the duration of the policy, according to the minutes.
Kuroda said the Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks posed by easing policy, while also taking into account the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the Japanese economy, as trade frictions between China and the United States and rising protectionism could affect global demand.
"The impact of such issues on the Japanese economy is limited for the time being," Kuroda said.
"But if the problem continues, the impact on the Japanese economy may become greater," he added.
"There is a need for continued strong monetary easing, while considering the positive and negative effects in a balanced way," Kuroda said.
Despite the growing drawbacks of the aggressive stimulus program, such as the erosion of financial institutions' profits by prolonged low interest rates, low inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the program.
The Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month, and Kuroda ruled out a near-term interest rate hike in the face of risks posed by the global trade war.
June 1, 2018, Cardiff, USA, the corporate logo on Tesla's electric vehicles.
Under a settlement, Tesla Motors and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have agreed to pay a $20 million fine to financial regulators each, and Musk will also step down as chairman of the company but remain as CEO.
The settlement will cap two months of turmoil for Tesla.
The Securities and Exchange Commission's disclosure on Saturday of the settlement of securities fraud allegations will bring investors a sigh of relief.
Investors had feared that the protracted legal battle would only further hit the still loss-making electric car company.
The SEC sued Musk on Thursday for fraud, saying his August 7 tweet misled investors.
The tweet said he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share and had secured financing.
The SEC said the tweets were actually unfounded and that the market turmoil they caused hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the deal could strengthen Tesla, which has been hit hard by Musk's recent behavior.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common Asset Management, said the settlement should put Musk under more scrutiny without taking the "devastating" steps to kick him out of Tesla.
The asset manager holds shares in Panasonic, Tesla's battery maker.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla would have to appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors, and a board committee to establish controls over Musk's communications.
"It is in the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, that this matter is resolved expeditiously and on agreed terms," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday's accusations wiped out about $7 billion from Tesla's market capitalization, which stood at $45.2 billion on Friday, lower than General Motors' $47.5 billion.
In the settlement, the SEC withdrew its request to remove Musk from the company's leadership.
Many investors said the penalty would be catastrophic.
"I think this is the best possible outcome for everyone involved," said Tigress Financial Partners' Ivan Feinseth, who gave Tesla a "neutral" rating and called the SEC's punishment a "lenient punishment" for Musk.
"It's important for Tesla that he's still the CEO. ”
Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement agreement and did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
Beijing Morning News (Reporter Wang Ping) Beijing Morning Post reporter recently learned from Beijing Construction Engineering Group that one of the core buildings of the 2019 Beijing World Horticultural Exhibition Park - - Beijing World Horticultural Exhibition Performing Arts Plaza project will use multi-color ETFE puzzle membrane structure for the first time, 5440 square meters of membrane structure will present dark red, dark green, orange, blue, red, green 6 colors, in the tension of the cable steel strand to present the shape of "butterfly wings".
According to Liu Changbao, the project leader of Beijing Construction Engineering Fifth Construction Group, the construction area of the Performing Arts Plaza project is 4,500 square meters, the total amount of steel installed is 1,182 tons, and the steel structure roof is supported by 26 cantilever steel trusses arranged in the form of umbrellas, showing the shape of "butterfly wings" under the tension of the cable steel strand.
"Looking down at the Performing Arts Plaza from the air, the gorgeous and colorful roofs are like colorful butterflies dancing through flowers, and the bright colors will not fade due to the passage of time, wind, frost, rain and snow."
Previously, the monochrome ETFE membrane structure has been widely used in Bird's Nest, Water Cube and other projects, but the ETFE membrane structure with multi-color puzzles is the first case in China.
The reporter learned that because there are very few suppliers in the world with a variety of color film structure production capacity, every inch of film structure materials are very "precious".
Liu Changbao said that in order to avoid problems such as overlapping and "fighting" at the end of the cable head, the "double-horned" cable head structure will also be innovatively adopted, and the special fixing insert will ensure that the "fighting" cable head is tied in the correct position.
At present, the construction of the 2019 Beijing World Horticultural Expo Park is underway.
Among them, the International Pavilion project has completed the hoisting construction of all "flower umbrellas".
According to the plan, the project will be ready for installation at the end of October.

Expanding imports is not a strategy for equity, but a long-term consideration for the future, and it is expected that in the next 15 years, China's imports of goods and services will exceed US$30 trillion and US$10 trillion, respectively.
Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech at the first China International Import Expo (CIIE), saying that China will further reduce tariffs, accelerate the development of new business formats such as cross-border e-commerce, continue to relax market access, promote the opening up of the service industry, and relax restrictions on foreign ownership in education, medical care and other fields with large gaps in the domestic market.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the symposium on private enterprises, injecting firm confidence into the private economy to a broader stage.
General Secretary Xi Jinping's emphasis on "letting entrepreneurs unload their ideological baggage and move forward lightly" has aroused strong resonance among entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurial spirit.
In the 40 years of reform and opening up, there are thousands of stories of entrepreneurship and innovation of entrepreneurs, and the growth and expansion of entrepreneurs' groups have continuously promoted China's economy to break the waves.
For a period of time, some people in society have made some negative and doubtful remarks about the private economy.
The so-called "theory of the departure of the private economy" and "new public-private partnership" have aroused the doubts and worries of some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in their operation and development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export enterprises, the rapid adjustment of the demand structure has brought pressure on transformation and upgrading, some policies are not coordinated with each other, and the policy effects are superimposed in the same direction, or the way of working is simple, resulting in some policies with good intentions having the opposite effect, and so on.
Various factors are intertwined, the private economy is encountering difficulties, some private enterprises are facing difficulties in their operations, and entrepreneurs have shown a lot of anxiety.
In this context, correcting misunderstandings, unloading the ideological burden of entrepreneurs, allowing enterprises to seek development wholeheartedly, and the government to promote development wholeheartedly are related to market confidence and development expectations, which is of particularly profound practical significance.
At this forum, the important thesis of "three unchanged" was once again emphasized: "The status and role of the non-public economy in China's economic and social development have not changed!"
In recent years, the CPC Central Committee has attached unprecedented importance to entrepreneurs and institutional guarantees, from further promoting the streamlining of administration and delegating powers, establishing a power list system, creating a legal environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, creating a market environment of fair competition, and shaping an atmosphere in which the whole society respects entrepreneurs.
The symposium clearly put forward the policy measures to vigorously support the development and growth of private enterprises in six aspects, and launched a series of pragmatic actions dedicated to the "light forward" of private enterprises.
All these have greatly encouraged the entrepreneur group and given more expectations to all walks of life.
The fog has been lifted, the policy has been decided, and the key lies in implementation.
It is necessary to continuously create a better environment for the development of the private economy, help private enterprises solve difficulties in development, and help realize China's economic transformation and upgrading; we must make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, safe in legal operations, and respected in social life, so as to stimulate innovation vitality and creative potential.
China's economy has entered the process of moving towards high-quality development, which requires more entrepreneurs to display their ambitions, and also provides a greater space and stage for entrepreneurs to display their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with the further deepening of reform and the removal of obstacles, the private economy will usher in better development prospects and development opportunities, and move towards a broader stage.

The export of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China has soared 20 times in 4 years, or it may be related to the increase in empty nest youth-Chinanews.com
Exports of Korean ginseng and chicken soup to China have soared 20 times in 4 years Analysis: It is related to the increase in empty nest youth
Yonhap News Agency reported on the 5th that last year, South Korea's exports of ginseng chicken soup to China exceeded 100,000 US dollars, an increase of about 20 times compared with 2013 four years ago.
According to the analysis, this growth trend is related to the increase in China's empty-nest youth driving the hot sales of convenience foods, as well as the increase in young people's attention to nutritious meals.
The data was released by the Korea Agricultural, Fisheries and Food Distribution Corporation (aT) on the 5th.
Last year, South Korea's ginseng chicken soup exports to China reached US$100,339 and weighed 21,859 kilograms, an increase of 2,094% and 3,668.8% respectively compared with 2013.
According to the analysis, the increase in sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup in China is related to the increase in the number of empty-nest youths driving the hot sales of convenience foods, as well as the increase in young people's attention to nutritious meals.
As of this year, China's one-person households have exceeded the 200 million mark, and it is expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020.
In addition, the analysis also said that avian influenza is the biggest factor preventing ginseng chicken soup from taking root in the Chinese mainland market.
According to the aT, the avian flu outbreak in South Korea from November 2016 to April last year caused the relevant authorities to completely ban the export of ginseng chicken soup to China, resulting in a sharp drop in exports.
In 2016, the export value of ginseng chicken soup to China reached 840,000 US dollars, but last year due to bird flu, the export value plummeted to 100,000 US dollars.

A flag-raising ceremony was held at the Hekou Port on the China-Vietnam border to celebrate the National Day
I never imagined that there would be such a majestic and magnificent flag-raising ceremony on the frontier, which was even more shocking than watching the flag-raising in the mainland. ”
On the morning of the 1st, Mr. Zhang, who came from Sichuan to visit the Hekou Port in Yunnan on the Sino-Vietnamese border, watched the flag-raising ceremony with more than 500 officers and soldiers, local residents, and Chinese and foreign tourists to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Hekou Port is the largest port in Yunnan on the Sino-Vietnamese border, located in Hekou County, Honghe Prefecture, Yunnan Province, across the river from Lao Cai City, Vietnam, and is a national first-class port.
With the deepening of the country's "Belt and Road" construction, as one of the most convenient passages between China and Southeast Asia, the inbound and outbound flow of Hekou Port has grown steadily.
At 7:30 a.m. that day, the sun had just emerged, and the limited area of Hekou Port gathered early to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 7:45, the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the members of the national honor guard at the Hekou border checkpoint were in high spirits and escorted the national flag to the flag-raising platform with vigorous steps.
After the commander gave the flag-raising order, the flag-raiser waved his arms hard to draw an arc, and the bright five-star red flag stretched out the flag like an "eagle spreading its wings", and slowly rose with the passionate and majestic melody of the national anthem.
"Holding the National Day flag-raising ceremony at every New Year's Day, Spring Festival, National Day and other time nodes of great significance not only shows the image of China, but also stimulates the patriotic feelings of the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas. ”
The officers and men of the honor guard who participated in the flag-raising ceremony said.
It has been learned that the national guard of honor responsible for the flag-raising ceremony at the Hekou port is composed of more than 40 officers and men from various posts at the Hekou border inspection station, and this team has experienced a history of more than 60 years, and has carried out more than 70 salutes of state-level foreign affairs activities since its establishment.
The newly revised Individual Income Tax Law adjusts the criteria for determining individual income tax resident taxpayers in China from one year to 183 days.
The relevant person in charge of China's Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation said on the 30th that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for overseas people, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, when implementing the new individual income tax law.
The person in charge said that the current regulations for the implementation of the individual income tax law have special preferential provisions on the tax payment of foreign persons, and individuals who have no domicile in China but have lived in China for more than one year and less than five years can only pay individual income tax on the part paid by units or individuals in China on their income from sources outside China.
The portion paid abroad is not subject to individual income tax in China.
China's Ministry of Finance, State Administration of Taxation, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) have also issued notices to expand the scope of application of the policy of temporarily exempting foreign investors from withholding tax on direct investments with profits distribution.
The scope of application of the policy of temporarily exempting the withholding tax on profits distributed by foreign investors from resident enterprises in China for domestic direct investment has been expanded from foreign investment encouraged projects to all projects and fields that are not prohibited from foreign investment.
During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, some positive messages were released on the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in relayed North Korea's "irreversible" determination to abandon nuclear weapons and said that US President Donald Trump and North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong-un could meet before the end of the year.
The U.S. State Department later said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to advance the implementation of commitments made by the U.S. and North Korean leaders at the Singapore meeting.
Since the beginning of this year, the DPRK and the ROK have broken the ice and started the road of dialogue, the leaders of the DPRK and the ROK and the DPRK and the United States have held meetings, the general trend of easing the situation on the peninsula has continued, and the principle of resolving the peninsula issue through dialogue has also been upheld.
First of all, the essence of the Korean Peninsula issue remains unchanged, and the key to achieving peace on the Korean Peninsula is to properly and balancedly resolve the legitimate security concerns of all parties, rather than blindly putting pressure on the other side and blindly emphasizing one's own demands.
Second, in the dialogue on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the parties concerned still have differences on the steps and ways to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
At the UN Security Council's open meeting on the Korean Peninsula issue held at the UN headquarters in New York a few days ago, the different voices of all sides on the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted that these two points on the Korean Peninsula issue "have not changed."
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted that sanctions against North Korea would not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula was fully denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov emphasized the principle of "action in response to action", stating that "the weakening of sanctions should be synchronized with the steps taken by North Korea on the road to phasing out nuclear weapons."
There is no doubt that all parties concerned should continue to comprehensively, completely and accurately implement the UN Security Council's resolutions on the DPRK, but pressure is not the goal, and the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are both requirements of the Security Council resolutions.
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in the relations between the DPRK and the ROK and the DPRK and the United States, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider initiating the reversible clause at an appropriate time to encourage the DPRK and all parties concerned to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back, every progress in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the peace process requires all parties to show sufficient political courage.
At present, in the face of the increasing expectations of the international community for a political settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue, all parties concerned should show political courage, make political decisions, implement their commitments, resolve difficult problems, continue to take steps in the same direction, and simultaneously advance the process of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and establish a peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula, so as to jointly create permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.
The People's Government of Ji County, Linfen City, Shanxi Province reported on the 1st that during the National Day, the Hukou Waterfall Scenic Area of the Yellow River in the county will maintain a relatively high water level and does not have the conditions for opening.
In order to ensure safety, the scenic spot is temporarily closed during the National Day.
Hukou Waterfall on the Yellow River is the second largest waterfall in China and the largest yellow waterfall in the world.
The Yellow River flows here, the stone walls on both sides of the river stand steeply, and the estuary is as narrow as the mouth of a pot, forming the spirit of "a pot of the Yellow River for a thousand miles".
According to the reporter's understanding, every year from June to October is the Yellow River flood season, starting from July 12, 2018, due to the high water level of the Yellow River, Shanxi Yellow River Hukou Scenic Area began to close one after another, so Hukou Scenic Area has been closed for nearly a month.
Ni Yufeng, chief engineer of the Hukou Scenic Area Management Committee, told the media that this is the longest time in the past 20 years that the high water level of the Yellow River has continued, "It has not been closed for so long before, and in 2017 we closed for 4 days during the flood season, and this year it is nearly a month." ”
It is understood that in order to welcome the "Eleventh" Golden Week, the Hukou Waterfall Scenic Area of the Yellow River in Shanxi Province has also increased personnel arrangements and vehicle maintenance in advance, and even temporary staff employment has been put in place.
According to the "Circular on Doing a Good Job in Flood Prevention and Flood Control Work in the Yellow River during the National Day" issued by the "Ming Chuan Telegram from the Office of the Yellow River Flood Control and Drought Relief General Headquarters," Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, and Shandong provinces are required to do a good job in flood prevention work on the Yellow River during the National Day.
At present, the flow of the main stream of the Yellow River is relatively large, with the flow of the upper reaches of the river being maintained at 2,000-3,000 cubic meters per second, the flow of the middle reaches of the river being maintained at 2,500-3,500 cubic meters per second, and the flow of the lower reaches of the river being maintained at the order of 3,000 cubic meters per second.
Influenza vaccination services are provided at health centres and health posts during the National Day holiday
The Health Bureau has ordered 150,000 doses of quadrivalent influenza vaccine for 2018-2019 this year, and priority is given to high-risk groups for free vaccination at this stage.
In addition to the above-mentioned facilitation measures, the influenza vaccination service hours of all health centres and health stations under the Health Bureau have been extended to 8pm from Monday to Friday since the launch of the programme, and as of 4pm on 30 September, 4,158 people have been vaccinated, compared with more than 3,714 in the same period last year.
The free vaccination targets include the following Macao residents: 6 months to under 18 years old, people aged 50 and above, pregnant women, all people with chronic diseases, including obese people (i.e. those with a body mass index (BMI of 30 or above), as well as staff in residential care homes, nurseries, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, all health workers, and Macao residents working in gaming and casinos.
At the same time, for other persons deemed necessary by the Health Bureau, including the public sector, the Health Bureau will take the initiative to contact the relevant institutions to obtain the list and the Health Centre will arrange vaccination after the Health Bureau deems it necessary.
In order to facilitate the vaccinated and shorten the waiting time for vaccination, the Health Bureau will send medical staff to secondary schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries in Macao from October to December this year to conduct influenza vaccination for young children, primary and secondary school students, teachers and staff.
Students and children who are unable to participate in the group vaccination can bring their Macao Resident Identity Card, Health Bureau User Card, Influenza Vaccination Card (if any), student card, employee ID card or occupation certificate to the vaccination station or health centre of Conde de de Januário General Hospital from 3 December 2018.
The Health Bureau reminds residents that those who have received influenza vaccine from September 2017 to August 2018 are still required to receive the new season of influenza vaccine from September 2018 onwards as the influenza antigen composition of the 2018-2019 Northern Hemisphere Influenza Vaccine has been updated to target the 2018-2019 winter and summer 2019 seasonal influenza in the Northern Hemisphere.
The peak of influenza in Macao generally occurs from January to March each year, which is later than that in temperate regions (such as northern China and Japan), and the Health Bureau appeals to the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese people and chronic patients, who are more likely to develop complications after influenza infection, as well as those who are in frequent contact with high-risk groups, to get vaccinated as soon as possible.

Hundreds of people gathered at the beach to celebrate the holiday when the waves hit the shore on Friday evening, and many were swept away by the waves, destroying everything in their path.
TOKYO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Confidence among Japan's large manufacturers hit its lowest level in more than a year in the September quarter, according to the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan survey report released on Monday, as companies were under pressure from rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affecting production.
The survey shows little that escalating global trade frictions have undermined the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-blown trade war has hit companies' business prospects and could threaten corporate capital expenditures.
Buoyant capital spending is a bright spot in the Japanese economy.
The survey calls into question the BOJ's view that a solid economic expansion will help accelerate inflation to its 2% target, despite signs that businesses are gradually passing costs on to customers.
"Amid concerns about the global trade war, manufacturing confidence has stalled due to slowing exports and weak factory production," said Nam Wuzhi, chief researcher at the China Finance Research Institute.
"Confidence is still high. And with corporate earnings improving and prices rising, I don't think confidence will continue to decline. ”
According to the Tankan survey, the large-scale manufacturing sentiment index fell to positive 19 in September from positive 21 three months ago, marking the third consecutive quarter of deterioration.
The median estimate for the market is positive 22.
The large non-manufacturing sentiment index fell to positive 22 in September from positive 24 in the June survey, deteriorating for the first time in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey was positive 22.
According to the survey, the large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing prosperity judgment index is expected to remain stable in December.
Investors are not concerned about the decline in the Tankan Corporate Sentiment Judgment Index, and the Nikkei Stock Index. N225 rose to a 27-year high on Monday as the yen's continued depreciation helped improve the outlook for Japanese companies' export earnings.
Solid capital expenditures.
Despite the decline in business confidence, the latest Tankan highlights the robustness of corporate capital expenditure plans, helped by renewing production capacity and increasing investment in robotics and automation to cope with labour shortages due to an aging population.
According to the central bank's Tankan survey, large companies plan to increase capital spending by 13.4% in the current fiscal year ending March 2019.
In the previous tankan survey, it was 13.6%.
Minami said that the capital expenditure of all companies is planned to increase by 8.5% this fiscal year, which is close to the pace of Japan's bubble economy era.
"There is still room for further growth in capital spending, given that small businesses have raised their profit estimates from now on, but much will depend on the impact of the trade war on business confidence," he said. ”
The Tankan survey showed a stronger ability for companies to pass on costs, and the output price index of large companies came in at positive 7, a decade-high high, which is an encouraging sign that Japan has made progress in its efforts to combat deflation.
The index, which measures employment conditions in large firms, hit minus 23, the tightest level since 1992, highlighting a tighter job market.
Japan's economy rebounded in the second quarter from the contraction in January-March this year, benefiting from strong business spending.
But the escalation of trade frictions over the summer and supply chain disruptions have clouded the outlook for Japan's export-dependent economy.
In dollar terms, the growth rate of imports and exports of services was 16.4 percent.
According to a press release on the website of the Ministry of Commerce, the total import and export volume of emerging services exceeded 1 trillion yuan from January to August, a faster growth rate than the overall.
Among them, the total import and export value of emerging services was 1,138.39 billion yuan, up by 20.9 percent, 10.4 percentage points higher than the overall growth rate of import and export of services, and the proportion of emerging services increased by nearly 3 percentage points.
In terms of service exports, from January to August, service exports continued the rapid growth momentum since the beginning of this year, and the export growth rate was 5.7 percentage points higher than the import growth rate.
Among them, the top three growth areas are telecommunications, computer and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, and insurance services, with growth rates of 61.1%, 38.8%, and 26.5% respectively.
The person in charge of the Department of Trade in Services also pointed out that the proportion of imports of emerging services from January to August also gradually increased.
From January to August, imports of emerging services grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6 percent of service imports, an increase of 1.6 percentage points over the same period last year.
Among them, the growth rate of imports of financial services, intellectual property royalties, telecommunications, computer and information services all exceeded 20 percent, 47.1 percent, 23.3 percent and 23.2 percent respectively.

The 69th International Astronautical Congress opened in Germany-Chinanews.com
Bremen, Germany, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The 69th International Astronautical Congress kicked off on October 1 at the Bremen Exhibition Center in Germany, attended by more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and enterprises, experts, scholars and young students from all over the world.
In his speech at the opening ceremony, Jean-Yves Le Gar, President of the International Astronautical Federation, said that the global space industry is no longer only a few countries and institutions participating, and the significant increase in the number of participants this year compared with the previous one shows that more and more institutions and people are joining it.
He called on all countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation and jointly promote the development of the space industry.
Zhang Kejian, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China and Director of the China National Space Administration, introduced China's space program at the exchange event and said that China will expand international cooperation in the field of space and contribute to the space industry of mankind.
Representatives of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation and other relevant institutions, as well as some private enterprises, attended the meeting and demonstrated the latest achievements of China's aerospace, including various types of carrier rockets, satellites and aerospace science and technology application products.
The International Astronautical Congress has been held annually since 1950 and is the largest event in the world's aviation community.
The five-day conference was co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Centre for Applied Science and Microgravity Research at the University of Bremen, and the International Institute of Space Law.
BEIJING, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The Canton Fair showed that China's foreign trade situation remains complex and severe, with 80.6 percent of companies expecting exports for the full year of 2018 to be better or flat than the previous year, the Canton Trade Center said in a press release on Sunday.
However, considering the continuous rise in the cost of domestic raw materials, labor and other comprehensive factors, and the increasing impact of Sino-US trade frictions, exhibitors also believe that next year's export situation is not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, deputy secretary-general and spokesman of the Canton Fair and deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions at the Canton Fair decreased slightly year-on-year.
There were 189,812 buyers from 215 countries and regions, a year-on-year decrease of 1.11%.
Exports amounted to RMB206.494 billion (US$29.86 billion), down 1% year-on-year.
From the perspective of the market, the transactions of Japan, the 10 ASEAN countries, the "BRIC countries" and South Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, and the traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively.
From the perspective of industries, transportation vehicles, machinery and equipment, construction and decoration materials, consumer electronics and information products, and sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1%, and 7.6% respectively, while textiles and garments, and household appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer and weather vane of China's foreign trade, the situation of buyers participating in the Canton Fair and the export transaction data show that the development of China's foreign trade will still face many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the deepening of supply-side structural reform, as well as the recent introduction of national and local policies and measures such as "six stability", the new momentum of China's foreign trade development is accumulating at an accelerated pace, and new progress has been made in the diversification of enterprise markets, which are important foundations and strong conditions for the development of foreign trade.
"Considering all factors, it is expected that China's foreign trade import and export will maintain steady growth throughout the year, and the quality and efficiency will be further improved. Xu Bing said.
The General Administration of Customs of China announced that exports in US dollar terms in September increased by 14.5% year-on-year, imports increased by 14.3% year-on-year, and the trade surplus in September was 31.69 billion US dollars, and the export growth rate and trade surplus in September were the highest since February this year.
Despite the escalating trade frictions between China and the United States, China's export performance in September still exceeded expectations significantly, strong foreign demand, enterprises rushed to export before the United States imposed tariffs and the depreciation of the RMB exchange rate, or the main supporting factors, but to a certain extent, it also shows the resilience of China's foreign trade, but the Sino-US trade war on confidence and the impact on the industrial chain should not be underestimated, analysts believe that the challenge of China's foreign trade may appear in the fourth quarter or next year.
U.S. fund managers recommended increasing cash holdings in September and continued to maintain a cautious stance as the U.S. and China began the latest round of reciprocal import tariffs and the dispute shows no signs of easing, according to a Reuters poll.
However, according to the recommendations of 12 fund managers who participated in the survey, asset allocation in North America increased to the highest level since June 2017, while holdings in the United Kingdom, the euro area and especially emerging markets declined.
The global allocation to equities averaged 56.6% and bonds at 35.5%, largely in line with last month's survey.
The most noticeable change was that the cash allocation rose to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager from a large fund house said, "Some economic data has brought confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so it's best to be prepared to enter when the market pulls back." ”
But fund managers still preferred equities, especially US equities, in September, even though US equities were perceived to be on the high side.
Today, in Shanghai, China's open landmark, the world's first large-scale national exhibition with the theme of import, the China International Import Expo, officially kicked off in great anticipation.
An exhibition is like a "window" that allows the world to better understand a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the Expo, people can see the "open China" moving towards a higher level; With the help of the "window" of the CIIE, we welcome the world to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results with China, which is "reforming and opening up again".
"For a country, opening up is like breaking out of a cocoon into a butterfly, although it will experience temporary pain, but it will be exchanged for a new life. ”
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of the road to opening up shows an important reason for "why China can".
Looking back on the 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which dares to plunge into the vast ocean of the world market, has always faced all risks and challenges with an open attitude, although it has encountered whirlpools and storms, and has continuously released endogenous power and continuously improved its competitiveness.
It can be said that China's solid achievements have effectively demonstrated the value and significance of opening up.
Standing at a new historical starting point, holding the expo with the theme of import is a major decision made by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core to promote a new round of high-level opening up, a major measure for China to take the initiative to open its market to the world, and a practical action for China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization, demonstrating a strong and clear willingness that "China's door to opening up will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider".
The enthusiastic registration of exhibitors from all over the world and the "hard to find" booth are the greatest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a wider range, wider fields and deeper levels.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have built a high wall of trade protectionism and retreated to the old path of unilateralism, which has increased the international community's worries about the prospects of free trade and added many uncertainties to the world economy, which is picking up.
Against this backdrop, this event on the banks of the Huangpu River reflects China's defense of free trade, and allows the world to see China's self-confidence and responsibility to open its market and share its future.
Go fast alone, go far together.
China's open-mindedness and embrace of the world have not only effectively promoted its own development, but also brought surging "Chinese opportunities" to countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, he has advocated and promoted the joint construction of the "Belt and Road", initiated the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and established the Silk Road Fund. China has provided a series of international public goods, providing real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, allowing enterprises from all countries to take the "fast train" and "free ride" of China's development.
The CIIE is also such a public good and a large platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 companies from more than 130 countries and regions have made their debut with their own high-quality products and services, taking a new step in the Chinese market.
In addition to enterprises in various countries, domestic consumers are also the ones who really benefit.
By building this platform of "optimal selection", it provides multi-channel high-quality supply for consumption upgrading and meets the personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs of the people.
As China's door opens wider and wider, goods flow smoothly and materials are used to the fullest, and the pace towards a better life will be more solid.
From a more macro perspective, the significance of the CIIE has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade, but focuses on the future, conveys the concept of openness, inclusiveness, inclusiveness, balance and win-win, and forms a consensus to jointly address today's challenges.
Only when the world is good can China be better, and only when China is good can the world be better.
We look forward to bringing excitement and success to the world at the CIIE, and we look forward to a glorious future where we will move towards a higher-level "Open China" and join hands with the world to build a community with a shared future for mankind.
Foreign media: The United States and Canada reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement includes Canada's opening of its dairy market to the U.S. and the temporary abolition of tariffs by the U.S. on vehicles produced in Canada.
According to foreign media reports, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of September 30 local time that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Earlier, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said that Canada would only sign favorable agreements, "with a focus on substance, not timelines." We will continue to negotiate an agreement that is in Canada's national interest. ”
More than nine out of ten Brazilian female voters say presidential candidates do not consider women's needs.
According to the South American Overseas Chinese News Network, data recently released by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) shows that more than 90% of Brazilian women do not believe that the needs of women are considered by presidential candidates.
At present, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million, and if all Brazilian women were gathered to form a country, the country would rank 13th in the world in terms of population, more than twice the population of Spain.
In Brazil, women make up 52 percent of the electorate, while men make up 48 percent, and although women make up a very high percentage of the electorate, only 10 percent of Brazil's Congress is women.
Out of 193 countries in the world, Brazil ranks only 154th in terms of women's participation in politics, higher than Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of power struggles, Brazilian women still haven't succeeded in gaining their rights.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori argues that the reason for this phenomenon is the result of a combination of ancient patriarchal societies, racism and capitalist values.
"Politics is supposed to be a society in which citizens claim civil rights, identity, access to public goods, and are made up of multiple social groups. But Brazilian politics is monopolized by one group, and the majority of the population is not represented. ”
A previous study conducted by the Brazilian Locomotive Research Institute (Locomotiva) also pointed out that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that elected politicians represent their rights, 90% of Brazilian women do not agree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93% do not agree with the current government's governance policies.
"We need to reverse the underrepresentation of women in parliament, and Brazil's political system is still affected by inequality. To this day, there is still a high level of gender, class and racial discrimination in the Brazilian political sphere. Natalia Mori said.
Despite women's lack of rights, the majority of Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
According to the survey, 76 per cent of women believe they can make a difference in democratic elections, and 72 per cent are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to expose women to less bias.
Astana, October 1 (Reporter Wen Longjie) The Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn flag-raising ceremony on October 1 to welcome the 69th birthday of the People's Republic of China.
More than 80 people attended the event, including all staff members of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, representatives of news agencies in Kazakhstan, financial institutions, Chinese-funded enterprises, overseas Chinese, Confucius Institutes and international students.
On October 1, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a flag-raising ceremony to welcome the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
After the flag-raising ceremony, Chinese Ambassador to Kazakhstan Zhang Xiao said that on the occasion of the 69th birthday of the great motherland, we held a grand flag-raising ceremony in a foreign country, which was a profound patriotic education activity.
Although you have been living overseas for a long time, you are always concerned about the great motherland.
Zhang Xiao said: Today, the Chinese nation is closer than ever to realizing the great goal of national rejuvenation and to the center of the world stage.
"Our mission, responsibilities and work are more honorable, arduous and onerous than ever. ”
Zhang Xiao stressed that we must not forget our original intention, keep our mission in mind, promote the steady and far-reaching development of the "Belt and Road" between China and Kazakhstan, draw a more beautiful "Belt and Road" and "fine strokes", and contribute all our strength to the development and construction of the motherland and the friendly cooperation between China and Kazakhstan.
The T2 terminal of Guangxi Guilin Liangjiang International Airport was officially opened on the 30th.
Zhao Leqin, secretary of the Guilin Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that after the opening of the new terminal, it can meet the annual passenger throughput demand of 12 million passengers, build a new advantage of Guilin's air traffic, and further improve the "four-in-one" modern three-dimensional transportation pattern of Guangxi's river-sea linkage, sea-rail intermodal transport, water and land parallel, and airport connection.
This year, Guilin is expected to receive more than 90 million tourists.
The expansion project of the T2 terminal and apron supporting facilities of Guilin Liangjiang International Airport is a major public welfare project for the 60th anniversary of the founding of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and a landmark project for the construction of Guilin International Tourist Resort.
The project started in December 2015, with a construction area of 100,000 square meters and a total investment of 3.258 billion yuan, which can meet the needs of 12 million passengers per year, 101,200 take-offs and landings, and 95,000 tons of cargo and mail throughput.
On the same day, more than 200 flights took off and landed at the T2 terminal of Guilin Liangjiang International Airport.
The design of the new terminal is inspired by Guilin's landscapes, which looks like a "landscape laurel" from a distance, and looks like the scenic scenery of "Longji Terraces" and the cascading eaves of Guibei's houses, which complement each other with Guilin's landscapes.
According to reports, the new terminal of Guilin Airport can meet the peak flow of nearly 4,000 people entering and leaving the port per hour, and the application of intelligent baggage sorting system, security integration platform, face recognition and other "smart airport" technical means, planning a commercial area covering catering, department stores, duty-free and leisure and entertainment and other formats.
With growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets largely unencouraging, the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine of global economic growth.
A container ship is berthed in a port in New Jersey, U.S., September 23, 2018.
But the U.S. economy is also under scrutiny because of the time that the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts has bought time, so the economy is also under scrutiny.
"As the U.S. is returning to full employment, a downturn in the economy is inevitable. ”
The only question, he said, is when it will happen, and in his opinion, it may only be in advance and not postponed.
While Barclays is optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy until the end of the year, the bank acknowledges that it is more difficult to make predictions for a longer timeframe.
"In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost growth potential, current growth stimulated by fiscal policy will be unsustainable," Barclays economists said in a research note.
"The risk of a hard landing in 2020 will rise amid a lack of investment growth," they said.
A series of business surveys will give a rough picture of the economic cycle in the major economies at the end of the third quarter.
The Eurozone and US manufacturing surveys, scheduled for next Monday, will be watched, and the services survey will be released on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week's data will inevitably be on the US non-farm payrolls, which will be released next Friday, which will provide clues as to whether the tight job market is driving significant wage growth.
This is important not only because it is important for the profitability of businesses and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because a jump in wages could trigger a rise in headline inflation, which could make US Federal Reserve officials uneasy.
"Wages will be in the spotlight as there is likely to be another sharp increase from the previous month.
The year-on-year increase in September may not exceed 3%, but we can fully expect it to break through next month," ING economists wrote in a research note.
European politics could be a source of market volatility at a time when holidays in China and the rest of Asia are leading to thin data in the region next week.
The Italian government has ignored previous financial commitments to the EU, and the rest of the EU member states will have to quickly decide whether to firmly oppose Italy's decision. Tria did not support the decision, he wanted to abide by EU rules.
As Brexit negotiations enter a critical phase, the Conservative Party's annual meeting in Birmingham is likely to be sparkling as well.
At the same time, with Brazil's highly anticipated presidential election set to take place next weekend, concerns surrounding emerging markets are unlikely to abate.
Chen Zhi, director of the Observation Division of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship will be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global ocean observation.
On September 29, China's first 3,000-ton large buoy ship "Xiangyanghong 22" was launched by China Wuchuan Group.
After the completion of the ship, it will break the current equipment bottleneck in China's support work such as large-scale buoys and submersible markers, recycling, and emergency repair.
The "Xiangyanghong 22" ship is mainly used for regular inspection and maintenance, regular deployment and recovery of buoys/submersibles, emergency deployment, recovery and repair of buoys/submersibles, and has the ability to perform comprehensive marine survey tasks such as cross-sectional surveys.
The new ship has a total length of 89 meters, a width of 18 meters, a depth of 7.2 meters, and a cruising range of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Weiling, deputy general manager of Wuchuan Group, said: "Xiangyanghong 22 is China's first large-scale buoy operation ship and the only domestic ship with the ability to lift 10-meter large-scale buoys, which will further enhance China's large-scale buoy support capacity. ”
It is understood that the ship will be handed over to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration after completion, Chen Zhi, director of the observation division of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship will be put into use, will be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system, and promote global ocean observation.
"This ship also has large-scale buoy deployment and maintenance operations, and also has the ability of comprehensive marine survey, and is the first comprehensive ship in China specially used for medium and distant sea buoy operations and marine comprehensive survey.
With such buoy vessels, we will have a powerful tool for ocean observation and ocean survey in the future. ”
Qingdao, October 1 (Chinanews.com) -- Affected by Typhoon "Tanmei", the 2018 International Extreme Sailing Series Qingdao Station "Mazerun Cup", which was originally scheduled to start on September 30, postponed the first competition day to October 1, and held a pre-race meeting at the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center before the race, and the captains of 12 hydrofoil catamaran teams from 6 countries and regions all appeared.
Affected by Typhoon "Tanmei", strong winds continued in the harbor, with a maximum wind speed of up to 24 knots, and the departure signal was postponed for nearly 90 minutes from 1 pm on the 30th, and the wind speed still did not decrease, and the chief referee of the event Anne Mundrant announced the cancellation of the first day of the game and postponed the game to the afternoon of October 1.
"The strong winds blowing from the shore continued, and the sea conditions were really violent. ”
Mundrant explains: "In such a situation, no one knows when and with what kind of gusts of wind will blow towards the boat.
With the proximity to the city's venues, canceling the race is the wisest option given the current wind conditions. ”
The crew who were all ready to go was still a little disappointed.
"The boat is ready to stop and we are in good shape. ”
Qingdao helmsman Max Richardson admitted: "But I know it was the right thing to do, and hopefully the wind will be a little less here today and we can show what we can do." ”
Omica Wilkinson, who has been hailed as the "hopeful" of the New Zealand team at Tokyo 2020, said: "Losing a day makes the game even more interesting.
Because the weight of today's game will increase, and there are only two days left.
Everyone will definitely work hard. ”
Despite the strong winds, Pierre Eavis Durand, the helmsman of the French ABM team, appealed at the pre-race meeting about his warm past with Qingdao, where the race was held: he was injured in an accident in the International Extreme Sailing Series five years ago, and his muscles were broken, thanks to the treatment of the local event medical team, he can still stand on the competition venue five years later.
It is reported that the International Extreme Sailing Series was founded in 2007 and is a World Sailing League event with Volvo, America's Cup, World Sailing Confrontation Tour and other events.
The Qingdao race will use the "Flying Ghost" hydrofoil catamaran (FlyingPhantom).
2018 is the 8th year that the event has landed in Qingdao, the "capital of sailing", and Qingdao is also the final battle of the series.
Despite the ongoing volatility in global financial markets, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the Exchange Fund's investment income in the third quarter of this year fell by 97% year-on-year, but it was better than the previous quarter, as overseas stocks rose amid the trade war between China and the United States, and foreign exchange losses narrowed significantly.
According to the latest data from the HKMA, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$1.6 billion in July-September 2018, significantly lower than the HK$61.8 billion recorded in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Mr Norman Chan, Chief Executive of the HKMA, said in the Legislative Council that at the beginning of the US-China trade war, Hong Kong and emerging market equity indices diverged from US stock indices, and it was not until late September and early October that market sentiment began to reverse after US stock market indices peaked one after another, as investors gradually realized that the trade war was also negative for the US itself.
"It's good that there is a change in market sentiment, and if the trade war only has a one-sided effect, it will not help to solve the problem. ”
But he also pointed out that "if the US-China trade war is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise." ”
In the third quarter of this year, the Exchange Fund's loss on equity investments in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% from the previous quarter to HK$4.7 billion, while gains on overseas equities surged by 172% to HK$12.8 billion, while foreign exchange losses of HK$16.2 billion and bond gains of HK$9.7 billion decreased by 24% and 31% respectively quarter-on-quarter, mainly reflecting the general increase in the US dollar against major currencies during the quarter and the rise in US yields above the 3% level in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund is primarily used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Since 1983, Hong Kong has implemented a linked exchange rate system pegged to the US dollar between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar.
Regarding the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Norman Chan said that the uncertainty of the economy and asset markets has increased, and the downside risks have increased, but Hong Kong's financial system is stable, and it is also well defensive, and has sufficient earthquake resistance.
"Hong Kong has a strong international investment position, with a net external value of US$1.4 trillion equivalent to four times GDP, higher than Singapore's 2.5 times and Japan's 0.6 times, and is more than adequate to cope with an economic downturn or reversal. ”
Norman Chan pointed out that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate rose by more than 400 basis points on September 21, and the market generally believes that it is mainly related to the rise in the Hong Kong dollar interbank rate, and then the Hong Kong dollar hovered around 7.80-7.84 against the US dollar.
However, he believes that with the start of the interest rate hike cycle of Hong Kong banks and the normalization of Hong Kong dollar interest rates, the situation that Hong Kong dollar interest rates are lower than US dollar interest rates will change in the future.
"As Hong Kong dollar interest rates and US dollar interest rates move more in tandem, we must be more careful in managing risks and being prepared for market volatility. ”
The three-month interbank rate fell 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, widening its spread with the US dollar from 46 basis points to 51 basis points, while the one-month interbank rate hit a five-month low and widened from 120 basis points to 127 basis points with the US dollar.
From May to mid-September, the spot exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar was close to 7.85 per US dollar for most of the time.
During the period, due to factors such as carry activities and the outflow of part of the proceeds from the IPO after the completion of the large-scale IPO activities, the weak-side CU was triggered several times in May and August, following the first triggering in April.
The HKMA buys Hong Kong dollars and sells US dollars at the level of 7.85 under the Linked Exchange Rate System to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
In May and August, the HKMA bought about HK$52.1 billion under the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking Regime.
Are there any preferential treatments for foreigners under the new IIT Law?
The relevant responsible persons of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation said in response to reporters' questions on the 30th that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, when implementing the new individual income tax law.
A reporter asked, the newly revised individual income tax law will adjust the criteria for determining individual income tax resident taxpayers in China from one year to 183 days.
In the next step, when the law is implemented, will there be any preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan?
The person in charge responded that the current regulations for the implementation of the individual income tax law have special preferential provisions on the tax payment of foreigners, and individuals who have no domicile in China but have resided for more than one year and less than five years can only pay individual income tax on the income derived from outside China.
The person in charge said that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for overseas persons, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, when implementing the new individual income tax law.
There is no "threshold" for confinement centers: quality certification promotes quality improvement.
With the pull of the "two-child economy" and the prosperity of the maternal and infant market, from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to third- and fourth-tier cities, various grades of confinement clubs have emerged in various places.
At present, the very popular confinement club meets the consumption needs of the masses, and the fees range from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan, but at the same time, it is also in an embarrassing situation.
The State Administration for Market Regulation recently launched a series of activities for the 2018 National "Quality Month", and the reporter came to a five-star confinement center in Tianjin to visit the certification experience of maternal and child care services.
The general confinement center provides newborn care, nutritious meals, postpartum repair and shaping services.
In this confinement center, the reporter saw that nurses checked the breastfeeding of newborns every day, and professional nurses provided fine care services such as bathing and touching for newborns.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, from wound care at the beginning of confinement to body care in the middle and late stages of confinement, we provide traditional Chinese medicine treatment and beauty care and other care items to help mothers restore their slender figure.
A new mother who is staying in the house told reporters that she booked this confinement club 8 months in advance.
The service items of the confinement club directly affect the comfort level and physical recovery of the mother during the confinement period, and some small-scale confinement clubs can only provide some simple confinement services, which have hidden dangers such as non-standard disinfection and hygiene, easy cross-infection, and unscientific diet.
The person in charge of this confinement center said that they are the only one among all the five-star confinement centers in Tianjin that has obtained B-level service certification.
"Although some customers do not understand the meaning of B-level certification at first, it is of great significance to the long-term development of enterprises to benefit customers by forcing enterprises to strictly standardize process management through certification. He said.
Pan Lifen, deputy director of the Certification and Supervision Department of the State Administration for Market Regulation, said that service certification is a new type of certification system based on customer perception and attention to the satisfaction of organizational quality management and service characteristics, which is an important part of the national quality infrastructure and has a positive effect on improving the proportion of high-quality service supply and enhancing the international competitiveness of China's services.
Starting in 2004, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has experienced a process of gradual development from scratch, and a number of influential service certifications have emerged, such as financial service certification, maternal and child care service certification, commodity after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification, health care service certification, etc.
According to the statistics of the State Administration for Market Regulation, there are currently more than 130 service certification bodies in China, more than 2,000 service certification personnel, and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.
Pan Lifen said that it is necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually expand the coverage of service certification in the fields of health, education, sports, finance, and e-commerce, and promote the supply-side reform and quality improvement of the service industry.
HONG KONG, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Hong Kong property prices have fallen for two consecutive months after peaking, and Norman Chan, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on Monday that it is still necessary to observe whether the property market has entered a downward cycle, and if confirmed, it can consider gradually easing the tightening of countercyclical measures at an appropriate time.
Norman Chan also pointed out that if property prices rebound, the first people who will be affected will be those who buy homes at the peak of the property market, but it is expected that there will be a sharp drop in property prices such as the Asian financial crisis in 1997, and the chances of people slashing prices and selling properties are much lower.
Speaking at a briefing at the Legislative Council, Norman Chan led a number of senior HKMA executives to say that if it is confirmed that the property market has entered a downward cycle, the measures can be relaxed in due course.
"But now we only see a few weeks of data, it is still too early to relax, and we still need more time to see if the property market has entered a downward cycle. ”
Since October 2009, the HKMA has introduced eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to significantly tighten mortgages for various types of properties, including lowering the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) ratio and requiring mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests, with a view to enhancing banks' risk management and resilience to earthquakes.
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest rate hike cycle, the private residential property price index in Hong Kong peaked and fell for two consecutive months in August-September, and the month-on-month decline in September widened to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative growth rate in the first three quarters of this year still reached 10.2%.
In the second quarter of this year, the ratio of unsecured owner-occupied households in Hong Kong reached 66%, higher than the average of 60% in 2009-11, and the average loan-to-value ratio and loan-to-income ratio of new mortgages were 47% and 34% respectively, a significant improvement from 64% and 41% respectively in 2009-11.
However, Mr Chan said that high earthquake resilience does not mean that people who have already purchased homes will not be harmed by the economic downturn, as property valuations will fall, and those who buy properties during peak periods will bear the brunt.
While the HKMA has tightened bank lending to mortgage lenders, homebuyers can also obtain high-percentage mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Mr Chan said that at present, together with the mortgage loans provided to developers, the loan-to-value ratio of borrowers can reach 85-90%, and if the property price falls by 10%, there will be negative equity (i.e. the market value of the property falls below the total outstanding mortgage loan).
However, the Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Victor Yuen, pointed out that the total amount of mortgages estimated by developers to be in high percentage of mortgages accounted for only 2-2.5% of the total number of bank mortgages, which is still low.
At the peak of negative equity in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative equity cases exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of the total number of property buyers.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong has recorded zero negative equity for seven consecutive quarters.

Third, the export goods do not belong to the goods that the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation have expressly cancelled the export tax refund (exemption) in accordance with the decision of the State Council.
The notice clarifies that the General Administration of Customs regularly transmits the electronic information of the e-commerce export commodity declaration list to the State Administration of Taxation.
The tax authorities in the comprehensive pilot zone shall strengthen the tax exemption management of export goods according to the electronic information of the export commodity declaration list cleared by the State Administration of Taxation.
The circular pointed out that the specific tax exemption management measures shall be formulated by the provincial-level taxation departments in consultation with the financial and commercial departments.
The Office of the Leading Group for the Construction of the Comprehensive Pilot Zone and the competent department of commerce shall coordinate and promote the communication and cooperation between departments and the implementation of relevant policies, accelerate the establishment of a statistical monitoring system for e-commerce exports, and promote the healthy and rapid development of cross-border e-commerce.
Ordos, November 5 (Zhang Linhu) Due to disagreements over the distribution of money, a man in Liaoning Province actually killed his lover and threw his body, and then absconded to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
On the 5th, the reporter learned from the Public Security Bureau of Dongsheng District, Ordos City, Inner Mongolia, that after a joint investigation by the police of the two places, the man was successfully arrested.
On June 26, 2018, a woman disappeared in Anshan City, Liaoning Province, and her family reported it to the local police.
After the police investigation and judgment, this is not a simple case of missing persons, the missing person Bai is very likely to be killed by his lover Wang, and the police immediately set up a special team for further investigation.
On October 30, the task force found that the criminal suspect Wang might be hiding in Dongsheng District, Ordos City, and the Dongsheng police immediately organized capable police forces to fully cooperate with the Liaoning police to solve the case.
After 5 days of investigation, the police finally figured out Wang's whereabouts and sorted out his related persons in detail.
On November 4, the police of the two places worked together to arrest the criminal suspect Wang in an excavator parts store in Dongsheng District.
According to Wang's confession, he and the victim Bai were lovers, and because Bai's sister had a large amount of money temporarily stored in Bai's name, the two decided to take the money for themselves.
On June 22, 2018, Wang and Bai had a disagreement over the use of the funds, and Wang then killed Bai in a rental house, decomposed the body and threw it away.
At present, the criminal suspect Wang has been handed over to the Anshan police in Liaoning.

Chinanews.com, Shenzhen, October 1 (Zheng Xiaohong, Xu Dianwei, Liu Shumeng) October 1 is the first day of the mainland's National Day "Golden Week", and it is also the last day of Hong Kong's National Day public holiday.
According to the data provided by the Shenzhen Border Inspection Station, as of 16 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, the number of people entering and exiting the Shenzhen port reached more than 429,000, and the number of transportation vehicles reached more than 16,800 (ships, racks, and trains).
It is understood that due to many favorable factors such as the increase in the number of countries providing visa-free policies for Chinese citizens, the number of tourists who take advantage of the National Day holiday to go to Europe and Southeast Asia for vacation and shopping continues to increase.
Early in the morning of the 1st, the outbound direction of Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Huanggang, Futian and other ports ushered in the peak of passenger (vehicle) flow, of which the peak passenger flow of Luohu Port lasted from 9:00 am to 11:00 am, and the peak passenger (vehicle) flow of Shenzhen Bay Port was from 6:30 am to 13:00 noon.
According to reports, in order to cope with the peak of passenger (vehicle) flow in and out of the country, the Shenzhen Border Inspection Station in accordance with the unified deployment of the National Immigration Administration, launched the passenger (vehicle) flow peak hour service mode, arranged overtime police to support the front line on duty, opened sufficient inspection channels in advance, guided passengers and vehicles to wait for inspection in an orderly manner, and ensured that the queue for entry and exit customs clearance of Chinese citizens did not exceed 30 minutes, while taking into account the efficiency of customs clearance for foreigners;
At the same time, Shenzhen Border Inspection Station reminds inbound and outbound passengers that they should pay attention to the validity period of documents, visas and endorsements before traveling, arrange their itinerary reasonably, try to avoid peak passenger flow hours, and choose the right time and suitable port to travel.
Passengers who take the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link to Hong Kong must hold valid entry and exit documents and visa endorsements, and the high-speed rail ticket is only a travel voucher and cannot be used as an entry and exit document.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic and intractable disease that affects multiple organs throughout the body, and was once considered an "incurable disease" in the past.
Because of its unclear pathogenesis, difficult diagnosis and treatment, and lack of effective treatment, it cannot be cured.
Recently, a joint team of Liu Wanli, a researcher at the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University, and Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatology and Immunology Center of Peking University People's Hospital, discovered that there is a molecular variant in human immunoglobulin that increases susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus, and this variant is involved in the regulation of immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors of the article and Peking University People's Hospital, Li Zhanguo's team collected nearly 2,000 large samples of systemic lupus erythematosus patients and conducted research, and found that patients with immunoglobulin mutations produced pathogenic cells and a wide variety and number of autoantibodies, and the incidence and severity of inflammation such as nephritis, arthritis, serositis, and vasculitis increased significantly.
Through a variety of research methods such as immune cell tracing, animal experiments, and sequencing, Liu Wanli's team discovered the pathogenic mechanism of immune signaling pathways activated by mutations of immune molecules and the secretion of various autoantibodies by B cells.
The reporter learned that the two teams joined forces, gave full play to their respective advantages, and realized the close combination of basic research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli's team is committed to the research of B lymphocyte immune recognition and immune activation, while Li Zhanguo's team has been engaged in clinical research on systemic lupus erythematosus for a long time.
"This study is one of the results of the collaboration between the two teams for many years, and it is also the first time that the academic community has recognized the mechanism that immunoglobulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted therapy. ”
This is not to protect shortcomings, but to act in accordance with the law.
Lawyer carrying an ax to court session?
The news is really exciting at first glance, and it has also exploded in legal circles.
Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, then fined the lawyer 500 yuan and recommended in writing that the Quanzhou Lawyers Association investigate and deal with it.
According to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association recently issued an official notice saying that the actions of the two lawyers did not involve violations of laws and regulations, and they would not be punished in accordance with the law.
Judging from various reports, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association's handling is not to protect shortcomings or engage in confrontation, but has been recognized by the Quanzhou Intermediate People's Court.
An incident that could have caused tension within the legal community was eventually properly resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete restoration of the truth: the axe carried by the lawyer involved was of the same style and model as the defendant's murder weapon, but it was not bladed, and it was only used as auxiliary evidence in the presentation and cross-examination of evidence, and there was no intimidation or subjective intent to "endanger the safety of the court".
There are four very important details that need to be paid attention to in judging whether the lawyer's actions are illegal and illegal: first, the local court only showed a photo of the axe in two previous court sessions, and from the perspective of defense, it is necessary to show the original axe; second, the axe was purchased one hour before the trial, not because the lawyer was unwilling to seek the judge's consent, but objectively failed to contact the judge; third, the entire axe was not excessively or improperly used; and fourth, the lawyer involved publicly admitted his mistake and apologized to the court at the first time.
Based on these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer involved "appeared in court with an axe" and had nothing to do with evil, but only to defend himself.
After clarifying the entire facts, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association did not push the boat with the flow, but withstood the pressure and made a decision not to punish.
And this decision can also stand the test of facts and law.
As for bringing an axe as a controlled knife to court without the permission of the court, it is indeed easy to cause uneasiness and misunderstanding.
For safety and prudence reasons, the Quanzhou Intermediate People's Court's previous fines and judicial recommendations are understandable.
In order to safeguard the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from making things difficult for lawyers, the Supreme People's Court promulgated the Rules for Security Inspections of the Judicial Police of the People's Courts in 2014, establishing the principle that lawyers do not need to undergo personal safety inspections when they appear in court.
Since the promulgation of the rule, the majority of lawyers have set an example, and there have been few incidents of endangering court security due to security loopholes.
In rare cases like Quanzhou, as long as communication is carried out in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding, misunderstandings can be resolved.
As a self-regulatory organization of the lawyer profession, the lawyers association undertakes the dual mission of punishing lawlessness and ensuring legality.
In the past, individual lawyers' associations have been criticized for their emphasis on punishment and lack of protection.
The decision of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association, both in terms of process and results, is commendable, and has set an example for more lawyers associations to perform their duties correctly.
From October 1st, what tax benefits will affect our money bags?
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1 (Reporter Sang Tong) The new individual income tax law will come into force on January 1, 2019, in order to allow the masses of people to enjoy the tax reduction dividend as soon as possible, from October 1, the actual wage and salary income of taxpayers will be deducted according to the monthly threshold of 5,000 yuan, and the new tax rate table will be applied.
With the implementation of the new policy, what are the benefits that will affect the people's money bags?
Good 1: The tax reduction of wages and salaries is obvious
Taxpayers who obtain wages and salaries after October 1 can deduct 5,000 yuan/month of basic deduction expenses and apply the new tax rate table, and most taxpayers have different degrees of tax reduction, especially for low- and middle-income people.
According to the tax reduction table of different income groups, after deducting the "three insurances and one housing fund", the monthly income of 8,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, and 50,000 yuan will be 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1,590 yuan, and 9,090 yuan respectively, and the corresponding tax reduction ratios will be 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, and 18.8% respectively compared with the monthly threshold of 3,500 yuan.
It is worth noting that due to holidays, the wages that should have been paid in October at the end of September in accordance with the law by various units can be subject to the new basic deduction fee and tax rate table.
To this end, the withholding client software uniformly promoted by the tax department has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid within the statutory declaration period.
Good 2: The distance between the low tax rate bracket has been significantly widened
In addition to raising the threshold, the new tax rate schedule will apply from 1 October.
The seven-level tax rate of wages and salaries is the same as before, and there is no change, but the tax rate range has changed significantly, the range of three lower tax rates of 3%, 10% and 20% has been significantly expanded, the range of 25% tax rate has been reduced, and the range of 30%, 35% and 45% of the three higher tax rates has remained unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the tax rates of production and operation income, of which the lower limit of the highest 35% tax rate has been increased from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan.
This means that sole proprietorships and sole proprietorship partnerships will benefit from the tax reform.
"Judging from the calculation of the personal tax reduction of Shanghai taxpayers in the early stage, the majority of taxpayers will fully feel the dividends of the individual income tax reform, especially the tax reduction for low- and middle-income groups. ”
Lan Min, head of the individual income tax department of the Shanghai Taxation Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation, said.
Advantage 3: Tax payment services are more convenient and optimized
Since the promulgation of the new individual income tax law, the Shanghai tax authorities have carried out a series of comprehensive and extensive tax publicity actions.
On the one hand, carry out "one-to-one, point-to-point" policy guidance for key tax sources and key enterprises.
The Pudong New Area Taxation Bureau has visited large enterprises such as Apple Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Alipay (China) Network Technology Co., Ltd., and Red Star Macalline Home Furnishing Group Co., Ltd., which have a large number of employees, a large amount of withholding and payment workload, and a large amount of tax payment. CIIC Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Co., Ltd. collects the concerns of enterprises in a timely manner, responds to their demands, and solves their difficulties.
On the other hand, for the general public and taxpayers, carry out "all-round, multi-dimensional, three-dimensional" tax policy push.
Use the official website of Shanghai Taxation, WeChat official account, Weibo and other channels to push policy hotspots in a timely manner to ensure that policy publicity is in place.
At the same time, from September 28, the Shanghai tax WeChat official account has launched the 12366 intelligent consulting platform to carry out "targeted" intelligent integrated individual income tax reform publicity services through "artificial + intelligent" tax service consultation.

Chang Jianhua, a crab farmer who has been dealing with hairy crabs for nearly 20 years, is planning to export the crab seedlings and breeding technology of hairy crabs from Yangcheng Lake to Thailand, so that the water town cuisine can cross borders and promote cultural exchanges with overseas cuisines.

A trilateral trade deal between the United States, Canada and Mexico will create new opportunities for 500 million people.
According to foreign media reports, a joint statement by Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer published on the Canadian government's website said that the United States, Canada and Mexico reached a trilateral trade agreement, which will be called "USMCA" (U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trilateral Agreement).
Earlier, Canada's CTV News television channel, citing senior US sources, said that Canada and the United States cleared their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Sept. 30 agreement between the United States and Canada will keep the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a trilateral trade agreement, with the three heads of state signing a new agreement within two months, The Washington Post reported, citing two sources with knowledge of the situation.
"Today, Canada, the United States and Mexico agreed on a new trade deal, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will provide our workers, farmers and companies with a high-standard trade deal that will lead to freer markets, fairer trade, and more sustainable economic growth," the statement said. The agreement will strengthen the middle class, create good-paying jobs, and create new opportunities for an estimated 500 million people. ”
It is reported that the current North American Free Trade Agreement was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
After taking office, Trump announced plans to reconsider the agreement and sign a new one.
The three countries began this negotiation process in 2017.
The results of the Okinawa gubernatorial election, which was held early due to the illness and death of former Governor Onaga Yushi, were announced in the early morning of the 1st local time, and Danny Tamaki, who opposed the relocation plan of the US military base in Japan, was successfully elected.
The election was held on September 30, and the final results showed that Tamaki received a total of 396,632 votes, the most votes in the history of the Okinawa gubernatorial election, and more than 80,000 more votes than his main opponent, Masashi Saki.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, and the turnout rate was 63.24%, a decrease of 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 Okinawa gubernatorial election.
Tamaki told the media on the 1st that the election results showed that the people of the prefecture did not want Governor Onga's efforts to be wasted, and that he would continue to make efforts to the Japanese and American governments to oppose the relocation of the U.S. military base and the closure of the Futenma base.
The Futenma U.S. military base, located in Ginowan City, Okinawa Prefecture, has been criticized for a long time, and the Japanese and U.S. governments previously agreed to relocate it to the Henoko area of Nago City, but the Okinawan people strongly opposed it and hoped that the base would be completely moved out of Okinawa.
As for the relocation plan, which was strongly opposed by the prefectural residents, and the request to revoke the land reclamation permit along the border of Henoko, Tamaki said that he did not stand on the side of confrontation and division with the central government at the beginning, and hoped that the two sides could fully exchange views and show their intention to resolve the matter through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also told the media on the morning of the 1st that he would seriously accept this result and would make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden on the base.
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference on the 1st that there has been no change in the government's policy on relocating US military bases as soon as possible.
At the same time, he also expressed his intention to hold talks with Yucheng.
Tamaki will officially take office as governor of Okinawa Prefecture on the 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oilseeds has grown, North Dakota farmer Paul Thomas has grown more and more soybeans in his fields.
That shift peaked this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans on 5,000 acres, an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch to corn and wheat, which were previously staple crops in U.S. agriculture, in 2019.
For the first time in 35 years, U.S. farmers are planting more soybeans than corn this year.
The plan to switch to other food crops comes because U.S. farmers are struggling to sell soybeans against the backdrop of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China.
China typically buys about 60% of U.S. soybeans exported, but the trade war has seen almost zero purchases of U.S. soybeans in recent months, sending soybean prices to a decade-low low.
Thomas plans to grow more wheat next year, hoping to earn more by reducing his dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Thomas said soybean prices were "a hard hit for us".
Without Chinese demand, he said, the spot price of soybeans near his farm is $7.10 per bushel, while the price necessary to cover the cost is $8.50.
U.S. farmers have recorded record soybean acreage this year, and their harvest is on track for record highs.
At such a momentous moment, they were hit by a trade war.
In response to Trump's tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, China imposed import tariffs on imports of U.S. soybeans in July.
The USDA will release its first estimate of next year's acreage, which is expected to include consideration of tariff implications.
This estimate is expected to confirm the expectation of a reduction in soybean plantings by private institutions.
Informa Economics projected corn acreage to increase 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019 and soybean acreage to 83 million acres in 2019, according to a report seen by Reuters.
Informa also expects a 4 percent increase in wheat acreage in the United States.
The area of soybeans planted before the retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres higher than 10 years ago.
Corn acreage has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008 to 89.1 million acres, and wheat acreage is 47.8 million acres this year, near a 100-year low.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Plantation Association, has nearly half of his family's 3,600 acres planted this year, but plans to cut it back in the future.
He said it could increase corn acreage by up to 20 percent on his farm in northern Illinois; The state is the largest soybean-growing state in the United States.
Soybeans have lower yields per acre than corn, but they also require less fertilizer, which makes soybeans generally cheaper to grow.
If farmers switch to final corn, it could raise costs, but it will benefit some businesses, including Andersons Inc fertilizer sellers.
Andersons CEO Pat Bowe told Reuters that he expects switching to corn will benefit fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from farmers' switch to corn.
Suthirawa, director of the Don Mueang Airport Authority in Bangkok, Thailand, held a press conference on the 29th to apologize for the beating of a Chinese citizen at the airport, and said that Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists, and relevant departments will strengthen management, improve service awareness, and avoid similar incidents.
According to reports, on the 27th, a physical altercation occurred between a security guard at Don Mueang Airport and a Chinese man who was denied entry.
Suthirawa said that the security guard involved had committed serious disciplinary actions and that the Airport Authority had suspended him from his post and set up an investigation committee to investigate the matter in accordance with the procedures, and would dismiss the security guard if the matter was true.
At present, the Thai Immigration Department has arranged for the man to return to China by plane.
Suthirawa apologized for this incident that damaged the image of Thailand, and said that the Thai side attaches great importance to this incident, is willing to do its best to reduce the impact of the incident on the beaten tourists, and will send a letter of apology to the person concerned through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that Don Mueang Airport is willing to provide convenience for Chinese tourists going to Thailand, and has joined hands with the Thai Immigration Bureau to set up special entry channels for Chinese tourists at Thailand's five major international airports, including Suvarnabhumi, Don Mueang, Chiang Mai, Phuket and Hat Yai.
He said that in the next step, the airport authority will rectify the landing visa area, clearly indicate the landing visa fee, and improve the service quality and communication skills of the staff.
After learning of the incident, the Chinese Embassy in Thailand immediately contacted the person concerned to understand what happened.
At the same time, he made representations to the heads of the Thai Immigration Bureau, the Airport Authority, and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, demanding that the Thai side thoroughly investigate the incident, severely punish the perpetrators, and continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side, properly handle the matter, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the parties concerned.
Xinhua International Times: Defending multilateralism, China integrates knowledge and action.
At a time when unilateralism is surging against the tide, international rules and the multilateral order are under attack.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible major country, China has worked with the international community to uphold multilateralism and push forward multilateralism with the concept of following the general trend and taking solid and effective actions.
In the face of the new situation and new challenges, China has made a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in his speech at the General Debate of the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to the goal of win-win cooperation, based on rules and order, based on fairness and justice, and guided by effective actions.
At the same time, China calls for the establishment of a global development cooperation pattern with the United Nations at its core, North-South cooperation as the main channel, and South-South cooperation as a supplement, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind.
China's thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As Espinosa, President of the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, said, in the current situation, "the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and uphold the rules-based international system more than ever".
Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, said that the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules, and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, along with the adjustment of the global economic and political balance of power, some emerging markets and developing countries have risen to play a greater role in major international multilateral mechanisms, providing new impetus for the development of multilateralism in the face of headwinds.
From this perspective, China's multilateralism concept of building a big family instead of cobbling together a small circle and adhering to extensive consultation and joint contribution instead of engaging in winner-takes-all is in line with the trend of the times, is an inevitable choice to respond to global challenges and solve world problems, and represents the common aspiration of most countries in the world.
There are advanced concepts and more solid actions.
China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China's Belt and Road Initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the 16+1 Cooperation, and other international and regional cooperation initiatives have promoted international and regional cooperation, improved and supplemented the existing international system and order, brought innovative vitality to multilateralism and cooperation, and contributed to the development of the international order in a more just and equitable direction.
As a defender of the international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China has become more and more powerful in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Mediation in international hotspots, addressing climate change, participating in peacekeeping operations, vigorously reducing poverty and alleviating poverty, and helping other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As UN Secretary-General António Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
At a time when the "trust deficit" facing the world is growing, and when populism and polarization are on the rise, the world's need for multilateral cooperation is most urgent.
At such a historical juncture, the international community needs to join hands to turn consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

By advocating heroes and commemorating martyrs, we must always remember history, continue the spirit of heroes and martyrs, and condense the powerful positive energy of national rejuvenation.
The quick comment pointed out that heroes and martyrs are the backbone of the nation.
To honor and pay tribute to the martyrs is to make the martyrs an eternity, noble, and powerful memory in our hearts.

Party committees and governments at all levels have improved the system of preferential treatment for bereavement pensions, continuously improved the level of bereavement benefits, and the party and the state have practiced their respect for heroes with practical actions.
Every year, countless people pay homage to the martyrs' cemetery, which makes us feel the deep feelings of the masses and the rejuvenation power rising from the national blood.
Advocating heroes, defending heroes, learning from heroes, and caring for heroes have become a common practice in the whole society.
At the end of the quick review, it was pointed out that today, when socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, we can comfort the martyrs who are buried in the ground: a powerful China is rising in the East, and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is becoming a reality in our hands.
Let us forge ahead with the spirit of heroes and martyrs and forge ahead towards the great goal!

The fifth "Disability Voice Month" is coming, focusing on the issue of sex education for disabled adolescents-Chinanews.com
In recent years, the topic of sex education for adolescents in China has been widely discussed, but the challenges of sex education for adolescents with disabilities are still very daunting.
Recently, a seminar on challenges and practical strategies for comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to educate children and young people with disabilities on sexuality became an important topic of the seminar.
According to the Report on the Sexual Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviours of Children and Youth with Disabilities in China, released at the conference, children with disabilities experience higher rates of sexual harassment and abuse than healthy children.
For children and adolescents with disabilities, more attention is paid to "sexual protection" in society.
The purpose of this symposium is to discuss the promotion of comprehensive sexuality education for children and adolescents with disabilities in China from the three aspects of family support, school education and institutional services, and to provide support for children and adolescents with disabilities from the source, so that they can enjoy the right to love freely like others.
Experts believe that the Chinese public's understanding of the disabled group has always remained at a level that is not deep enough.
Due to traditional attitudes and other factors, comprehensive sexuality education for people with disabilities, especially children and adolescents with disabilities, is not in-depth enough.
However, in recent years, with the support of UNESCO and philanthropists, the practice and realization path of sexual and reproductive health education for the full-cycle and comprehensive development of persons with disabilities in China have made gratifying progress.
According to the report, although children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical disabilities have more difficulties than the general population in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding intimate relationships, they have generally developed towards convenience and enrichment.
Organized by the Shanghai Renren Foundation, and co-supported by UNESCO China, Handicap International Alliance (France) Beijing and UNFPA China, the "Seminar on Challenges and Practical Strategies for Comprehensive Sexuality Education for Persons with Disabilities" aims to discuss the practice and realization path of sexual and reproductive health education for the comprehensive development of persons with disabilities in the context of the Healthy China Strategy, and to promote policymakers, educators, researchers, social service organizations, and social service organizations in the field of special education and inclusive education. Parent representatives and other stakeholders learned about the international policy on comprehensive sexuality education and the right to health of children and youth with disabilities, and exchanged views on sexuality education practices, strategies, challenges and resources for children and youth with disabilities in the country, and discussed and developed a blueprint for comprehensive sexuality education for children and youth with disabilities in the future, forming a support network.
BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The central bank's short foreign currency positions against local currency forwards and futures contracts were zero for the 12th consecutive month to the end of August, with no long positions in the month, according to data released by the People's Bank of China on Sunday.
According to the central bank's previous data, as of the end of August last year, the central bank held a total of 6.044 billion US dollars of short positions in foreign currency against local currency forward contracts and futures contracts, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, and the size of short positions denominated in SDR (Special Drawing Rights) was 4.276 billion SDRs.
Since then, the central bank's short position in FX forwards has been zero.
The data was first released by the central bank at the end of March 2016, and the data showed that at the end of February 2016, the central bank had a long position of $2.438 billion and a short position of $28.9 billion against local currency forwards and futures contracts.
The September data released at the end of October of the same year showed a net increase of $16.401 billion to $45.301 billion for the first time.
The central bank has previously stated that the forward and futures short positions of foreign currency against local currency mainly reflect the foreign exchange forward operations carried out by the central bank with commercial banks in order to meet the hedging needs of foreign currency liabilities of enterprises, and will continue to provide forward hedging products according to the principle of actual demand, and the forward operations of the central bank will have little impact on the scale of foreign exchange reserves in the future.
On the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, Qiao, a junior in Zhengzhou, took a bus to Hebi.
An uncle on the train bought a non-seat ticket, but took her seat: "Shoot, shoot, shoot".
After a two-hour journey, the conductor persuaded him for an hour to no avail.
In the end, a male passenger in the same carriage couldn't stand it and dragged the uncle up.
From the perspective of public opinion, although most of the final results are that the hegemon is condemned by the public, administratively punished by the public security department, and even included in the integrity blacklist, the public still feels that it is not "relieves hatred": Why can't the hegemon be punished on the spot?
Why can't they stop their immoral or even illegal behavior on the spot, but punish them after the fact?
As for the unreasonable behavior of the "Uncle Overlord", why is it just a male passenger who "sees unevenness on the road" and drags him up?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police, and short-distance trains generally do not; and even if there are police, the police do not take forced removal measures because they are concerned about the possible rogue reaction of the overlord.
The repeated incidents of hegemony have made people realize that the hegemon must be forcibly removed or even punished on the spot in order to have a deterrent effect.
This requires that our train police should dare to take strong measures in a timely manner, and trains without police should be equipped with police as soon as possible to stop and crack down on illegal acts in a timely manner.

At 8:05 a.m. yesterday morning, two pickpocketing suspects were caught pickpocketing from Yongdingmen Station to Zhushikou Station of Bus No. 20.
Two pickpocketing men cut the pockets of the passengers' coats and stole 800 yuan in cash, so that the police, who were already squatting nearby, could catch them.
This is the first pickpocketing case cracked by the Beijing police during the National Day holiday.
At about 5 o'clock yesterday morning, the anti-pickpocketing investigators of the Beijing Public Security Mobile Investigation Corps arrived at the predetermined position.
According to past experience, places where the flow of people is concentrated, bus hubs, bus and subway lines, and the crowd watching the flag-raising in Tiananmen Square are the focus of their work.
In the midst of the crowd, plainclothes policemen calmly observed the passing crowd.
At around 7 o'clock in the morning, investigators who were squatting at the bus stop found two suspicious men following a male passenger from Yongdingmen Station to the No. 20 bus.
In the car, two suspicious men, one left and one right, sandwiched the male passenger in the middle, one of whom tried to cover the other.
But they didn't know that their every move had already fallen into the eyes of the plainclothes policemen who were observing from the sidelines.
In the process of waiting for the man to start the theft, the police stared intently at the man who was ready to pickpocket, and was caught by the investigators in one fell swoop after they succeeded in pickpocketing.
A reporter from the Beijing Morning Post saw that the police seized 800 yuan in cash from the theft suspect.
"The money was taken from the pockets of the passengers' clothes. ”
The police pointed to a torn jacket pocket and said: "They cut this place open and pickpocketed 800 yuan from a tourist who came to Beijing, and when we caught them, the money had just been put into their own pocket." ”
The reporter learned that in order to catch these two people, the plainclothes police followed them for an hour, and finally arrested them in one fell swoop when they committed the crime.
The two suspects are currently under police scrutiny.
Plainclothes police told reporters that the question of who was suspicious in the crowd was very simple for the police.
"If you catch more thieves, you will find that their eyes and demeanor are different from ordinary passengers, in addition to staring at people's pockets and backpacks, they also like to drill into the crowd instead of avoiding people. ”
The police also told reporters that suspects often have no purpose in waiting for the train, and like to wander around the station, and will only follow them on the train after finding the object of pickpocketing.
"These are all empirical words, and after a long time of dry clothes, you will naturally know it. ”
In addition, the police also reminded that "it is most convenient to put things in the pocket of the coat, and it is also the easiest to be stolen." ”
Be careful of your belongings during the ride to prevent theft.

To activate rural consumption, it is necessary to rely on the normalization mechanism to purify the market, guide the demand for healthy consumption, and enhance the sense of gain of farmers' consumption.
In the first half of this year, the retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5 percent, 1.3 percentage points higher than that of urban areas.
Visited a poor village in a county in the west, there is only one convenience store in the whole village, and when I walked into the store, some of the goods seemed familiar, "Arowana" was marked as "Golden Dragon Oil", "Wangzai" became "Wang Milk", and there were many "cottage" goods.
Over the years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed, and some fake and inferior goods in rural areas are close to famous brands, with similar names, similar packaging, and fake and real, which is difficult to prevent.
According to a consumer survey report released by a city in the west, the problem of fake goods in rural supermarkets is serious, and 66% of users have bought fake goods in offline supermarkets in towns and villages, of which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant departments rectify the rural market and shout and beat every year, why is the "Li Ghost" still fighting repeatedly?
Unlike urban markets, farmers' awareness of protecting their rights is relatively weak, and many rural areas are located in remote areas and are in blind spots beyond the reach of regulatory forces, so that fake and inferior goods have a breeding ground.
A commodity is in charge of multiple heads, some departments are in charge of prices, some are in charge of production, and some are in charge of the market, with overlapping functions, cracking down on counterfeits every year, and centralizing the management of a gust of wind, fakes have avoided the limelight, and slowly emerge again.
The lack of a long-term regulatory mechanism, the difficulty of purifying the rural market, the low cost of violating the law, and the large benefits, have caused some illegal traders to start the crooked brains of "going to the mountains and going to the countryside", and some rural areas have become "waste markets".
From subsistence and clothing to moderate prosperity, the vast number of peasants are moving towards development-oriented consumption.
A few days ago, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Several Opinions on Improving the System and Mechanism for Promoting Consumption and Further Stimulating the Consumption Potential of Residents", which proposed to promote the upgrading of rural residents' consumption ladder, with the aim of allowing the majority of farmers to "be able to consume", "willing to consume" and "dare to consume", so that rural consumption can truly flourish.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen reform, eliminate the malpractice of multi-door and multi-headed management of market supervision and administration, adapt measures to local conditions, improve the food safety and product quality supervision network, and constantly reduce the space for making and selling counterfeits in rural areas.
On the other hand, it is necessary to intensify law enforcement, open up the "capillaries" of supervision, and never allow counterfeit and shoddy products to breed and spread in rural areas.
Severe punishment of pit farmers is to protect farmers, no matter how hidden the counterfeiters are, should not become the reason for the breeding of fake and shoddy goods, the relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, the grassroots supervision force sinks, which link has a problem, it is necessary to investigate the responsibility, so that the counterfeiters, counterfeiters have nowhere to hide.
Strictly control market access, implement strict qualification examination for producers and operators, control the market circulation, let the products come from the right way, go to the road clear, from the source, the root of the way, so that the legal distributors can operate with peace of mind, so that farmers can buy at ease.
To activate rural consumption, it is necessary to guide the demand for healthy consumption.
With the upgrading of consumption, many farmers not only pursue full food and good food, but also pursue high-quality life such as culture and health, and cannot equate the rural market with "low quality" and "cheap".
It is necessary to promote the extension of e-commerce coverage to the vast rural areas, smooth the two-way linkage sales channels between urban and rural areas, promote the combination of offline industrial development platforms and online e-commerce trading platforms, and support the expansion of new forms and models of consumption to the rural market; promote qualified towns and towns to organically combine trade and logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc.; improve the modern rural circulation network system, optimize and integrate the stock of facilities and resources, and effectively reduce the cost of rural circulation.
Create a clear and reassuring market environment for rural areas, so that farmers do not worry about consumption, rural consumption can become more and more prosperous, and only then can farmers' sense of gain and happiness in consumption be enhanced.
From November 1, China will reduce the most-favored-nation tariff rate on some goods, and the overall tariff level will be reduced to 7.5%
According to the decision of the 26th executive meeting of the State Council, the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council issued an announcement on November 30, 2018, reducing the most-favored-nation tariff rate for some commodities from November 1, 2018.
According to the Announcement of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council on Reducing Import Tariffs on Certain Commodities, in order to adapt to industrial upgrading, reduce enterprise costs and meet the needs of the masses for multi-level consumption, the MFN tariff rate for some industrial products and other commodities will be reduced from November 1 this year.
A total of 1,585 tariff items were tariff-reduced goods, accounting for about 19% of the total number of tariff items in China, and the average tax rate was reduced from 10.5% to 7.8%, with an average reduction of 26%.
The tax reduction mainly involves textiles, stone, ceramics and glass products, some steel and base metal products, mechanical and electrical equipment and parts, such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, construction machinery, power transmission and transformation equipment, electrical equipment, instrumentation, etc., resource commodities and primary processed products, such as non-metallic minerals, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, gems and jade, etc.
At the same time, with the reduction of the overall level of tariffs, especially the import tariffs on pharmaceuticals and consumer goods, the tariffs and tax rates of import taxes on imported goods will be lowered accordingly.
In order to implement the decisions and arrangements of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, China has implemented zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported drugs since May 1 this year, reduced import tariffs on automobiles and parts and some daily consumer goods since July 1, and implemented the third step of tariff reduction for products expanded by the information technology agreement.
This reporter learned from the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council that since the beginning of this year, after many successive independent adjustments, China's overall tariff level will drop from 9.8 percent in the previous year to 7.5 percent, with an average reduction of 23 percent.
Appropriately reducing tariffs is conducive to promoting the balanced development of foreign trade, promoting a higher level of opening up, and is also conducive to the overall use of international and domestic resources and promoting domestic supply-side structural reform.
The relevant person in charge of the committee said that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, and taking the initiative to reduce the overall level of tariffs is a practical action to implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Boao Forum for Asia, and it is also an important measure for China to further expand opening up and actively expand imports according to its own high-quality development needs.
On September 29, the regional public brand conference of "Huanxiang people" agricultural products in Huanxian County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District, Tianjin.
Red Army millet, black beans, mountain boy pastoral black goat, hardcover tartary buckwheat tea, paper-cut shadow book, handmade slippers ... A piece of beautifully packaged agricultural products were neatly placed on the booth, and they had a common brand name called "Huanxiang People".
"Building the regional brand of 'Huanxiang people' has effectively solved the development bottleneck of 'many and scattered, small and weak' agricultural products in Huanxian County, and has become a powerful carrier for poverty alleviation. On the 29th, the "Huanxiang People" regional public brand conference of agricultural products hosted by Huanxian County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District, Tianjin.
Huanxian County is located at the junction of Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningbo provinces, as "the national advanced county of grain production", "the hometown of China's small grains" and "the hometown of China's shadow puppetry", with a long history and rich resources.
Local snacks such as lamb, yellow rice wine, buckwheat chopped noodles, and swallow noodles are the flavors that wanderers in other places often think of.
With the continuous improvement of China's urbanization level and the rapid increase of urban population, a large number of young people in rural areas have left their hometowns to start urban life.
Yang Qiaojia, an expert in China's agricultural brand research, said: "Now the city life is fast-paced and stressful, and more and more people are beginning to miss the rural life when they were children, but, "the hometown that can't go back is called the hometown, and the most beautiful memory is the countryside". ”
Huanxian County has special climatic conditions, long sunshine hours, large temperature difference between day and night, and unique planting conditions for characteristic small grains.
It is rich in more than 20 kinds of small grains, and is the hometown of small grains in China, with the output ranking first in Gansu and the quality in the forefront of the country.

Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) rose more than expected by 0.2% in July from the previous month, raising expectations that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If it does, it will be the fifth time the central bank has raised rates in a little over a year.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 0.1% increase.
Statistics Canada said Friday that 12 out of 20 industries saw growth.
The data is noteworthy because the central bank expected earlier this month that temporary factors could weigh on Q3 GDP data.
Bank of Canada President Poloz promised on Thursday that the central bank will continue to raise interest rates gradually and will keep a close eye on economic data.
The Bank of Canada's next interest rate decision will be on October 24.
With Canada's economy strengthening and unemployment near record lows, the Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017.
Stephen Brown, senior Canadian economist at Capital Economics, said the country's economy is expected to grow at an annualized rate of about 2% in the third quarter.
"This would be higher than the 1.5% expected by the Bank of Canada and would therefore be another reason to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month," he said in a note.
Overnight index swaps showed that the market's estimate of the probability of the Bank of Canada's interest rate hike in October rose from 76.46% to 78.27%.
For the first time in 65 years, the ROK and the DPRK jointly inspected the estuary of the Han River
The South Korean Ministry of National Defense confirmed on the 5th that South Korea and the DPRK launched a joint inspection of the waters of the Han River and the Imjin River estuary on the same day.
This measure is a preliminary preparation for ensuring the free navigation of civilian vessels on both sides.
According to a briefing provided to the media by the South Korean Ministry of Defense on the same day, this is the first time that the two sides have conducted a joint inspection of the Han River estuary since the signing of the Korean War armistice agreement in 1953.
The ROK and the DPRK signed a military agreement in September this year, agreeing to jointly inspect the estuary of the Han River and other waters from November in order to ensure environmental protection and tourism development in the future.
In October, the two Koreas planned a joint survey of the waters at a general-level meeting.
On November 5, the joint inspection of the waters of the ROK and the DPRK was officially launched.
The joint delegation consisted of 20 people, including the ROK and DPRK military and experts.
According to the South Korean Ministry of National Defense, during the inspection, personnel on both sides did not carry weapons, and it was forbidden to use words and deeds that provoked the other side.
"Because there is no military demarcation line near the estuary, this area used to be an area of high risk of accidents, but through joint investigations, it will become a new peaceful area in the future. ”
The total length of the waters for the joint inspection is about 70 kilometers, with a total area of about 280 square kilometers.
According to the ROK Ministry of National Defense, the ROK will send six research vessels to survey the depth of the sea and provide basic information for safe navigation in the waters.
The two Koreas held a summit meeting in Pyongyang in October 2007 and agreed on joint use of the Han and Imjin estuaries to the sea, but subsequent talks were stalled due to tensions on the peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed between the two Koreas in September, ships from both sides will need to inform each other in advance before sailing in common waters in the future.
Chinanews.com, November 5 According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia on the 4th, recently, Chinese citizens Guo Yuqin and Mao Runxin lost contact during their travel in Mongolia.
It is understood that the two are members of the blue sky rescue team, on October 19, the two contacted relatives and friends in China, saying that they were about to enter the mountains near Kusugul Lake to explore, and shared their location through WeChat, and then lost contact and are suspected to have gone to no man's land.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and interests and safety of Chinese citizens in Mongolia, and has attached great importance to consular protection and assistance.
After learning the news of the disappearance of the above two tourists, the embassy immediately activated the emergency plan for consular protection, and strived to seize the golden rescue time and make every effort to carry out the work.
The embassy maintained close communication with the families of the victims, assisted the families in immediately reporting the case to the Mongolian police, and provided the families with a list of interpreters for selection.
The embassy immediately met with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Relations, the General Police Department and the General Emergency Situation of Mongolia to report on the relevant situation, and asked the Mongolian side to carry out the search and rescue as soon as possible, and maintain close communication with the Mongolian side throughout the search and rescue process to ensure that the latest progress is grasped in a timely manner.
At the same time, the embassy assisted the families in issuing missing person notices in Mongolia, and extensively mobilized overseas Chinese and Chinese-funded enterprises in Mongolia to actively participate in the search for the missing persons, provided effective clues, and provided relevant assistance to a number of blue sky rescue team members who went to Mongolia to assist in the rescue.
With the vigorous promotion of the embassy, the Mongolian side immediately dispatched a rescue team and promised to waive the search and rescue fees.
The Mongol Police and the General Directorate of Emergency Situations instructed the Khuvsgul Provincial Police and the Emergency Situations Department to make every effort to search and rescue.
Because Kuvsgul Lake is located in the northern part of Mongolia and the border with Russia, it is remote, sparsely populated, and the transportation and communication are extremely inconvenient, and Mongolia has entered a severe winter, with the temperature as low as minus 20 degrees, the local police and emergency departments have overcome great difficulties, mobilized almost all police forces, and mobilized local herdsmen to carry out a wide range of carpet search and rescue around the missing location of the two people by riding, walking, visiting herdsmen, etc.
At the same time, in view of the special situation in the pastoral area, the Mongolian side has been circulating the search notice through radio for many days.
The relevant staff of the domestic blue sky rescue team have also come to Mongolia to actively participate in the rescue together with the Mongolian side.
The safety of the two missing people has always been close to our hearts.
So far, the two have been missing for more than 10 days, and the embassy has received some clues one after another, but the two have not been found, and the search and rescue operation is still in full swing.
The embassy will always adhere to the principle of "people-oriented", continue to pay attention to this matter, urge the Mongolian side to continue to make all-out search and rescue efforts, and provide maximum assistance to the families of the parties concerned.
The embassy appeals to compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia to contact the Chinese embassy in Mongolia as soon as possible if they know relevant clues.
