Xinhua Times Review: Turning good returning migrant workers into rural revitalization force - Xinhua Network
In rural renewal, talent is the key.
Where's the talent?
The elite group of returning migrant workers is an indispensable force.
Xinhua News Agency
News of July 26th, Xinhua News Agency.
The 34-year-old Zhang Yu family was in Orchard Village in Sichuan Meishan City and in 2010 he resigned from his monthly job in Beijing to start his own business.
After several years of struggle, he now runs a grape-growing family farm that earns more than a million yuan a year, becomes a small, well-known leader of wealth and is selected for the village's “two committees”.
In recent years, inspired by a series of pro-farm policies such as the national fight against poverty and the revitalization of villages, a growing number of excellent rural workers, like Zhang Hung, have opted to return to their homes to start their own businesses and have activated a pool of rural water.
In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village branch secretaries, 61,000 village reserve troops and 20,000 development party members were drawn from the elite migrant workers of the western province of Sichuan, which led to the implementation of the “Big Farmer Return Project” for the sake of seditious interests.
Little Hong isn't too bad, it's important to look at the old man.
Since the reform and opening up of the economy, the country ' s large number of young and adult workers have been working abroad to increase their earnings, sometimes by building their own businesses.
However, it has also objectively led to the emergence of rural “empty” to varying degrees, in particular the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations, as well as the “older” and “lower” characteristics of village branch clerks and party members, i.e. the ageing and low level of education, the weak leadership of village party organizations and the problem of youthlessness.
If elements such as rural talent continue to flow to the city alone, the country is chronically “blooded” “anemia”, and revitalization is empty.
To attract those who are able, conscious and willing to serve their homeland, to lead them back home to start their own businesses as leaders of wealth, to train from among the best of their abilities to become party members and village cadres, and to strengthen the cadres at the grass-roots level, which is the solution to the problem of the poorness of the ranks of rural and grass-roots parties.
Good migrant workers are attracted, and they must be kept and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan has embarked on a process of hard-on-the-farming of the Workers ' Party, which has set up institutional mechanisms such as orientation, service security, training, selection and use, based on strict selection criteria, so that they can be empowered, secure at work and expect to live, and truly take root in rural areas, where officers have a sense of success in entrepreneurship.
This year is the year of the final battle against poverty, which is linked to rural renewal.
The party committees at all levels must give high priority to the group of good returning migrant workers and, through comprehensive measures, create a well-established, combatable, non-dismissed task force and a force of strength to provide strong organizational security and talent for rural poverty alleviation and development revitalization.
As a result of the epidemic, this year ' s university graduates are special, and on the evening of July 11th, the bilibili summer graduation song will bring to the graduates a special live live live performance, with music such as wolf, Park, Lee Woo-chun, Mao and others giving voice and blessing to the graduates.
The well-known master, SealWu U-Ivan, also brought with him a " Weeds " , a rap song he adapted to the same essay poems of Ruther, which is very popular among young people.
As a result of the epidemic, a number of graduates were unable to appreciate the ritualism of the site and the degree certificate, and they transferred it online.
According to the data, this is a 2.5-hour concert with a live human peak of over 35 million.
“Follow your own heart, take advantage of the opportunity, without account being taken of the consequences, and sometimes the unexpected gain.”
Although it was a graduation concert, many songs moved non-responsible graduates.
“The whole scene looks like a real cry, and everyone's youth is full of beauty and regret, but it's worth remembering, and we have to walk bravely.”
Beijing's natural ecology continues to be good, attracting more than 500 wildlife cities to "settle" - a new network.
2020-07-26 05:03:17 Source: Beijing Youth newspaper by Wang Seok-seok.
The natural ecology of the capital continues to attract wildlife cities to settle.
There are over 500 species of wildlife in Beijing.
The reporter Wang Bin, a Beijing youth journalist, has learned from the Greening of the City Gardens Bureau that in recent years, as the natural ecological environment of the capital continues to improve, the variety and number of wildlife have continued to increase.
The number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife living in Beijing has increased to more than 500, including the protection of animals at the national level, such as brown horse chickens and black storks, as well as the protection of animals at the national level at the secondary level, such as antelopes, giant swans, cranes and thirams.
Whether it is an urban forest planted in the ring or a small wetland embedded in a building, it not only brings nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wildlife to “settle” the city.
In the middle of the summer season, the Pine Mountains, located in the Yan Mountain Mountains in the north-west of the Yanqing region, are vibrant in their national nature reserves.
And one of them played around the mountains, and two of them fought each other.
Turning back, a wild boar could not resist the “strucking” on his body and was strutting the bark. The Director of the National Service for Nature Reserves in Pine Mountains, Mr. Hu Xiaoli, described the fact that, as of the end of 2019, in a green sea of more than 6,200 hectares, 178 species of wildlife, including the conservation of animal golden eagles at the national level and the protection of animal spoon chickens and euphoria at the national level, could be found in nearly one third of all wildlife species in the city.
“In Pine Mountain, wildlife is the true master, and our staff can only be considered as their bodyguard.”
According to Hu Chongli, in order to gain a field view of wildlife in the protected areas, more than 30 professional rangers patrol each day along 16 well-designed protection routes, and a monthly “turning circle” takes almost the entire protected area all day.
“In the course of the inspection, not only the recording of biodiversity, but also the installation of artificial bird nests, the rescue of injured wildlife, the installation of infra-field infrared cameras, etc..”
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in the Pine Hill National Nature Reserve to document the state of life of wildlife in the forest.
As the biodiversity of protected areas has increased over the years, the presence of wild animals in the lens has increased, leopard cats, gills and pigs have become “resident guests” and the “opportunity” of protected animals at the national level has increased.
Zhang Zhi Minh, Head of the Wildlife and Wetlands Conservation Division of the Beijing Park Greening Bureau, described the increase in terrestrial vertebrate wildlife from 461 species in 1994 to over 500 today, and the continuous increase in species and numbers of wildlife in Beijing in recent years.
The presence of wildlife in cities is becoming more common and is closely linked to the recent escalation of greening in the capital city.
In particular, the new round of reforestation of million acres, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban environment, upgrade the ecological function of green lands and highlight the concept of “near nature”.
The plan seeks to interact with the surrounding green areas to facilitate wildlife “visit friends” and to plant trees that are also a source of honey and food for animals.
Black land “scropping” out of the Agricultural Modernization - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26th.
In the summer, two jets of spraying agents crossed from the 10,000 acres of high-yielding demonstration fields at the second operating station in the Friendship Farm Area V, forming two white lines in which the words “first in the world” from black rice seedlings were particularly striking.
The station's head hole forced the aircraft to spray over 6,000 acres of arable land, which was about eight times more efficient than the drone and hundreds more than manual.
This farm is located in the Friendship County of Heilongjiang Province, the first food-producing province of China, from the sound of rice cutting in the past, to the sound of Mada, which is now the “Longlong”, where traditional Chinese farming and farms have been transformed.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are used in modern agricultural production on friendly farms.
On the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precision fertilization, reduce agricultural inputs and reduce pollution, and on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can increase the standard level of operation in agricultural machinery.
During this year ' s rice production, the farm expanded the operational area of satellite navigation unmanned plug-in technology from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
This technology has resulted in more even planting of seedlings, maximizing the use of sunlight and cropland resources and saving $16 in labour costs per acre.
The farm has tried new technologies such as information and intelligence in agricultural production, creating the country ' s largest agricultural machinery, from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total holdings of farm machinery currently stand at 49,000 units, with an integrated field mechanization rate of 99.8 per cent.
Agricultural machine operations have achieved 100 per cent GPS satellite navigation, 100 per cent dry field precision planting and 100 per cent dry field motor vehicle operation.
“Green agriculture, smart agriculture, digital agriculture are the path to modernization of agriculture.”
The head of the friendly farm, Liu Selene, said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, farm-based farming by Heilongjiang has played a leading role in the demonstration of modern, large-scale agricultural “carriers”, leading to the initial establishment of modern agro-industrial systems dominated by scale farming, standardized production and industrialization.
On the outskirts of Friendship County, there is a 350,000 square metre farm machine exhibition park.
More than 140 agricultural tools have been introduced and used by Heilongjiang farmers over the years.
These tools and farms bear witness to the process of modernizing our agriculture.
Zheng Xiao's home for you all — Anhui — Zhang Guo River — Zinhua Network
On July 26th, Xinhua's Fat Chai Tsai: The House of Houses for All - Anhui and Yang Guo Union of People
Xinhua News Agency journalists Chen Sang Camp, Wang Liwu, Liu Xia Village
On 25 July, at more than 4 p.m., Fu Qungbo, in his mud-filled rubber shoes, went to the back of the house and went back and forth with his wife, Zhou Yan, to pack his stuff.
“I received a call from village officials for transfer, and I was still in the field.”
Fu Qungbao says he's been running more than 60 acres, growing rice, and now he's doing a good job, and he says, "Well, yesterday he was drugged and his tools haven't been packed."
Fu Quinbo pointed to a pesticide sprayer in the corner, and he said, "No one wants their homes flooded, let's go home for everyone."
In response to the continued high water level pressure of the nest lake and the possible heavy rainfall, Hofer City, Anhui Province, is preparing to open on 26 days the Yang Guo River Union, where the Fu Qungbao family lives, to divide the flood reserves.
The Jiang Kong River Union is located in Fatsy County, close to the lake embankment.
There are thousands of villagers in the country who need to be relocated, involving the town of Tsang and River.
As at 1600 hours, the fifth-largest freshwater lake in the country remained at a high level of 13.2 metres, exceeding the guaranteed level of 0.7 metres.
The Fou Quinbao kitchen is clean and clean, there's a pumpkin head on the table, eggs and some halogen in the fridge.
“I can't believe I'm moving. The water of the Jianggu River looks good now. It's not like we're going anywhere.
Zhou Yan said that the house was flat and that some big items had not yet been settled.
“Clean up valuable items, and for the time being, refrigerators, televisions, etc., can be placed at the homes of high-lying neighbours or relatives.”
The village's chief has given him some advice.
Wang was responsible for the relocation of 13 villagers, and one family notified each of their resettlement programmes.
The nearest settlement to the Fu Qungbao family is the Su Primary School, located in Quantuan.
In addition to the large items, Fou Quimbau had a headache with more than 1,000 pounds of food and new furniture.
“The food is ready to be dragged to relatives, and the furniture cannot be moved.”
The couple agreed to put the bench under the newly purchased mattress and raise the bed about half a metre.
At 6 p.m., Fou Qungbao started carrying goods in tricycles to relatives' homes, and Zhou Yan continued packing at home.
At more than 11 p.m., the husband and the wife looked back and forth at the house and pulled the electric switch to the place of installation.
"I hope the water retreats."
Fou Quinbo said.
On 26 July, at 9.30 a.m., journalists observed on the scene of the Jiang Kong Union site that preparations had been made to divide the flood.
Zhang Jie-Kolin's small house team has a lot of power.
On 11 July, the sports youth hot-blood competition " Sports Bar Boys " , officially landed in the south of the lake.
The sports leader Zhang Jieko and the sports assistant Lin Xiao residence are cross-border co-opted, Lindane and Fu Zhueng Dynamite have different styles, while the hard core of a “smuggling”-like power-drawing device has become more powerful.
At the same time as the crowd of 11 young sportsmen on the show, the “strong confrontation” “strong heart” on the stage was also highlighted.
Among them, the “strength conflict” came from Super-A sports student Joven I, who openly provoked, in front of the match, Xu Ji-bin, who had been known as the “Face Man” on the track, and whose appearance should be singing the show and even uttering the harsh phrase, “Don't cry over the makeup”.
The statements made by the youths and sports leaders on the scene took a breath.
And “strength” is more like a fairy fight, and Sun Kenshin, who is dubbed the Great Demon King, meets the same powerful Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng.
Their identity is unexpected, as Sun Kenshin is a fitness-loving actor, Zhang Zhang Zheng Dynasty is a retired special soldier who won three medals.
At the beginning of the competition, the two teenagers tried their best to pull out the pole quickly, and the protracted confrontation on the pole made the audience sweat for them.
In a tense race, Zhang Jiko, one of the leaders of the Sports Bar Boys movement, also watched carefully.
At the point of assessment, he was also very careful and patiently encouraged the young people who had lost the game, helping each failure point in the reset process.
The sports assistant Lin House, on the other hand, is a florist aid, and she does not hide her appreciation for the youths of the Facebook network.
It is all the more admirable when it comes to learning that sports teenagers are overstretched in their daily training.
The same sport leader has different styles of Lindane and Fu Park, and one of them is the "pregnant" of the aberration. One is the "flooding young girls" who use their smiles to disperse tensions.
In addition, Gyok Yi and Liu Yi, as sports assistants, have created a number of laughs around young sportsmen.
Nantes Church, France: Communion volunteers admit to arson, normal and unspoken -- the new net.
On July 26, China Newsnet reported that on July 18, in Nantes, France, religious historic buildings, the famous St. Peter and St. Paul Cathedral were severely damaged in a fire and the cathedral was completely destroyed.
On 26 local time, Nantes Public Prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer who was in charge of defending the cathedral had been charged with “blasting the fire”.
He has admitted to setting fire to himself in the church.
According to reports, the local prosecutor, Xenas, a 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda, admitted that he had set fire to three of the cathedrals at night.
For his part, his lawyer indicated that the arsonist now regretted having done so.
He entered France a few years ago by way of asylum and was sheltered in the parish of the place where the fire took place, where he was taken to church.
The prosecution stated that he had recently tried to update his visa and was in dialogue with the police.
For its part, however, the church continues to believe that the faithful, who are usually very kind and smiling, but who do not speak very much, will destroy a church that he so loves.
On the day of the fire on 18 July, the volunteer had already been questioned by the police on account of a lack of logic in his account, but he was later released.
It shows firefighters on the scene.
In the evening of 25 days, the individual was again summoned as new evidence was obtained by professional engineers at the Paris Central Police Laboratory.
This time, the man confessed to his arson.
It was reported that if the crime of vandalism was committed intentionally, the suspect could face 10 years ' imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
It was reported that the fire caused serious damage to the Cathedral of St. Pierre and São Paulo, that the cathedral was completely burned and that the coloured window behind the cathedral was severely damaged.
According to Brunet, the chief architect for the preservation of French history, it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of the Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive message: US unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries and international public opinion supports China ' s opposition to US-Sinhua network
Xinhua News News, Beijing, July 26, reported by the news agency Xinhua's foreign correspondent: On the morning of 24 July, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China informed the United States Embassy in China that the Chinese side had decided to withdraw its authorization for the establishment and operation of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu and had made a specific request that the Consulate General cease all operations and activities.
International public opinion is of the view that the unilateralist measures taken by the United States have seriously troubled relations between China and the United States and that China has responded to unjustified provocations by the United States, and that counter-measures are legitimate and necessary.
Andrés Borgs, Director of the China Research Centre of the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateralist measures of the United States had destroyed the bridge of understanding between the peoples of China and the United States and had put relations between the two great Powers at risk.
China ' s notification of the closure of the United States Consulate-General in Chengdu was a counter-measure to unilateral measures taken by the United States and was consistent with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Justo, Professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and Director of the Centre for Academia, considers the above-mentioned decision to be a legitimate and necessary counter-measure to the earlier provocations by the United States and not to the general American population.
The United States has tried to distract its people by pressuring China to cover up its failure to respond to the new epidemic.
The Chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Centre of Indonesia, Bambang Suryono, said that the provocative diplomatic stance of the United States had seriously troubled relations between China and the United States, which faced serious challenges.
China has informed the United States that the closure of its Consulate-General in Chengdu is a normal counter-measure and is in line with diplomatic practice, reflecting both China ' s principled position, which firmly upholds its own interests, and China ' s legitimate interests.
The Tanzanian commentator, Francis Semwenza, said that the above-mentioned decision by China was a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
In order for relations between China and the United States to return to normal, the United States should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in its internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to win economically and politically with China and how to benefit both peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yusuf, Executive Director of the Federation of Arab-China Friendship Associations, based in the Sudan, said that the counter-measures that China had been forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified acts of the United States, in accordance with the basic norms of international law and international relations, and with diplomatic practice.
The previous United States request for the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston constituted a serious violation of the basic norms of international law and international relations.
It was to be hoped that the United States would reverse the previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the normalization of relations between the two countries.
Singapore's Joint Morning Post published an editorial stating that the United States had a greater strategic intention to block China and prevent its continued rise.
In the face of the tight pace of the United States, China, while reluctant to see relations between China and the United States continue to deteriorate, has had to take counter-measures.

On 26 July, a journalist from Guangzhou, Xinhua news agency, Mao Zhuang, learned from the Guangdong Sea Police Department that in recent days, the Agency, in association with Guangzhou Customs and Public Security, had dismantled an extraordinary group of smuggled oil products, which had initially verified that since 2019 it had smuggled about 120,000 tons of oil, worth about 800 million yuan, and had stolen about 240 million yuan.
The Guangdong Police Force, in conjunction with the Customs Department of Policing, has gradually worked out the division of labour and organizational structure of the group.
On 8 July, the maritime police, customs and public security departments carried out a unified network operation in Guangzhou, Fushan and in the area of Pearl ' s River pocket, where four vessels suspected of smuggling were seized on site. A total of 4,700 tons of finished oil were seized in the respective vessels and oil depots, and funds were frozen.
It is understood that the joint operation involved eight ships and two helicopters, divided into teams working in concert to combat smuggling and illegal land-based operations at sea, with 35 major suspects on board.
The case is currently under further investigation.
The relevant officials of the Guangdong Police Department indicated that they would continue to maintain a high level of pressure in the future to combat all types of smuggling offences at sea and to maintain good order in the territorial waters.
Hurricane Hannah landed in Mede County or triggered a surge in water and flash floods.
On July 26, China Newsnet, a comprehensive external report reported that at 5 p.m. local time, Hurricane Hanna landed in Texas, United States, bringing strong storms and water surges in Texas, and potentially life-threatening flash floods.
According to the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Hanna is expected to carry heavy rains that will sweep parts of the southern and north-eastern parts of the state, either by storming or causing some of the stream surges and life-threatening flash floods.
It was reported that the worst affected by Hurricane Hanna was south of the city of Copes Christi to the mouth of the Grande River, and that the Rio Grande Valley could be hit by widespread flash floods.
The Governor of Texas, Albert 25, said: “Any hurricane is a great challenge.”
Thirty-two counties in the state entered a disaster emergency due to the hurricane.
The city of Copes Christie, a city with over 320,000 inhabitants, has closed its libraries and museums and its inhabitants are waiting for them.
Abot also stated that the hurricane could not be allowed to cause more casualties in Texas at a time when Texas was suffering from a new coronary epidemic.
Rainfall in southern Texas is reported to be 6 to 12 inches during the night of 26 days, with 3 to 5 inches of rainfall in the northern Texas and Louisiana coastal areas.
As a result of global warming and other factors, “Hanna” predates the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
As a rule, the first hurricane in the Atlantic usually takes place in mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women
The Ministry of Justice of Poland indicated on Saturday that Poland would take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women.
The right-wing Government Cabinet of Poland stated that the treaty required schools to teach students about gender issues, which violated the rights of parents.
A press conference organized by the Polish Minister of Justice, Joblo, said that his Ministry of Justice would submit a request on Monday to the Ministry of Labour and Family to start withdrawing from the treaty.
The treaty is known as the Istanbul Convention.
“The treaty contains elements of a morphological nature which we consider to be harmful”.
The Polish ruling law is closely allied with the Party for Justice and its partners in the ruling coalition and the Roman Catholic Church, advocating a conservative social agenda.
The hostility to homosexual rights was one of the main themes of the successful re-election campaign of Polish President Duda this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, held protests against withdrawal from the Convention in Warsaw and other cities.
One of the organizers of the protest, Lempat, stated in a protest march in Warsaw that “the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty was to legalize domestic violence”.
A number of protesters carried banners that read “The Law and Justice Party is the hell of women”.
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
The Convention was ratified by Poland ' s previous intermediate Government in 2015.
The Law and Justice Party Government stated that the treaty did not respect religion and required the teaching of liberal social policies in schools.
To date, however, the party has not decided to withdraw from the Convention.

Jiangxi has opened a Green Channel for youth on the front line of the flood.
The Conscription Office of the People ' s Government of Jiangxi Province of Xinhua Nanchang (Kou Dongming, Kuang Yang) has recently made it clear that individuals or their children who were prominent in this flood-risk relief mission are eligible for recruitment and qualified for medical and political examinations.
“The registration of young recruits will be followed by a joint recruitment of youth from their communities, the Street Armed Forces and the recruitment service of the Sunyang district, which will give priority to their recruitment.”
According to Wang Fai, Vice-Minister of Wu, Yuyang District, Kyushu City, who was affected by the floods, they began to organize a medical examination of the young recruits for three days.
A 22-year-old university graduate from the Yingyang District of Kyushu city, whose mother was a community worker and father a veteran of an air force, had been on duty for 12 days on a line of duty against the flood.
“These days, I want to be someone like the people's soldiers who have been defending my homeland against the floods.”
Zhou raced to say that he had a military dream since he was a child and that his commitment to the military camp had been reinforced by the flood.
The city of Nine Rivers also uses flood risk insurance as a “living material” for recruitment campaigns, using the community as a unit, calling on young conscripts to join voluntarily in patrolling the Chateau, on duty, etc., and is now aware of the nature of the People's Army and strengthening their confidence in joining the State.
The Political Committee of the Wuyang People's Department of the city of Nine Rivers, Yoko Yoo Yu, said that, by giving priority to the recruitment of soldiers, it was hoped that more young recruits would be encouraged and that a good social atmosphere would be created for them to participate in the mission and participate in it.
According to Viet Nam News, according to Grivorys, Viet Nam has contributed significantly to ASEAN development for 25 years.
Viet Nam is not only a responsible member of ASEAN, but also an ASEAN locomotive.
Grivory stated that the Russian Federation and, indeed, the Asian-European Economic Union considered that Viet Nam contributed to ASEAN ' s enhancement of its status and to the promotion of its image abroad.
He stressed that “ASEAN should therefore thank Viet Nam”.
Grivory indicated that the analysts had endorsed Viet Nam ' s peace initiative.
Viet Nam is ready to share its experience with ASEAN countries and to propose constructive peace measures on issues facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East China Sea issue.
With regard to cooperation between Viet Nam and Russia within the ASEAN framework, Grivorys believes that Viet Nam supports cooperation between Russia and ASEAN and helps Russia benefit from this cooperation framework.
The Asia-Europe Economic Union, including Russia, and Viet Nam were able to enter the ASEAN market with the signing of the FTA.
Grivory suggested maximizing the free trade area between ASEM and ASEAN countries, thereby creating a platform for economic and security stability.
Grivory was also confident that Russia, Viet Nam and ASEAN were on track and would achieve their goals.
Between now and the end of 2020, the province will have the necessary conditions, particularly in the areas of infrastructure, human resources and land, to proactively attract foreign investment flows, especially transnational groups with value chains and the transfer of advanced technologies.
In addition, Kitajiang Province will finalize the proposal for the decision of the Prime Minister of the Government to invest in infrastructure development and operation projects in the Vietnamese industrial zone and approve the addition of the two industrial-urban-service areas of Anshan-Northang and Anhuang Province to the overall development plan for Viet Nam ' s industrial zone by 2020.
At the same time, efforts have been made to accelerate the progress of projects, in particular infrastructure-building and operation projects in industrial park clusters such as Fuu Guangzhou, Twin Creek and Uttar Pradesh, which have led to the creation of a land fund for the mobilization of funds.
In 2020, the Department of Industry and Trade of Kitajiang Province participated in the formulation of proposals for the establishment of industrial zones and cluster planning for inclusion in provincial planning.
The province of Kitajiang has determined to combine the development of clusters of industrial parks with the safeguarding of national defence, the protection of the ecological environment and food security, thus contributing to the balanced development of industry; the availability of comprehensive infrastructure such as electricity, water supply, transport and telecommunications; and the integration of urban construction, trade services, worker housing and other social infrastructure such as health and education.
In the industrial zone, the province of Kitajiang has focused its efforts on investment projects in high-tech and clean technologies in areas such as electricity, electronics, telecommunications equipment, precision machinery, support industries, etc.
In the industrial park cluster, the province calls for small and medium-sized investment projects in the areas of production, utilization of local labour, particularly agricultural products, and food processing.
In the future, North Jiang Province will focus on accelerating investment in the infrastructure of the North Jiang City Logistics Centre, in tandem with the development of clusters of industrial parks, in order to optimize goods, currency flows and help reduce production costs, improve the value of goods, optimize supply chains and develop multimodal transport, thereby creating an incentive for investors to invest in their province.
Upgraded Russian helicopter gunship card-52M first released at the end of the year - Xinhua Network
On the basis of plans by the Russian Ministry of Defence, an upgraded version of the Russian helicopter gunship (hereinafter called Wutai) card-52M will be completed for the first time in December of this year to replace and leave the plant, and the model will be significantly improved in terms of reconnaissance, communications and weapons performance.
According to a recent Russian newspaper, the development contract for Wutaka-52M, known as the “Super Short-Skissed Crocodile”, was signed last April by the Russian military and military engineering units, and the first two such upgrades are currently being modified at the Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of the Russian Aerospace Corporation Progress Group, whose national testing and upgrading will be completed by October 2022.
According to Russian experts who are aware of the above-mentioned upgrades, the “presence” of the “Super Short-Sniffing Crocodile” — the Wu Nacca-52 — was formally installed in November 2011 and the model was exposed to some weaknesses in its use, the purpose of which was to upgrade the “clipboard”.
It was reported that, compared to card-52, the card-52M would partially use new, non-weighted protective materials, its pilot cabins would be reinforced and equipped with new equipment to withstand missile attacks, thereby increasing the probability of survival on the battlefield; more powerful generators would be assembled to provide electricity for more sophisticated on-board electronic equipment; the photovoltaic system would be upgraded to enable the detection and identification of more distant battlefield targets; new light multi-purpose missiles with a major attack on armoured combat vehicles and concrete fortifications, with a range of up to 20 kilometres, would increase approximately one-fold the range of missiles of the same type as those in active Russian military use; and their defensive weapons and communications equipment would be used to maximize their utility with Mi-28NM armed helicopters capable of attacking air targets, thus making the associated maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, card-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapons targeting systems and navigation equipment.
The Russian experts also stated that it was of concern that the card-52M would be equipped with communications equipment to communicate with drones, thus providing real-time air access to information transmitted by nearby drones, such as showing images taken by drones on the cabin screen of the helicopter.
It is planned that the pilots of the card-52M will be able to directly manipulate the drones with which they work, thereby improving their knowledge of the situation on the battlefield and their guidance on long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, the Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation, Krivorochko, stated last December that the Ministry of Defence plans to purchase more than 110 VK-52M by 2027.
The new decree provides for the wearing of masks in indoor public places in the Campania region from the immediate date onward, punishable by a fine of up to 1,000 euros.
On 1 June, local time, the Rome coven reopened in Rome, the capital of Italy.
According to the latest vaccination decree issued by the regional government, the population of the Campania region is reportedly required to wear masks in compliance with the vaccination requirements in all public transport, as well as in indoor public places such as shops, bars, supermarkets and exhibitions.
Violation of this provision is punishable by a fine of up to 1,000 euros.
It also provides for the segregation of all passengers entering the Campania region from non-Schengen countries.
The Regional Government will authorize health agencies to coordinate the organization of specific hotels to isolate positive and non-symptomatic persons.
The decree entered into force on 25 July.
In less than an hour, three customers entering the supermarket have been fined.
Hebei has had 1.75 billion cubic metres of ecological recharge of the river and lake since this year - a new medium net.
On 26 July, a journalist from Wang Quin, Xinhua Jia Chen, learned from the water hall of Hebei Province that since this year, Hebei Province has been carrying out ecological refilling of 28 rivers, such as the river Chau, Tang River and the Shima River, and white ocean starch, with a cumulative total of 1.75 billion cubic metres of ecological refilling of the river and lake.
Hebei province seized the opportunity of the North-South Midway project to increase the flow of water and used the river to carry out ecological water recharge to rivers such as Tang, Sand and Yong.
At the same time, nine large- and medium-sized reservoirs, such as the Western Ocean, the East Wuss, and the White Ocean-to-Yang River and the Blue Dragon River have been used for ecological recharge, which has accumulated over 90 square kilometres.
In order to ensure ecological water recharge, the Water Department of Hebei Province has been active in organizing the discharge, remediation and cleaning of rivers, refining physical measures and enhancing surveillance and supervision.
The timely resolution of problems through supervised inspections and intensive unannounced visits ensures that the water recharge is safe and orderly.
According to the responsible officials of the Water Department of Hebei Province, the orderly implementation of the ecological recharge of the river and lake has resulted in the effective restoration of the river and lake ecosystems in Hebei Province, the promotion of the restoration and cultivation of the coastal groundwater and the significant improvement of the habitat and economic development environment along the routes, which is important for the conservation of the river and lake management objectives of “water clean, green, smooth and beautiful”.
In the past two weeks, the number of new crown cases has risen significantly in Spain, with thousands of new cases occurring in many days.
In the evening of Saturday (25 July), the British Government decided that Spain would be removed from the security travel list, with 14 days of isolation for those entering the United Kingdom from Spain, starting at 00:00 local time.
British tourists on vacation in Spain have been surprised, worried and even angry at the decision, as news has been unexpected.
The British Minister of Transport, Grant Shapps, is also reported to be on holiday in Spain.
Prior to the release of the isolation measures by the United Kingdom, Norway had also announced a 10-day isolation for returnees from Spain.
France and Belgium recommended that their residents abandon their plans for vacations in and around Barcelona.
The beaches in these areas are overcrowded and unable to maintain social distance between people, and the police once needed to take measures to reduce the number of beach tourists.
Tourism is a major pillar of Spain.
Spain: It's safe here.
In response to the decision taken by the United Kingdom, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated on Sunday that the epidemic in the country was under control.
The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Arancha Gonzalez Laya, stressed to the media that " Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists. "
The Spanish Government will try to persuade the British Government to exclude the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands from the isolation measures.
The reason for this is that the infection rates in the two tourist resorts are much lower than those in the British mainland.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Spanish Catalonia region has also re-established its "failure order".
Tourism is an important pillar of Spain, one of the most popular resorts for British tourists.
This decision by the United Kingdom is expected to significantly affect Spain ' s tourism industry.

Mid-Turn Day: Beijing will not be hot and hot for a while.
On July 26th, Xinhua's Beijing news service (journalist Nixin Jin) marked the first day of this year's “middle ambush”.
In the early hours of the 26th, heavy weather weather was turned against the storm and the heat and heat that had swept over the Beijing region would continue for several days.
At 1100 hours, the Beijing Meteorological Observatory announced that there were scattered showers (accompanied by weak thunder) in Beijing on 26 June, with a maximum temperature of only 27°C, ranging from small to medium rain at night (accompanied by weak lightning) and a minimum temperature of 23°C at night.
However, from 24 to 25 years ago, the city of Beijing was in the middle of a high-temperature blue warning, with a high daily temperature of around 37°C in most areas and high temperatures of over 40°C in the area.
Voltage is the highest, wet and hottest day of the year, with “three volts” a year, the hottest in the middle, as the Chinese people call it “hard summer”.
During the ambush, the house was filled with barns and the civilian population had the term “twisted dumplings on two sides”.
According to current forecasts, over the next three days there will be heavy rain in Beijing.
The meteorological services are alerting the public to minimize mountain travel and to avoid geological disasters.
It is understood that this year's “midwar” will be 20 days from 26 July to 14 August.
When caught in the middle, people feel weak and hungry.
The choice of foods such as green beans and thorium, which have thermal and accommodative function, as well as bitter foods such as bitter vegetables and bitter melons, can help to improve appetite and de-summer.
The engine could shut down.
The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on 24 December, requiring an emergency inspection of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737 NG and 737 Classic passenger aircraft registered in the United States, on the grounds that the erosion of the aircraft ' s air-closure valves could lead to engine parking in the air.
According to the Federal Aviation Office, four reports of air parking of 737 NG and 737 Classic passenger engines have been received so far, leading to an urgent inspection request for passenger aircraft parked for seven consecutive days or more and for passenger aircraft that have so far flown less than 11 times after re-entry.
The Federal Aviation Agency warned that if all the 5th stop valves of the passenger engines were corrupted, they might be stuck in the opening position, resulting in a complete loss of power and inability to restart the engine.
This aviation regulator ordered that, once the stop valves were found to be corrupted, the air operator must replace this critical component before the passenger aircraft is again operational.
Boeing responded later that day that the outbreak of the new coronary outbreak had led to a reduction in the need for travel, resulting in a number of passenger aircraft being blocked or less used, and that the “closure valves were more vulnerable to erosion.”
Boeing also stated that it had been recommended to the air operator to inspect the passenger aircraft covered by the instructions and that if problems were identified, Boeing would provide assistance in such areas as overhauling and replacing stop valves.
The Associated Press reports that major United States air operators usually fly multiple flights within one day, but that a large number of passenger aircraft have stopped following the outbreak of the new coronary outbreak; some of them are back in operation as the demand for passenger travel has recently grown slowly.
The Federal Aviation Administration did not issue details of four air parking reports.
One of the incidents was disclosed later on 24 March by Alaska Airlines.
In the statement, the air operator stated that on 15 July, a passenger aircraft under the flag was on its way from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, where an engine suddenly went off and the passenger aircraft eventually landed at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines stated that the engine of the passenger aircraft had been replaced and that the engine of the six passenger aircraft had been inspected as instructed by the Federal Aviation Office.
U.S. Airways, U.S. Airways and South-West Airlines stated, respectively, that there was no engine outage of the associated air valves.
Four American Airlines passenger aircraft will be inspected and 28 United Airlines will be inspected.
Dharma Airlines stated that it would inspect 20 passenger aircraft under the flag, but did not state whether the engine had been shut down.
According to several media reports, the Federal Aviation Agency's Emergency Airworthiness Directive was another impact on Boeing.
In October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, a Boeing 737MAX aircraft belonging to Indonesian Lions Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines lost 346 lives.
This series of passenger aircraft subsequently ceased to fly globally, ceased production in January and resumed production in May this year.
In June, the Director of the Federal Aviation Authority, Steve Dixon, admitted that the Federal Aviation Administration had made a “mistake” in the supervision of Boeing with regard to the 737 MAX passenger aircraft.
We're on next week.
I've got new art on the line.
The interactive knowledge-sharing programme, Dingdong On-line! How are you?
It is understood that the programme will create a new full-age youth class and that a class of talented and talented teachers will be in play and challenge the production of interesting knowledge.
Unlike previous serious impressions in the minds of the community of teachers, Tink On-line!
They are both young intellectual role models from a variety of disciplines, and a group of all-powerful “diggers” who can shake the burden and teach pleasure.
In the programme, these excellent youth knowledge role models as “knowledge-sharing officers” will challenge interesting knowledge classes.
They need to impress the audience in the field by displaying the most interesting aspects of their discipline through an attitudeful knowledge output.
And the fact that the Quakers, a group of all-age viewers, are on the scene raises the issue of change, making it more difficult for the `knowledge-sharing officers' to teach, and adding a slightly stimulating atmosphere to the programme.
It was revealed that among the “knowledge-sharing officers” in this event were leading young teachers, such as Li Yong Lok, a physics teacher in secondary schools attached to the People's University of China, Zhang Xue-fung, a research examiner, and Wang Zheng, a historical teacher with 10 years of experience, who would display their “hard core” knowledge of various disciplines to an unexpected audience.
In addition, Professor Xue Um Fong, Professor of Economics, was invited to act as the “founder of knowledge” for the programme, to join the “Dingdong Aides” Doo Hae-tao and Kamong Jia, to talk with the audience about youth and to create “Open classes for all”.
Chief of the Political Affairs Department of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: The situation is serious.
Zhang Jianzong, Chief of the Department of Political Affairs of the Hong Kong SAR Government, stated on 26 July that the new coronary pneumonia epidemic in Hong Kong continues to be serious and that if the epidemic deteriorates, the HKSAR Government will take firmer control measures to further restrict the opening of business and reduce public space.
At this stage, however, it is not the intention of the HKSAR Government to impose a “home order” or a “ban order” to restrict public travel.
On the same day, Zhang Jianzheng published a post entitled " The situation is dire and we must fight the disease " .
He said that the epidemic was the worst in six months and that the next two weeks would be crucial, and that every effort should be made to prevent further spread of the virus in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the HKSAR Government, citizen self-regulation and cooperation are also important.
He called on citizens to stay at home as much as possible, to reduce social contacts and to eat outside.
Citizens should cooperate in the protection of themselves and others by means of coercive measures with masks, with a focus on personal and environmental hygiene and on hand-washing, and should, inter alia, suspend and reduce to the streets the non-essential gathering of relatives or friends.
He stated that the Centre had been very concerned about the change in Hong Kong's epidemic and had supported the Government's efforts to combat the disease, and had responded positively to the Chief Executive's latest request for assistance in increasing its detection capacity and in retrofitting the work of the Asian International Expo to provide a similar “Stairwell Hospital”.
According to Zhang, free viral tests provided by the HKSAR Government to specific high-risk groups, i.e. residential homes, residential and nursing staff, restaurant workers, taxi drivers and property managers, have been fully implemented, involving up to 400,000 people.
He is concerned about cases of infection in residential homes, where the HKSAR Government has arranged specific temporary quarantine centres for alumni.
He indicated that the HKSAR Government was constructing quarantine facilities near the Bay of Bamboo Quarantine Centre, located on the New Territories Grand Mount, and that an additional 700 isolation units were expected by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on 19 September that the HKSAR Government would construct an additional 2,000 isolation units at the Bay of Penny Quarantine Centre and try to complete them by the end of this year.
Together with the 800 units already in operation at the quarantine centre, the Bay of Bamboo Quarantine Centre is expected to provide a total of 3,500 shelters by the end of the year.
There are currently four operating quarantine centres in Hong Kong, which provide approximately 2,600 shelters.
In addition, the HKSAR Government reactivated the Carpgate Park resort in Hong Kong as a community isolation facility for persons under 50 years of age who are self-reliant.
The "Nutalizer" of the regular party history, the New China history - the China New Net.
Source: People ' s Forum Network.
In recent days, when visiting the Memorial Museum of the Fourth Ping War, General Secretary Xi has stressed: “One and a half billion people, more than 90 million party members, especially leaders at all levels, will learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of the new China. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Carefully studying the history of the party and the history of the new China is an essential lesson for party members to learn about their mission and to learn from it, so that they can enrich and nurture their family, so that they can take advantage of the new era.
The history of a vast party, the history of New China, records the hard work and glorious journey of the Chinese Communist Party since its birth, demonstrating its belief in life and blood, its loyalty and its abiding duty.
History is the best textbook, and party history and New China history are the most impressive chapters of this textbook for party cadres.
Each party member's cadre is constantly strengthening historical thinking about history and the way forward, building on the new mission of a new journey to bring up the “wields” of the times and to take the long march of the present generation.
The spirit of history has been the first to learn the history of the party and the history of the new China.
The history of the party, the history of the new China, is full of the Chinese Communist Party’s unfailing initial mission and its firmness as a rock, demonstrating the pristine affection of the Communists with their people forever.
Close access to party history, important events in the history of the new China, important conferences, important figures is not only an intuitive shock to the mind, a baptism of thought, but also a deep understanding of the meanings of the original faith and the weight of the mission.
For party cadres, it is necessary to find out where we left off from the history of the Party, the history of the New China, and the roots of our initial hearts, to maintain a clear sense of awareness and firmness, to stir up the power of the country to fight for its people, and to ensure that the blood and life of the revolution’s predecessors are passed on to the Red Gang and Shan generation.
It is wise to learn the history of the party and the history of the new China.
Since the establishment of the Communist Party of China, a series of great spirits have emerged, including the spirit of the Red Ship, the spirit of Iiokayama, the spirit of the Long March, the spirit of Yanan, the spirit of resistance, the spirit of Sipapo, the spirit of “two-shot” and the spirit of space.
These great spiritualities, which have sunk in history, provide a powerful spiritual incentive for our party to overcome risk challenges on the way forward and are invaluable spiritual assets that cannot be broken, dispersed and looted.
The process of learning party history and Chinese history is a process of renewal and self-spiriting of these spiritualities. It is a process of self-empowerment that must reflect the noble spirit of the revolutionary ancestors, uphold the spiritual homeland of the Communists, build firm spiritual bases for the advancement of great causes and dreams, and regenerate and promote these spiritualities to a new era.
The history of learning about party history and the history of the new China is constantly being corrupted.
For party cadres, there has never been a single chapter of history that can bring deeper warning, inspiration and inspiration than party history and the history of the new China.
In the history of the Party and the New China, we can see both the great deeds of the older revolutionaries who have dedicated themselves to their faith and struggle to achieve the goals set, and the profound lessons that some people have come to the opposite side of the Revolution because of their idealistic convictions, and the inspiration and warning that with firm determination and will we will never rest and never cease, that we will always have a strong spirit of struggle, and that we will continue to be pure.
To truly become a strong believer and a faithful practicer of the far-reaching ideals of communism, it is necessary to fade away from the idea of “dust” and to guard against “dirty.” Party history and the history of the new China should be the basis for every party member’s cadre to look at themselves and warn themselves.
To learn the history of the party and the history of the new China, to take up the task of the time.
General Secretary Xi has stated that “learning party history and national history is a compulsory course in maintaining and developing Chinese socialism and continuing the Party and the nation's causes”.
Looking back at history, bowing to the heart for glory and for the future.
Each party member's cadre should use the history of the party and the history of the new China as a lifelong quest to keep its course in learning, shoulder its historic mission in their respective jobs, be responsible and be proactive.
In the midst of the great revival of the Chinese nation, writing has become one of its own luminous acts.
"Seoking Gangnam" pursues poetry, "The Yellow River Dream" - a new net.
"Segawa Gangnam" pursues the poetry of "The Yellow River Dream"
On July 26th, the Chinese news agency, Yondi, “The Nine Rivers of Mandarin, The Waves and the Winds of the World”.
The Yellow River, which has aroused so many humans, has created a beautiful and rich Ning Ha plain. Today, the beautiful Ning Ha, known as "Sai Hae-nam", is upholding the concept of “ecological priority, green development” and pursuing the poetic dream of the Yellow River.
"Beibo Dream" by the Riverwater Show
The Yellow River, which is 397 km through Ningxia, is the “mother's river” for one of the caregivers.
However, with rapid advances in industrialization and urbanization, there is an imbalance between river and lake exploitation and management protection, with the emergence of disturbances such as over-plaining, lake-building, encroachment on waters, resulting in black stench of water, high water quality, environmental mess and ecological degradation.
Ningxia is now promoting the restoration of the biodiversity of the water and is working to restore the Yellow River to its cleanliness.
Water must come from the source.
In Ningxiashikawa, the industrial parks have been completely centralized in terms of “postmarks + anti-fouling + tight water”, municipal sewage treatment plants have been fully compliant with level 1A standards, urban areas have been completely eliminated from the black stench of water, and a third batch of China's black stench model cities has been successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia, which introduced a river- and lake-long system in 2017, has now achieved full coverage of the river- and lake-long system of responsibility at the district and village levels and has become the norm.
Guo Jin Sung, 64 years old, lived in a village by the Yellow River, and he witnessed the change of the Yellow River: “The previous water smelled, and after treatment, the smell was gone.”
Gu Jin Sing says that the ecological environment is good and his life is better, and now he walks with his family to feel the blue sky.
"Wetland Dream" by the sandgulls.
Flying Birds, Green Trees, Walls, Waters... ..the beauty of the “saga of sandgulls” under Van's pen became a reality in the Yellow River wetlands park in Ningxia Silver River.
Yellow rivers pass through the Ningxia, along which many wetlands, such as river wetlands, lake wetlands and marsh wetlands, are formed. They play an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and the ecological balance of water. They also serve as important international routes for bird migration.
Since 2009, Ningxia-related departments have invested approximately RMB 34.5 billion in projects to protect wetlands. At present, the area of the Sinkawa wetlands is 19.2 million hectares, the rate of wetland protection is 78.5 per cent, there are nearly 200 natural lakes, marshes, five national wetlands parks, one national urban wetlands park, six autonomous wetlands parks and eight municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, Deputy Director of the Wetland Conservation Centre in Sinkawa City, told journalists that wetland conservation had increased biodiversity, particularly in birds, “the swarms are endangered birds, with only 20,000 birds worldwide, of which Sinkawa wetlands inhabit more than 2,000”.
At the same time, Ningxia has legally assigned a 500-metre red line to the area of wetland protection on both sides of the Yellow River Milkyon Region, which stipulates that, except for public goods, no unit or individual may engage in development and business activities within the protected area.
Zhao Xiaoyong, Deputy Director of the Water Services Centre in Silverkawa City, described the fact that, through the management of pollution sources, the integrated management of the lake's ecology and the construction of the end wetlands, 100 per cent of the quality of the nine Ningxia mainly into the yellow drain has now been met by the category IV standard. “The water is now clear, fish are swimming and flowers are blooming.”
"Dream of Drinking Water"
The city of Ningxia Yinchuan had the name of “unusual”: the only city along the Yellow City that was “drinking water from the Yellow River”.
Since 2010, the city has been facing a continuing shortage of water at its peak in the summer. The “water shortage” of the last decade has been a painful experience for many high-rise residents in the summer, but water scarcity has become a problem for the city, given the fact that major water sources are over-extracted and that large areas of groundwater overabundance have been created underground in the city.
Thanks to the improvement in the quality of the Yellow River, the use of purified Yellow River water is a good solution to the drinking problems of the local population.
Mr. Din Ming, Deputy Director of the Silver River Water Authority, Ningxia, in order to improve the production of water for urban and rural residents, launched a timely water supply project for urban and rural western areas of the Silver River Metropolitan Circle, replacing the original groundwater source with high-quality yellow river water.
“On 29 December 2019, the water supply project was officially distributed to the three districts of the city of Sengchuan and, in 2020, residents of the town of Banning and Holand also drank of the Yellow River. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Din Ming said that the Sinkawa Water Sector would take into account the regional adaptation of integrated rural water supply with urban water supply in an integrated manner and that “the next step would be for us to integrate all scattered rural water points into the West Line water supply project, which is expected to achieve almost integrated urban and rural water supply in the Sinkawa region by the end of this year”.
Strengthening disaster response in all sectors - the new network
Increased responsibility for disaster relief in all sectors
News from the Ministry of Water Services (JW): At 1200 hours today (25 July), the river below the Yangtze River Dry Dam is over-alert at 0.64-3.31 metres, the river below the Yangtze Mid-Range Dry Stream is over-alert at 0.05-2.02 metres.
Lake Tai has been on alert for 28 days since 28 June.
Today, at 1200 hours, the average water level in Taihu was 4.67 metres, with a super-guaranteed water level of 0.02 metres.
Today, the National Council for the Prevention of War decided to maintain the Yangtze and Wei River Defence II-level response by holding local authorities accountable for the further implementation of disaster relief efforts.
Today, the Office of National Defence, the Ministry of Emergency Response and Management has urgently seconded Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian professional drainage trucks to help Jiangxi address local problems such as flooding in cities caused by heavy rainfall.
For the first time, the United States launched a countervailing survey on China with an “undervalued RMB exchange rate”
In response to a recent announcement by the United States Department of Commerce, it was decided to launch an anti-dumping countervailing investigation into Zatra (belt belt) products originating in China and an investigation into the “undervalued RMB exchange rate” project.
The Ministry of Commerce of China stated that this was the first time that the United States had investigated the so-called “underestimation of the RMB exchange rate” project in a countervailing neutral case, which China strongly opposed.
In particular, the Ministry of Commerce issued a press release on the night of the 23rd meeting in which it stated that China had introduced a system of regulated floating exchange rates based on demand and supply, with reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market played a decisive role in exchange rate formation.
The press release emphasized that the exchange rate of the renminbi was generally at a reasonable level of equilibrium and was not underestimated.
Since 2005, the renminbi has accumulated an appreciation of over 17 per cent against the United States dollar.
According to data published by the Bank for International Settlements, between the beginning of 2005 and May 2020, the effective exchange rate of the renminbi appreciated by 38 per cent and the real effective exchange rate by 49 per cent, the strongest currency of the G-20 economies and one of the largest currencies globally.
The Department of Commerce noted that the exchange rate issue went beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations under World Trade Organization rules.
In February this year, the United States amended its legislation to conduct countervailing investigations of foreign exchange rates, which have been criticized for violating WTO rules.
The press release stated that even under United States legislation, there were numerous errors in the content of the applicant ' s complaint, which did not have the necessary countervailing elements, such as financial support, benefit award and exclusivity.
China urges the United States to comply with existing international rules and to stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called “underestimation of the RMB exchange rate”.
Increased tensions in relations between China and the United States led to a sharp drop in the 22-day exchange rate between offshore and the United States dollar, both of which fell at a level of 7.0 yuan.
Whether this move by the United States Department of Commerce is intended to push the renminbi up is a matter of concern.
The current exchange rate of the renminbi against the United States dollar rose by 7.0 to 6.9961 on 23 days.
The median value of the RMB against the United States dollar, which is officially regulated, was reduced by 17 basic points on 24 days, to 6.9938.
As the epidemic gradually improved, the film industry, which had been silent for almost six months, was returning to normal.
Previously, the 26th Shanghai Television Festival Organizing Committee published the shortlist of the White Tamran Prize.
In terms of the best male and female actors, there is an absolute advantage in the number of male and female elites: Reigaing, Chen Po, Zhang Joo-ryu, Sun Hong Lei, Huang Zheng will compete for the best male actor, and Haiqing, Mai-Sik, Qin Hae-sung, Sun Qin and Yani will compete for the best female actress.
The results will be officially available on 7 August.
From the point of view of the high examination, the real-life educational feature of the “China-style family” television show, Little Joy, received six nominations for the title “Best Chinese television show”, “Best director”, “Best writer”, “Best female lead”, and “Best male/female mix”.
The “best male and female protagonists” prize has always been one of the focus of attention, and this year's competition has also been intense. The male and female actors in this category are the greatest actors in power.
Chen Po, Huang Cai, Sun Hong Lei are well-qualified middle-school actors, Reigai, age 37, is also a powerful actor, and Zhang Joo-chung, age 32, is among the youngest to enter.
In 2016, 34-year-old Huo won the White Tamran Prize for the best actor and became the youngest lookout in the award, a record that Zhang Zhang would have updated if he had won over several other predecessors this year.
The competition for the best female protagonists was also determined to be one of the most popular actresses in the film industry, such as Haiqing, Mai-Star, Qin Haiyan, Sun Qin and Yani.
It is worth mentioning that Sun Zheng came under the auspices of the House of Peace, which is the sixth time that she has been nominated for the award, and that in 2014 and 2016 she was twice decapitated as the “best actress” with the words “Preliminary Mom” and “Most Moon”.

Data show that, to date, Brazil has the second highest cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths globally, after the United States.
The state of São Paulo, where the epidemic is most severe, has cumulatively confirmed nearly 480,000 cases and more than 20,000 deaths.
More than 160,000 cases were diagnosed in the states of Ceará and Rio de Janeiro and 150,000 in the states of Pará and Bahia respectively.
More than 110,000 cases were confirmed in Maranhão and Minas Gerunas.
The Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Marcelo Krivilla, announced on 25 December that the city had decided to cancel the celebration of the 2021 New Year in view of the spread of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic in Brazil and the fact that no effective vaccine was yet available.
In the past, the city celebrated the famous Copacabana Beach at the beginning of the New Year at 0:00, and the New Year ' s event, the last day of 2019, attracted 2.9 million people.
At the same time, the city decided to postpone the Carnival in 2021 from February to September.
The Mayor of São Paulo, Bruno Corvas, announced on 24 December that he would cancel the city ' s inter-annual celebration scheduled for 31 December this year on Paulista Street and postpone the carnival of 2021 until the end of May or early July next year.
The Venezuelan Foreign Minister accused the United States of fabricating a false attack on China -- Xinhua Network.
Aleazar said that the recent constant political, diplomatic, economic and public pressure by the United States Government on China was a baseless attack on a sovereign State.
Areaza transmitted the tweets and comments of the Chinese Ambassador to Venezuela, Li Boong, on his personal account earlier that day.
In its tweets, Li Boong said that China strongly condemned the forcible entry of the United States into the Chinese Consulate-General in Houston, which constituted a serious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the Treaty between China and the United States of America, to which China would respond with due and necessary attention.
Government officials such as Vice-President Rodríguez of Venezuela, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs for North America, Carlos Long, well-known members of society and journalists from the mainstream media, have also transmitted tweets from Lee Bo-Yung, condemning the United States for its serious violations of international law.
The fifth State of the Nation address (SONA) was issued by Philippine President Dootelt on 26th of the year, on which the Philippines cumulatively confirmed more than 80,000 new cases of coronary pneumonia, including an increase in the number of confirmed cases by staff of the Presidential Information Department (PCOO) and its immediate agencies to 25.
To that end, PCOO has prepared a working group, which has not been in contact with identified staff, to coordinate the press release of SONA by President Doutelt.
Minister PCOO Martin Andanal, in an interview with DZBB, stated that two packages had been prepared for President Doutelt to publish SONA modalities.
According to Plan A, SONA will be published in the afternoon of 27 Doutelt in the Philippine Congress building in Quezon City.
As a result of the epidemic, only 50 seats were set aside for some members of the Cabinet and legislators, with separate video conference rooms for other Cabinet members, local government officials, etc.
All participants were able to enter the National Assembly Building on the same day through rapid testing.
Once one of the participants tested positive, Plan B was launched, whereby President Doutelt published SONA at the Presidential Palace in Malakal, with fewer hearing seats on site.

LEWIS FAMILY: John Lewis is a warrior who fights for the weakest.
John Lewis, a member of the United States Congress, was remembered as a fighter “to fight for the weakest” at his memorial on Saturday (25 July).
A public memorial to Lewis has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There are two memorials on the first day.
On Saturday, at a public memorial at the University of Troy, Alabama, five brothers and sisters of Lewis and a grandson spoke of a man who was full of love, fearless and family-oriented.
The youngest brother of Lewis, Henry “Grant”, Lewis, said at the meeting, “He's dedicated his life to helping others.”
Samuel Lewis said that his mother had warned John “not to cause trouble, not to cause trouble”.
He added that John did not heed the mother's warning, saying, “We all know that John always gets in trouble, always gets in trouble, but that's because he's sticking to the right thing, and that's good trouble.”
The brothers and sisters of Lewis remind people at the memorial that John's most famous argument is to create “good trouble”, that is, not to avoid causing trouble in the interests of justice.
John had applied for the University of Troy (Troy University), where he was born in Troy, Alabama, but at that time the University of Troy, which was all white schools, refused his application.
John Lewis, who was evangelizing chickens on his farm as a child, later obtained a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Many years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones, a congressional senator from Alabama, said that the current protesters “are protesting peacefully and non-violently”, as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said, "Even though President Trump knocked over a boat and described all the protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more equal nation.”
A six-day series of events to commemorate Lewis will culminate this week at the funeral in Georgia.
On Saturday, Lewis' coffin was stopped at a public memorial at the University of Troy, and people came to pay tribute to the civil rights movement pioneer.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge of Selma.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators demanding the right to vote of the black people were beaten in front of the bridge by the Alabama State police, who also gave tear gas to the demonstrators.
Lewis was almost killed.
The day after that is called “bloody Sunday”.
Lewis' remains will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk and finish this last journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials are required to wear masks and maintain social distance when requesting public participation.
The Governor of Alabama, Kay Ivey, ordered half a flag down on Saturdays and Sundays to commemorate Lewis.
In the commemoration of almost a week, Lewis ' remains will be divided into the Alabama State Council Building in the city of Montgomery, the Georgia State Council Building in Atlanta, and the United States Congress Building in Washington for a short period of time for the public to express their condolences.
The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, announced last week that one could come to the United States Congress Building on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
As a result of the coronary virus epidemic, a public event in memory of Lewis will be held outdoors.

In recent days, during his visit to Jilin province, the General Secretary of Xi emphasized the need to strengthen party leadership, promote the extension of party organizations to the grass-roots level, improve the working system of grass-roots party organizations and provide strong guarantees for governance in urban and rural communities.
Insisting on party-building as a leader and bringing party leadership into all aspects of grass-roots governance is a fundamental requirement in the direction of grass-roots governance.
To raise the level of governance at the grass-roots level, to insist on party leadership, to promote the political, organizational and mass-work advantages of the party by reinforcing political leadership, building a war fortress and rallying red forces, and to channel party strength and advocacy to the “neuro end” “last kilometre”.
Focusing on calcium-making and strengthening political leadership.
Strengthening the political leadership of grass-roots governance requires the implementation of the calcium replanting project.
It is important to take a long-term approach to building the Party's permanent agenda and the life cycle of its members and cadres, and to strengthen the principle of reading the original language. It is also important to continue to promote the Party's innovative ideas through thematic training, batch training, seminars and discussion halls. It is also important to encourage the party's cadres to further strengthen their “four consciousness”, “four self-confidence”, “two defence” and to perform their duties better.
Through a combination of online and sub-lined learning methods, educational channels have been expanded to guide grass-roots party organizations and party cadres to integrate learning into everyday life and to focus on learning.
Focusing on practical exercise, addressing the critical issues in the field of grass-roots governance, addressing the concerns of the population, the concerns and concerns of the population, and building party identity and capacity.
Hold on to the rules, build a battle fort.
Grass-roots party organizations are both an important component of grass-roots governance systems and an important vehicle for demonstrating governance capacity.
In order to promote the institutionalization of grass-roots party organizations, starting with the rules governing the work of the party branches, the leadership of the focused party organizations has been weakened and weakened, and the foundations, panels and platforms for development have been established through the establishment of a mechanism for linkage between the top and the bottom levels, the creation of innovative branches, the consolidation of the general situation, the establishment of sound decision-making processes and the provision of services to the public.
In rural areas, the standardization of the organization of the village parties is being strengthened, the standard of construction is being standardized with the party branches, the form of organization, learning activities and management mechanisms are being regulated, and the implementation of the “three-part lesson” and thematic party day activities is being promoted.
In cities, focus on street communities, explore innovative branching, focus on areas of weakness, “blocks”, “push points”, and actively build the Cities Party Alliance to achieve effective coverage of its work.
At the same time, institutional mechanisms for governance at the grass-roots level have been put in place to improve the system of governance at the grass-roots level, to improve the mechanisms for decision-making, which are co-opted, co-ordinated, urgent, co-ordinated and organized by grass-roots parties, to improve the mechanisms for outreach to party members' cadres, to bring together the people in the service of the people, to increase the sense of access, happiness, honour and pride of party members and to make governance at the grass-roots level more warm.
Play a pioneering role, rallying red forces.
Basic party cadres are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
(c) Upgrading grass-roots governance capacity, with emphasis on strengthening the governance capacity of grass-roots party cadres, focusing on the role of “red cell” as a model leader in grass-roots governance, bringing red forces together at the forefront of outreach to the population.
It is essential to strengthen the capacity for governance as a mandatory course for members of the party at the grass-roots level, to constantly strengthen intellectual skills, professional training and practical exercise, to promote commitment in their positions of responsibility and in their urgent tasks, and to contribute to strengthening the foundations of the system of governance and its modernization.
A wide range of “community whistle-blowing, party members reporting” activities are carried out, involving party members in community-building, management and services through participation in thematic party days, outreach to hard-to-reach people, identification of service lines, advocacy and sound advice.
In order to play its full role as an active member of the rural non-governmental organization, it is important to ensure that members of the community at the grass-roots level are actively involved in the fight against poverty, in the construction of the environment, in the maintenance of correspondence and in the prevention of burning, and that the red forces are better integrated into the service of the population.
The foundation is solid.
The grass-roots party organization is the foundation of the ruling building.
It is only by maintaining a strong focus on close party affiliation and increasing the well-being of the people, and by using party leadership as a fundamental means of promoting innovative development of governance at the grass-roots level, that the foundation can be firmly established, with grass-roots party organizations pulling out and holding up, with cadres coming up and running up to promote “the spirit”, order, strength and effectiveness of governance at the grass-roots level.

Coco Sicily hides antelopes into the migration season - Xinhua Network
On 25 July, a reporter from Xinhua Xinning, a journalist, received information from the five protection stations of the Coco Sili administration of the Yangtze National Park Authority, that monitoring indicated that the hideaways who had previously travelled to the Zoroa Lake region of Coco Sicire to migrate to their children were beginning to return to their homes with their young children.
On 25 July, some 40 females led three young children of the herd through the 3002 km of the hidden road and the five northern bridges of the hidden railway, which have begun to relocate, according to surveillance footage near the five beam protection stations.
Expert analysis shows that in recent years, the number of young children with antelopes in the herd of sheep has accounted for between one quarter and one fifth of the total number of herds.
The Vice-Researcher of the Northwestern Highlands Institute of Biological Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences added that: “In the early days of their return, the Tibetan antelopes were at higher risk of being arrested for food, so that the number of young children in the herd would be relatively small and possibly even without them”.
According to the Kosiri Administration of the Yangtzeen National Parks Administration, the total number of returnees of the Tibetan antelopes is rising from year to year, to 4860 in 2019, an increase of 338 over 2018.
“It is expected that this year's return of antelopes will end in early September and that the number of antelopes will continue to increase.”
Antelopes are protected at the national level.
At the end of May each year, Tibetan antelopes from the three rivers of the Qinghai Sea, Tibet ' s Tong and Xinjiang ' s Archin Mountains travel to the Zoroa lake, which is located in the interior of Cocoxi.
Our expert in the protection of antelopes, U Xiaomin, a researcher at the Institute of Animals of Shaanxi Province (NWFP), said: “The return of antelopes is the process of returning young children to their habitat after the birth of the female. The group of returnees who had initially left the land of origin was large, but the herds would then return to their habitat on a different geographical basis and along different routes.”
In order to ensure the safe return of the herds, journalists learned that the cocoa management department of the Yangtze National Park Authority had arranged for staff to conduct continuous video surveillance and district patrols in the main areas of return.
In the event that an oryx flock is found to be attempting to cross the road, the rangers will, at the first moment, perform temporary traffic controls to allow the herd to pass safely through the wildlife passages and to ensure that they are not subjected to as much human interference as possible on their return journey.
So, how does everyday life work?
Experts suggested that summer trips should avoid high temperature periods and that it would be preferable not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, as the sun was strongest and the possibility of heat strikes was higher.
If it is necessary to go out during this period, it is essential to do protective work, such as obscuring an umbrella, wearing a suncap and sunglasses, with the best conditions to wear sunscreen to prevent sun damage.
To the extent possible, clothing is selected using light, air-transmitting cotton, lumber, silk and less fibre-optic clothing, so as to prevent the timely spread of heat and heat during heavy sweat.
In high-temperature and hot weather, sufficient water should be prepared to drink in time and not wait for thirst to drink, because once a thirst is felt that the body is already short of water, each time the water is contained in 150 to 200 ml, the water is warm, and no ice water.
Based on the high and low temperatures, the average person drinks 1.5 to 2 litres per day, while the high-temperature worker drinks 3 to 5 litres per day.
When sweat is higher, some salt water can be appropriately replenished to compensate for the loss of salt from sweat.
In addition, in the summer, the human body is prone to potassium deficiency, causing fatigue and fatigue, and potassium tea is an excellent cooling drink.
During the summer, more vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc.; fresh fruits, such as peaches, almonds, watermelons, melons, etc., have 80 to 90 per cent moisture content, which can be used to supplement water; dairy products can fill both the water and the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high-temperature environments should be adequately supplemented with drinks containing potassium, magnesium, etc.
The summers are short, the temperatures are high, the body is rich in metabolism and is consuming and vulnerable to fatigue.
Adequate sleep relaxes the brain and body systems, both for work and learning, and for heat prevention.
According to the experts, the best bedtime is between 2200 and 2300 and the best time to get up is between 5.30 and 6.30.
Be careful not to lie in the air conditioner vents and electric fans in order to avoid air conditioners and heat and wind.
The experts recommend that a group of people who operate outdoors or perform high-temperature operations may carry 10 drops of anti-summer medicine, such as water, humans, fragrance or oscillating airballs, or be placed in the nearest workplace for use at any time in case of heat.
Graduate art exhibition moved into the mall for public goods exhibition - Xinhua Network
During the “mud graduation” season of universities, a rare undergraduate art exhibition began on the weekend.
However, it is neither in the gallery nor on the campus, but is present in the public space of the city of Taiyuan and is open free to the public until 23 August.
The journalists learned that the 2020 graduate art exhibition brought together 50 works/groups of 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the China Media University and the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition space was extended from two to six floors, making full use of the lampbox in the building for the display of graphic works and making maximum use of the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
In the context of the epidemic, the exhibition was particularly significant.
“We have chosen to take the graduation to the cloud to the bottom of the line, and we hope that more people will see young people's exploration and understanding of the world, and that the healing power of art for society and the mind will be amplified.”
She revealed that the exhibition was a collection of graduates of several major art institutions, from which they selected suitable for commercial space, in the form of traditional shelf paintings, sculptures, new media devices, interactive drawings, VR panorama, with the greatest volume and richness in the past year.
Among them, Lee Yunshaw expressed his feelings about the epidemic in the first battle of 2020 through a combination of mechanical and manual writings; Liu Jia-hyun explored the themes of “encrypted currency”, “credit creation”, “trading”; Zhang Jialong's Catwood and Qu Daqiang were animals who were often associated with human beings and in which young artists could see their understanding of human-animal relations; and Chu's work, “Wind of Faith - Gifts”, was a reminder to growing young people that “when one day's career came to fruition, remember that it was pure and sincere”.
Among the few graduates who have made their own appearances, there is Li Hyuncai, from the sculpture department of Tianjin College of Fine Arts.
“I came to Beijing on 7 July, when I was actually worried about the epidemic, and three days earlier I had a nucleic acid test, which was displayed with alcohol cotton and a test report.”
His work " Yesterday as a Mystery" is complex and must be personal.
At the same time, he was also tasked with helping his classmates repair damaged works.
“It is a pity that the display will be held until 4:30 a.m. and then it will be patched up.
He hoped that when the epidemic became more stable, he would come to Beijing with his classmates to see his work.

The University of Australia has developed a new drug that is expected to be used to treat a new coronal-induced blood-traffic net.
Researchers at the University of Monash, Australia, Xinhua, on July 26, Sydney (journalist Chen Woo) are developing a new drug that will help prevent heart disease and strokes, and hope that it will be used to treat vascular congestion caused by the new crown virus.
Researchers have found that an enzyme in the plate accelerates the condensation of the plate before heart attack or stroke.
As a result, they have developed a drug that temporarily inhibits the condensation of blood platelets, thus avoiding vascular congestion and preventing heart disease and strokes.
According to researchers, this drug only inhibits the condensation of the blood plate when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
As studies have shown that similar vascular congestion is one of the leading causes of death among new coronary patients, researchers hope that the drug will be used in the future for the treatment of such patients.

Question: Deep tilling Sunflower Fields in Xinjiang
More than 6000 pentagon sunglasses, each 48 square metres, are organized in one circle, like a silver “sun-to-sun field”, which, in turn, reflects sunlight to a heating tower at a centre of more than 200 metres, generating electricity.
This was seen by journalists at the Hammy Melting Tower Photothermal Power Plant, a mid-electric project in the town of Chau Lake in the city of Igou, Xinjiang.
“The so-called melting tower photothermal power generation is the formation of thermal energy by the central reflection of solar light through the lens to the inhaling tower, which is then converted into electrical energy through traditional power generation technologies.”
Zhang Yong, Deputy Managing Director, China-Electro-Hami Solar Thermal Power Company Ltd., described its design rationale as similar to the solar stove used in rural areas of north-west China, which brought together solar light.
Construction of the plant began in October 2017 and the site was connected by the end of last year, covering 6,600 acres, with a total planned installation of 14,500 sunglasses.
“The greatest advantage of conventional solar power generation technologies is that they can store the accumulative heat and generate electricity at night.”
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system that the project had been configured would allow the generator team to operate continuously and steadily, free from light changes; it would also allow for rapid participation in grid peaking based on grid load peak demand.
When fully implemented, the project will result in an annual generation of 198 million degrees of electricity, saving more than 60,000 tons of standard coal annually, reducing over 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, approximately 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and providing a source of clean energy for the local environment.
In addition to this, there is another silver "sun-to-sun field" in the Shilling City Photovolt estate in Hamish City.
The Hamif light solar photovoltaic power station covers more than 2300 acres, and the 714 power plants that have been built follow the Sun and maintain a 90-degree straight angle between the sun and the spotlight.
“We use two-axis tracking PV technology and, through integrated control, all generating equipment will maintain the efficiency of the power generation by adjusting the angle to the solar altitude.”
The station's long section, Mongji, states that in light weather conditions, the power generation technology can increase the efficiency of photovoltaics by about 20 per cent over traditional ones.
In the first half of this year, the power plant has achieved more than 7 million degrees of power generation, supplementing local demand for electricity.
The Stone City Photovolt Industrial Park is currently the largest single-hub complex in Xinjiang, with the most complete type of photovoltaic industrial model, with 38 PV-based projects with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
Electricity generation completed in the first half of this year exceeded 110 million degrees, an increase of 6 per cent over the same period in 2019.
Hammy is one of the best places for solar energy in China.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megaJouries per square metre, with around 3,200 daily light hours throughout the year.
In recent years, the city has been vigorously developing the photovoltaic industry, so that it can grow sunflower fields.
Solar power generation of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been built, with the city ' s photovoltaic capacity exceeding 1.4 billion degrees in the first half of the year, an increase of about 14 per cent over the previous year.
At present, Xinjiang has more than 330 PV plants with a installed capacity of over 10 million kilowatts.
Photovoltaic power is expected to reach 15 billion degrees this year, replacing over 6 million tons of standard coal.
The police report details of the missing female university students travelling to Qinghai.
On July 26th, Xinhua's news service (Reporter Wang Kim Zhou Zhou ) recently drew the attention of the online community to the “lost connection of a female university student on a trip to Qinglewood”.
On 26 January, the Public Security Department of the Tibetan Autonomous District of Hysien Mongolia, Qinghai Province, informed that Huang Yai, a student at a Nanjing university, was still in a state of disconnection and that many police officers were actively pursuing search work along a missing area.
On 10 July 2020, the Security Division of the Public Security Department of Galmu City, Hysy County, was informed by its superiors that a student from a university in Nanjing, Huang Ho, had been travelling on Z164 from Nanjing to Galming on 5 July and had lost access to a machine on 9 July in Somandaje, Tsumalai Autonomous District, Yukki Province, Qinghai Province, in order to assist in the search.
On 6 July, at 1954 hours, Huang entered the territory of Qinghai province and arrived in the city of Galmu at 0400 hours.
On that date, at 0800 hours, one of the lost members of the United Nations was travelling in a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Galmu towards G109 and arrived at 1200 hours at the guard station in Côte d ' Ivoire, where the taxi driver returned alone, and at 1500 hours on that day, he arrived in the area of the clear water river near the Sonan Darje protection station, where he closed at 1800 hours on 9 September.
In a further investigation, the police found Huang to have passed through the Nai Jiae checkpoint at 1707 hours on 13 July.
As a result of the absence of video surveillance at the checkpoint in the city of Natra, Tibet Autonomous Region, which established a checkpoint at the southern Pass of the city of Germín, the police were unable to identify the person and the vehicle they were travelling with, and the police were able to conduct a search along the road and coordinate with the public security bureau of the city of Germín at the various checkpoints along the Tibet route.
According to the latest information, at 1 a.m. on 26 July, the Gaelming City Public Security Department organized rescue forces to carry out a search at the Frozen Spring protection station along the Qingchu road and the Sonan Daj protection station, and actively contacted Sichuan police, Tibetan police and Nanjing police to work together.
The local police expect a wide range of netizens and communities to provide timely information to the Gaelming Police and the Nanjing Gangning Police in an effort to locate the missing persons.
At the same time, the experts suggest that tourists should behave, rationally and civilizedly when travelling outdoors, keep an eye on roadside warning signs, do not venture into unattended areas, encounter emergencies and report to the police in a timely manner.
The American press has revealed the unprovoked demand that China shut down the Consulate General in Houston.
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: Observatories Author: Zhu Yan Jing
The American press has revealed the unprovoked demand that China shut down the Consulate General in Houston.
On 24 January, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the United States Embassy in China that the Chinese side had decided to withdraw its authorization for the establishment and operation of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu and had made a specific request that the Consulate General cease all operations and activities, as a counter-measure to the US ' s sudden request to close the Consulate General in Houston on 21 December.
This action by the United States Government has raised concerns and its political motives have been questioned by external media and scholars.
Why should China shut down the Consulate General?
According to various media sources, it is not clear why the United States would choose China's Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the media put it bluntly: for the election.
The United States cable news network (CNN) reported on 23 March that the American request to close China's Consulate General in Houston raised questions about its political motives.
According to the article, the catastrophic response of the United States Government to the New Crown outbreak had resulted in President Trump ' s low opinion rate in the run-up to the elections.
White House officials have claimed privately that the hard-line strategy against China was designed to save Trump’s support rate and to divert responsibility from the White House’s failure.
According to the article, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston was a “politically driven and very cautious” target chosen by the United States Government “to create a strong attitude while avoiding the risk of a major conflict”.
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that, at a time when the United States election season is approaching and the United States economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that playing the "China card" has a political advantage.
The current situation, which is “a spiralling, confrontational struggle”, is driven in part by the United States Government's domestic considerations and will only exacerbate tensions between China and the United States.
The American Broadcasting Corporation (CBS) reported that the prospect of Trump ' s re-election had been strained by the outbreak, which had repeatedly blamed China.
There is almost daily new action in the United States against the absurd rhetoric of Trump's so-called “China exploits America”.
“The importance of the Consulate General of Houston in establishing links between the two countries”
The Associated Press commented that the demand by the United States that China close its Consulate General in Houston had increased tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in the south of the United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do United States citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston expressed regret that the United States had asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston, which had played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
According to the Associated Press, this reflects the importance of the Chinese economy.
According to the website of the United States Foreign Policy magazine, this move “is part of a series of provocative initiatives that can only worsen US-China relations”.
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an East Asia expert at the American think tank Brookings Institution, as saying that since the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of anything to compare with the United States operation against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
According to Hong Kong's South China Morning Post, this move was unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
According to analysts, this move could cause persistent damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 as the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
At present, China has an embassy and five general consulates in the United States.
Russian military parade to celebrate Naval Festival - Xinhua Network
On 26 July, in St. Petersburg, Russia, a naval festival was celebrated by naval teams.
Xinhua (Mogina)
On 26 July in Moscow, Xinhua (journalist Rukinbo) the Russian fleet held a parade to celebrate the 324th anniversary of the establishment of the Russian Navy.
On the same day, Russian fleets in the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea and the Pacific Ocean held military parades in the waters where their bases were located, with a total of 15,000 troops, 219 vessels of all types and 71 military aircraft.
Russian President Putin, the supreme commander of the armed forces, attended the parade of the Baltic fleet.
Some 4,000 troops, 46 ships and more than 40 warplanes participated in the local parade.
Putin first inspected the ship formations in the waters of the Baltic Sea Naval Base in Karungstad.
He then arrived in a fast boat in the waters of the Neva River in the centre of St. Petersburg and landed, where he watched the parade on the River Neva.
In his speech at the parade, Putin said that the state of modern technology of the Russian Navy’s equipment had continued to rise in recent years, and that in 2020 the Russian Navy would receive a total of about 40 new ships equipped with a unique high ultrasound strike system.
In addition, the Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief, Yevmenov, in an interview with the Russian Ministry of Defence agency newspaper Red Star, said that Russian plans for the construction of ships had been effectively implemented and that the number of new vessels to be received by the Russian Navy in 2020 had been larger in recent years.
In 1696, the tsar Peter began to form a naval fleet, opening the history of the Russian Navy.
The last Sunday of July of each year is Russian Navy Day.
Since 17 July, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have been actively involved in the prevention and control of the epidemic, as called for by the General Union of the Autonomous Communities.
North and South Tianshan trade union officials, workers, workers and model workers enter the street community and the population. They carry out activities such as delivery of food and medicine, disinfection, promotion of awareness of the disease, service to the workers and practical action to highlight the union's “hard nuclear power”.
In recent days, a group of condolence groups of the General Trade Union of Tianmuzi City in Urumqi sent a much-needed supply of disease-control and life-saving goods to staff in 12 isolated locations.
After the outbreak, the first-ever investment of more than 1.05 million yuan was made in Tianshan, which was allocated to 23 trade unions directly at the grass-roots level.
The Deputy Secretary-General of the China Xinjiang State Construction Commission and President of the trade union Zhao Zhongxian offered to stay on duty to protect workers from the epidemic, after receiving notification from the company.
He sends cooking materials, food and daily supplies to employees living in the unit dormitories and to newly employed workers, and organises the delivery of essential supplies to them every two days.
“As of 21 July, 704 first-line workers in the Urumqi area were replaced with supplies for the prevention of the disease and for the supply of household goods by means of a line-by-line and merchant service”.
The leaders of the Xinjiang Transport and Communications Union told journalists that in the face of an outbreak, they were doing their best to provide protection against the epidemic, steadily advance the development of transport and create an atmosphere conducive to fighting the epidemic.
In the current summer heat, trade unions at all levels focus on the first-line workers in priority areas for the prevention and control of the epidemic, so that they can take care of them.
On 19 July, the Urumqi District General Trade Union launched a “cool” condolence campaign for first-line workers in disease prevention and control, and the county police stations, card points and health system received condolences such as beverages, fruit, etc.
“Trade union cadres must further strengthen their political positions and responsibilities, take care of the warmth of the people and encourage them with action.
The role of trade union organizations in bringing workers together and bringing them together must be fully realized, the services provided for disease prevention and control must be ensured, the health rights and interests of workers must be actively protected, and care should be provided to workers in the first line.”
According to the relevant head of the Central Trade Union of the Autonomous Communities.
Full roll-out of direct recruitment in 2020 - Xinhua Network
On 26 July, Xinhua Beijing (journalist Ja ' Quilong), the Political Work Department of the Military Commission, and the Defence Mobilization Department of the Military Commission issued a joint circular on the deployment of non-commissioned officers directly from among the graduates of general higher schools in 2020.
This year's Direct Recruitment Officers cover more than 270 military field generalizations in 64 categories, such as computers, automation and machinery, with a focus on increasing the intake of such specialties as drones, navigation, aerospace, electronics, small languages, etc., which is nearly 2,000 more than last year.
This year, the immediate recruitment of non-commissioned officers was carried out in parallel with the recruitment of conscripts, which began on 1 August and ended on 30 September.
Young conscripts can consult the National Recruitment Network (http://www.gfbzb.gov.cn) about the conditions for immediate recruitment of conscripts and the distribution of admissions among the various regions, and submit registration information on a professional basis and in accordance with the uniform requirements of the military service authorities of the place of recruitment, for follow-up examinations, political examinations, etc.
Qualified young people who are unable to be recruited as non-commissioned officers because of professional and planned restrictions on recruitment may join the compulsory recruitment of soldiers, and the number of years of attendance in regular higher education schools is considered to be the same length of service at the end of compulsory military service.
This year, the recruitment of non-commissioned officers is organized in a unified manner by the people ' s recruitment offices of provincial or municipal governments, and those with high potential will be selected on a competitive basis on the basis of a comprehensive assessment of the level of qualifications of the candidates, their professional performance during school years, and their attainment of vocational qualifications; the scarce professions will be targeted at local, professionally qualified institutions.
In accordance with the routine control requirements of the epidemic, this year's direct recruiter does not, in principle, arrange to report himself to the battalion, which will be organized in parallel with the conscripts.
The direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers began on 1 September 2020, and the Force issued an order for non-commissioned officers on 1 December 2020.
The receiving units of the Force will develop scientific recruitment and professional training programmes, which will be carefully organized and, upon completion of the training, will be based on the principle of consistency in the recruitment and recruitment of non-commissioned officers, who will be assigned in a uniform and accurate manner to their respective professional technical posts.
Spokesperson at the Embassy in the United Kingdom: Chinese Government is a firm defender of cyber security - China New Network
On July 26, Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-
The Chinese Government was a firm defender of cyber security and had always been firmly opposed to and opposed to any form of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
Questions were raised by journalists: according to the media, hacker organizations associated with China had interfered with the network system of a British company, launched attacks on British-American technology companies with proprietary data, and invaded networks of European Union Governments.
The Chinese Government was a firm defender of cyber security and had always been firmly opposed and opposed to any form of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
Cyberspace is highly virtual, retrogressive and diverse in its range of actors. Sufficient evidence should be produced when investigating and characterizing cyber incidents.
A series of events, such as the Prism Gate in the past, had proved that the United States had been conducting the largest worldwide campaign of cyber-piracy.
It is in the common interest of all States to maintain peace and stability in cyberspace.
His country ' s achievements in the area of science, technology and innovation were not stolen, not stolen, but rather obtained through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted approximately 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6 per cent, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a major innovation and intellectual property power.
Data from the Central Branch of the People ' s Bank of China, Urumqi, show that in the first half of the year, new loans to Xinjiang farmers and micro-enterprises increased over the full year of 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Branch of the People ' s Bank used a variety of monetary policy instruments to guide the banking sector to increase lending and provide adequate financial support for disease control and rehabilitation.
Most of the Urumqi free nucleic acid tests are almost complete.
Zhang Wei, Director of the Urumqi Health and Safety Commission of the City of Urumqi on July 26 (journalist Sun Tintin Zhao Yamin), reported that at present, most of the Urumqi city-wide free nucleic acid tests have been completed.
The development of the epidemic is being further assessed by a team of experts from the State Council and experts from the Autonomous Region and the city of Urumqi on the basis of the results of tests of nucleic acids and epidemiological surveys.
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Press Office held a press conference on 26 June to inform the Xinjiang epidemic and control.
According to him, between 0000 and 2400 hours on 25 July, 22 new cases of coronary pneumonia were diagnosed in the city of Urumqi (of which 5 were referred for confirmed cases) and 38 new cases of non-symptomatic infections.
As at 2400 hours on 25 July, 135 cases had been confirmed in the city of Urumqi and 147 cases were diagnosed without symptoms.
The 25-day increase in the number of non-symptomatic infections was also largely the result of free city-wide nucleic acid testing and voluntary screening.
According to the Director of the Urumqi Health and Safety Commission, Zhang Wei, most districts throughout Urumqi have largely completed the free testing of nucleic acid.
He added that, in the light of experience in other parts of the country, there were a number of factors influencing the results of nucleic acid tests, such as the sensitivity of the test agent, the time of infection and detoxification of the person being tested, the co-operation of the person being tested at the time the specimen was taken, which might have resulted in the absence of the specimen, and the environment, the operational proficiency of the tester.
For various reasons, detection of nucleic acids also results in false negatives.
Fake negatives mean that the person tested is indeed infected, but the results of nucleic acid tests are negative.
In addition, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to exclude persons who are in close contact with confirmed and suspected cases.
For those who have travelled to high-risk areas of the epidemic, two nucleic acid tests are also required to remove the possibility of a negative nucleic acid test if hemorrhaging and respiratory symptoms occur.
In view of the above, and in the interest of the health of the entire population of the city, the city of Urumqi will conduct, as of today, a second free nucleic acid test in priority areas such as Tianshan and the Shaybak district, along with a “missing”.
A high-risk area of the epidemic is known to be Tianshan and Shaybak districts.
The Shanghai International Film Festival revealed extraordinary industrial confidence - the new China Network.
2020-07-26 06:52:39 Source: Report by Wang Si-seok Responsible Editor: Wang Si-seok
Underline, the clouds are hot, and the Shanghai International Film Festival has generated extraordinary industrial confidence.
Yesterday, the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival 2020, organized in the context of strict anti-epidemiological measures, opened the scene of the twenty-third Shanghai International Film Festival with an industry summit on the theme “All-round to build a new era”.
This year ' s Shanghai International Film Festival is of great significance as the first international video festival since the continued spread of the global epidemic and the normalization of our epidemic prevention and control.
The Shanghai International Film and Television Festival is a sign of confidence and, above all, a demonstration of determination – our confidence in the fight against the epidemic, our confidence in people’s festivals, and our determination to build a global centre for film creation, and our confidence in the “Shanghai culture” brand.
Every year, the Shanghai International Film Festival, in an innovative and progressive manner, is a fresh start.
Therefore, every step needs to be taken to serve the people ' s general spiritual life and the quality of the development of the film industry.
This year in particular.
In order to cherish the hard-won epidemic control situation, the Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, strictly respects the requirements of the disease and elaborates the measures to prevent it, and, on the other hand, opens a multi-boarding of activities online and offline, with the vision of generating wisdom for Chinese films and meeting the needs of visual visions.
On the first day of the opening, from the bottom of the line, to the Industrial Forum, film festival-related activities are strictly implemented.
The Forum activities were controlled by up to 50 people, with each viewing room isolated and a maximum of 30 per cent.
In any case, as the Organizing Committee for the Film Festival held, “the safety of life and physical well-being of the population is paramount”.
Underline activities have been significantly streamlined and there has been a lot of activity on the clouds.
In order to implement the important concept of people's cities and people's cities as people's festivals, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival has been innovative and transformative, meeting the diverse needs of fans with initiatives such as cloud displays and master Ben cloud sharing.
On the first day of the opening, the official partners of the festival, Moo-Clue and Myeong Joo-Chu of the East, will feed back the fans of the “Away” film.
That evening, the Golden Open Forum and Master Jaishakot Ben were also online on various platforms, such as video, learning from powerful countries, and App Wenki, to keep people away from home and to follow the latest developments in Chinese films.
At the opening forum yesterday, a statement was made by Xiaoming, a member of the Central Radio and Television General Group, and Vice-President, and the film festival was opened, with a message from Zhou Huimin, Minister of Communication, and Deputy Mayor.
White House Epidemic Specialist Foxy: Cautionary optimism about the development of a vaccine in early 2021
Fouche made the above statement at a web video conference organized by the International Leadership Foundation.
He cautioned that it was not clear how the new coronary outbreak would develop in the autumn and winter or how its ultimate impact would be, “and the only way to end it is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution”.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University in the United States, the number of new crown confirmed cases in the United States had reached 4.176,000 by the time of the twenty-first century, resulting in 146,000 deaths.
Fouche indicated that some parts of the United States are struggling to combat the rebound.
Despite the diversity of epidemics and the need for tailored responses, a diversified anti-epidemiological strategy does not mean that there is no close link between regions.
The outbreak in one region eventually affects others.
“This is not the time for complacency”, Foggy said, “Our work has not been accomplished, we must intensify our efforts and we must remain vigilant to the uncertainty of the future”.
At this meeting, the founder of the Chinese medical expert, the “cowtail therapy” for AIDS in the United States, stated that the new United States crown epidemic had not yet peaked.
“Each of us must do our part to slow down the spread of the virus.”
The public is called upon to use its own practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up the development of new crown therapy drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting international exchanges between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region, working to upgrade the status of the American Asian-Pacific people and foster international youth leaders.
On the same day, statements were made by the United States Minister of Transport, Zhao Xiao Lan, the United States Congressman Menghuwen, and the President of the Foundation for International Leadership, Dong Ji Ling.
In particular, they paid tribute to Asia-Pacific medical workers and volunteers on the front line of the epidemic, and called on the United States public to continue to adhere to immunization norms such as “social distance” to curb the spread of the epidemic.
Dalian: No new local confirmed cases of coronary pneumonia
On July 25, the news came out on the 25th of the city of Dalian (journalist Zai Jin-jun, Choi Shi-ho), and between 1500 and 1400 hours on July 24, there were no new confirmed cases of coronary pneumonia in Dalian City, and 24 new cases of non-symptomatic infections, and no new suspected cases.
Between 22 and 1400 hours on 22 and 25 July, 12 confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia were reported locally throughout the city, all of which were treated centrally in isolation at the Sixth People ' s Hospital in Dalian City.
The Deputy Director of the Health and Health Commission of Dalian City stated that, in the light of the epidemic, Dalian City organized the presence of medical staff from the third-level hospital throughout the city in the streets, opened more than 600 sampling sites in Dalian Bay, the workers ' village, along the light track and in some of the priority areas of the new district of Kimp, and made every effort to promote the screening of personnel for nucleic acids, with nearly 2,000 medical personnel taking samples of nucleic acids daily.
As at 1400 hours on 25 July, the city-wide cumulatively sampled more than 210,000 people.
Ten out of 12 confirmed cases in Dalian City are employees of Dalian Kaye World Seafood Co. Ltd.; 46 out of 54 cases of non-symptomatic infections are employees of the company and relatives of their relatives; and 85 per cent of all positive cases of nucleic acid testing are attributed to employees and relatives of the enterprise.
As a result of the study, the city of Dalian decided to tighten strict controls on close contacts with all employees of Dalian Kaye World Seafood Co. Ltd., as well as close contacts with close contacts, and to implement 14 days of centralized quarantine medical observation and at least two tests of nucleic acid.
At the same time, the city of Dalian decided to further expand the scope of the centralized quarantine medical observers by conducting at least two intensive 14-day isolation medical observations and at least two nucleic acid tests for those in close contact with those who test positive for nucleic acid (including cases and those infected without symptoms).
Notices were issued on 25 days at Dalian airport and at Dalian railway station that, in principle, city-wide personnel who did not have to be separated and who did have to be separated must be certified as having negative nucleic acid tests within seven days; Dalian bus terminal suspended all city-wide route tickets from 1200 hours on 25 December, with the date of resumption to be notified.
Brazilian studies show that hydroxin is not effective for treating new coronary pneumonia for mild moderate disease - a new mesonet
In recent days, a Brazilian study has shown that hydroxin is not effective for new coronary pneumonia patients with mild moderate disease.
The study was published in New England Journal of Medicine.
Researchers in Pakistan have conducted clinical trials in three groups of 667 patients in 55 hospitals throughout the country; the main objective is to analyse whether this has helped to improve the condition of the mild and moderate patients of the new coronary pneumonia, compared to the effects of the treatment of hydroxin alone or with other antibiotics.
The results show that not only is hydroxychloroquine not therapeutic but may have damaging side effects on organs.
This study was carried out by several authoritative hospitals in Brazil, such as the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein Hospital, the HCor Hospital, the Syrian Hospital in Lebanon (Hospital Sírio-Libanês), in collaboration with the Brazilian Clinical Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Guardian Research Network (BRICNet).
On 25 local time, President Bossonaro of Brazil declared the fourth nucleic acid test negative through social platforms.
During the infection, Bosonaro was given hydroxin and was actively promoted on several occasions.

A new round of App governance in four sectors to protect personal information security - Xinhua Network
On July 25, a reporter from Xinhua Beijing (journalist Yu Junjie and Chen Yae Ping) learned from the National Network Office that in 2020 the work on the illegal collection and use of personal information for governance was officially launched in 2020, with a focus on countering strong questions from the public, such as the private uploading of personal information from the backstage of App.
According to the information received, this round of App governance was carried out jointly by the National Network Office, the Ministry of Industry and Communications, the Ministry of Public Security and the General Directorate of State Markets.
It was described that over the past year, a four-sector dedicated governance working group had received more than 12,000 valid Internet reports, verified over 2,300 Apps, and imposed penalties for public exposure, interviews, layoffs, etc., on 260 Apps whose users were large and problematic.
According to the relevant officials of the National Network, the number of Apps is currently over 5 million and the problem of the collection and use of personal information in violation of the law has not yet been resolved.
The 2020 governance exercise will further strengthen efforts to further extend governance to SDK (software development toolkit) and small programs on the basis of App verification.
It was informed that the Working Group would conduct thematic studies and in-depth tests on the irregular use of personal biometric information collection and the abuse of sensitive authority by App, focusing on such abuses as recording and photographing.
Depending on the circumstances of the discovery and the seriousness of the consequences, the Working Group will, in accordance with the law, impose penalties such as interviews, warnings, layoffs, fines, etc., to effectively deter violations.
It is understood that the working group is planning to develop a manual for the management of the app store for the collection and use of personal information, which will provide guidance to the app store in order to ensure that the app store has access to the web and closes the entrance.

Data show that the United States is the most affected country globally, with a cumulative number of 41,78027 confirmed cases and a cumulative number of 1,46460 deaths.
The cumulative number of confirmed cases in Brazil is 239,4513 and the cumulative number of deaths is 86449, both of which are second only to the United States.

On the 25th, the Festival of the Red Tourism Festival 2020 and the First Red Cultural Industry Fair opened in Changshan.
In recent years, demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of the red tourism industry is also faced with a small youth population, homogenization of tour projects and single channels of commercialization.
In particular, this year's epidemic has been marked by a major setback for the national literary industry and serious challenges for red tourist attractions.
For example, the use of technology such as drone photography and VR insulation can meet visitors' needs for “unattendable and present” tours; the introduction of live webcasts to promote the famous eugenics of the red scenes can directly enhance the economic benefits of red tourism; the introduction of “clouds” technology, which will create a high-profile, well-directed and well-intentioned fine display of the red scenes, which will give full visibility and boost to the teaching function of the red scenes; and the innovation of the dissemination of red culture, which will “live up” the revolutionary relics, spread red tourism, transmit the red genes and increase the attractiveness of the red scenes.
This cultural festival, using the popular `prefects of county and city + professional anchor presentation' method to promote the production of red scripts, and the use of 5G technology to provide real-time viewing and intelligent city demonstrations to promote red scripts, is an attempt to insert smart wings into red tourism, with the expectation that Hunan's red tourism will become more popular.
The U.S.-China trade negotiators are meeting in August.
Hong Kong ' s South China Morning Post, 25th, quoted an anonymous source who reported that the Chinese trade negotiators, Vice-President Liu Tsung, and the US team co-leader and trade representative Rae Hae-chul were expected to meet formally in August to assess their compliance with the first phase of the US-China trade agreement.
It has been reported that while China has significantly increased its purchases of United States agricultural products over the past few months, Chinese purchases are still some way from the commitments made in trade agreements due to, among other things, the New Crown Virus outbreak.
The analysts said that the recent closure of each other's consulates in the United States and other disputes could undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States, which entered into force one month after its signature on 15 January, provides for a six-monthly meeting of a high-level trade framework group from both sides.
Informed sources revealed that the meeting would be an “an important turning point” for both parties to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, the same source said that if tensions between the United States and China led to less willingness to talk at this time, the two sides might agree that the teleconference of 8 May between Ri Hae-chul and Ryu Liu had met the terms of the biannual talks in the trade agreement.
Since the beginning of this year, relations between China and the United States have rapidly deteriorated, with disputes between the two sides covering a range of issues such as the origin of the New Crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
The President of the United States, Trump, boasted at the beginning of the year about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement, but his attitude had recently changed.
At the White House press conference, he said that, although China had recently purchased a record number of American corn and had bought soybeans, “this trade deal is less important to me now than it was when it was reached”.
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also argued that, due to poor US-China relations, a new round of trade negotiations was unlikely to take place and that “trade issues have lost their weight in US-China relations”.
He revealed, however, that China’s trade-related units still met on 23 March to discuss a number of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, “We have tried to buy them, so any additional purchases will be difficult.”
Peng Jinning, Vice-President of the United States-China Trade Commission, said that keeping the momentum of the first phase of the agreement was “more important than ever” and that China had made progress this year in further opening its financial markets to American companies.
The Plenum analyst of the independent research company said, "It's better to talk than not, although it may be considered routine."
On 26 July in Beijing, a reporter from Xinhua News Agency (Reporter Wei Yukwu) was informed by the Ministry of Emergency Management that the Ministry of National Defence and Emergency Management, together with the National Food and Material Reserve, would again urgently transfer 1.35 million knapsacks, 1.2 million square metres of rags and 130,000 square metres of earth cloth to Anhui once again to provide central reserves of anti-flood rescues.
According to the relevant head of the Ministry of Emergency Management, the Yangtze River River basin is currently experiencing high water level fluctuations, with the Yangtze River Flood No. 3 of 202026 forming up the Yangtze River and increasing local risk.
The meteorological sector expects heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the lower-central part of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the situation remains critical and complex.
Since the invasion, it was reported that the Ministry of Emergency Management had deployed an integrated national fire rescue unit to pre-position specialized relief units in priority areas for flood protection. A total of 10,064 cases were attended by a total of over 130,000 firefighters, 17,778 fire trucks and 11887 boats.
Chief Representative of the China District of NASDAK, Xianxiang: It's now the best time node for Chinese companies to travel to the United States of America - Economic Watch - Professional Financial News.
Zhang Bin, a journalist for the Economic Watch Network Zhang Bing, more stringent regulation of the medium-size stock by the United States market due to the successful coffee fraud, combined with long-term pressure on valuation, has put pressure on the medium-sized stock market in the United States and has recently begun a process of returning to Hong Kong.
Recently, companies such as Shell, Ideas, etc. have been enthusiastic about going to the United States.
Is this the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States of America?
“In terms of the recent IPO case and the companies that are going to go to the United States for listing, IPO is essentially unaffected, but the market is now very good, even at the best point in time for Chinese companies to go to the United States for the last 10 years.”
The Chief Representative of the China Region of the NASDAQ Stock Exchange stated at the “Significance in the 2020 Summit of Listed Corporate Leaders” hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the United States Securities Commission (SEC) and the United States Public Company Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) issued a Statement on the Critical Role of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information – a discussion on the current challenges of access to information by United States listed companies with extensive operations in China.
This statement indicates that, despite the significant increase in international cooperation and coordination in recent years, United States regulators continue to have problems with access to information and that SEC and PCAOB continue to face legal and practical challenges; in contrast to this document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed companies facing audit barriers and their auditing institutions, with a large number of stock-taking companies.
In addition, in May this year, the Senate of the United States Congress passed the Foreign Corporate Accountability Act, which introduced additional disclosure requirements for foreign companies listed in the United States.
It appears that the crisis has not affected the appetite of investors.
“When this news first came out, everyone was asking if they could go to the United States in the future, but then we found that these problems were not a matter for investors, who might ask them, or even become a matter of standardization, in their recent IPO tour, but not as an important factor for investors not to vote in a Chinese company.
It is suggested that the current situation should be viewed as usual.
This, of course, may appear to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but it has not been affected by the appetite of investors.
So the next wave of IPOs will continue between now and the end of this year or before the American elections.”
On 9 May this year, Kim Shanyun was officially listed in NASDAQ in the United States as the first Chinese enterprise to travel to the United States of America after the outbreak.
“The listing of Kim Shan Yun gives great confidence to the Chinese companies behind the preparations for IPO.”
That's a sign.
In the first half of the year, the Snowball mid-year summary data report shows that 20 enterprises went to IPO China in the first half of the year, an increase of 17.6 per cent over the same period last year; 20 enterprises raised a total of $2.725 billion in initial funding, an increase of more than 52.4 per cent over the same period last year; and, in the distribution of sectors, the number of IPOs in the health-care sector during the first half of the year was high, an increase of 100 per cent over the same period last year.
According to Xi Jin, Chinese companies that traveled to IPO in the first half of this year are of high quality, with hard fundamentals and high-quality companies that have grown up, and are more favoured by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, he remains optimistic about Ming China’s visit to the United States.
“The short-term is that the rush to the IPOs continues; the medium-term is that Chinese companies have more options: A shares, Hong Kong shares, United States shares, all of which will take the United States general election and US-China relations as factors in market choice and timing; in the long-term, everything will return to normal, with market fluctuations being cycles, both political and economic, and eventually to normal, with stock markets always moving ahead.”
At the same time, he said, “This year there are many uncertainties, but for high-quality companies, whether the market is good or bad, other factors are relatively minor as long as they are solid and have growth that can be seen by investors, who need to invest in good Chinese companies.”
On the evening of July 25, July 26, Beijing (journalist Takai), the “Dance of Life” of the National Theatre's “Speaks like Summer Flowers” series was launched online in parallel with the director Yang Yang, the pianist Zhang Xiaoqing, and the National Theatre Orchestra, in collaboration with the National Theatre Orchestra, playing Rahmaninov's Second Piano Concerto and Symphony Dance.
At the same time, the national theatre theatre of Taihu, located in Beijing’s city’s secondary centre, also staged a first-time performance since the epidemic was fought, with the commander Zheng Jian, the National Theatre Choir, singing with passion the military song of the “Tai Lak Sunday concert” – the military brigade’s song concert.
Following the downgrading of the level of response to the epidemic in Beijing, and in keeping with the city-wide requirements for disease prevention and control and with the spirit of the relevant departmental documents, the National Theatre, in accordance with the principle of “precautionary openness and gradual liberalization”, staged a concert on 25 July, for the first time with a limited number of tickets to the public.
“This is the first show that the National Theatre has sold tickets to audiences since the outbreak.
In accordance with the requirements related to disease prevention and control, the sale and entry of " one person, one vote, one yard " is carried out in an amount not exceeding 30 per cent of the total seat.
The following plays, "Conspect for the West" and the 8th Military Festival, will be devoted to special concerts, opera films, etc., and artistic activities.
The concert on 25 July also continued to be broadcast live simultaneously on the classical music channel of the National Theatre and on several web platforms, reaching an online audience of over 30 million hits as of 12 p.m. on 25 July.
That evening's concert was opened in the sound of the piano bell at the beginning of the La Zero, which was the first time that the National Theatre's "Speaks like Summer Flowers" concert was dedicated to the audience.
With his deep understanding, Zhang Xiaoqing has developed the first theme of his work, which is full of sorrow and confusion. Under Yang ' s command, the orchestra and the piano create a continuous hearing and enjoyment in the vagaries of competition and compromise.
After the second chapter of the music, “such as the water quiet” and the third of the musical, “the great festivities”, more than 100 viewers gave warm applause in their return to the scene, and online viewers gave their heartfelt praise in the form of curtains and comments.
Zhang Xiaobun then gave back to the audience a song from Zhang Xiaobun.
After a brief stage change, Yang directed the National Theatre ' s Orchestra to sing the last of the large orchestras by Rahmaninov, " Symphony Dance " , in which the composer presented a more introspective emotion and incorporated his new inspiration and memory of past creations and ancestry.
In Yang Yang's calm and calm treatment, the sad and rising atmosphere of the work was revealed, and Rakhmaninov's “last sparks” were devastated.
The pre-audience of this concert once again brought unexpected surprises to the audience.
In view of the fact that the news anchor had just arrived in the back stage of the National Theatre's dressing room, he revealed the “place” in front of music masters such as Jhajeev and Lang. He then went to the public space of the National Theatre level, where he quickly engaged in a dialogue with Yang, Zhang Xiaoe and the National Theatre's tuner in front of the three nine-foot pianos with stories. He had just discussed with them, from the perspective of a senior piano fan, the maintenance and maintenance of the piano, the music of Rahmaninov, the life of musicians in peacetime, and the preparation of their performances. At the end of the presentation, he had just worked with Zhang Xiaoqing to make Schuman's Dreams feel good.
That night, at the National Theatre's Tahouk Open Theatre, the military song was so bright that the song of the military brigade would begin in the loud and open edition of The Unforgettable Heart.
This is the first performance since the national theatre, the Taihu Week Concert, was fought against the disease.
According to the information received, on 1 August, the Commander Zheng Jian will also continue to bring to the National Theatre Choir the "Warmen and the Motherland" — the National Theatre — a concert to celebrate the 8th Military Festival, to be performed as a line in the “Sunflowers” series, to be broadcast live on the Internet and to pay tribute to the warriors defending the homeland in their classic voice.

Commentator of the People ' s Daily newspaper: Focus on managing your own business and building new advantages for future development — learning to follow up on the important speech made by General Secretary Xi Jinping at the Business Symposium — Xinhua Network
Xinhua News, Beijing, July 25, The People's Daily, July 26, commentator's article: Focusing on your own business, building new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation remain grave and complex, and the challenges to our development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic strength, building confidence in winning and concentrating on doing our part is key to addressing the risk challenges.
At the recent entrepreneurial colloquium, Secretary-General Xi stressed that, in the current external environment of increased protectionism, a depressed world economy and a shrinking global market, we must focus our efforts on doing our part, making full use of domestic super-large market advantages, moving towards a new development paradigm dominated by large domestic cycles and mutually reinforcing domestic and international cycles, raising the level of modernization of the industrial chain supply chain, vigorously promoting scientific and technological innovation, accelerating key core technological challenges and shaping new future development advantages.
The wise, the master win.
In an external context of deepening economic globalization, markets and resources have played an important role in the country's rapid development.
The world under the impact of the epidemic is now undergoing profound change, facing additional uncertainties and uncertainties, and economic globalization has experienced a reversal and a reversal.
One of the most important aspects of preparing and working for a longer period of time to cope with the changes in the external environment, which will drive our economy to take advantage of the winds and make it more stable, is to use the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand as a strategic basis for development, to make full use of its advantages and to give impetus to our economic development through the prosperity of the domestic economy and the opening up of the internal cycle, and to bring about economic recovery in the world.
We are deeply aware of the importance of building a complete domestic demand system for the long-term development and security of our country.
The Party's Central Review has clearly set out a determined strategy for the expansion of domestic demand, which is needed to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to sustain the long-term and healthy development of our economy and to meet the growing needs of the people for a better life.
The advantage of large economies is their internal recyclability.
With the world ' s most complete and large industrial system, strong productive capacity and well-developed complementary capacities, with more than 100 million market owners and more than 170 million highly educated or skilled people, and an extremely large domestic demand market of 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, our country is in a new phase of industrialization, informatization, urbanization and rapid agricultural modernization, with great potential for investment.
The system of public ownership, which combines the development of a dominant, multi-ownership economy, with the distribution of labour, multiple distributions and a socialist basic economic system, such as the socialist market economy system, stimulates the dynamism of various market subjects, liberates and develops social productivity, while promoting efficiency and equitable organic unity and the continuous achievement of common prosperity.
We need to firmly grasp the strategic basis for expanding domestic demand, making production, distribution and circulation more dependent on domestic markets for a virtuous circle, defining the strategic direction of supply-side structural reforms and promoting a dynamic balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand at higher levels.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, to vigorously promote science, technology and innovation and other aspects of innovation, to accelerate the advancement of strategic and emerging industries such as the digital economy, smart manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, and to create more new growth poles and poles of growth and to move towards a new development paradigm dominated by large domestic cycles and mutually reinforcing domestic and international cycles.
Openness brings progress, and closure inevitably lags behind.
The Secretary-General of Xi has repeatedly stressed that China ' s open doors will not be closed, but will only open larger.
The dominant domestic cycle is far from closed, but rather stronger and more sustainable development by harnessing the potential of domestic demand to better connect domestic and international markets and to make better use of both domestic and international markets and resources.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between the expansion of domestic demand and the expansion of openness, and the smoother the internal cycle, the more conducive it is to the creation of new patterns of openness and to the emergence of new advantages in international cooperation and competition.
Despite the current rise in protectionist thinking at the international level, we stand on the right side of history by insisting on deepening reforms, expanding openness, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting an open world economy and building a community of human destiny.
The Chinese nation, which has experienced many ordeals in its history, has never been crushed, but has grown stronger, growing up and emerging from them.
On the way forward, with the strong leadership of the central party centre, with Comrade Xi at the centre, with the remarkable advantages of the socialist system of Chinese identity, with a strong mobilization capacity and strong combined strength, and with the unity of all the nation's entire ranks, we will be able to overcome all the difficult obstacles and obstacles, maintain the momentum of our economic and social development, fully establish our small and prosperous society and successfully begin a new journey towards the full construction of a modern socialist State!
In the second line of balance gains, “after 90” is “retributive” savings?
As the balance gains went down, instead of fleeing the balance, the “retaliation” started saving money?
China's New Economic Research Institute's Joint Payment of the Balance 90 Savings Report (2020 edition) showed that, in the first half of the year, “90s later”, was more interested in saving money: per capita savings were nearly 40% higher than in 2019.
Interestingly, "after 90" tends to start with a single "small money", with 60% of the average savings below $20...
Saving money with the balance is also a “post-90” habit.
The data show that of the 700 million surplus users, 134 million are “after 90”.
China has 174 million “after 90”, that is to say, about three out of every four “after 90” in the country are saving in surplus.
Currently, the seven-day annualized rate of return for the IMF, such as balance sheets, has declined from above 2 per cent at the beginning of the year to about 1.5 per cent.
Even so, it does not affect the pace of “after 90” savings.
Against the backdrop of an increase in the “saving effect” of the surplus, many young people who are accustomed to using the surplus have also been transformed directly into “kimin”.
As of 13 July, the payment data show that the new “Kimin” on the treasure has more than doubled over the same period, and that an increasing number of young people are making progress on the treasure.
According to analysts, the flow of funds from surplus to stock markets was also an important reason for the clear decline in the IMF share in June.
The report also shows that “after 90” girls tend to save more, on average, 20 per cent more than boys; 60 per cent of users holding funds on the payment platform are men, and women tend to choose a more robust approach to financial management than men.
What are the plans after 90?
Disbursement data show that “after 90” there is a habit of targeting money, with travel being the target of most users.
As a result of the epidemic, many “after-90s” savings were made to prepare for post-empire travel; cinemas resumed operations and provided new avenues for moving from savings to consumption.

The colourful party flag is flying high on the flood-resistant embankment, holding the position firm and the horn of the offensive.
In the face of the floods, party organizations at all levels acted quickly to blow up the flood-resistant “shockheads”, placing the colourful party flag on the flood-resistant embankment, and the determination and action of the members of the party cadres and soldiers of the people to stand on the flood-resistant positions, using the “floods at the positions” and the “never draw the soldiers back” became the most reassuring and trustworthy barrier to the population of the affected areas.
It is selfless dedication and responsibility that the colourful party flag rises on a flood-resistant embankment.
It is this selfless dedication and commitment that inspires the people of the affected areas to overcome the disaster and to gather strong spiritual strength to win against it.
“People above all else, life above all else” is a test that is put to the test in times of normality, and more so at critical times.
On the flood-resistant embankment, a large number of party cadres and soldiers of the people will be able to see the red flag, the image of the struggle, the voice of encouragement everywhere and everywhere, and will be glorified with the unbreakable steel embankment, which will allow a small party flag to rise and rise high on the flood-resistant embankment!

France ' s military input into space -- Xinhua Network
The French Minister of Defence, Florence Palley, stated on 24th that France would add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defence budget and develop a military force in space in order to guard against “unfriendly acts” that might be carried out by other countries in outer space.
On the same day, Palley told the newspaper Provence that the expenditure budget for the French military space project would increase from the Euro3.6 billion (approximately $4.2 billion) previously proposed to Euro4.3 billion ($5 billion) between 2019 and 2025.
Under the French Military Planning Act for the period 2019-2025, which was approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to upgrade its existing observation and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic interception satellites and upgrade its space surveillance radar.
The President of France, Emmanuel Marlon, announced last July that a military space command and an “aviation and space force” would be established within the French Air Force.
Pali said that she would officially announce the establishment of the space force later when she visited a military school in Salon, Provence.
According to Palley, the space force was attached to the Air Force, with a strength of 500 by 2025.
She said, “The idea that space served the common good of science was gone. Space is now the place where nations compete for global hegemony.”
Pali reiterated the previous statement by Marklon that the French side had no intention of provoking an arms race.
“We are in no way engaged in an arms race. But it is my duty to fully understand the threat we may face.”
Pali recalled the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She called it a Russian satellite.
The Russian side rejects this claim.
According to Paley, France would “promptly” have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and locking in “the black hands behind unfriendly actions”.
According to the French media, France ' s quest to establish a space force stemmed from the request made by United States President Donald Trump last February to the United States Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish a Tai Chi Air Force.
Trump signed the Defence Authorization Act last December, approving the establishment of the sixth largest United States army, the Air Force.
Some experts are concerned that these American initiatives have accelerated the militarization of United States space and could trigger a new arms race in space.

Shaanxi: Breaking the challenges of relocation and avoiding crowds running.
In response to the follow-up challenges faced by the displaced population in their local integration, Shaanxi Kang Chongqing district has built a “neighborhood home” based on local innovations, which has led to the relocation of the villagers to the local population in order to achieve stability, rapid integration and prosperity.
It is located in the Qinba Mountains, where nearly one third of the population has moved out of the mountains through emigration.
The 39-year-old Chai Yangtze moved from the village of Wu village in the town of Xiemen, in the county of Xiu, to the community of Minju, in the town of Democracy.
He came to the “neighborhood home” where he lived with an old-age insurance card and finished his pension this year in less than two minutes.
At the beginning of this year, the Quan district managed employment, civil administration and health care by building a “neighbour house” so that people could be relocated to work in front of their homes.
In the Minju community, 305 residents entered local community factories through the “neighborhood home” information.
At present, community-based factories have been fully covered in the 31 100-and-over-centre settlements in the district, providing 2598 jobs.
Reported that the shared accommodation market has been heating-up since March.
The China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020 (hereinafter referred to as " the Report " ), released by the National Information Centre of the present newspaper (journalist Yang Chae-kyu), which shares the economic research centre, shows that our shared accommodation market transactions decreased by 72.1 per cent in the first five months of 2020.
However, the shared accommodation market has been warming since March, and market turnover, order volumes and reception numbers have gradually resumed.
According to the Report, there has been a significant decline in transactions in the shared accommodation market, owing, on the one hand, to a sharp decline in demand for epidemic-controlled accommodation, a sharp decline in the volume of orders, a 65 per cent decline in the total number of orders over the previous five months and a 63 per cent decline in the number of receptions, and, on the other hand, to a more marked decline in overnight prices due to weak demand, with a 16 per cent decline in average overnight prices over the previous five months.
However, market turnover increased by 78 per cent, 199 per cent and 35 per cent in March, April and May respectively; orders rose by 141 per cent, 152 per cent and 50 per cent respectively; and host populations increased by 81 per cent, 112 per cent and 28 per cent respectively.
The report notes that the development of shared accommodation has been good in the long term, but that much uncertainty remains in the near future.
In response, the Deputy Director of the National Information Centre for the Sharing of Economic Research Centre, Fengxia, said to workers ' daily journalists that the development of shared accommodation requires stronger policy support, on the one hand, better implementation of policies already in place, greater policy coherence and a focus on creating a better business environment, and, on the other hand, greater policy direction and support in terms of stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism accommodation services, innovative services and strengthening government cooperation with platform enterprises.
According to Reuters, the world ' s largest steel producer, Anselemitar, has seen a new coronary outbreak in a factory in the city of Lasaro Cardenas, Mexico, with 21 deaths to date.

Solorio stated that 21 people had died in the factory since April, including 9 trade unionists.
As a result of strict sanitary measures in factories, workers may have contracted the virus outside the factories.
According to the union, the factory has over 7,000 employees.
As of 25 July, Mexico had more than 385,000 cumulative confirmed cases, with more than 40,000 deaths, and was the fourth-highest country in the world.
On July 26, China's famous centre for vascular surgery — the Shanghai Changhai Hospital of the Naval Medical University — signed a contract with the Chinese University of Xiamen to establish a collaborative centre for vascular surgery on July 26 (Yanwan Shan Zhang Shushan Zhang Zheng Zheng — China) to promote cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, particularly in the area of acute aneurysm.
As a result of the formal collaboration between the vascular surgeons of the two hospitals, the Zhongshan Hospital said that it would conduct long-distance consultations, develop treatment programmes with real-time on-line consultations at the Longhai Hospital, choose to send people for further training, conduct weekly joint surgical exchanges, conduct school visits, etc., and, in complex cases, invite Zhanghai specialists to the hospital for surgery, depending on the patient ' s needs, thereby enabling patients in the south-west to benefit from the country ' s top medical resources.
The two hospitals will also work together on innovative scientific research for surgical operations, the generalization of aneurological diseases and early screening.
On the same day, the Acoustic Seminar, organized by the Beijing Health Promotion Society and hosted by the Nakaman University Hospital, was held in Xiamen.
At the same meeting, the two prominent hospitals in the above-mentioned region signed a contract for angiosynthetic collaboration centre to form a collaborative unit to improve the treatment of vascular-related diseases in the south-west region.
The Shanghai Long Sea Hospital, which is the only vascular surgery institute in the army and the only clinical medical centre for diseases of the vascular system in Shanghai City, is the first national priority for vascular surgery, leading the establishment of the Chinese Association of Doctors' Committee for the Professionals of Coercive vascular Science, which is the leading team in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Angiology, Nakayama Hospital, University of Xiamen, was interviewed by the media.
The vascular surgery at the Nakayama Hospital, which is the first independent subject in Fujian province, has a long-term commitment to the treatment of aortic and peri-vascular diseases, and was approved in 2018 for the construction of provincial clinical priorities.
In the treatment of aneurysms, there is considerable experience in the treatment of aneurysms in emergency cases, in addition to the treatment of abrasive aneurysms and aneurysms.
“The history of the development of vascular surgery at the Nakayama Hospital, affiliated to the University of Xiamen, the breadth, difficulty and complexity of the operation are so remarkable in the region that this time we have set up a coordination centre which, in addition to the aorta, will provide a full range of medical, pedagogical and scientific cooperation for the treatment of diseases such as the lower artery, the cervical artery and so forth.”
Professor Von Wie, Deputy Director of Angiosurgery, Shanghai Changhai Hospital.
The Nakayama Hospital attached to Xiamen University and the Changhai Hospital in Shanghai signed a contract in 2018 for the establishment of a “Li Myersan Medical Clinic” for digestive medicine.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, the chief of the vascular surgery at the hospital, said in an interview with a reporter from China New Network, that the vascular surgery at the hospital had long been shared with the Longhai Hospital, and that the two hospitals had formally established a collaborative unit for this time, bringing the two to the new level of cooperation.
He said that the College would regularly invite experts from Shanghai to conduct surgical exchanges, study rooms, discussion of difficult cases, etc., while conducting further remote consultations, which were currently planned once a week; in addition, it would select staff for further exchanges and enhance the development and development of the academic workforce.
At the meeting, journalists learned that vascular disease was the leading cause of death in China, and that the aortic arteries, as the backbone of the various organs of the human body, flowed from the heart to the whole body and played an important role.
The occurrence of aneurysms is often accompanied by high risks, high mortality rates and the difficulty of treatment, with the roughest part of the aorta up to 4 cm in diameter, which can cause haemorrhages if an aneurysms are formed, fractures occur, or hysteresis are created, which is dangerous.
In recent years, as people ' s way of life has changed and the pace of life has accelerated, China has become the world ' s first country with high blood pressure, with an increase in the number of aneurystic diseases. Today, with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases has continued in a small, rapid and efficient manner.
Doctors can make an appropriate “transformation” of the blood flow by piercing their thighs and putting it in the aorta so as to avoid shocks to aneurysms or fractures and achieve good therapeutic results, with some operations even requiring partial anesthesia.
More than a dozen national experts were invited to the seminar to discuss new developments in the treatment of aortic diseases and to conduct cutting-edge technical training and case studies in the form of a conference salon.
At the meeting, journalists learned that the treatment of aneurystic diseases is currently developing in a small, fast and efficient manner as surgical technologies and industrial materials develop.

The longest high-iron tunnel in the Three Gorges Treasury runs through the Central New Network.
2020-07-26 17:34:48 Source: China News Network. Author: Chen Hai Feng.
The figure shows the construction site of the Tunnel of the three canyons.
It's from China's Central Bureau.
Chongqing, a journalist and journalist, was informed on 26 July by the Chinese Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Ltd. that the Tunnel, which is about 18.9 km long, was fully connected.
It is understood that the small three canyon tunnel is not only the longest high iron tunnel in the three canyons area, but also the longest single-hole two-line high iron tunnel, designed to reach 350 km/hour per hour, as part of a project currently under construction in the country.
In the cities of Henan, Hubei and Chongqing, Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, Zheng Guang and Zhou Lan Gao, Zhongqing, together with Zhongqing, are part and parcel of our “eight-and-eight” high-speed railway network.
The Tunnel Zheng Mangung is fully connected on 26 days.
It's a straight line.
Zheng Wangai was established in the city of Zhengzhou, Henan Province, on a new route from the city of Pyeongshan in the south-west, the city of Namyang, and the city of Jaeyang in Hubei Province to Huangzhou in Chongqing City, approximately 818 km long, designed to speed 350 km/hour and about 184 km inside Chongqing territory.
Among them, the Zhengzhou-Yang sector was opened early on 1 December 2019, and construction is being intensified in the Chongqing sector.
The 26-day-lined Tunnel of the Three Isthmus, which is a full-line control project for Zheng Manghai, is located along the border between Phuong Dynasty County and Wakayama County in Chongqing City, approximately 18.9 km long and 890 metres deep.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017 and was fully operational on 26 July 2020.
According to the Royal Army, which is responsible for the design of the China-China Iron II Engineering Group limited liability company, Zheng Wangau Tun Tunnel, the location of the Tunnels in the small three canyons is very difficult to design and construct because they are exposed to the risks of rock solubility, mudslides and massive deformations of soft rock, which are of high risk to class I.
“In the course of project construction, we have adopted special designs for more than 30 types of dissolved holes, using advanced geological forecasts such as geological surveying, physical exploration and hyper-prevalence drilling. For example, a 24-metre bridge is designed to avoid the fall of a tunnel by crossing a large dissolved hole of more than 10 metres vertical length and 55 metres deep inside the tunnel.” The Royal Army says.
According to the Bureau of Iron Tunnels in the construction site, the tunnel was constructed in a combination of decoupling methods, through the construction of cross-hole smoothing, slurry clogged water, reinforced tunnel structure support and the construction of sewage treatment stations, which both ensured the orderly advance of the project and avoided damage to the water bodies of the small three canyons, while successfully overcoming the difficult geological problems of seven kilometres of soft rock mass deformation, with a maximum daily influx of 157,000 cubic metres of mud.
The construction of the Zheng Wangau railway line will make it a new easy and fast passenger route to the south-west of the country to the south-west, north-east and north-east regions. It will be important to improve the capacity and quality of the north-east-to-railway route to the south-west, improve the layout of the regional road network, speed up the development and urbanization of tourism resources along the routes, promote coordinated regional development and promote the implementation of the western development strategy.
Experts say it's unconstitutional to collect immigration data from the U.S. Census for allocation of seats in the House.
A number of civil rights organizations and several United States cities and counties have filed complaints against the United States federal Government alleging that President Trump ' s Office ' s attempt to exclude undocumented migrants from the United States census was neither feasible nor constitutional.
The United States census will determine the distribution of seats in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress.
The executive lawyer of the American Civil Liberties Union, Sarah Brandon, said to Voice of America, “This is not going to work”.
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship status of the person surveyed in the census was difficult to achieve and “not very reliable”.
Another civil liberties organization, Common cause, filed a lawsuit on Thursday challenging the administrative order of Trump.
Several cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the suit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the suit on Friday.
“The United States Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must take an accurate count of everyone living in Arlington County and not let this illegal attempt to scare people away and reduce the number of our immigrant communities succeed.”
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump for his executive order.
The Minister of Justice of Alabama, Marshall, stated that the executive order was a “winner” for the state.
He said that “the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives of the National Assembly and in the electoral college in the states must be based on the number of residents living in the states and the number of legally resident residents”.
Last year the United States Supreme Court prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census.
President Trump signed an executive decree earlier this week instructing the United States Census Department's business minister, Ross, to oversee the data on the unlicensed population as presented in the census, so that the administration could exclude these unlicensed populations from the census figures of the states, and thereby determine whether each state increases or decreases or maintains a seat on the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House every 10 years in response to demographic changes.
Chongqing's 33 Districts.
Zhongqing, a journalist and journalist, Ko Gaoyang and Li Song, learned from Chongqing City's Drought Control Command that on July 25, Chongqing City has seen a new wave of heavy rainfall, heavy rainfall in 33 districts, over-alert water level flooding in 4 small and medium rivers, and that an emergency response against ZhangIV has been launched.
From 0800 hours to 0800 hours on 25 to 0800 hours on 26 June, heavy rains broke out in the area of Chongqing, with heavy rains in 33 districts, including Jiangjin, Yangjiang and Wulong, including 16 districts, including Huanzhou, Yunyang and Namgawa.
The largest daily rainfall was recorded in Yongshan village, Kinshan Town, Namkawa, at 197.5 mm.
As a result of heavy rainfall, over-alert water levels have been flooding four small and medium-sized rivers in the Jiangjin region, in the Kaizhou region, and in the Kaiyang region.
Heavy rainfall has also led to landslides in the village of Six Wells, a land village in the Vulong district, resulting in the disruption of road access to the village, the slides to the river's tributaries along the river, the blocking of the river lanes to form the lake of Zhusai, where an urgent downstream mass transfer has been organized.
In response to the storm, the Chongqing city drought control command released early warning information on river floods III at 1300 hours on 26 June, and launched an emergency response against river floods, calling on the districts and units concerned to strengthen their patrols, mobilize emergency relief teams and supplies in a timely manner and evacuate the population in the threatened areas.
In response, the construction of industrial projects -- headlines -- Hunan Daily News Network -- China Voice Online
The summer of Hunan, the heat wave.
And the enthusiasm that will be unleashed by the project to build and advance the industry across the province, after the three-volt heats, is inspired by the sharp guidance of the “Industry-to-Hero” project.
The development of Hunan will always depend on projects and industries.
Faced with a very unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the party centered on Comrade Xi, the whole of the province insisted on playing a game of chess, with its best efforts to fight the two hard battles of disease prevention and prevention, using industrial projects as a “precedent” for the implementation of the “six-soft” “six-soft”.
From a decline of 1.9 per cent in GDP in the first quarter to an increase of 1.3 per cent in the first half of the year, the hard times, the hard work, the obvious.
On this valuable report card, industrial project construction is the key to accelerating economic recovery and developing stability in Hunan.
It's smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects needs to be placed in the larger picture, where they are both dynamic, dynamic, aggressive, knowledgeable and responsive.
Against the backdrop of the complexity and severity of the current international situation, it is necessary to look quietly at the new features of the new situation, to be more disciplined, to be more scientifically accurate and to be better integrated into new patterns of development, dominated by large domestic cycles and mutually reinforcing domestic and international cycles.
Increased emphasis on upgrading the industrial base.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavy investment projects in new and emerging industries begin to open up, sowing hope, but the industries with more traditional advantages accelerated their deployments and their fallout in terms of digitalization, intellectualization, and greening industrial transformation.
The Liyang Oscon III Science Park project is retrofitting existing production lines, with high-end printing of circuit boards leading the way to smart production lines, and Hunan's new plant dedicated to intellectual transformation, the construction of modern plants, and a vivid picture of the emergence of old trees around major national strategies and “two new ones”, focusing on the promotion of niche industries, the active development of new industries, and the overall scaling up of technological innovation and national production alternatives, in order to build on basic conditions and build on transformational energy.
Greater attention has been given to fostering new business models for the development of new economies.
The sudden onset of the new epidemic has brought the “unseed economy” to the fore, unleashing the potential of the digital economy and providing new opportunities for industrial change: in the first half of the year, I saw an increase of 12.6 per cent in the manufacturing of computers and office equipment, electronics and communications equipment, an increase of 32.2 per cent in the volume of online retail sales by wholesalers above the limit, and an increase of 35.6 per cent in the revenue generated by catering companies.
It is in the midst of the crisis that new machines are being created and new ground is being set in motion in order to actively promote digital industrialization and the digitalization of industries, leading to the integration of the digital and real economies.
Increased focus on optimizing and stabilizing supply chains in industrial chains.
Engineering machinery is the backbone of the Hunan industry, but two thirds of the associated enterprises are outside the province and there is room and potential in the associated chain.
A project to strengthen chain thinking requires not only the sustained accumulation of front-line firms to achieve technological breakthroughs at key links in the chain; it also needs to be nurtured locally to stimulate “chain-locking” lock-down reactions with strong chain-reconnecting links, to promote a synergistic layout of the relevant supporting industries and to accelerate the construction of an autonomous, controlled and secure supply chain of industrial chains.
Hwanan remains a hot and happy land with a good business environment and market opportunities.
(b) Shangyang's “shareholder” service, which allows businesses to do nothing, deliver policies and solve problems overnight. In recovering the damage caused by the epidemic, there are “methods to be done” to find a spot of pain and to achieve the living stories that are at stake.
A firm and optimal business environment that is focused on researching industry, nurturing it and developing it will win the favor of more investors.
The wind is still ahead, but it has become the province-wide norm for building industrial projects and promoting quality development.
During this critical period, it is necessary to learn and follow up on the spirit of the important instructions of the General Secretary of Xi Jinping, to respond effectively to external uncertainties with the certainty of his work, to sustain the construction of industrial projects, to spread his passion and sweat, and to ensure the successful completion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and the complete construction of a small society.

The overall level of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature" - a new net.

The overall level of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature"
Economic Journalist, China Economic Network.
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, China has taken a comprehensive approach to the prevention and control of the epidemic and the economic and social development of the country. The situation in the area of prevention and control of the epidemic has continued to improve.
The survey unemployment rate increased during the first two months of the year.
In February, in particular, many enterprises were largely out of business, with reduced demand for workers, delayed or cancelled recruitment and increased unemployment in urban surveys.
With the gradual improvement in the prevention and control of the epidemic, there has been a gradual return to the social order of life.
The party's central government is committed to the overall thrust of the steady and steady pace of work, further strengthening the macro-policy response, strengthening employment priorities across the board, and actively promoting job-scaling assistance.
It has increased its policy to stabilize jobs by introducing a combination of “reducing relief and rehabilitation” policies, phasing out three contributions to social insurance units, allowing for the extension of social insurance contributions, expanding the return of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises, benefiting from a policy of job-training, receiving subsidies for enterprises to absorb the employment of priority groups, traineeships, etc.
As the implementation of employment policies has fallen, the demand for employment in enterprises has steadily recovered, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the unemployment rate in urban surveys has been declining, reaching 5.7 per cent in June.
According to Zhang Yi, Director of the Population and Employment Statistics Department of the National Statistics Institute, employment policies continued to work during the second quarter, with the return of former workers who had been withdrawn as a result of the epidemic, and the urban labour participation rate increased by about 10 percentage points in June compared to February, close to the same level for the same period last year.
The data show that total urban employment increased by more than 19 per cent in June than in February, with most industries reaching pre-disease levels; the average weekly working hours for employed workers in enterprises amounted to 46.8 hours, an increase of 6.6 hours from February and a slight increase of 0.1 hours from January.
Prices also affect thousands of households.
In January this year, the CPI increased by 5.4 per cent, up from many years.
In February, the CPI increased the same year, albeit slightly, but still in the “5 zone”.
The increase in the CPI ratio is high, with both pre-spring consumption demand pull factors and spring miscalculation and lower than the same base.
However, the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly evident.
As a result of the epidemic, delays in logistics, delays in the supply of goods and the increased cost of transporting goods were observed throughout the country in January and February, as well as the accumulation and purchase of goods by some citizens, which led to a marked increase in the price of some essential goods.
In order to deal with the disruption caused by the control of the epidemic to the price situation, the authorities have included vital goods in the emergency transport guarantee to ensure their smooth transport.
As a result of a series of policy initiatives, the market supply of vegetable guacamole is strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid increase in pork prices at the beginning of this year, the central policy of securing prices was quickly implemented in various regions and sectors, with a marked improvement in the supply of pork reserves, an orderly restoration of the capacity to produce and produce and a gradual normalization of marketing.
Since March, pork prices have declined continuously, driving food prices back to 10.6 per cent in May, and in June, the round of pork prices increased slightly, influenced by a slowdown in the production of pigs, a decline in imports and a rise in group consumption demand.
Seasonal variations in the price of fresh vegetables are evident, with an average increase of 3.4 per cent in the first half of the year.
As a result of the higher comparison base for the same period last year, fresh fruit prices continued to decline in comparison with the previous year, averaging 13.3 per cent in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the population is effectively guaranteed and the socio-economic situation remains stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transport logistics and increased local coverage, market supply and demand have improved.
Starting in March, the CPI ring ratio declined for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase also fell from 4.3 per cent in March to 2.5 per cent in June, with price levels generally returning to a stable level.
In the second half of the year, our prices will continue to remain moderate, with little overall inflationary pressure, but will still have to contribute to the restoration of productive living order in the context of the normalization of disease control.
To respond effectively to natural disasters, such as floods and droughts in agricultural areas such as food, fruit and vegetables, to strengthen market regulation and to resolutely combat market disorder such as the hoarding of surprises and prices.
Ma Yun was summoned to Indian court?
Ali: Web-based official response to the non-Ali-China new network
Ali: An "official response" from the non-Ali side
In the afternoon of 26 July, the client at China-Newsun latitudes received a press report that a court in New Delhi, the capital of India, had summoned UC India, the founder of Alibaba, Mayun, and a dozen other corporate executives for a lawsuit against a former employee.
In response, the President of the Committee on Public Relations of the Aribaba Market left a humorous message in the circle of friends saying that the UC Indian company was following the process, but as far as Mayun himself knew, Wang said: “I don't know.
He's actually getting harder to find after retirement... and I've been looking all day... and I'm gonna go to the HHB tonight. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The other side confirmed to China's Sanctuary client that previously the so-called official reply of Ali was “UC has been strongly committed to serving the Indian market and protecting the welfare of local workers, and that the policy is consistent with local law.
Since the matter is still on trial, it is not possible to comment further on this matter.”
Not from Ali.

New story: Prince Harry thinks he's a snob.
The British Times and Sunday Times have a new book called Finding Freedom, which depicts the path of Prince Harry's family life with his wife Meghan Markle.
Reuters reports, however, that Harry and Megan have disassociated themselves from the book, stating that they have not been interviewed by the author and have not provided any information.
According to The Sunday Times, the new book quotes sources who say that Prince Prince William wanted to confirm whether Megan, who was a Hollywood star, had an ulterior motive for Harry when he dated Megan.
According to the source, William said to Harry at the time: “Don't feel the need to marry Megan.
You can spend as much time as you can on this girl."
It was reported that when Harry heard William describe Megan as “the girl”, he sensed arrogance in his brother's tone and thought he no longer needed a reminder.

Heilongjiang has launched a special operation to clean up and clean up the network using the name of a well-known hospital.
In recent years, the names of some medical institutions have been irregular and inappropriate, and the use of the names of well-known medical institutions without legal authorization has led to the misleading treatment of the population.
Upon enquiry into the National System for the Dissemination of Credit Information for Enterprises, some of the names of registered medical institutions in Heilongjiang province include the words “coordination” and use such recognized hospitals as “coordination” to operate abroad, disrupting the normal medical order and causing adverse social consequences.
At the same time, it will be used as an opportunity to carry out a variety of legal literacy campaigns to raise awareness of the responsibilities of market owners, to defend their rights in accordance with the law and to act in compliance with the law.
By opening up channels for reporting complaints, the public is exposed to a number of typical cases of poor impact, which have a deterrent effect.
30 electrical competitions closed, Shanghai Pudong expands the new economic "new track" - Xinhua Network
On the 24th of July 25th, Xinhuai, a journalist, Tengini, 30 major electric competition projects landed in the East Sui district of Shanghai, covering the entire spectrum of electric industry development, with an additional $10 billion expected to be generated by regional electric games.
The digital cultural industry, represented by electric games, will be a new growth point for the new online economy in Pudong, helping Shanghai to build a global electricity competition.
On the other hand, on the basis of the pre-existing top-level arenas such as the Maeben Cultural Centre, the Oriental Sports Centre and others, it is possible to confirm the arrival of new venues such as the Rendong Football Field at the Cultural Integration Field, the Zenland Electronics Competition in the Specialized Electronics Competition and the Dong Chang Games.
The General Manager of Sunland Land of the Shanghai High Bridge Group told journalists that about 1,500 square metres of indoor stadiums at the Senland Electric Contest would accommodate 1,000 people. Construction is currently under way. It is expected to introduce competitions next March, with 120,000 square metres of greening parks to be built next to the Concert, along with the electric competition for entertainment practices, and the introduction of recreational elements such as a second dimension of animation.
With regard to the electricity-competing industry, Pudong has focused on improving the industrial chain layout.
The world’s champions, like the Internet’s Elrone team, are showing up at the signing event, and the country’s only video game contest digital channel – the Game Modified Pudong Development.
With regard to the competition, Putu actively sought to settle the national and international top-level competitions and to create an open electric season.
A series of electric competitions, such as the 2020 Peace Elite International Championship Cup and the West Jai Electric Competition, were announced in Pudong.
On the business side, Pudong focused on promoting the landing of head enterprises.
For example, Nawon Information is launching dozens of video games in Pudong, and online snowstorms, perfect worlds, fun games, etc. will be actively launching new projects aimed at generating billions of dollar-level receipts.
Statistics show that Pudong currently has a third of the size of the electric games industry in Shanghai.
A series of top-level competitions, such as Tette, Internet and other competitions, such as TTI9 and the King’s Glory Winter Games, are being held in Pudong, which is becoming the “hard heart” of the development of the electricity industry in Shanghai.
The concentration of the high-quality electricity industry in Pudong is also supported by policies.
Recently, the Chinese Institute of Game Industries (CITE) set high standards for the industry.
The Astronomer School in Pudong was awarded as the "Shanghai City Vocational Education and Electronic Competition Pilot School" to lay the foundation for the development of talent in the electric competition industry.
The registration of electric racers was the first to land in Pudong, further improving the professionalization of electric campaigners.
According to Huang, Director General of the Cultural Tourist Board of the New District of Pudong, the aim of creating a “global electricity capital” around Shanghai is to create a “core functional area for the development of the Shanghai electric industry”.
As a next step, Pudong will continue to focus on key events and enterprises, accelerating development and forming industrial chains.
Using the policy of the Shanghai Free Trade Pilot Zone, piloting and exploring innovations to boost the overall development of the electric competition industry will create replicable experiences.

Question: Qinghai Lake Qinghai's “Flowwater Lives": “Sweet” for farmers to raise their revenues
Author, Hu Guilong, Pan Yujie
“On the lake of the Mid-Summer Sea, full of gold flowers and bees, high altitude, high day and night temperature and low air pollution, the strongest and most generous bees are bred by strong light, which characterizes the high activity, high protein, nutritional value and low sugar fat.”
On 26 January, Qinghai Province, Zhang Jianhun, Deputy Director General of Industry and Information Administration of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Region, stated.
On the same day, a live delivery of the Qinghai lake was held on the side of the Qinghai lake, with the China Bee Products Association and representatives of entrepreneurs and the Hornet, among others, gathering together to promote the Qinghai specialty products, selling online almost 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau bee male, totalling nearly $3.8 million.
It shows bee products on site.
It was reported that the live delivery campaign, which benefited from the Beijing Hode Beacon chain network, fast-handers, peddlers and other well-known domestic retail, live, electrician platforms, resulted in exchanges between “business + bee farmers + growers” and the continuous distribution of “slurry coupons” to consumers via online and offline channels, which were expected to yield nearly $5.28 million a year.
In response, Chennai, President of the Hode Bee Industry Corporation, Beijing, said that it was “very worthwhile”: “This would increase the visibility of the products of the green bees, attract more consumers to know, prefer and add to the pure natural bees, and boost the harvest of the bee farmers.”
At present, the company has entered into a strategic production cooperation agreement with the Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Ltd. and the Qinghua Bee Industry Corporation, which seeks to contribute to the growth of the local bee industry in the Qinghai Sea.
The figure is the Qinghui River by the Qinghu Sea.
In this spring, the road of the bee farmers to “honey-hunting” has been hampered by the need to set road crossings to prevent and control the epidemic. Many bees have died as a result of missed flowers and lack of food, with their incomes severely affected.
“One year to the end, the bee farmers traveled long distances from Yunnan and Sichuan to the north to the north-west, where they slept and had nowhere to go.
As an enterprise, we have a responsibility to help them.”
Nina called.
"The bees are `environmental scouts', and they cannot survive in heavily contaminated areas." The Vice-President of the China Bee Products Association, Zhao Xiaochuan, described bee pollination as an important link in the ecological chain and an irreplaceable contribution to protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination increases the quality of crops, especially in areas that are widespread and poorly managed.
Research data show that pollination can increase the production of oilseeds by 15-30 per cent.
Zhao Xiaochuan (right), President of the Standing Vice-President of the China Bee Products Association, presented the Qinghui bee product.
“The economic, ecological and social benefits of bee pollination are far greater than the value of the bee product itself, and the bee industry's potential for human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological conservation has been poorly understood.”
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Today, however, the number of beekeepers is decreasing, and in addition to the year-rounded beekeepers, many poor households with limited mobility have opted for bee-boxing cooperatives.
“The State has financial support, we have contacts with technicians to help guide the farmers' lack of understanding and appreciation of the market environment, and the help and coordination of governments, enterprises and industry associations in order to open up the market.”
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
“It is hoped that in the future more attention will be paid to helping the bee-rearing community,” Yana says, “Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect consumer rights while helping the bee farmers”.
As a result of continued rainfall, since 22 July, the earth has been fractured in the wake of the mid-station slides in the village of Wuhui, Chongqing Province, resulting in a wide-scale slide and deformation that has completely cut off the final river, creating a 13-metre water level in front of the dam and an estimated reservoir capacity of approximately 550,000 cubic metres.
In order to ensure safe navigation, Chongqing ' s maritime sector has decided to impose temporary traffic controls over the Yangtze Stone plate to the sounding beach waters.
Chongqing Meteorological and Hydrological Service monitors that, from 25 years on, heavy rain, heavy rain in parts of the central western and north-eastern parts of Chongqing have prevailed.
On the evening of 26 December, the river dam will have its highest water level, close to the alert level.
In order to ensure safe navigation, Chongqing ' s maritime sector has decided to impose temporary traffic controls over the Yangtze boundary ' s pebble plate to the sounding beach.
Following an urgent consultation between the Chongqing City Defence Office and the meteorological, hydrologic, hydrological and other departments and agencies, the Chongqing City Command for Drought Control decided to publish a level III warning message on river floods and to initiate an emergency response against Zhang IV.

A new round of restructuring is being launched in green.
On July 26th, the Greenfield Holdings (600606.SH) issued an indicative bulletin on the intention of State-owned shareholders to transfer part of the company's shares and duplicate cards by means of an open solicitation agreement.
The announcement indicates that, in order to further deepen the reform of State enterprises, optimize the restructuring of the State's capital allocation and improve the structure of the greenfield shareholdings, the Haut-Haïtien Company Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “the Upper-Haïtien stock”) and Shanghai City Throws Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “the Shanghai City loan”) are to transfer part of the company's shares by means of an open solicitation of the recipient, and that the total share to be transferred does not exceed 17.5 per cent of the total greenfield equity.
The price of the shares to be transferred in the current period is not less than the average of the daily weighted average price for the 30 trading days preceding the indicative notice date (27 July 2020) and the value of each net asset audited by the company in the most recent fiscal year.
At present, the new strategic investors in the greenfield are still uncertain and, according to the announcement information, it is estimated that 17.5 per cent of the equity transfer in the greenfield will require funding of approximately $14 billion.
It is worth noting that the greenfield is expected to remain without controlling shareholders and actual controlling persons after the current transfer, but the structure of control may change significantly.
Since its creation, the Green Land Holding has undergone several institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, it operated under a purely state-owned system in accordance with market rules; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continued to improve the system of State-owned, employee-owned shares; from 2013 to 2015, it introduced strategic investors into a mixed system of State-owned and non-publicly owned, mixed ownership; and from 2015 to the present, it has been listed as a public company.
The Greenfield ' s current mix-up programme is similar to Glig, which in December 2019 took over 15 per cent of Gwidg Electric (000651.SZ) shares for 41,662 million yuan from HYDRA capital title Heminge. Gwig Group withdrew its small shareholders and, after completing the mix, implemented modern methods of business management, such as executive incentive schemes, unmanageable human structures, etc.
Shanghai-based Haitians and Shanghai-based companies are fully owned by the Shanghai-based National Investment Commission. According to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Greenfield, Greenfield is an important step towards comprehensive reform of State enterprises, in line with the central requirements of the Party, and the acceleration of a new phase of reform of State-owned enterprises. The new approach to reform, which is tailored to local conditions, is a strong indication of the new approach to reform, through the introduction of new strategic shareholders to listed companies, the support of enterprises to further increase their marketability, increase their freedom of management and accelerate the full release of the reform.
The country's first inter-provincial car tour was launched by Xinhua Network.
On 25 July, at 1220 hours, over 200 Shanghai tourists travelling in D771 vehicles arrived successfully in Lanchou City, Zhejiang Province. This was the first time that the Ministry of Culture and Tourism had resumed its cross-provincial (district and city) team tour since 14 July.
The city of Lanbrook, in the middle and west of the Zhejiang River, has many well-known attractions, such as the village of Qingxi, the underground river and the village of Zhi Xiangu. Over 200 Shanghai tourists will be able to look at them on a two-day and one-night journey.
Lee Li, Deputy Managing Director, Shanghai Railways International Tourism Group Ltd., said that, in line with the latest policy, the company was focused on cross-provincial travel needs, approached Lanbrook City at the first moment and introduced the products Shanghai to Lanbrook and Summer Two Days, which were sold out less than a week ago.
Auntie Sun from Shanghai said that she had not left this year because of the epidemic.
“As soon as you see a team trip at home, you share the information with your friends to sign up, and you have never been to Lanbrook before and look forward to this trip.” Auntie Sun said.
It is understood that in September last year a strategic cooperation agreement was signed between Lanhre City and Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Shanghai Group) Ltd. for the project “Big Iron Rueland Creek”, which is scheduled to open 12 high-terrain tours in four areas of the river over a year.

United States White House consultant, “Bite back” states, getting back to work too soon - New and Medium Network
It's too early for White House consultants to re-enter the state.
On 23 July, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30 per cent of global cases.
For months, United States President Trump has repeatedly called for all states to return to work, until recently when they changed their attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public, while his adviser, who was a “back-to-back” to say that some state governments were too early to return to work.
In a press conference on 22 September, the White House Presidential Adviser, Karen Conway, stated that some state governments had not complied with the criteria for re-entry and had prematurely reopened places such as bars.
Conway also referred to previous rumours that the President had “absolute powers” to decide on the re-entry of the cantons.
“The President is a federalist who believes in the autonomy of the states.”
She defended Trump.
However, the rumour in Conway's mouth was given by Trump himself at the White House outbreak briefing on 13 April.
In response to this self-absorption, Internet users mocked it as “rewriting history”.
Kelly Ann Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump described the Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, as a dictator, because she followed medical guidelines and insisted that work be suspended.
Trump wanted to push for resumption so that he could hold a rally.
This is not the first time that Karen Conway has been controversial.
On April 15, Conway interviewed Fox News and said, “This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!”
She seems to understand the 19s as a version number, which the netizens are crazy about: reading newspapers without common sense!
Three-year-old kid college playgrounds are wrecked and paid for before bringing charges against the school?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Daily Journal of the Rule of Law
The playground was smashed and the children were paid for and then sued.
□ The correspondent of this newspaper, Zhao Yifan
When a 3-year-old young Man played in a university playground, Chen was accidentally hit in the head by a softball team during a pitch.
After some compensation, Mr. Wen, his father, brought the school before the court as his legal representative, requested an apology from the school where the incident had taken place and paid a total of $20,000 for medical care, moral damage relief, etc.
Recently, after hearing the case, the People ' s Court of the Haidian District of Beijing decided to dismiss the plaintiff ' s claim on the basis that the school had set up a safety net in the playground at the time of the incident, that it had fulfilled its obligation to provide adequate security and that Chen had paid compensation.
Mr. Wen claimed that during the summer vacation of 2019, he was playing in the school playground with young Man, while the softball team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid the risks associated with this, Mr. Siu Man, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents are operating within the safe zone designated by the softball team.
However, since then, the softball team member, Chen Yai, left his hand when he pitched the ball, causing the softball to fly across the net to the safety zone described above and hit the back of the small text.
Mr. Wen immediately took Siu Wen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with a head trauma.
According to Mr. Wen, the facilities at the school stadium did not meet the relevant security requirements and did not effectively manage the teams and related facilities.
The school ' s negligence has led to the above-mentioned events, causing great physical and psychological suffering and causing greater suffering to its families, for which the school is legally responsible.
In response, the school argued that it had installed a safety net in the playground and had posted regulations, training notices informing it that it was necessary to enter the playground at a safe distance from the training site and to alert itself to its safety, and that the plaintiff could not prove that the school was “not fulfilling its safety obligations” and therefore did not accept compensation.
The court concluded that the premises in question were those open to the public free of charge by the university, and that while there was a safety and security obligation for the management of the playground, such a security obligation would have to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school had installed a network in the playground and had fulfilled its obligation to provide adequate safety and security, and Chen had paid Xiaowen more than $2,000 in compensation for various losses such as medical expenses, transportation expenses and so on, in accordance with a previous compensation agreement.
Later, the parents again claimed compensation for the school, which was not justified by law, and the court decided to dismiss all the plaintiff ' s claims.
Following the delivery of the judgement, neither party appealed, and the judgement has now entered into force.
Under article 37 of our law on liability for torts, schools, as managers of public places, have a duty of safety and security; in the case of damage caused by the actions of third persons, third persons bear responsibility for violations, while those in public places who fail to fulfil their duty of safety and security should bear the corresponding supplementary responsibility.
The judge stated that, as managers of public places, who were most likely to know the actual situation of the site as a whole, to foresee the risks and damage that might occur, and thus to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of the loss or to mitigate the extent of the damage, and to avoid and mitigate the lowest cost of the damage, the law imposed on them the corresponding obligation to safeguard the performance of social activities.
In the present case, the safety and security obligations of schools should be commensurate with the social activities they engage in, in particular, the basic security measures and the obligation to inform about hidden risks, for groups of people who do not enter the playgrounds free of charge to the public.
It is also inappropriate in judicial practice to impose excessive security obligations on public administrators.
If the school has adopted a safety net and is obliged to inform, it can be assumed that the school is free from fault and is not legally liable.
In addition, the liability of managers of public places, such as schools, for violations committed by third parties, even if they fail to meet their security obligations, is a supplement to compensation for damages, and, under the recently enacted Civil Code, the administrator may also recover compensation from the third party after assuming additional liability.
Thus, in such an incident, the victim should not extend the claim after having received compensation from the direct infringer.
With the normality of disease control, people's enthusiasm for physical exercise increased.
With the gradual liberalization of tourism operations across provinces, the tourism market is about to recover.
The Fujian province resumed its inter-provincial tourism operations on 21 July, and the first weekend after its opening saw a peak in passenger flows as a popular tourist destination.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrive on weekends to travel to Xiamen.
The train station in Xiamen is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer season, while the airport traffic is dominated by students, tourism and family visits.
The tourist market has been warming, with 440 daily flights at Xiamen Airport in July, and domestic flights have resumed to 80 per cent of the pre-empire.
The airline encrypted air speed lines to major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming and Xi'an, seizing the recovered tourism market.
At present, many travel agencies in Xiamen are running a series of summer-time, inter-provincial products, mainly for outdoors.
In response to the peaks in the summer passenger transport at railway stations and airports, the units involved have increased the number of people trained in areas where there is a high concentration of people, such as on-board counters and security corridors. Fujian has also optimized the “eight health codes”, which have resulted in the sharing of health data and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, thus contributing to an orderly recovery of the tourist market.
Can Liu Dehua Qing Yun "discover" the new spark-net?
Bomb Demolition Specialist 2 recently announced that it would be released on 24 December as the first slot in the greeting slot.
The second is still the director of Quilytao, the director of Liu De Wa, and the lead actor, with a new story.
The inclusion of elements of the “nuclear bomb” in Part II is also known to have made the challenge for the bomb-dismantling experts even more difficult, with several glimpses in the forecast that are already at stake, the explosion of the mushroom cloud, the burning airport, and the considerable shock.
Three years ago, the bomb-dismantling expert, who was made by the original class, won the 5-1 ticketing title in the same year, and received seven nominations for the Hong Kong Film and Images Award. Liu Dehua has also become a gold partner in the audience.
This time, the Demolition Specialist 2 is again looking forward to a new spark for the ace combination.
The bomb-dismantling expert 2 told an entirely new story: the former bomb-dismantling expert, Ban Chi-feng (Lao Deok-hwa), fainted at the scene of the explosion and was identified by the police as a suspect.
In order to find the truth, he had to seek help from his close friend, Dong Zhuo, who was also an expert in bomb disposal.
The female inspector, who was anxious to solve the case, was also involved in the case of Pong Ling, who was the former girlfriend of Pan.
It is still an expert in bomb disposal, but the complexity of Liu's new role can be felt in the premonition: a leg was broken, a prosthetic limb was worn, while Liu Qingyun, who was also a bomb demolition specialist, was hunted down while her former girlfriend, Nini, directed the operation.
What is the relationship between the three men, what did Liu De Wa do at the Chaishima Hotel, and what kind of case he was involved in, and what was his experience as a bomb-dismantling expert?
It is understood that the most important feature of the film is the live viewing of the world ' s landmark buildings in Hong Kong, together with the top-of-the-art special effects production team, resulting in a shocking visual shock.

Yang Hong was born in 1934, and the Gang Sunanking people have loved music since childhood.
In 1951, he was directed by the Nanjing People ' s Radio Choir, and in the autumn of 1951, he was admitted to the Great Music Department of the Shanghai East China Division, where he studied from Professor Yang Garren and German commander Hizmann, and from the former Soviet expert, Alzamanov, to learn the tune and retweet.

On 26 July, the Chongqing Municipal Development and Reform Commission of China (journalist Liu Xian) released a report that 4404 fishermen had been repatriated to date, or 42.54 per cent of all fishermen involved.
In an interview with the Chinese news reporter, 53-year-old Li Dixon said that his grandfather had been fishing at the Long Creek River since he was 11 years old and had been fishing with his father, shaking small boats, walking along the Long Creek, going up to Chongqingping, going down to a long life, leaving his home for 10 and a half days each time to support his family by fishing.
Since 1997, however, as the rural population gradually gushes into towns and towns, the population of the town of Gao An has grown and the resulting environmental pollution has increased.
Paper-making plants, chemical plants and farms have been built along the Long Creek River, which also pollutes water.
By 2007 and 2008, the Ryon Creek had become a gutter.
"The fish scales are black, and they're black when they open."
Li Dixon said that it was increasingly difficult to catch fish after the river had been polluted.
The local effort to combat the pollution of the dragon stream, including drifting, river cruises and the management of aquatic resources, has begun.
Li Dynasty has also converted from fishermen and became a member of the river patrol team, which handles aquatic resources.
From 1 January 2020, the City of Chongqing aquatic living reserves and the relevant waters of the main urban areas were completely banned.
According to Chongqing City Development Reform Commission data, to date, Chongqing City has a cumulative total of 3,403 fishing vessels and 4,643 fishing vessels that have signed a withdrawal agreement, representing 63.3 per cent and 86.3 per cent of the three-year total.
There were 4404 rearrested fishermen, or 42.54 per cent of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4,404 repatriated, 4,267 were employed, or 96.89 per cent of the repatriated fishermen.
The pension insurance coverage covers 2,691 persons, or 61.10 per cent of the retrenched fishermen.
As a next step, the city of Chongqing will carry out intensive rehabilitation and rehabilitation activities to speed up the implementation of the Yangtze Dry Stream project to clean up the Yangtze dry stream, complete a new round of the Yangtze into the river and carry out the corresponding remediation activities, complete the “triphosphorus” (for phosphorous mines, phosphorous chemical workers and phosphorous plaster banks) and undertake the rehabilitation of small-scale hydropower, promote the Yangtze reforestation project, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the results of the illegal dry stream docks and the special remediation of illegal sand-mining, and further promote the interdiction of the Yangtze basin.
Israel ' s Repeated Prevention and Control of the Epidemic - New Network
2020-07-26 04:56:44 Source: The Day of Light by Wang Seok-seok
Israel has stepped up its response to the outbreak.
In the early days of the new coronary pneumonia outbreak, the effectiveness of Israeli preventive and control measures was evident.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban and the recent marked rise in the number of new coronary pneumonia diagnoses in Israel, the Government of Israel has taken urgent measures on several occasions to strengthen the control of the epidemic.
On 28 February, the first new case of coronary pneumonia was confirmed in Israel proper, with the swift adoption of the closure of all entry/exit points, the suspension of non-essential industries, the conversion of schools to online teaching, restrictions on public transport and non-essential social activities, the closure of cities with severe epidemics, and joint military and police defence and control initiatives.
This series of measures quickly yielded positive results and, by mid-May, new single-day confirmed cases of coronary pneumonia in Israel had returned to single digits.
As the epidemic was brought under control and Israeli measures to prevent and control it were completely unsealed, the number of new confirmed cases of coronary pneumonia has gradually rebounded since June.
The spread of the epidemic has been accelerating, especially since July.
In recent days, Israel has experienced new cases of more than 1,500 new cases per day for eight days, reaching 916 new cases as of 25 July.
As at 25 July, there were 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Government of Israel has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen its control.
On 6 July, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Government of Israel closed public entertainment sites, such as gymnasiums, swimming pools, bars and nightclubs, and introduced a public transport restrictive policy that provided for a maximum of 20 passengers per bus.
On 17 December, the Government announced a series of new restrictions, including the “sealing of the city” on weekends, providing for the “sealing of the city” between 5 p.m. a week and 5 p.m. a week.
During this period, people may go out, but the shops, shopping centres, hairdressing shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, for all days and periods, gatherings of more than 10 persons are prohibited, gymnasiums, studios, etc. are closed, restaurants and cafés are prohibited from eating in the canteens and only takeout services are permitted.
At the same time, the Israeli population has not paid enough attention to the gravity of the epidemic and has failed to work with the Government in combating it.
In the wake of repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people went to the streets to protest demonstrations because of the Government's control measures affecting their economic interests.
On 11 July, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, arguing that the policy of resistance affected the economy.
During the evening of 21 November, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu ' s residence in Jerusalem to protest against the imposition by Prime Minister Netanyahu of preventive measures, such as a ban on restaurants and canteens, without corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people do not observe the requirement of wearing masks while travelling outside the home, and maintain a safe social distance of two metres. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people wear masks only on their chins or on their wrists.
During the recurrent epidemic, schools were the worst affected by the spread of the new coronary virus, and according to recent visits by journalists to the kindergarten, neither kindergarten teachers nor students were wearing masks as required by the Government, nor were they maintaining a safe social distance of two metres from each other, leaving behind the risk of a large number of teachers and students contracting the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the Israeli National Security Council's Advisory Panel of Experts on Combating the Epidemic, argued that Israel was moving towards a “dangerous situation”, pointing out that the current Israeli epidemic prevention and control measures were insufficient and that all leisure, recreational and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman stated that Israel lacked an overall plan to combat the epidemic, and that Parliament and Government departments should move away from their respective interests as soon as possible and reach agreement on the fight against the epidemic, with clear steps to include related restrictions in different sectors.
It's Tel Aviv, July 25th.
Ng Fengfang, a farmer in Ning Chaohara, could not survive the old companion's journey to Liang Yun Cultural Complex in a car from 20 miles away.
Despite these two years of discomfort, the 77-year-old DeFront was counting on “to come here in half-turns, to be in trouble”.
This is a small courtyard in the former prefecture of the city, which, unlike the home of a general farmer, is often characterized by a Qin cavity, and by a great variety of skin scenes, embroidery, traditional Qin cavities, brows, etc.
The owner of the compound, Liang Yun, was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he began to plan for the construction of a cultural complex, which he loved to sing and play.
With the Liang Yun Cultural Complex, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and diverse.
Journalists have not yet entered Liang Yun Cultural Complex, and the Qin accent has been transmitted.
Qin Qin's selection is for the village residents.
Since she was a child, she had become famous in the region and had come to the cultural complex to perform for her people.
Recently, she played live on the Internet.
"There's a stage where more people can see themselves performing."
On stage, the singer takes a single look, the singer plays a single tune, although he is an amateur, but he has no less enthusiasm.
Like the simple style of the farm house, beyond the Qin accent, the “grass roots” art and non-pensive culture of the Liang Yun cultural complex have emerged.
The compound also contains over 300 pieces of agricultural tools, traditional and handmade tiles, paper clippings, embroidery and leather shadows from different ages.
Liang Yun led journalists into the courtyard, showing his collection of old objects, old winepots, tristrings, swirling cars, etc.
Why does an ordinary farmer build a cultural complex?
"Felmography is my home-based trade, which I have been studying since I was 15 years old."
The Liang Yun Cultural Complex was established in 2012 as the first rural “Intangible Cultural Heritage Museum” in Ningxia and as a model compound for the preservation of intangible cultural heritage in the solid city.
In addition to the Liang Yun Cultural Camp, the Old State District of Solidahara has more than 120 cultural complexes and 79 private performance groups, including over 50 cultural complexes of a certain size, such as the Shen Jia River Cultural Complex, the Wang Yonghong Cultural Camp, the Yang Long Cultural Camp, etc., covering the towns, towns and streets of the Old State District with over 5,000 participants.
These grass-roots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the population and satisfying their spiritual needs.
“As life gets better, traditional culture cannot just be left behind.”
The "Liu's Battles" came back to "The Winners" to watch Yoyo Yun Long Lee's rivals "Standing"-Sinhua Network.
The 40-episode drama Winning will land in Beijing on 16 July.
The Winner is based on the true history of the Soviet military archives, which have been in existence for many years.
The actor Yoo Yun Long, well known to the audience as “The Battle of War”, broke his image in the play and challenged a very happy “stuttering agent”.
In recent years, the popularity of the " Concealer " " " Mask " and " kite " and other plays has proved to be a dynamic feature.
Unlike in the past, Winning looked at the world and extended the background of the story to the battlefield of the Soviet Far East.
In the context of the final phase of the 1944 anti-Japanese war, it tells the story of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) secret intelligence worker, Tang Fei (Liu Yunyu) who, under the leadership of the Secretary-General of the Chinese Underground Party, Lin River Province and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, carried out the “Mutangura” strategy of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency.
In many battles, the leading man, as a high-ranking spy, comes out with a perfect image of handsome, intelligent and mature.
But in Liu Yun Long's view, such a person is not fit to be a spy: “Shall a spy be the kind of person who can't find a place in a pile, and if it's a very handsome image that everyone wants to look at you, can it be any more? There's a line in the kite, "If you don't come after me, I'll forget I'm a nationalist." The spy is going to be elite."
So, in Winning, Yoo Yun-lung deliberately designed his play's master Don Fly as a stuttered “agent”.
The other camp in the Winners was supported by Fukuhara, the Japanese, and Fong Shiba, the chief of the police department.
Two powerful actors, one in the south and one in the north, added a great deal of skill to the whole play.
The director Yin Fei used the word "showing" to describe Li Li Li Qun and Liu Yun Long's rivals, "it's definitely a show, and they're very close to each other, and it's very impressive for me. Many times they're `current', like we write half a page of paper, and when I shoot, I don't say stop, so they can continue."
It is not only from the point of view of the characters, but also of the viewers who are able to look at it more, as Yin Fei says, when the actors are in the role and guarantee their character.
There are also familiar faces in many of the “Liu's battles”, with the famous “Mountain F4” in the kite, and the powerful “Mountain F4”, which gathered three in the “winners”.
He played Song Xiao An and Zhao Jane, and Liu Nam Yang, this time in Tang Fei's right arm.
Directed by Yin Fei, "There is no evil in these two people, but they just went with the times, the circumstances."
Yoon Yong has also taken the initiative, “We want a human face. This man's taste means that there must be good and bad people around me, and bad people are enemies, but we have to develop them, and our teams have to grow.”
The outcome of the show was also carefully designed, and he was confident that a satisfactory response would be given to the audience.

Hong Kong, Xinhua News Agency, 25 July
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Xu Jong-woo stated at an online seminar (Dorundo Time) on 24th (Hong Kong Economics and Trade Office in Toronto and Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce (Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce) that Hong Kong was experiencing a difficult situation as a result of the “rehabilitation” and new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is stable and favours the level of exchange guarantees for the powerful.
The banking system does not show clear signs of financial outflows; on the contrary, more than $11 billion has been inflow since June.
Total bank deposits have also continued to increase over the past few months, with a series of open equity fund-raising activities in the stock market, which has been on the rise.
According to Xu Jong-woo, the new coronary pneumonia epidemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong ' s fundamental advantage remains unchanged.
Hong Kong ' s many advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, the free flow of information and capital, and a simple low-tax system, have kept Hong Kong a leading international financial centre.
According to Xu Jong-woo, the HKSAR Government has set aside HK$ 6 billion for the Anti-Infectious Disease Fund to create approximately 30,000 time-bound jobs in the public and private sectors over the next two years, covering persons with different skills and qualifications.
To support the development of financial science and technology, the HKSAR Government has also launched the “Ten Thousand Plan” to fund local financial science and technology companies, start-ups and other enterprises with financial science and technology-related business to create 1,000 new jobs, employ local talent and enrich Hong Kong's financial science and technology pool.
Looking ahead, Xu Jong-woo is optimistic about Hong Kong ' s financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to take advantage of Hong Kong ' s advantages and its position as an international financial centre, an international centre for asset and wealth management and a global offshore currency business hub to develop and invest in the Bay of Hong Kong and surrounding areas.
"The Lancet" praises China's efforts to combat the disease and encourages countries to learn from the experience of China.
According to the 25-year-old Lancet magazine, China, a country of 1.4 billion people of similar size to Europe or the United States, is effectively controlling the new coronary epidemic at this stage, without further widespread transmission and to a large extent controlling the epidemic at home.
According to the article, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction for more than a decade, which has made it much more prepared for the new crown than for the SARS of that year.
According to the author, at the time of the SARS outbreak in 2002, China was initially under-prepared, especially since the pathogen was uncertain.
When the new coronary virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and, on 11 January 2020, shared genomic sequencing data with the international community.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had described the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world of the threat of the new crown virus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, which has been carried out very quickly and strictly through close cooperation within the country in the event of a state of emergency declared by the State. In May and July, respectively, China published the results of early trials of its new crown vaccine.
China ' s experience had shown that it was important to invest in national health and research systems and to improve laboratory capacity effectively.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, deserve to learn and learn.
Moreover, China ' s experience has shown that, on the basis of strong research, strong high-level and decisive science-based sound decision-making is necessary to effectively control the new coronary epidemic.
The article stressed that Governments and their leaders must respect science, understand its value and act on it in the best interests of society.
In the early days of the outbreak, the Chinese National Guard commissioned three groups of infectious disease specialists to travel to Wuhan to investigate the risks and spread of the new crown virus, whose recommendations provided the basis for the decision to “seal the city” in Wuhan on 23 January; the Government's decision was quickly taken and implemented as soon as experts had raised the need and urgency to build the square-hull hospital; and the wide participation of the community and the population had enabled the epidemic to be brought under control quickly and effectively.
The article concludes by emphasizing the need for countries to strengthen global cooperation and joint responses to global health emergencies.

"Good luck" by director Tai Peng.
On 18 July, the twenty-third Shanghai International Film Festival published the list of official selections for the Golden Lord Prize.
Director Tai Po's first reality film, " Good luck " , was successfully included in the Golden Order award for the film festival, while the first poster was published.
Posters, tablets.
The film " Good luck " was the first realistic piece of the film by the director of Tai Peng and his second link to the Golden Lord Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy director who came back to his home in the north-eastern countryside, hoping to turn his family into a literary film in the New Year, and suffered a series of accidents.
Members of the family gathered for the film, who completed the final party.
In today’s film poster, one of the family’s members, Uncle Wang, sits in the middle of the picture smoking cigarettes in the north-east black land dressed in silver, with the prospect of Chinese wearing red lanterns for the holidays.
The great contrast between the red lantern, which symbolizes the celebration and reunification, and the king's illustrious, also seems to reveal the complexities and problems of this extended family relationship.
According to the information received, the film, with the exception of Wang's daughter, who was played by actor Liu Lui, was completed by the real director's family, and the video's experimental audio-visual style broke the theatre and real boundaries and gave the audience a new insulated visual experience.
According to the director, Tai Peng, the creation of "Grateful Goodness" came from a "benevolent vision" that suddenly led to a series of changes in the family during the shoot that had to be followed by changes in the original filming plan, and that life without scripts was eventually recorded as a film, but released tension beyond design.
How can the director of Tai Peng face this "demonstration" and how can he continue to embrace the changes it has brought?
There can be no doubt that Gymnasium is experimental in nature, and that the almost universal form and innovative audio-visual style transforms life in front of the camera into a film, and that, under the cover of real images, the audience will also find a shadow of itself and of their families in the family that appears in the film, which brings a series of reflections to light as this family gathering ends.

The Battambang outpost, with a long platoon and a soldier on duty.
At this point in the year, where the average temperature is less than 10 degrees, a single platoon of simple barracks is standing at the hill gate, with a flag flying not far from the barracks, and soldiers standing in the wind on a daily basis, with regular patrols to higher altitudes.
The soldiers climbed the steep slopes of the pebbles and needed both hands and feet.
In late July, it was precisely when the grass of low-altitude areas was flourishing, and in Bakokang, only the hills behind the barracks were relatively dense green.
The warriors who had been stationed at the outpost for six years pointed to the ravine and said that it was their back garden, and that it was only in July and August that they could see the grass grow slowly and soon all turned yellow and covered with snow.
On foot patrols, which may take about nine hours.
In the harsh highlands, soldiers stationed there are often accompanied by snow mountains and glaciers, and they are regularly patrolling at higher altitudes.
A patrol consisting of eight fighters, led by a mentor, Liang Yan, took another patrol road.
Each soldier weighs about 30 pounds and moves towards the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a fighter turned his back, and his comrades were in emergency care.
In addition to patrolling missions, the fighters at the Badhodok outpost conduct daily tactical and physical training.
The passage of one minute and the rising altitude, the low oxygen content and physical overstretched have tested the willingness of the patrol personnel.
They kept on gnawing their teeth, then crossed several landslides and crossed several acute beaches.
At about 1600 hours, the members of the patrol took out their own dry rations and sat on the ground at an altitude of more than 5,700 metres, accompanied by rain and snow to supplement their physical strength with food.
The soldiers of the Bata Drecon outpost conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they play cards together and losers have to push-ups, both for entertainment and for exercise.
After a short break in the cold, they climbed the position of the patrol ' s target point and placed their flag at the intersection and made a solemn declaration.
Behind them is Mount Mamar, which is a few dozen kilometres of no-man's-man's-land, and they are the safest protectors of the gates.
Beijing consumption season restart - Xinhua Network
The city of Beijing resumed its activities for the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principles of “full renewal, focused planning, orderly advancement and organization”.
On 26 July, 1.5 million government coupons were issued, including 1 million underline food and catering coupons and 500,000 smart-product coupons, which consumers can collect from the Kyoto APP.

From the beginning of August, the current Government and enterprise contribution of 1:1 was adjusted to 2:1, for example, if the original consumer received a card to the shop, he would be entitled to a discount of $120, of which the Government subsidized $60, the enterprise contributed $60, and the adjusted Government subsidized $80 and the enterprise contributed $40.
During the consumption season, the three main operators will subsidize flows and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting 5G new infrastructure in Beijing and 5G new consumption.
Chen Maobo means that Hong Kong's economy has been hit again by the outbreak.
Hong Kong, China News Agency, July 26, Chen Maobo, Director of Finance of the Hong Kong SAR Government, stated on July 26 that Hong Kong was facing a new wave of new coronary pneumonia, which had hit business exchanges and economic activity, which had seen some recovery.

On the same day, Chen Mobo published an article on the Internet entitled " The Crouch Path to Recovery " .
He stated that the recent high number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in Hong Kong was critical, affecting the well-being of society and plaguing the economy.
In case of repeated outbreaks, first and foremost, the case of strict import control and the most rapid treatment and disruption of the chain of transmission of the virus; when the epidemic is under control, economic activity should resume accordingly, as appropriate.
He noted that, in the face of the impact of the new epidemic, commercial transactions and economic activities, which had seen a slight recovery, had also been hit.
Social responsibility is equally important for the business community, beyond the contractual spirit, especially for groups that receive large government subsidies in “employment security schemes”.
He mentioned that the economic situation in Hong Kong remained critical in the second quarter of the year, but the contraction seemed to have slowed slightly.
With regard to exports, he considered that the external situation in Hong Kong remained critical.
According to Chen, the development history of Hong Kong over the past few decades has shown that every crisis conceals new opportunities and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
The largest earthquake in Taiwan's eastern waters this year - the new Chinanet.
On July 26, Taiwan's eastern waters at 2052 hours, an earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale, with a maximum of 4 magnitudes, with an all-time shock, was the largest earthquake in the country this year.
Media outlets such as Integrated Central, China Times Electronics, and ETtoday News Cloud reported that the earthquake hit 86.5 kilometres south-east of the Ilan County Government, that is, the eastern sea area of Taiwan, at a depth of 53 kilometres.

Malinichev stated that changes in value were influenced by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic.
He said, “The cost of services is increasing.
As a result of the epidemic, people started spending more time on the Internet.”
Malinichev does not rule out a serious rise in the price of the Internet each year, arguing that operators can counter-balance the dissatisfaction with the price increase by providing higher speed and more services to their clients.
"Doctors of China" for a tribute to the anti-fouling hero Xinhua.
Recently, with respect to the Chinese filmmaker ' s hero in the fight against the disease, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Borneo Film Company, Liu Weiqiang (Tu Zhou), in Guangzhou and Zhongnanshan, held a conversation on the production of the film " Doctors of China " against the disease.
The Boone industry wishes to take advantage of the Chinese Doctor to pay tribute to all the medical and preventive workers who fought in the first line of the epidemic!
In 2021, the film will be presented as a national presentation to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party.
At present, with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau, the Bonaña Film Industry is being deployed under the auspices of the Chinese Ministry of Public Information and the National Film Office, and the Chinese Medical Doctor is organizing the original film " Chinese Captain " , a film that reflects the strong leadership of the central party and which unites the people of the country to fight the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
The film, which focuses on the fight against the disease in Wuhan, will present a moving story of Chinese health-care workers who are dedicated and sacrificing, from a human perspective, using unique narratives and very powerful lenses.
It is understood that, at the very first hour of the day when Wuhan was released, Bo Na, despite the difficulties it faced, sent a team of surveyors to go into the epidemic and to meet with hundreds of health-care workers for a face-to-face exchange of information and information. Interviews have been made with the Chinese himself, the first person in Guangzhou to assist Wuhan, the medical team in Guangdong, and the first-hand video files of the white-clothes angels at the forefront of the anti-immunism front, such as Wuhan Jinxiang Hospital, Wuhan Association and Hospital, Wuhan University and Wuhan Central Hospital.
At this symposium, the Zhongnan Shan academic staff also expressed their expectations and hopes for the film production: “I look forward to seeing not only some of the more visible experts, but also more of the medical personnel who are suffering at the front line, most of them.”
He stated that he had read " Me and my motherland " , " Captain China " , and that he believed that it would be good to tell the big story from a general human perspective.
“There is still some misunderstanding of China by some foreign friends.”
When it comes to the spread of the film, the Zhongnan Shan Academy says that there are people abroad who now like to label the virus as politicized, and he hopes that the film will impress the audience from a human perspective: “In addition to China, it is desirable that the film be shown abroad, in a way that is understandable to the audience at home and abroad, in a true human spirit.”
The Zhongnan Mountain Academy also remembered with great affection the film Man to Middle Ages of the 1980s, “Man to Middle Ages, after so many years, I was most impressed by the post-reform open-door film Man to Middle Ages, when my friends of doctors abroad cried, and it would have been remarkable if the Chinese Doctor had been able to do so.”
Zhongnan Shan said that it would be very successful if the Chinese Doctor could resonate with the audience abroad.
In the course of the conversation, the Zhongnan Mountain Academy also shared its views and recommendations on the current international epidemic, “I believe that people are always smarter than the virus”.
According to Zhongnan Shan, although the virus is difficult to predict, human beings have so far been at great risk from the primordial societies, and today there are developed medical, technological and social management measures in modern societies, together with a basic understanding of the scientific response to the new coronary pneumonia epidemic among the world's medical staff and even among the general population, so that people will no longer be as passive as they were before.

According to the Director-General of the Jian'an City Department of Civil Affairs, Madung Po, the exhibition carefully selected the best red creative products in Yen'an for almost two years, 16 of which were excellent works of 2019 national red original.
At the same time, they invited the National Intangible Cultural Heritage Protection Project, “Anse Cutting Paper”, “Showing the Song of the North” and the Provincial Non-Remaining Project, the Yanchuan Painter, to focus on the promotion of the Yonan Folklore feature products, and to use this opportunity to communicate with enterprises in other exhibition areas to promote cross-regional cooperation.
The cumulative number of new confirmed cases in Japan exceeds 30,000 - Xinhua Network
According to statistics, 239 new confirmed cases were recorded in Tokyo on 26th day, and more than 200 new cases were registered on a single day of six days, reaching a cumulative total of 11114.
In addition, 141 new confirmed cases were registered in Osaka, 90 in Fukuoka and 80 in Aichi.
The first half of the year saw a 70% rise in fraud on the telecommunications network.
In the first half of this year, the national prosecution service prosecuted 58101 persons for fraud offences, a 35 per cent increase over the previous year.
In particular, fraud offences are more prevalent among epidemic-related offences, and the prosecution of fraud offences by the prosecution service accounts for 43.4 per cent of the total number of cases of epidemic-related offences.
The Supreme People ' s Procuratorate has conducted targeted guidance and has published a total of 9 cases involving fraud in 10 typical cases of disease prevention and control.
In the first half of the year, the Public Prosecution Service handled a wide variety of cases involving fraud offences, ranging from national macro-policies to civilian food and clothing, including epidemic-related fraud, “medical” frauds, “health-care” frauds, “pupil recruitment” frauds, “loop loan” frauds, State subsidy frauds, the unfreezing of national assets, etc., and continued “news”, ranging from education, medical care, employment, old-age pensions, social security, evictions, precision poverty alleviation and financial credit to economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications networks defraud national borders, geographical areas and human constraints, with characteristics such as crowd, cross-border, long-distance, electronic payments, and a large number of non-specific groups of victims, to the detriment of them.
For example, the creation of specialized companies, the rental of high-grade writing buildings, the creation of multiple departments or posts, the use of legal web platforms for advocacy, recruitment, training and appraisal of recruiters, the introduction of business models for management, the wearing of “legitimate clothing” and greater confusion.
It is incumbent on the prosecution authorities to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to provide timely warning to the public and to the authorities concerned.
In the administration of justice, the Public Prosecution Service has taken a serious role in maintaining a high level of pressure on fraud offences, and has tailored law enforcement initiatives to promote social governance through the issuance of prosecutorial recommendations, among others.
The Public Prosecution Service strictly applies the factual, evidentiary, procedural and legal application of arrest, prosecution and fraud cases, on the basis of the facts and in accordance with the law, so as not to be unjust.
In particular, in the case of telecommunication network fraud offences, efforts have been made to build a chain of evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence, focusing on the central role of electronic data in factual determination.
In the case of a case of fraud and fraud in Nimba County, Zhejiang province, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office intervened early in the first instance, taking only five days from the time the case occurred to its conclusion, reflecting an attitude and determination to proceed quickly and to maintain stability in society.
In reviewing the arrest and prosecution chain, focusing on the prosecution of the leaks in the case, the Public Security organs corrected the arrest of 733 persons, and the Public Security organs reviewed the prosecution of 1113 persons.
In the first half of the year, the National Prosecution Service issued 298 prosecutorial recommendations on fraud offences, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud and promote deeper governance.
For example, in response to deficiencies in the monitoring of the telecommunications network identified by communications companies, banks, intermediaries, etc., the Guangzhou City Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the East Chang City Public Prosecutor ' s Office in Guangdong Province have issued timely recommendations for inspection, urging the authorities concerned to strengthen their supervision and improve their mechanisms to help build a long-lasting system.
The fourth is to do everything in their power to recover the damage.
The prosecution authorities in all regions have taken advantage of the important elements of intervention in the investigation leading to the taking of evidence and the examination of prosecutions. They have urged the investigating authorities to actively pursue the collection of stolen funds and to cooperate with the authorities in the recovery of the proceeds, in an effort to minimize the economic damage caused to the population by fraud.
As in the case of a certain set of road loans, which was handled by the Beijing Municipal Public Prosecutor ' s Office, there were 22 housing units that were waiting to be seized, and where the property might be disposed of first and foremost by other cases, a stay of execution letter was first issued, which was sent to the relevant court in a timely manner, recommending that the previous seizure court suspend the execution of the property in question, pending the establishment of the facts of the offence, and that it should be dealt with uniformly, with a view to making the best efforts to recover the property in question and recover the damage to the victim.
The Prosecutor reminds you of the need for a high level of vigilance with regard to fraud, not to expect “papers from the sky” and not to hold your own “money bags” lightly.
Jinna Town, Weining County, Guizhou: Short apple tree, wide poverty path - new net.
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Network
Inflammation in the heat, the daily economic newspaper, a reporter of the China Economic Network, walked into the town of China Sea in Winning County, Guizhou province.
In the middle of the sun, the villagers Lee Won-zheng snuffed in the base and, while his face was tanned in red, he used to sing songs from time to time.
In the town of Winning, where the town is located, the size of the industry has not been made possible because of its low latitude and altitude, the abundance of light, the high temperature of day and night, the high sugar content and taste of the apples produced, and its visibility in the surrounding area, but also because of its small size and its large number of spots.
This town was once a poor town of “Spring and Autumn Potato” and 10 years ago the incidence of poverty was as high as 25.8 per cent.
In the critical period of the fight against poverty, changing traditional farming practices, restructuring industries and increasing farmers' incomes are imminent.
After numerous visits, Chen and a group of people in the town of Chena, the Party Secretary, believed that industrial development could no longer follow the same path.
To that end, the town of Xuana has introduced the lead enterprise to grow apples in a modern manner.
Viinen, Deputy General Manager of the Agricultural Company Limited, Hu Xian Wen, who came to the town of Chennai in 2015 to study the local conditions for planting, starting in 2016, to plant apple trees locally.
At first, the village mobilized Lee Yuan Zhong to move the land out and plant apple trees, and the couple made a cynicism: “We have grown apples for so many years, and we have seen no one in the village grow them rich.”
"All the apples we grow are dwarfed apples. They don't grow too tall."
What Li won't think is that this apple planting has taken a new approach: irrigation pipes are laid under every apple tree, water and fertilizer are poured together into the roots of the tree, and when the fruit is collected in the fall, the tractor drives straight into the orchard and can pick the fruit standing up.
At present, Apple Base has gradually entered a productive phase, and the market, as envisaged in the Huixian script, is not apocalyptic and is well received by urban consumers in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
The growing apple industry has brought about a new change in Lee's life, with new sources of income, though still growing.
The Lee Yuan Zhong family has transferred more than nine acres of land to Apple Base, and each year, in addition to securing the land flow costs, profits are divided between the fruit and the fruit, and the husband and the wife usually work in the Base “for 80 yuan a day for each person, with constant work”.
Lee Yuan Zhong told journalists that last year's profit-sharing was over 2,800, and that, together with land transfer fees and the income of the couple's workers, the family earned more than 80,000, “the life of Xiao Hong is over”.
“Accountable results have now been achieved, with one acre of apples producing more than $15,000 per year, about 10 times the value of corn.”
Chen told the journalists that the town had grown 20,000 acres of apples, 6,000 in the village of China Sea alone, covering 4056 farmers and 172,000 people, of whom 656 were poor and 2,952 were paid more than $6 million a year, making it possible to build a base in front of the home and to work without going outside.
LEE Won-zhong, a growing fan, has also begun to realize his “will”.
This year, Lee Won-chun bought a Land Cruiser, which was driven to and from work today. “There are more than a dozen acres of land in the family, and more income when the apple base is next scaled up and all flowed to them”.

The membrane separation technology helps break the greenhouse effect - the new net.
Membrane separation technology helps break the greenhouse effect.
Map of new hybrid base-mass membrane preparation techniques
Reporter Swe: Recently, the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team of Tianjin University made significant progress in developing new technologies for the preparation of mixed base membranes for carbon dioxide capture in the context of membrane separation.
The results were published as a cover article in the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The greenhouse effect is a major environmental problem plaguing human development, and CO2 emissions are responsible for the greenhouse effect.
The efficient capture and use of human emissions of carbon dioxide is the focus of scientists.
The membrane separation method is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technique that separates carbon dioxide gases with the help of membrane materials and is characterized by energy efficiency and simplicity of operation.
How to make membrane material “deep breath” and improve the efficiency of gas separation is a bottleneck to capture carbon dioxide using membrane separation.
The scientific team at Tianjin University has been innovative in exploring the effects of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance through repeated experiments.
Experimental results have shown that the use of N-methylacne as a solvent has resulted in a more even distribution of carbon nanopipes in membrane materials, which are “better ventilated” and have effectively improved the gas separation efficiency and rate of membrane materials.
The composite base membrane, prepared with this new technology, allows CO2 separation performances close to the theoretical separation cap of the current membrane material.
“New technologies provide new ideas for membrane separation methods to capture CO2.”
Li Yun, member of the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team at Tianjin University, said: “We hope that this technology will provide strong support to future coal-fired power plants and chemical industries in dealing with flue gases and play a major role in areas such as control of greenhouse gas emissions.”
Before you volunteer, understand what a professional grader is.
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning News
You know what a professional is before you volunteer.
Each year, students or parents fill in a higher examination because of their lack of knowledge of the terminology involved in the voluntary submission, thus affecting the voluntary filing.
This year, Beijing University of Transport, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Post and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing Chemical University and five universities jointly launched a 2020 admission policy to eliminate professional differentials.
What does a poor professional level mean and what is the significance of voluntary filing?
There are three ways the rules of professional assignment.
Experts reminded that before volunteering, it was important to read the admission charter of the Heart School and to understand the admission rules for higher education institutions, including the transfer rate, rules for professional assignment, etc.
The rules for the allocation of professions refer to three modes of professional admission, namely, professional preference, grade priority and professional grade differentials, following a transfer from higher education.
The specific modalities used in higher education institutions are specified in the Statute of Admission.
However, there are also some institutions of higher education where the principle of admission is given priority and there is no difference between the levels of specialization.
In other words, candidates in the range are queued according to their total score, and when the score does not reach the first professional voluntary intake score, it depends on whether the second professional voluntary intake score has been reached, so that it is pushed until the last professional volunteer is accepted, and there is no grade differential between professional volunteers.
The so-called “professional differential” is the “professional differential” in the selection of candidates for a different professional voluntary examination, which is determined by the grade of one or more of the points published in the by-laws of admission.
This is the difference between the scores of the first and non-first professional voluntary students admitted to the Institute and the difference between the levels of the various professional volunteers, i.e., three, two, one.
For example.
On the assumption that the students will take the post-secondary examination, 560 points have been taken for professional volunteering: computers, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, and professional admissions to the post-secondary level A have a professional differential of 2 points, 1 point, 1 point and 0 points.
When a professional assignment is made, if the first professional volunteer meets the requirements for professional admission and there is a planned balance of the profession, he is admitted to the “computer” profession; if the computer is not accepted, his score will be reduced by two points to determine whether the qualification for professional admission is met by ranking the first professional volunteer for “international trade” according to the 558 score; if it remains unsatisfied, the third professional voluntary “automated” admission will be reduced by one point (i.e. 557); if it remains unsatisfied, the fourth professional admission will be reduced by a further fraction (i.e., 556) and the subsequent professional will not be reduced by such deduction.
Different universities have different levels of specialization.
With the spread of parallel volunteering, many higher education institutions have now abolished professional grades, but some of them have retained this method this year, which, according to the admissions charter published by the respective schools, has been marked by more than 20 universities.
For example, Sichuan University of Agriculture, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Medicine, Jiangsu University of Technology, Jiangxi University of Teacher Training, Chengdu College of Medicine, Northeast Power University, Sumi University, Nanjing University of Medicine, Nanjing Industrial University, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, Chinese Civil Aviation Flight School, etc.
Each university has a different level of specialization in these institutions.
Some higher education institutions have grades in each specialty, such as the University of Ningxia, where the files have been placed and accepted according to the order in which the candidates filed their professional volunteer, in descending order of fraction.
Some universities, on the other hand, have different professional grades between them.
For example, at the Central University, the total difference in professional voluntary rank is 4 points, i.e. 3 points for first professional voluntary and other professional voluntary levels, no difference between other professional volunteers, considered parallel voluntary, and 1 point between other professional voluntary and transfer professional volunteer levels.
When making a voluntary contribution, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school and see whether there is a difference in professional grades, what the difference is, and, while taking due account of the points, a reasonable analysis of the schools and professions to be selected, if the admissions are explicitly made by a grade difference in the by-laws of the institution, and when selecting a profession, the candidates must take care of the gradients between the professions and increase the intake rate.

The first Atlantic hurricane this year landed in Texas, which was hit hard by the outbreak.
The United States National Hurricane Center announced that morning that Hurricane Hanna was at 145 kilometres per hour and expected to cause heavy rainfall in southern Texas and north-eastern Mexico until Monday, which in turn could trigger rapid flooding.
At present, with the gradual movement towards land, customs have been reduced, and no casualties have been reported for the time being, despite local power cuts.
A number of local officials in Texas are preparing to respond to the likely cyclone along the coast.
On Twitter, President Trump stated that the Office was closely monitoring the dynamics of Hurricane Hanna and Hurricane Douglas in Hawaii and called on the population to listen to the emergency management information of the local Government and protect families and property.
At the same time, the new coronary epidemic in Texas is deteriorating dramatically, with the number of infected people soaring, with a cumulative diagnosis of more than 390,000 infected and more than 5,000 deaths.
In the wake of this hurricane, the Government will face the double challenge of sheltering the homeless while preventing the epidemic from worsening again.

According to the latest statutes, the Alliance will introduce a lead unit rotation mechanism to enhance the functioning of the Panel.
The Panel will make recommendations for the analysis of trends in industry to promote sustainable industrial development.
At the same time, the integration of industry-wide chain resources, with a large and small presence of associated enterprises, will lead to the formation of the Fair as a high-rise for industrial enterprises.
The establishment for the first time of the Inter-Agency Committee on Public Health Prevention and Control is particularly important in the current fight against the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
As Vice-President of the Third Episcopal Committee on Public Health, the General Manager of the Addis Ababa Rapid Diagnosis Operations, Chao-Ping, said that, in the next step, the organization would work with more industry partners to explore new solutions and cooperation models to help China and the world fight the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
On 26 July, at the site of the inaugural ceremony of the Specialized Committee on Public Health Prevention and Control in Shanghai.
According to information received, the third Expo established for the first time a special public health prevention area, and to date nearly 50 global enterprises have registered for the exhibit, with an exhibition area exceeding 10,000 square metres.
During the first Expo, in 2018, the Alliance of Exhibition Participants was established by the Fairers' Self-Advocacy Initiative to serve as a platform for high-quality business exchanges and cooperation, a platform for information- and resource-sharing to connect participants, and a think tank to promote trade and trade between China and countries (regions) around the world.
To date, 142 enterprises have joined the Alliance of Exhibitors, covering 23 countries and territories worldwide.
Death of 3-year-old Belgian girl from New Crown Virus infection - Xinhua Network
According to the Belgian health sector, a 3-year-old girl died of a new coronary virus infection, the youngest in the country.
The Belgian health-care spokesperson, Boudwin Cutterri, said that the girl had already had other serious diseases before she became infected with the new coronary virus; in addition to the girl, a young person aged 18 had recently died of the infection.
Cartri said that 85 per cent of the new arrivals in Belgium last week were under the age of 60.
He reminds the population, who is healthy and younger, not to lose heart.
“Although it is rare for young people to die of new coronary virus infections, no one is now immune. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Last week, new coronary confirmed cases in Belgium increased by 89% over the previous week, with an average of 2.9 deaths per day from new coronary virus infections, up from an average of 1.7 per day in the previous week.
During the peak of the European epidemic, the Belgian population accounted for the “highest number” of new coronavirus infections in Europe.
Belgium has a population of more than 11 million.
The most recent data show that a total of 64,847 people in Belgium are infected with the new crown virus.
Katry warned earlier this week that people must take action before snowballs roll bigger and eventually cause an avalanche.
In an effort to contain the rebound, Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Vermes announced on 23 August that the rules governing the wearing of masks in public places would be tightened and that a programme to lift further restrictive measures would be suspended in August.

Xinhua Hong Kong, 25 July
Quo Tinghua made this statement in the context of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Video Conference of Trade Ministers to Combat the New Crown Pneumonia Epidemic.
At the meeting, ministers exchanged views on the substantive options that APEC could take to address the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic and to promote economic recovery in the region.
Quintenghua stated that the public health and economic crisis triggered by the epidemic had far-reaching social and economic implications that were unprecedented.
“We are in a double battle, and we must overcome the epidemic before we can save the economy.
If we are to be clear, the virus is our common enemy, and if we are to work together, we will only fail.”
According to Quo Tenghua, the new coronary pneumonia outbreak has led to a series of trade restrictions that help to contain the epidemic.
Trade was a key good solution to the current problem and should not be seen as a problem.
He condemned all policy measures that were discriminatory and divisive and urged all economies to keep their borders open at this critical time, maintain the smooth functioning of supply chains and avoid barriers to trade or irrational trade policies.
44,000 new crown cases confirmed in the state of Metropolis.
On July 26, China Newsnet, a comprehensive report, the Johns Hopkins University website in the United States showed that as of around 0834 Beijing time, the state of Florida in the United States had reported over 414,000 new confirmed cases, more than 411,000 in New York State, making it the second-largest “prevalence zone” in the United States after California.
According to the Florida Health Service, 124 deaths were reported in 24 cases in Florida.
This is the tenth death toll per day in Florida since the beginning of the New Crown pandemic.
The total number of cases reported in the worst-case scenario in Florida in the Miami-Dedshire is over 100,000.
There are currently 8,974 new crown patients in Florida, of whom 1874 are in Miami Ded.
Since 4 July, the number of new crown hospitalizations in the canton has increased by 79 per cent.
Since the reopening of the first state in the United States on 24 April, 91,000 lives have been lost to the new crown.
According to data provided by Johns Hopkins University, the total number of confirmed cases reported by the United States has reached 4.176,000, with at least 146,000 deaths.
The police stopped people from looking too happy.
In response to the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, China announced the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
On Saturday, the consular badge was removed and on Sunday a dark glass car drove out of the consular post in the boob.
On Sunday, a lot of people piled up in front of the consular post, and people who had not come were driven by current curiosity.
Agence France-Presse journalists also went to see the Chinese consulate near Chengdu, where news was received that curious people were coming, and that many parents took their children for a walk to watch the consulate, photograph the building, or take a selfie.
The consular post was surrounded by guards, and from time to time the police “picked” people, who seemed to have refused to allow any defection: a woman had been called to a halt as soon as she was ready to sing and a guard had confiscated a banner.
But residents of a nearby residential building succeeded in lifting a huge Chinese flag on their balcony and shouting slogans in support of China.
The Chinese Consulate opened in 1985 and covers all United States consular-related matters in south-western China, in particular the Tibet Autonomous Region.
The Chinese government's reaction to the United States has been relatively restrained: A large number of Chinese online have asked the government to close the United States Consulate in Hong Kong, but the official simply said that “the closure of the Chengdu Consulate is a necessary and legitimate response to the unreasonable behaviour of the United States”.
In addition to Chengdu, the United States is based in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and Hong Kong Consulate.
The big integration media campaign, Walking Village Live to End Poverty, is on its way.
On 25 July, a large-scale media initiative, " Walking Villages to Fight Poverty " , organized by the Central Radio and Television General Financial and Economic Centre, was launched from Jiangsu Zezhou, and two caravans carrying a mobile cloud-laying system of 5G new media were dropped off by guests at the scene.
According to General Secretary Xi, “the year 2020 is a landmark year in which we will be fully able to achieve our first centennial goal, and the year 2020 will also be the year of decisive victory against poverty”.
The large-scale media campaign, " Walking Villages and Watching Out of Poverty " , is an important initiative of the Central Radio and Television Centre for Financial and Economics to promote poverty eradication in line with this major theme.
The operation will go into the anti-poverty villages of more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government, dig up stories of life-saving poverty, confront the dramatic changes in the village ' s face and show how villagers have broken the path to survival and development.
This operation will last for more than three months.
From Xuzhou, the journalists split into two groups and travelled along the south-west route, via Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan and Tibet, and the north-west route, via Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei, and beyond 10,000 kilometres.
In the form of the report, The Walking Village Live to Fight Poverty has been boldly integrated.
The economic development of the villages visited by caravans will be broadcast through the Central Radio and Television General, the Financial and Economic Channel, Yang Guange Voice of the Economy, China Transport Radio, and the new media.
Among them, live television coverage will be completed mainly in the OIF ' s midday news programme, The Book of the World (first: Monday to Sunday, 12 noon to 13:00), while the OCF ' s gold news section, Economic Information Channel, will feature an anti-poverty column (first: Monday to Sunday, 2030 to 21:30).
At the same time, every village visited will be broadcast live for up to one hour on the client side of the financial and economic field, and viewers will be able to watch live broadcasts and participate in the award-raisers by downloading the financial and economic app.
In terms of technology applications and studio design, Walking the Village Lives to Get Out of Poverty was the first “new media caravan outside”.
The vehicle carries a mobile cloud-laying system for 5G new media, using 5G+4K/8K+AI technology to achieve an organic combination of offline, large screens and television broadcasts.
The three-temperature broadcast area, modified by container, is 12 metres long, 2.55 metres wide and 3.98 metres high, and the container is automatically constructed using hydraulic pressure, with a maximum lift of 120 degrees.
The show area can also be automatically launched and replaced by an extended platform of more than 50 square metres to meet the scene requirements of most programmes.
The East River district of Kunming city is now experiencing summer inflammation, and more hot than the weather is the relocation of pro-poor workshops near settlements.
Lu Ling, an employee of Kunming Espoo Electronics and Technology, said, “Now, as soon as we get out of the house, we go into the factory and make money, thanks to free vocational skills training organized by trade unions.”
Walking into a poverty-reducing workshop for the processing of electrons on the copper street in Toshikawa district, a busy, hot-fired image was shown in the curtains.
Rulings, over 40 years old, is a single mother with a child and is caring for older parents.
At her most difficult time, the General Trade Union of Toshikawa helped to find a way to “carry in the snow” before running.
Since 2018, Lu Ling has benefited from support policies such as housing, schooling, social security, employment, etc., and from assistance from trade unions at all levels.
This year, her child had successfully graduated and been employed, and she herself had worked and earned income as a result of her skills training and had been released at the end of April.
According to the information received, the training project of the General Organization of Toshikawa Region to help combat poverty is part of the skills training of the Yunnan General Trade Union.
Taking into account the characteristics of the district ' s hard-to-reach relocation centres, in-depth surveys have been conducted to identify training needs and to identify the types of jobs to be trained.
In recent days, the Agricultural Bank, Yunnan Menglian County Branch employee, Li Yi, has written a sincere letter of thanks to the county union.
In her letter, she expressed her sincere appreciation for the assistance given to her by the trade union between August 2013 and January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi ' s father died as a result of a car accident and her mother was included in the files of workers in difficulty, and since then she has enjoyed the care of the policy of building a card.
With the help of local trade unions, she successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3809 families have been rescued through institutional guarantees and precision support.
The successful release of the Lu Ling family and LEE is a microcosm of the Yunnan trade union ' s promotion of the work of needy workers.
According to the opening statement of the staff of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights Defence of the Yunnan Province, the provincial general has strengthened the dynamic management of the files of workers in difficulty, promoted the regularization of the slotting process and the timely incorporation of the help system for those in need who meet the conditions of the slotting; broadened the application channels for workers in difficulty, and made it possible for those in need to file a slotting service platform on the web-based application for workers in difficulty to facilitate their timely and active filing.
During the epidemic, in order to help workers in difficulty in the care of their lives, Yunnan Province has set aside more than $13 million to provide warmth funding, and special warmth condolences for more than 6,000 workers at the national level and 1,000 at the provincial level, in accordance with the 2000 yuan per family for workers in difficulty at the national level and 1,500 yuan per household for workers in difficulty at the provincial level.
At the same time, various Internet recruitment platforms, such as the Human Welfare Department and the IUPU, are interfaced to disseminate recruitment information to workers in difficulty and provide employment counselling, guidance, etc.
