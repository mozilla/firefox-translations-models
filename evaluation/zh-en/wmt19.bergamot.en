According to British media, General William Moran, Undersecretary of Warfare, said that even as the U.S. Navy is reviving its strength to tackle the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States continues to make the Asia-Pacific region the scope of the region including the Indo-Pacific, the Pacific Ocean-Asia-Pacific a priority.
According to the website of Jane's Defense Weekly, the United States listed China and Russia as a strategic competitor in the new defense strategy announced at the beginning of the year.
The U.S. Navy has since restored the Second Fleet in order to more directly counter Russian activity.
The moves have raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts who fear the U.S. Navy could stay away from the Obama administration's "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy.
But Admiral Moran said the U.S. Navy's focus remains on the Western Pacific.
At a roundtable titled “Meeting the High Sea Challenge, ” hosted by the National Bureau of Asian Studies in Washington, D.C., on January 24, 2018, he said, “For us, no major changes have been changed. ”
Moran said, "The focus is still rebalancing, shifting the center of gravity or whatever you want to describe it," Moran said.
But he admits that the United States has close ties with Europe.
“We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do, ” he said.
While Moran pointed out that the general policy on Russia falls within the purview of the U.S. defense secretary, he warned: "The Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history proves that if we conflict with them, they will be very tough."
Admiral Moran said that as part of the U.S. re-emergence operation against Russia, China and other competitors, the U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying troops into a "new operational mode" that will help get adversaries off guarding where U.S. carrier strike groups or other assets will be deployed at any given time.
“Our Navy and Marine Corps support it — the concept of operational unpredictability, not to appear in the same place again and again, almost like a clockwork — that ’ s what we do, ” he said.
The first attempt at this new approach was the "Harry Truman" carrier strike group, whose early deployments included working visits to ports and patrols in areas that are usually only adopted.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is currently working to make sure allies know that the warships will still be patrolling in traditional areas and is also addressing logistical and home liaison issues for the new deployment process.
Gen. Michael Noon, commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also spoke at the event, saying that the Australian army could work seamlessly with the US carrier strike group.
He said this situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to procure nine more frigates equipped with the Aegis operating system.

Japan's Ito Zhong Commercial on Friday identified a $13 billion in impairment losses in investment in China's China CITIC shares, a write-down of the largest corporate investment deal due to trade tensions between China and the United States.
In Tokyo, Japan, in May 2016, a man walked past the headquarters of Marubeni Co., Ltd.
Marubeni said that the trade war hit Gao Hong, the U.S. grain division, and that it has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
In the past, some heavy equipment manufacturers and telecommunications companies in Japan have issued warnings about the impact of Sino-US trade frictions at the time of the latest results, and now these Japanese traders have joined the ranks.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on each other's hundreds of billions of dollars of goods, and U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened that if the dispute cannot be resolved, the levy will be extended to all of more than $50 billion of Chinese exports to the United States.
Ito Zhong's chief financial minister, Tsuyoshi Hachimura, said the impact of the trade dispute on China's economy could be even greater next year.
Ito Zhong Commercial and Thailand's Bu Bee Group invested $10 billion in the 2015 to gain a 20 percent stake in CITIC.
Hachimura said that Ito Zhong Commercial's shareholding in this part of the column was a loss of 1,443 billion yen ($1.3 billion) in view of the fact that CITIC's stock price will not pick up in the near future.
Ito Zhong Commercial maintained a profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 at 5,000 billion yen.
China imposed 25% import tariffs on U.S. soybeans in July to counter Washington's move in trade frictions.
“Our grain business has been hit by U.S.-China trade frictions, ” said Yan Hong, the Treasurer of Marubeni.
He said Gao Hong had stopped trading financial transactions on his own account since September.
Gao Hong spokesman Pat Burke said in a statement on Friday that the company's move was "consistent in accordance with internal policy restrictions and due to a lack of market opportunities."
He also said that the suspension of financial transactions would not lead to job losses.
Marubeni remained unchanged for its annual profit estimate of 2,300 billion yen, which was helped by the pulp and paper and power generation business.
Sumitomo announced a 16 percent increase in profit from April to September on Thursday, stressing that “America ’ s trade issues with China have left the outlook uncertain. ”
Mitsubishi Motors on Friday raised its annual profit forecast to record levels, at a drop of increased coking coal production and higher prices for commodities such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Corporation also announced a new business plan, aiming to increase its profit in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 to increase from the 6,400 billion yen ($79.8 billion) estimated this year.
China New Network November 5th comprehensive report, the United States mid-term election voting has entered the countdown.
On November 4, President Trump and Democratic opponents actively "send votes" to their core voters.
Both major parties have pointed out that voter turnout will be the key to swaying the election.
According to reports, 48 hours before the American people voted, Trump was busy attending the Republican candidates' campaign, and former President Obama went to Indiana to stand for the election of Democratic Senate candidate Joe Donnelly, and shouted to the masses to make their last demands before the election.
On November 4th, Trump went to Megang, Georgia, to be a Republican nominee for governor Brian Kemp, who said, "Tuesday you have to go to the polling place, you have to vote."
“The contrast in this election is unlikely to be clearer. ”
The political enthusiasm of voters has risen to a rare peak, and early voting in some states has become far beyond the usual level.
Successive U.S. presidents face the first mid-term election, and the number of members of Congress in his party tends to be reduced.
According to a new poll released by the Washington Post and ABC News on the 4th, while the Democratic Federal House election remains dominant, Republicans can benefit from economic assessments and Trump's strict focus on border security.
Polls show that registered voters prefer Democrats to more candidates than Republicans, which is 50% versus 43 percent, but it still declines compared to August's 14 percentage points.
Another poll done by NBC and the Wall Street Journal also showed that Democrats still lead Republicans by seven percentage points.
It is reported that Obama told the crowd on the occasion of Senator Donnoli's campaign: "When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, there will be evil consequences."
Democracy can't work if people can only lie from themselves. "
"The only way to stop these Republican actions now is you and your vote."
Democrats face the toughest election in decades in the Senate, where the Republican Party currently holds more than half a half of the seats.
But the House election is more favorable, and Democrats need to win 23 more seats to control the House of Representatives with 435 seats.
Analysts at the prediction website FirethyEight.com estimate that Democrats are likely to win the House of Representatives by up to 85 percent.

Under the current wave of "mass entrepreneurship, innovation", more and more technology companies have begun to attach importance to patent research and development and related protection work, digging deep into the potential value of patents, and occupying market dominance.
Similarly, there are many technology companies that have encountered no small infringement storm in terms of patent technology licensing and patent technology use.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province three people took the "Didi Chuxing" APP developer Beijing Xiaolan Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiaotang Technology), the operator Didi Chuxing Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Chuxing), and the seller of Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested a court order that the three defendants immediately cease the patent behavior of manufacturing, selling, promising sales, and using the plaintiff's patent.
On October 30, 2018, the China Referee Instrument Network published the "Olimate Judgment of the First Instance Dispute between Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaotang Technology Co., Ltd.", and disclosed the details of some cases of Didi Chuxing APP for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs believe that the patent and inventor of the patent and inventor of the "mobile ride-sharing service system and method-based" patent, and the entire operation process of the "Shunfeng" application in the "Didi Chuxing" APP corresponds to the technical scheme of patent protection in the case, which constitutes a patent infringement.
However, during the court's ruling, Xiaolan Technology believes that Guangdong Pacific is not a qualified defendant, and it only provides a free download of the APP "drip trip" on the Internet, and does not implement the patent method involved in the case, there is no direct or indirect infringement, and should not be listed as the defendant in this case.
Second, the violation of this case is not in Guangdong.
According to the law, the place of infringement of the patent in question shall be the place where the patent method involved is carried out in full, so it has raised an objection to the jurisdiction of the court and requires that the case be transferred to the court of the defendant's domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for hearing.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the accused of infringing Didi Chuxing APP products on its online platform, and the plaintiff did not make it inappropriate to list the defendant Guangdong Pacific as the defendant.
And the defendant's Guangdong Pacific residence is located in Guangzhou, which is within the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
Defendant Xiao Orange Technology claims to transfer the case to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial, on the basis of the lack of time, dismiss the defendant Xiaotang Technology Co., Ltd.'s objections to the jurisdiction of the case, and bear the cost of the acceptance of the jurisdictional objection case.
At present, other trials of the case have not been announced, and the reporter will also pay close attention to the follow-up details of Didi Chuxing's patent infringement case.
Interview with Chief Executive Officer of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Australia: Significant achievements in Australia-China Science and Technology Cooperation
"China's science and technology have developed rapidly in the past few decades, and Australia and China have worked hand in hand in the scientific field to achieve fruitful results."
Larry Marshall, chief executive of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation of Australia, said in an interview with the China News Agency in Beijing that from the cooperation on climate change to the "Sky Eye" project, the cooperation between Australia and China in science and technology has shown vitality.
As the largest national research institution in the Australian Federation, CSIRO has achieved many innovative research results in the world in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials, astronomy and so on.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"It's a lasting friendship that encompasses a tradition of trust and long-term cooperation for partners," Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-meter-caliber spherical radio telescope, "China Sky Eye", installed the world's first 19-wave beam L band receiver.
At present, the most advanced 19-wave beam feeder receiver in the world, jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on the accumulation of technology from CSIRO for many years, and after the launch, the FAST sky survey speed will be increased by five to six times, and at the same time, it will also expand more scientific observation goals.
"This is a part of the CSIRO's contribution to FAST."
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO also has close cooperation with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of square kilometers array radio telescopes, research and development of new fuel technology, and energy conservation and emission reduction.
"In the past, scientific research often focused on the problems of the past hundred years, and now more scientific research force is needed to solve the problems in front of us."
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and both countries face a series of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather is frequent in the world, droughts and floods have led to food production cuts, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, problems such as population explosion, aging, and chronic diseases are also the serious challenges facing them.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years is mainly focused on solving these current problems."
Marshall said that the International Southern Hemisphere Marine Research Center, built by CSIRO and the National Laboratory of Marine Science and Technology of Qingdao, focuses on observing the El Niño phenomenon and the La Niña phenomenon, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather, and establishing an early warning facility for extreme weather; the new varieties of cereals developed by the CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences can also alleviate the food shortage caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, scientific and technological innovation is difficult to complete alone, the need for extremely high cost, there are very many problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today."
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it is to make a breakthrough, which is also the significance of strengthening cooperation between Australia and China under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative.
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly for us to cooperate in science and technology."
Marshall, for example, said that CSIRO has developed a purening method of gold without cyanide, which is very harmful to the environment due to the traditional cyanide gold purification method, and many countries hope to find a way to purify gold with little environmental pollution.
"We are very willing to bring this technology to China, which is one of the results of our participation in the Belt and Road cooperation."

The industrial enterprises in the northeast are more important and the foundation is good, for the northeast, grasping innovation is to grasp the development, and seeking innovation is to seek the future.
Whether it can re-energize the vitality of the old industrial base and release it has touched the hearts of the general secretary.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said Saturday that the continued imposition of sanctions has deepened North Korea's distrust of the United States, and it is impossible for North Korea to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly, Ri said North Korea had taken a "very friendly approach" over the past year, including halting missile and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and pledging to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"If we don't trust the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation, we can't give up our weapons unilaterally first."
While Rie is repeating North Korea's complaint about U.S. opposition to "phased" denuclearization, his speech is of great significance because it does not completely reject unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea did before.
Li Yong Ho mentioned a joint statement between Kim and Trump on June 12th, when Kim Jong Un agreed to the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" effort, and Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also refused to ease its demands for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and ramps up sanctions pressure to achieve its goals in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue a 'declaration of war ending'," Li Yongho said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us kneel for forgiveness is to not understand our people's daydreams."
But the problem is that such persistent sanctions are deepening our distrust. ”
Li Yong-ho did not mention the second Trump trip by the US president mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he highlighted the meeting between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in three times in the past five months and said: “If the other side of denuclearisation is South Korea, not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so deadlocked. ”
China announced that it has reduced import duties on 1585 tax items since November 1, 2018.
Since the beginning of this year, China has successively taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1st this year, the drug was comprehensively reduced, and the import tariff for a total of 28 tax purposes, including all ordinary drugs and co-alkali drugs with anti-cancer effects, and a total of 28 tax items such as Chinese medicine imported.
At the same time, it has also significantly reduced the value-added tax burden of anti-cancer drug production and import links.
On July 11th, the car and parts for the purpose of the tax were reduced.
After the tax reduction, China's automobile vehicle tax rate has been lower than the average in developing countries, in line with the actual situation of China's automobile industry.
This tax reduction will promote the structural adjustment of the industry and the optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the survival of the fittest, help to improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to promote the adjustment of automobile prices to a certain extent, so that consumers can get more benefits.
On July 1st, the tax on 1449 taxes was taxed for daily consumer goods.
The tax reduction of daily consumer goods is closely related to the people's needs for a better life.
This tax reduction is not only a large number but also strong, the average tax reduction has reached 56%.
The tax reduction of daily consumer goods directly benefits the majority of consumers and promotes the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On November 11th, the tax reduction will be implemented on November 11th for industrial products such as machinery and electrical equipment, parts and raw materials for 1585 tax purposes.
Appropriately reducing import tariffs on some of the much-needed domestic industrial products can attract more foreign investment, which is conducive to increasing domestic supply and helping industries to upgrade, while helping enterprises to allocate resources on a global scale, reducing production costs, and reducing the pressure on the domestic environment.
The relevant person in charge of the Office of the Tariff and Tax Committee of the State Council of China introduced that the above four independent tax cuts, as well as the third step of tax reduction implemented under the results of the negotiations on July 11th under the scope of the information technology agreement, will reduce the total tariff level of China from 9.8% to 7.5% in the previous year.
The overall level of adjusted tariffs is slightly higher than that of the EU, which is lower than that of most developing countries, at a medium-low level, and basically matches the status and development stage of developing countries with China.
According to the person in charge, the total level of tariffs, as one of the important indicators of China's openness in the field of trade in goods, should be adapted to the stage of China's economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China's largest trade in goods is the first in the world, and it already has the economic foundation for further opening up, but there is still a gap between the quality and efficiency of trade development compared with advanced economies, so the overall tariff level should be appropriately reduced.
Tariffs are a means of protection for compliance, and the level of tariffs should be in line with industrial competitiveness, so as to encourage healthy competition, and excessive protection is not conducive to industrial development and improve quality.
The adjustment of tariff rates should take into account production needs and consumer demand.
Focus on reducing the large domestic demand, help industrial transformation and upgrading of the commodity tax rate, and strive to increase the people's demand for more concentrated characteristics of the advantages of the import, and constantly enhance the sense of access to enterprises and the public, to meet the needs of industrial structure and consumption structure upgrade.
The tax reduction should take into account the affordability of fiscal revenue and industrial development.
In the choice of specific tax reduction and tax reduction, we should coordinate and coordinate the two aspects of domestic and foreign markets, upstream and downstream, production and consumption, and maintain the development momentum of China's economic stability.
The person in charge stressed that this year marks the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening up. China's initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure made according to China's own needs for high-quality development, which is conducive to the overall utilization of the two international and foreign resources, promote the improvement of the quality of the domestic supply system, and meet the needs of the people's consumption upgrading.
This action and measures show that China will unswervingly adhere to the strategy of opening up for mutual benefit and win-win results, firmly support economic globalization, resolutely safeguard the principle of free trade and the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the world, and make China's development better benefit the world.
Serbia announces maximum readiness for Serbia and Russia to meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
Citing the Serbian presidential office, the Nnan News Agency said that in view of the seizure of the water-reservoir of the Gazivoda hydropower plant in northern Kosovo, which is controlled by the Gazivooda hydroelectric power station in northern Kosovo, President Vucic of Serbia ordered the country's armed forces to enter the highest combat readiness.
On September 29th, Serbian Minister of Defense Vulin declared that the Serbian army had entered full combat readiness.
Vulin stressed that as long as Vucic's order is still in force, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo, and the Serbian army will respond no matter what direction the situation develops.
According to Russia's TASS news agency, Vucic said in an interview on September 29 that he has informed the current situation with the United States, Russia and Europe, and will travel to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on October 2nd to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
Asked if Serbia needed Russian military support, like Syria, Vucchid gave a negative answer: "I don't want a major military conflict on our territory."
Vucic also said that the Serbs entered a full-scale readiness only to form a deterrent to stop the conflict, but it is also a clear warning: no violence in Kosovo will never be tolerated.
The reason why the Serbian army's upgrading of combat readiness is related to the two major actions of the Kosovo side.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, Albanians have been arresting Serbs who have lived in the area for generations in the northern part of Kosovo, and these have not violated any laws.
Vucic said that since the beating and seizure of the head of the Kosovo and Metohija offices of the Serbian government, Mako Juli, by the Kosovo and Metohiya offices on March 26th, the Albanian community has escalated the situation in the region, with inhumane arrests and evictions of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the RSU Special Forces, armed police and snipers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, which have been announced, have seized positions near the Lake of Gazivooda Hydropower Plant, enter the ecological and sports centres near the levees of the northern part of the Kosovo region, and have blocked all nearby roads, which were originally controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucic pointed out that this military adventure in Kosovo was carried out by instigation by Western countries, and the actions of the Kosovo army did not inform the Serbian side in advance, in violation of Chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, and the military-technical agreement between the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and Seko.
Vucic has already shouted to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, criticizing the hypocritical rhetoric of Western nations on Kosovo.
The root cause of the conflict remains a centuries-old grievance between the two ethnic groups in the Kosovo region.
With regard to the ownership of Kosovo, there are separate claims from the Serbs and the Albanians.
Serbia regarded Kosovo as the birthplace and cultural cradle of the nation, because Serbia had established its strongest country in the 12th century, and the Albanians moved in large numbers only after the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the defeat of the Serbian army to the north.
The Albanians, for their part, insisted that the primitive tribes that lived in Kosovo in the 4th and 5th centuries BC were the ancestors of the Albanians, and therefore Kosovo has been an Albanian territory since ancient times.
The subjective political division has led to fierce clashes between different ethnicities, religions and cultures, creating fierce confrontations between Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, Kosovo Albanians first announced the independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of ethnic Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, and the proportion of Serbs rose relatively, and the Serbs seemed to the practice of "just taking back their own land", but they were regarded as "great Serbian" plundered by Albanians, and the contradictions between the two ethnic groups intensified.
Kosovo became the "powderpow keg" in the Balkans.
In 1999, an armed conflict between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro by NATO forces, which broke out in the Kosovo War.
On February 17, 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Since then, although there is news that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, it has not been possible to sign an agreement subject to multiple forces such as the United States, Europe and Russia due to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints.
Just a month ago, Vucic made clear for the first time that it was for the separation of Serbs from the Albanians in Kosovo and the disclosure of the two-communite conflict.
Electricity communication still interrupts Indonesia's strong earthquake and tsunami rescue difficulties
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early hours of the 30th, a strong earthquake and tsunami caused by the 28th occurred in the country's Central Sulawesi Province of Dongaa, which killed 420 people.
The head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, Wilem Rampangilei, said that the figure is only a preliminary count of the city of Palu, the capital of Zhongsuweisi Province, about 80 kilometers from the epicenter. Due to the lack of large search and rescue machinery, many densely populated buildings in hotels, shopping malls, warehouses and other buildings damaged by the earthquake have not yet been searched for.
On September 29, 2018 local time, Ba Lu, Indonesia, a bridge damaged by the earthquake and tsunami collapsed into a number of sections.
Due to the severe damage to electricity and communication facilities, the epicenter of the Dongraa County and the neighboring Sigi region are still still "islands" that are still in contact with each other, and the number of victims cannot be counted.
According to the media report, Indonesia's Vice President Carla said the death toll or reached thousands of people.
Power outages, communications, roadblocks, damage to airports... and rescue efforts after strong earthquakes and tsunamis are difficult.
Due to the power outage, some hospitals and rescue settlements in the city of Palu need to be powered by fuel.
Roads in and out of the city were blocked due to landslides, and large transport vehicles, including tanker trucks, were unable to enter, making the fuel supply very tight.
Indonesian Social Minister Agus said that due to road damage, the Ministry's emergency relief supplies such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothing, food, household goods bags, which were transferred from the south of Sulawes and Colen Tsolo provinces adjacent to the quake zone, had not yet arrived in the disaster area.
Disaster relief materials transferred from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster area through air force transporters.
In view of the damage to the Tower and the runway at Palu Airport in the earthquake, in order to ensure safety and security, all commercial flights have been grounded for the purpose of military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel to take off and land.
Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, who directs rescue in the earthquake zone, called for the restoration of electricity and commercial flight services at the airport as soon as possible to ensure the operation of rescue agencies such as hospitals, so that more rescue workers and volunteers and aid can be delivered to the affected areas.
On the 28th, there were several strong earthquakes in Dongaa County, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, and the 7.7-magnity earthquake that occurred at 17: 02 local time caused a tsunami, causing major disasters in the cities of Palu, Dongala and Xiji.

Why do people in Chicago love the blue sky?
Only because people living in the city in the past are suffering from smog, which is particularly eager to look forward to the blue sky, and in Beijing to fight the "blue sky defense war", after the continuous improvement of air quality, the haze has become less, the blue sky has increased, and the people are happy in their eyes, and the happiness they have gained is particularly weighty.

At 8 a.m., the vast majority of 35 air quality monitoring sites across the city were shown as "first-class" green.
The spontaneous "bluest sky" theme photo contest on social platforms is still ongoing.
Why is the sky so blue in Beijing lately?
According to the relevant person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, in August this year, the average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 micrograms / cubic meters, which set the best record for the same period in nearly five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 during September is frequent in the single digits.
One of the major factors that has appeared in the "bluest sky" is that the meteorological conditions are generally favorable in the near time. More importantly, Beijing has continuously carried out air pollution control, vigorously promoted the clean air action plan in the past five years, and the continuous release of environmental benefits has been reduced, which has laid the foundation for the continuous improvement of air quality.
Beijing officially released and implemented the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan for 2013-2017 in 2013.
According to the plan, the official continues to guide non-capital functions to ease, promote energy clean-up and pollution reduction work, and eliminate the total of 4923 coal-fired boilers.
Beijing has thus become the first large city in mainland China to achieve full-grid natural gas.
The data shows that between 2013 and 2017, the cumulative annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased by 35.6%; the number of air quality up to the standard day increased by 50 days; the number of first-level preferential days increased by 25 days; the number of heavy pollution days decreased by 35 days, and the incidence of heavy pollution decreased significantly.
In the continuous improvement of air quality at the same time, Beijing official according to the new round of PM2.5 source analysis, released in September this year "Beijing to win the blue sky defense war three-year action plan", for the current stage of governance and pollution characteristics, focus on diesel trucks, dust, volatile organic matter governance and other key prevention and control areas, optimize the adjustment of transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land structure, strengthen regional joint prevention and control, focus on strengthening urban fine management, and strive to make the "most blue sky" stationary Beijing, no longer "fre in the background of people's photo albums."
During the Golden Week of the National Day this year, the relevant departments of the Municipal Tourism Commission, Industry and Commerce, Urban Management, and Public Security will strengthen the law enforcement inspection of the "day trip" market, focus on the "six black" chaos of tourism, and once the illegal offenders are verified, they will be given severe superposition punishment in accordance with the law.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a special meeting to crack down on illegal "day trips" to deploy special actions to further crack down on illegal "day trips".
At the meeting, it was revealed that the "six black" chaos that focuses on black ticketing, black guide, black society, black car, black shop, and black network interest chain is intertwined, and the city has launched a special action to crack down on illegal "day trips" since July 28.

After rectification, the chaos of illegal "day trips" has basically been curbed, and the "day trip" market order has shown a steady and good trend.
According to reports, in recent years, the city has continuously increased its efforts to rectify illegal "day trips".
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission accepted 1612 and 897 complaints of "day trips", which decreased by 79 percent and 44% year-on-year, respectively, but the illegal "day trip" was still repeated and rebounded frequently, and formed a "six black chaos" that black ticket, black guide, black society, black car, black shop, black shop, black network and other interest chains.
Specifically, illegal tourist arrivals on the streets are "black ticket calls", illegal websites that publish false travel information are "black nets", travel agencies engaged in illegal "day trips" or no travel agency business qualifications institutions or "black society", "black club" hired unguided or illegal guides "black guide", which uses unguided or illegal passenger transport-related vehicles that use non-tour passenger transport qualifications or vehicles that provide passenger transportation services for illegal "day trips", that is, "black cars", and eventually bring tourists into the designated tourist shopping shop.

Among them, "black car" and "black shop" have become the focus of two strict fights in the special action.
According to reports, without black cars, illegal "day trips" can not be made, black cars can be easily found, remembered and investigated, but also a fixed asset with a higher value.
The relevant departments use road traffic monitoring probes to increase the supervision of key "day trips" tour buses, and use scientific and technological intelligent means such as technical defense and physical defense to find and deal with "black cars" in a timely manner.
Travel shopping "black shop" due to the small number of sitting, the location of the business, has also become the focus of hard work.
In order to strengthen the deterrence and suppression of illegal "day trips", all functional departments in special actions shall be severely superimposed in accordance with the law.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on the strict fight against the relevant legal aspects of illegal "day trips", and discussed the means and measures combining administrative punishment and criminalization.
The Municipal Tourism Commission said that in the future, more formal travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out Beijing's "day trips" and increase the supply of formal "day trips" to further squeeze the living space of illegal "day trips", and the specific plans are still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has continuously improved the e-drawn itinerary system of the tour group to ensure that each team is included in the supervision of the electronic itinerary single platform.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economy symbol, what has happened to Wuzhen over the years
As the permanent site of the World Internet Conference, how Wuzhen can undertake the summit dividend has attracted much attention.
From the beginning of the first World Internet Conference, the changes in Wuzhen have been obvious to all in the past five years.
In 2014, there were only 12 companies in the town related to the digital economy and the Internet, and by the third quarter of this year, there had been more than 500.
This is a microcosm of the development of the digital economy in Wuzhen.
The convening of the Internet Conference has allowed local enterprises to accept the inspiration of the digital economy and the wave of digitalization from zero distance, the desire for enterprise transformation and upgrading is very strong, and traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased investment and research and development in machine replacement, intelligent management and so on.
Jiang Wei, party secretary of Wuzhen Town, said that Wuzhen will build a new economic empowerment center in the future.
The development of the digital economy cannot be separated from the support of infrastructure.
This year, Wuzhen launched the 5G pilot work on the basis of achieving full coverage of 4G communication network and free WiFi.
At the same time, Tongxiang City, where Wuzhen is located, has also become a hot land for the development of the Internet industry as the first county-level city in the country to build an international Internet data-specific channel.
Since the first World Internet Conference, Tongxiang has introduced a total of 565 digital economy projects, with a total investment of 377.25 billion yuan, and the core manufacturing industry of the digital economy has achieved a total output value of 87.3 billion yuan in the first three quarters of this year, and the value added has increased by 13% year-on-year.

The results of the project show that after active treatment, the survival rate of premature babies in China for 29 weeks and above has reached 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in the survival rate of premature and premature babies without complications in the gestational age of the gestaracy.
For nearly 20 years, the Chinese government has been concerned about the treatment of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has fallen to 3.71 ‰, which is significantly lower than the national average, reaching the advanced level of developed countries.
"China NICU hospitalized premature pre-province quality improvement project" through four years of unremitting efforts, greatly improved the survival of premature babies.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature babies, focusing on reducing the survival quality of premature babies, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the neurodevelopmental prognosis, and improving the overall survival quality of the children's survival and the quality of the population, it is of great concern to the paediatrics and neonatal circles at home and abroad.
"China NICU hospitalized premature quality improvement project" through four years of unremitting efforts, the collection of tens of thousands of gestational children 33 weeks and below the country's preterm birth, so that the domestic gestational and small birth weight premature mortality rate decreased, while the incidence of serious complications of premature babies decreased significantly, greatly improved the quality of premature survival.
Through the establishment of a national neonatal quality improvement collaborative network, the introduction of collaborative quality improvement concept, the project radiates 25 collaborative hospitals across China, and establishes a set of collaboratively adapted to the domestic national conditions to improve the pre-mortgculty of premature babies, improve the level of newborn treatment of complete, systematic, and effective collaborative quality improvement methods.
Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital is jointly with the national neonatal unit, according to the experience accumulated in the project, the development of neonatal infection guidelines, to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of newborn infections in China.

After more than ten years of improvement, the survival rate of premature babies in Canada has increased by about complication, and Canada has now become one of the best countries in the world.
The EPIQ method is now applied to all of the NICUs in Canada and has been adopted in six countries.
The pediatric hospital revealed that the results showed that two years after the EPCQ intervention, prematurely infections fell by 35%, while antibiotic use decreased by 20%.
In the future, Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital will continue to promote and implement this method nationwide, with a view to comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications in premature babies and improving the quality of treatment of newborns in the country.
At present, there are differences and inescapitability of different levels of treatment in various regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important construction unit of the National Children's Medical Center, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role in radiation. This research covers a number of western provinces such as Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi, etc., in order to gradually promote the homogenization and standardization of newborn treatment nationwide.
It is understood that Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital is working with the national neonatology strength, according to the experience accumulated in the project, the development of neonatal infection diagnosis and treatment guidelines, for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of newborn infections in China to provide reference and guidance.

Xin Zhenping: Building the Heart of the "Herce Monument" as "Herknown" as it is written on the 5th Martyrs' Day.
On September 30th, on the eve of the 69th birthday of the Republic, we celebrated the 5th Martyrs' Day, and Xi Jinping and other party and state leaders came to Tiananmen Square to attend the ceremony of offering flower baskets to the people's heroes.
At this moment, please pay tribute to the heroes wherever you are.
Anniversaries, reliving, even more arousal.
Opening the heavy history, behind every martyr's name, is a living life.
They, too, have a fiery youth, sincere love, have concerned family.
However, because they believe that "the doctrine we believe in is the truth of the universe, they are willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of the suffering of the next generation."
“I ’ m going to be crying out for China for a day.
Through time and space, the heroes set up a spiritual sign to guide the way forward.
"Where, where to go" "what kind of person to be", read the hero, it is not difficult to get an answer.
Remembering the heroes, the most important thing is to build a "hero monument" in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the Revolutionary War, about 20 million martyrs have sacrificed their lives for national independence, people's liberation, and national prosperity and strength.
For various reasons, many of the martyrs did not even leave a name.
Countless heroes watered the ideals with blood, practiced their faith with their lives, remembered their English name, and passed on their spirit, which is the root and soul of the nation.
This "hero monument" does not allow any defacement and destruction.
For some time, the undercurrents such as historical nihilism and pan-entertainment have surged.
All kinds of distortions of history, demeaning practices, challenging the conscience of justice, and misdeed value judgment have aroused public anger and vigilance in the whole society.
The heroes cannot be desecrated, the hero cannot forget.
You can't let it be allowed to touch the bottom line, we must dare to light the sword and defend the dignity of the spirit of the rule of law and justice.
On May 1st this year, the Law on the Protection of Hero Martyrs was officially implemented.
Judging from the judicial practice, the verdicts in some cases are very happy, which not only effectively safeguard the glorious image of the British spirit in accordance with the law, but also release the positive energy of advocating heroes and revering the martyrs.
A nation with a pursuit cannot be without heroes, an ideal country cannot be without a pioneer.
Remembering the martyrs and calling for heroes has become a general social consensus.
At present, there are millions of memorial facilities in various countries, and more than one hundred million visits to the Martyrs' Mausoleum every year.
The heart is the most powerful cornerstone.
Let the hero, defend the hero, learn the hero, care the hero, let the spirit of the spirit into the national blood, a "hero monument" will stand tall between the world, the depths of the heart.
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU took a non-coup stand against Italy on Friday after it flouted the EU's demands and gave the market a big surprise with a massive budget deficit plan, but the EU may take a more aggressive stance if it sticks to its too-bold target.
Italy's Eurosceptic government aims to be the equivalent of 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the next three years, suggesting that there is still no debt reduction in the face of deficit reduction requirements.
The European Commission on Economic Affairs Executive (EC) Economic Affairs Commission, Moscovici, said on Friday that “we have no interest in the crisis between the Commission and Italy ” and that he responded cautiously because the EU ’ s proposals and sanctions could have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan ahead of Italy's formal submission to the EU's executive board in mid-October.
After the government announced its plans, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, and the yield on Italian bonds touched its highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged by the October deadline, the European Commission would likely veto Italy's draft budget, something the Commission has never done to any country.
EU Executive Vice President Tony Bovsky said at a meeting in Latvia's capital Riga on Friday that Italy's current fiscal plan "appears to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Pact," referring to the bloc's fiscal regulations.
But he didn ’ t say that would trigger a reaction from the EU.
Bidders may submit an application for the public tender by October 26th this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture regarded China as one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
Russia's Agricultural Supervision Agency announced in May that for the first time in this agricultural year, Russia's grain exports to China exceeded one million tons, an innovative record.
The bureau predicts that China could enter the top ten Russian grain importers.
After the first victory over the Cuban team, the Chinese women's volleyball team once again won the Turkish team with 3: 0 on the 30th, and won the two consecutive wins in the 2018 World Championships group stage.
But compared with the first battle, the Chinese women's volleyball team is more difficult.
There are 24 teams participating in the 2018 Women's Volleyball World Championships, with the Chinese women's volleyball team in Group B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
Judging from the world rankings and overall strength of the B teams, the Turkish and Italian teams are the main opponents of the Chinese team.
After the start of the game on the same day, the Chinese team entered the state quickly, and the beginning of the game took the lead, and maintained the advantage throughout the whole process, and put pressure on the opponent on the serve and blocking the Internet, and won the first innings with 25: 18 more smoothly.
The second inning of the entry of the Turkish team to the state of the ball is very fierce, the start of the 6: 2 lead, the Chinese team requested to suspend the adjustment of the formation, gradually chase the score to 7 flat, and then repeatedly blocked the net to score, play a score of 7: 0; the end of the Turkish team once chased the score to 15: 19; the Chinese team in 24: 20 to get the point, the tenacious Turkish team chased the 2 points; the Chinese team again after the suspension, with Zhu Ting's running attack, with 25: 23 to score the second game.
The third inning situation was very glued, and the score between the two sides rose alternately, and once hit the 19th level.
At the crucial moment, the Turkish team made a mistake, and after the Chinese team led by 21: 19, and with Zhu Ting's strong buckt and Zhang Changning's attack to get the match point with 24: 21; then the Turkish team chased the score to 23: 24, after the Chinese team requested a pause, Zhang Changning scored the offense, and the Chinese team locked up the win with 25: 23.
Chinese women's volleyball coach Lang Ping admitted after the game that the whole game was not easy.

Experts from the national membrane-free cotton on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities walked into the test field and listened to the representative of the academician team of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
China New Network Xinjiang Shaya September 30th (Gengdandan Wang Xiaojun) is located in Xinjiang Shaya County, the filmless cotton growth is gratifying, compared with the mulch cotton next to the mulch cotton "unbeatable", a cluster of snow-white cotton competing "open", hanging branches.
From September 27th to 28th, the national in-person inspection and discussion and exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
The reporter learned at the observation meeting that the membrane-free cotton technology system with "Chinese cotton619" and its supporting cultivation measures has initially achieved the goal of membrane-free cultivation of cotton fields, reducing the pollution of the ecological environment and raw cotton of the cotton field in Xinjiang, and making significant progress in the research and demonstration of the comprehensive technology of the membrane-free cotton.
Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, the famous cotton genetic breeder, and the chief scientist of the cotton system of the national modern agricultural industry technology system, Yu Shuxun, introduced the growth of membrane-free cotton to Zhou Guomou, party secretary of Zhejiang Agricultural and Forestry University.
"The comprehensive technology we have developed for membrane-free cotton can be fully realized to plant cotton without mulch, which can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and achieve green cotton planting."
The academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, Yu Shuxun, introduced.
Xinjiang is China's most important cotton-producing region. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the cotton cultivation area in Xinjiang was 35 million acres in 2017, accounting for 61 percent of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of mulch into China in 1982, the area of all kinds of crop film in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million acres, and the annual use of the mulch is about 30 million tons.
Among them, the coverage of cotton film covers up to 100%, and cotton field coverings account for about 60% of the use of mulch in Xinjiang.
Imethless cotton is measured, and cotton production can be produced by 320kg to 350kg.
With the continuous increase of the input of the mulch in Xinjiang, the recycling rate of residual film is low, the amount of residual film in the soil is gradually increasing, and the amount of soil structure damage caused by the residual film has seriously affected the sustainable development of agriculture.
The disresult is not only causing serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great impact on the quality of the cotton fiber.
At present, the cotton fields that exceed draped over draped in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvest.
In 2017, the area of cotton mining in Xinjiang was about 14 million acres.
Machine mining cotton harvest process income a large number of surface, cotton on the broken film, doped in the original cotton in the process of raw cotton processing is difficult to remove, in the follow-up textile processing process can not be completely removed, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On September 28th, the national forless filmless cotton site observation and discussion and exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
In order to focus on solving the pollution of cotton field membranes, simplifying cotton planting technology, and improving the efficiency of cotton fields, Yu Shuxun led his team to implement the "China Cotton619" membrane-free cotton technology cultivation for the green development of Xinjiang.
Through innovative breeding new ideas, we have cultivated a new line of land cotton "Chinese cotton619" through innovative breeding new ideas, salt-tolerant, low temperature resistance and abundant land cotton.
"The" China Cotton619 "has realized a series of supporting measures such as membrane-free planting machinery, improved the depth of seeding, drip strip shallow burial under membraneless conditions, suitable sowing density screening, and reasonable chemical regulation."
At present, Aksu, Kurle, Arar and other places have established a membrane-free cotton demonstration base, and the yield per hectare has reached 4800 kilograms.
Irco-free planting cotton, to achieve abundant production, cost-saving, environmental protection, comprehensive efficiency improvement.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist of the Third Division Agricultural Science Institute of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through the research and demonstration of membrane-free cotton cultivation technology in the past six years, the production of non-filmd cotton seeds can fully produce 320kg to 350kg, and may even be higher.
"The promotion of membrane-free cotton cultivation technology is very promising."
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, membraneless cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but at present, there is still a certain gap between the economic benefits compared to the mulch cultivation.
"The support of the purchase price of cotton will be conducive to future promotion."
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and large-scale promotion and application of membrane-free cotton, so as to make the film-free cotton industry bigger and stronger, and completely solve the problem of soil pollution caused by the mulch.

But at present, Ningxia flights to and from Hong Kong are inconvenient, and it is good to open the Hong Kong section of the high-speed rail, and Mr. Song inquired about the train schedule and found that the first bus can arrive at 7: 3 a.m., connecting the city's transportation to Golden Bauhinia Plaza, and the time is just right.
He lamented to reporters: “The high-speed rail is so convenient, fast and punctual! ”
Daily short-distance trains between Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North and Futian and West Kowloon in 701 hours greatly facilitate residents of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.
After Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, arrived in Hong Kong, was preparing to go to the Hong Kong friends of the Central Mountain Convergence.
Mr. Liu said: "The National Day Mainland and Hong Kong are on holiday, and we intend to challenge ourselves to see if we can walk 50km of Hong Kong Island Trail!"

According to the trade agreement subsidiary arrangements announced Monday, the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain U.S. President Donald Trump's ability to implement the threat of a 25% tariff on imported cars, while at the same time making passenger cars, pickups and car parts imported from Canada and Mexico essentially exempt from paying tariffs.
If Trump imposes so-called "232 Chapter" tariffs on cars for national security reasons, then Mexico and Canada will have a passenger car quota that is exempt from paying taxes for $2.20 million vehicles exported to the United States every year.
Under the subsidiary arrangements, pickup trucks produced in both countries will be fully exempted from the tariff.
If Trump imposes auto tariffs, Mexico will receive a tax quota of $1,0.8 billion a billion dollars a year, and Canada will receive a $324 billion quota.
Both quotas are much higher than the existing output levels in both countries, providing room for growth for exports between the two countries.
WASHINGTON / MEXICO CHAN (Reuters) - After days of controversy, U.S. President Donald Trump's government and Canada are making concrete efforts to resolve trade policy differences, raising hopes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is expected to maintain the form of the trilateral agreement.
Despite the lack of details, the above-mentioned apparent progress is enough to prompt the Mexican and U.S. governments to abruptly halt plans to publish the text of the two-party trade agreement, giving Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government has made new counter-proposal to the Canadian government, saying he would continue to push all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said the time to submit the texts of the U.S.-Mexico-based trade agreement to Mexico and U.S. legislation was delayed because the Canadian and U.S. governments "very seriously" tried to reach an agreement.
“In the next 48 hours, we ’ ll know if we ’ re going to have a text of a tripartite agreement or have to publish the texts of the two-party agreement, ” Guajardo said.
Guajardo said his U.S. and Canadian counterparts "specially requested" to delay the release of the text.
A spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative ’ s Office (USTR) did not comment on the text of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and the U.S.-Canada consultations.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of the Foreign Minister did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-recommencement.
According to foreign media reports, in a conservation center on the outskirts of Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, two lions play together, and it is difficult to see any anomalies, but they are unique.
The University of Pretoria declared: “This is the first young lion born in artificial insemination – the first in the world. ”
Intensive scientists are working on the reproductive system of the Mother African Lion.
Ganswint, director of the Mammal Research Institute at the University of Pretoria, said that the two young lions, born on August 25th, are quite healthy and normal.
After eighteen months of intensive trials, his team finally made the breakthrough.
Ganswint said in an interview with the media: "We collected sperm from a healthy lion."
Next, the researchers, etc., when the hormone content in the mother's body reaches the right level, artificially insemination for it.
Ganswint said, "Fortunately, the result was a success."
He said the researchers "done attempts several times, but unexpectedly, didn't cost much effort."
He said that the above-mentioned research breakthrough can be repeated, and scientists hope to use this technology to save large cats on the verge of extinction.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature notes that lions have been extinct in 26 African countries, with the total number of surviving wild lions falling by 43% over the past 20 years, with only about twenty million left.
The African Lion is listed as a vulnerable animal by this organization.
Ganswint said, "If we don't do something for this animal, they're going to be extinct."
He said that this new technology does not need to be given to the lions for breeding, but simply injects sperm into the fertilized lion's body, just as North America and Europe do with captive elephants.
South Korea's exports fell the most in more than two years in September, but analysts blamed the decline on fewer working days, saying global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China.
It is true that South Korea's average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, preliminary data released earlier showed that exports rose in double digits in the first weeks of the first few months before the long holiday.
South Korea's exports fell the most year-over-year in September since July 2016, a 5.7 percent decline larger than the estimate of a decline of 5.7 percent from 11 analysts polled by Reuters.
Initial results, released on Monday, showed exports amounted to $5.56 billion in September, down from $512 billion in August.
While the growing U.S.-China trade dispute could also hurt other export-dependent Chinese neighbors, South Korea ’ s exports to China rose 7.8 percent in September, expanding for the 23rd month in a row.
South Korean exports to the United States fell 11.8 percent as sales of petroleum products fell.
Overseas sales of South Korean memory chips and petroleum products rose 28.3% and 1.75%, respectively, although the market is worried that the so-called chip "supercycle" may have peaked.
“However, the impact of the trade conflict will be inevitable, because South Korea ’ s exports are quite large dependent on the US and Chinese markets. ”
Imports slipped 2.1 percent to $448 billion, also less than the growth of 3.3 percent in a Reuters poll estimate.
The September trade surplus was initially worth $97 billion, up from $69 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that thanks to the United States and EU countries, the global manufacturing industry will remain prosperous, which is a favorable factor for South Korean exports.
The statement pointed out that "the increase in export prices caused by the rise in oil prices will also be beneficial for exports in the second half of this year."
"However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with the intensification of market volatility after the interest rate hike in the United States, is a negative pressure on exports."
Exports per week in September increased to an average of $2.6 billion per week, to $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea fell to September 24-26 this year, so there were only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.
South Korea ’ s exports in January-September increased by 4.7% compared to the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei / Markit Purchasing Managers' Index, South Korean manufacturing activity picked up in September, but was supported by domestic orders, as orders from China and Japan slipped, which could grip a shadow over the export outlook.
North Korean media criticizes U.S. not easing sanctions on North Korea
North Korea's Labor News published an opinion piece on September 30th criticizing the United States for not easing sanctions against the DPRK while seeking dialogue with North Korea, calling it a "contradictory" approach.
The article said that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on the 14th that "the key to realizing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is to fulfill sanctions against the DPRK", stressing that the United States' position of continuing to implement the UN sanctions resolution remains unchanged.
In the Singapore-U.S. joint statement, the two sides pledged to establish a new DPRK-U.S. relationship that is compatible with the aspirations of the two peoples to peace and prosperity.
On the one hand, the United States has increased its sanctions crackdown and demanded dialogue, which is undoubtedly contradictory.
If we want to establish new DPRK-US relations, build a permanent and consolidated peace system on the Korean Peninsula, and realize the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, we should put trust in the first place and start with what can be done, and resolve it in a phased manner one by one.
The article also said that the United States should understand that the sanctions crackdown on North Korea will not work.
The article said that even the "Northern Devinsk" before the "Kashan" also made the US military admire.
The National Interest magazine quoted the US Navy as saying: "We will encounter a strong potential opponent. It's enough to just look at the North Devonsk submarine."
Fogo, the current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, also praised the North Devinsk submarine.
"This submarine is impressive. Looking at the development of the Russian Navy and how to use resources, it will know that its main efforts in research and development are first and foremost to strengthen the submarine fleet," he said.
But the National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this area.
Fogo said, "I believe that Western countries still have asymmetric advantages."
Earlier, it was reported that the Russian Navy would be able to install the "Kazan" submarine in 2019.
"Kashan", "Nin Siberia", "Kershanyarsk", "Kerhangelsk" multi-purpose submarines are "white wax tree-M" improved type, drainage capacity of 13800 tons, submersible depth of 520 meters, personnel of 64 people, underwater speed of 31 knots, will carry mines, torpedoes and "caliber" and "online" and "Onymgate" cruise missiles.

EU or Iran to reach crude oil purchase deal
The U.S. government has announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions on Iran in November, and even urged other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
U.S. allies, though, don't seem to listen to it.
According to the New York Times, on the 29th, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed in an interview that despite the threat the United States will sanction any country that does business with Iran, Tehran is nearing the EU on a deal on crude oil sales.
The core purpose of the agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism to replace the dollar transaction in a barter or local currency.
The purpose of the approach is to hope to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from obstructing financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is working on the broker, some French and British officials have also raised concerns that if the agreement is realized, it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States, which opposes the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement.
In an hour-long interview, Zarif's words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement has the ability to "strip" the traditional U.S. allies, effectively breaking the U.S. effort to cut Iranian revenues.
"This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit," Zarif believes that under the agreement reached in 2015, countries have the legal right to trade with Iran.
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said: “No sovereign state or organization can ’ t accept that any sovereign state or organization can decide who they can trade with. ”
However, she also predicted that before the U.S. government launched its next sanctions in November, it would be possible for U.S. leaders to take a range of financial measures aimed at targeting banks, businessmen and countries that do business with Tehran.
In May, the U.S. government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement on the grounds that the agreement was flawed, saying that the agreement could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The U.S. then threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other goods from doing business in the United States.
The threat led some companies to withdraw from Tehran and the Iranian currency plummeted.
Businesses such as Airbus and French oil giant Total have canceled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said the U.S. government could "take the upper hand."
Sure, according to a recent report in Turkish media, the U.S. sanctions do not appear to have much impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iran's oil minister Zang Gain revealed that no other country except South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani believe that the purpose of a series of U.S. actions is to "tempt" Iran for violating the agreement.
Zarif also felt shrugged off the U.S. string of verbal attacks, and when asked if the U.S. would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, "It is a regime change strategy, and this is the real purpose of the United States."

The reporter learned from the National Health and Health Commission that compared with a few decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in China has declined, but the incidence of overweight and obesity has increased significantly.
Experts pointed out that the main idea of maintaining a healthy weight is to "cure the disease" and vigorously promote scientific fitness and reasonable meals.
According to the "China Youth Health Education Core Information and Interpretation (2018 Edition)" released recently by the National Health and Health Commission, the key to maintaining a healthy weight is reasonable diet and scientific exercise.
Being overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are not good for health.
The health risks behind the "little fat pier" cannot be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, director of the Nutrition and Health Institute of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight obesity endangers the normal growth and development of adolescents, has adverse effects on their psychology, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and even leads to high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high blood lipids in children.
At the same time, the high-grade obesity of adolescents is likely to continue into adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes in adults.
Ding Gangqiang said that the nutrition and health status test of Chinese residents in 2010-2012 shows that the overweight rate of children and adolescents aged 6-17 years in China is 9.6%, the obesity rate is 6.4%, and the two are added to 16%.
At the same time, children and adolescents overweight and obesity show that boys are higher than girls, urban higher than rural characteristics, overweight obesity rate has increased significantly in recent decades.
How do teenagers deal with overweight obesity?
Zhang Li, deputy director of the Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of the State Sports Administration, pointed out that the main reason for the current obesity of adolescents is that the main reason for obesity in adolescents is that there is too much caloric intake and insufficient physical activity.
For this simple obesity, should focus on scientific exercise plus reasonable diet control.
Zhang Li pointed out that the main concept of maintaining a healthy weight, the most important concept is "treating the disease", which is an important part of the school, parents and students to carry out a full range of popular science education, popularize the harm of overweight and obesity, and improve the awareness of young people's prevention.
Adolescents should regularly have a physical examination, monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight, and early detection and scientific determination of whether overweight and obesity are present, so as to timely intervention.
For adolescents who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gang strongly recommends that in addition to active scientific arrangements for meals and exercise, adolescents are at a special physiological stage, and that the use of hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and lose weight should not be taken blindly.

After the implementation of the new regulations, the security plan is issued once every day at 9am and 21st, and the dam plan is issued once per day and 20 hours, so that the ship can flexibly arrange the dam plan.
The "Dispatch Procedure" adds the principle of "classification control" of ship over-the-saw and dam dispatch, which clearly defines the ship's priority of the dam according to the functional positioning of the lock and the lift, and adjusts the short-term passenger ship that passes the lock to the same priority level as the demonstration ship and the integrity ship.

The Sichuan River and the Three Gorges Reservoir District, the long-sized and new energy power ships have also been among the priority levels for the first time.

After the water storage in the Three Gorges, the navigation conditions in the reservoir area have been improved, which has promoted the rapid development of Yangtze River shipping.
The data shows that the annual cargo passage volume of the Three Gorges locks and Gezhou Dam locks has increased from 34.30 million tons in 2004 to 1.38 million tons and 1.4 billion tons in 2017, respectively.
Three Gorges lift test voyage in the past two years through the ship 5767 times, passengers 16.22 million people, cargo volume reached 171.28 million tons.
Chen Dongyuan, deputy director of the Three Gorges Navigation Administration, said that the "Settlement Procedure" has a positive effect on promoting the management of the gate in good faith, maintaining the order of navigation of the two dam hubs, easing the pressure of the ship waiting for the gate in the dam area, and improving the navigation ability.

Nagoya, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday that the central bank is aware that long-term implementation of ultra-loose monetary policy could squeeze the margins of financial institutions and potentially destabilize the country's banking system.
But he said the BOJ needed to maintain its massive stimulus package in light of sluggish inflation and the uncertainty of its overseas economies, while closely monitoring the pros and cons of its policies.
“The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected under the continued monetary easing, ” Kuroda said in a speech to Nagoya ’ s corporate leaders.
If financial institutions are more actively engaged in risks to compensate for the impact of shrinking margins caused by low interest rates over the years, there is a risk of turmoil in the banking system in the event of a severe negative impact.
“Although these risks are not great at the moment, the central bank will closely monitor the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take necessary measures, ” he said.
Minutes of the Bank of Japan's meeting, released earlier on Monday, showed that at the September meeting, the Bank of Japan's policy committee discussed the rising cost of long-term easing policy.
According to a member, the minutes said that if the economy continued to expand, “the BOJ has more room for flexibility in terms of policy in the future. ”
The minutes showed that another member said that in view of its limitations during the duration of the policy, the committee should discuss how long the BOJ could maintain stimulus.
Kuroda said that the Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks posed by easing policies, and at the same time need to consider the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic prospects, which may affect global demand due to Sino-US trade frictions and rising protectionism.
“The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is temporarily limited, ” Kuroda said.
“But how the problem continues, and the impact on the Japanese economy could be greater, ” he added.
“There is a need for sustained and robust monetary easing while considering positive and negative impacts in a balanced way, ” Kuroda said.
Despite the growing drawbacks of aggressive stimulus packages, such as long-term low interest rates eroding financial institutions' profits, sluggish inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by a global trade war dispute, Kuroda ruled out the possibility of a recent rate hike.
June 1, 2018, Cardiff, United States, corporate logo on a Tesla electric vehicle.
Under a settlement, U.S. Tesla Motors and its CEO, Musk, have agreed to each of their own fines of $20 million in fees to financial regulators. Musk will also step down as the company's chairman but still as CEO.
The settlement will put an end to Tesla's two-month turmoil.
The settlement of the securities fraud charges disclosed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday will relieve investors a sigh of relief.
Investors were concerned that a protracted legal battle would only hit the losing-lose electric car company even further.
The SEC sued Musk for fraud on Thursday, saying its August 7 tweets misled investors.
The tweet said he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 per share and having secured financing.
The SEC says the tweets are virtually unfounded and the market turmoil it has caused harm to investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the agreement could boost Tesla, which has been battered by Musk's recent actions.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common Asset Management, said the settlement should be subject to more oversight by Musk, while not taking "devastating" measures to get him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds a stock of Tesla's battery maker Panasonic.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board committee to develop controls on Musk's external communications.
“The matter is resolved promptly and in the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, in the best interests of our customers, ” SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday's allegations caused Tesla's market capitalization to evaporate by about $7 billion, and the company's market capitalization was $452 billion on Friday, down from GM's $475 billion.
The SEC retracted the request in the settlement to remove Musk from the company's head of the company.
Many investors say the penalty would be disastrous.
“I think it ’ s the best possible outcome for everyone involved, ” said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a“ neutral ” rating and said the SEC ’ s penalties were“ light-suited ” for Musk.
"His role as CEO is important for Tesla."
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement, nor did they immediately return a request for comment.
The settlement still needs court approval.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the symposium of private enterprises, injecting firm confidence into the private economy to a broader stage.
General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that "let entrepreneurs unload the burden of thought and move forward lightly" resonate strongly among the majority of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes from people, especially entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the course of the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, there are thousands of stories of entrepreneurs' entrepreneurship and innovation, and the growth of the entrepreneurial group has continued to promote the wave of China's economy.
For some time, some people in society have made some negative and suspicious remarks about the private economy.
The so-called "private economy departure theory" and "new public-private partnership theory" and other false statements have caused some entrepreneurs to have doubts and concerns.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have an impact on some export enterprises; the rapid adjustment of the demand structure brings structural adjustment and pressure to transform and upgrade; some policies are not coordinated, the policy effect is superimposed, or the working methods are simple, resulting in some good policies that have the opposite effect.
Various factors are intertwined, the private economy is in trouble, some private enterprises are facing difficulties in operation, and entrepreneurs have shown a lot of anxiety.
In this context, correcting the misunderstanding of understanding, unloading the ideological burden of entrepreneurs, so that enterprises can seek single-minded development, and the government is bent on promoting development, which is related to market confidence and development expectations, which has particularly profound practical significance.
At this symposium, the symposium once again stressed the important statement of "three no changes": "The status and role of the non-public economy in China's economic and social development has not changed.
From in-depth promotion of decentralization and the establishment of a list of powers system to creating a rule of law environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, creating a fair competition market environment, and shaping the atmosphere of the whole society to respect entrepreneurs, in recent years, the Party Central Committee's attention to entrepreneurs and institutional protection has been unprecedented.
The symposium clearly put forward policy measures to strongly support the development of private enterprises in six aspects, and launched a series of practical actions dedicated to the "lightly installed forward" of private enterprises.
These have greatly encouraged the entrepreneurial community and given more expectations from all walks of life.
The fog is open, the policy is set, the key is to implement.
It is necessary to continuously create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve difficulties in development, and help realize China's economic transformation and upgrading; let entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legal business, feel respect in social life, and stimulate innovation vitality and creative potential.
China's economy has entered the process of moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to show their ambitions, and also provides a greater space and stage for entrepreneurs to play their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with the further deepening of reform and the elimination of obstacles, the private economy will usher in better development prospects and development opportunities and move towards a broader stage.

China-Vietnam border estuary port to hold a flag-raising ceremony to celebrate National Day
"I can't think of such a majestic and spectacular flag-raising ceremony on the frontier, which is even more shocking than watching the flag-raising in the mainland."
On the morning of the 1st, Mr. Zhang, who came to the Yunnan estuary port from Sichuan to the China-Vietnam border, and more than 500 troops, resident people, and Chinese and foreign tourists watched the flag-raising ceremony of the national gate to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The estuary port is the largest port in the Yunnan section of the border between China and Vietnam. It is located in the estuary county of Red River State in Yunnan Province, and is separated by the river from the old city of Vietnam and is a national port.
With the deepening of the country's "Belt and Road" construction, as one of the most convenient channels for China to connect Southeast Asia, the flow of estuary ports inbound and outbound has grown steadily.
At 7: 30 a.m., the sun was just showing a corner, and the limited area of the estuary port gathered the local people and Chinese and foreign tourists from the estuary who came to watch the flag-raising ceremony early.
At 7: 45 a.m., the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the members of the national honor guard guard at the estuary border checkpoint were in good spirits, escorting the national flag to the flag-raising platform at a pace of improvement.
After the commander issued the flag-raising instructions, the flag bearer struggled to volatilize an arc, and the bright five-star red flag was as "ehawks spread wings" to unfold the flag, which slowly raised with the zeitgeist of the national anthem.
"The National Day flag-raising ceremony is held at each New Year's Day, Spring Festival, National Day and other significance, which not only shows the image of China, but also inspires the patriotic feelings of people of all ethnic groups in the frontier."
The honor guard of the honor guard who participated in the flag-raising ceremony said.
It is reported that the national honor guard responsible for the flag-raising ceremony of the estuary port consists of more than 40 officers and soldiers from various posts at the estuary border checkpoint, from the flag-raising team of three people to the scale of the honor guard team, which has experienced more than 60 years of history, and has carried out more than 70 times of the national foreign affairs service saluter mission since its establishment.

Individuals who have no domicile in China but have lived for more than one year or less, and their income from outside China can only pay personal income tax by units or individuals in China.
The portion paid abroad does not require personal income tax in China.

During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, all parties released some positive messages around the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in recounts North Korea's "irreversible" determination to abandon nuclear weapons and said U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un could meet by the end of this year.
The State Department then said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to push for the implementation of the U.S.-North Korea leaders' Singapore meeting commitments.
Since the beginning of this year, the DPRK and the ROK have broken the road of opening the road of dialogue, the leaders of the DPRK and the DPRK and the United States have held meetings, the general trend of de-escalation on the Korean Peninsula has continued, and the principle of dialogue and settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue has been adhered to.
First of all, the "Improbation of the Korean Peninsula issue is a security issue" has not changed, and the key is to properly and balance the legitimate security concerns of all parties, rather than blindly pressuring each other and emphasizing their own demands.
Second, in the dialogue on realizing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the relevant parties' differences on the steps and ways to realize the denuclearization of the Peninsula remain at odds, and due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the game of "who first and who is first and then" is still strong.
At the Security Council's open meeting on the Korean Peninsula issue held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices made by all parties on the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted the two points on the Korean Peninsula issue.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insists that sanctions on North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula is fully denuclearization.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, while stressing the principle of "actions to be responded to by action", noted that the weakening trend of sanctions should be the same as the pace of North Korea on the road to a gradual denuclearization.
There is no doubt that all relevant parties should continue to implement the DPRK-related resolutions in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but the pressure is not the purpose, and the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are the requirements of the Security Council resolutions.
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the positive progress of the DPRK-ROK and US-US relations, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider the timely initiation of reversible provisions, so as to encourage the DPRK and relevant parties to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back, every progress in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and in the peace process requires all parties to show sufficient political courage.
At present, in the face of the international community's expectation of promoting the political settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue, all relevant parties should, in particular, show political courage, make political decisions, implement commitments and resolve problems, continue to take the step of meeting each other, and promote the process of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in parallel with the establishment of a peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula, so as to jointly create a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.

TOKYO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Confidence in Japan's large manufacturingers in the quarter of September touched their lowest level in more than a year, according to the Bank of Japan's short-view survey quarterly report on Monday, due to rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affecting production, which has put companies at the pressure.
The survey shows little that escalating global trade frictions have hit the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-blown trade war has hit a business outlook and could threaten corporate capital spending.
Active capital spending is a bright spot in the Japanese economy.
The survey calls into question the Bank of Japan's view that a solid economic expansion will help drive inflation to its 2 percent target, despite signs that companies are gradually shifting costs to customers.
“With the global trade war raising concerns, the confidence of manufacturers has stagnated due to slowing exports and weak factory production, ” said Nan Wuzhi, chief researcher at the Institute of Agriculture and Forestry.
"Confidence is still high. And because corporate profits are improving and prices rise, I don't think confidence will continue to decline."
The short-term survey showed that the large manufacturing boom judgment index fell from positive 21 three months ago to positive 19, which was deteriorating for the third consecutive quarter.
The median estimate of the market is positive 22.
The September large non-manufacturing sentiment judgment index fell to positive22 from the June survey on positive22, the first deterioration in eight quarters.
The Reuters investigation is positive 22.
The survey shows that the index of large manufacturing and non-manufacturing boom judgments in December is expected to remain stable.
Investors did not care about the decline in the short-term corporate sentiment, and the Nikkei index .N2225 rose to a 27-year high on Monday, as the continued depreciation of the yen helped improve the export earnings prospects of Japanese companies.
Capital expenditures are robust.
Despite the decline in business confidence, the latest short-term highlights the robustness of corporate capital spending plans, driven by newer capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to cope with labor shortages caused by an aging population.
The central bank's short-sighted survey showed that large enterprises plan to raise capital spending by 11.4 percent in the current fiscal year, which ended in March 2019.
The previous short-view survey was 13.6 percent.
Nan said that all corporate capital expenditure plans to grow by 8.5% this fiscal year, close to the pace of the Japanese bubble economy era.
“Given that small businesses are raising their profit estimates from now on, there is still room for capital spending to grow further, but much depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence, ” he said.
The short-sightedness survey showed an increased ability of companies to pass on costs and the positive seven-year output price index for large enterprises, a decade-long high, a sign of encouraging and reflecting progress in Japan's efforts to combat deflation.
The index, which measures the employment situation of large enterprises, touched negative 23, the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
Benefiting from strong corporate spending, the Japanese economy rebounded in the second quarter from a contraction in the first quarter of this year.
But the escalating trade frictions in the summer and the disruption of supply chains to natural disasters have clouded Japan's export-dependent economic outlook.

Xinhua News Agency, Germany's Bremen October 1st (Reporter Ren Ke Zhang Yirong) The 69th International Astronautical Congress kicked off on October 11th at the Bremen Convention and Exhibition Center in Germany, attended by more than 6,300 astronauts, space agencies and business representatives, experts, scholars and young students from all over the world.
Jean-Ye-Lehgar, president of the International Astronautical Federation, said in his speech at the opening ceremony that the global space industry is no longer only a few countries and institutions participating, and the number of participants this year has increased significantly compared to the previous one, indicating that more and more institutions and people are joining.
He called on countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation and jointly promote the development of the space industry.
Zhang Kejian, China's vice minister of industry and information technology and director of the State Department of Space, introduced China's space program when he attended the exchange event, and said that China will expand international cooperation in the space field and contribute to the human space industry.
Representatives of relevant institutions such as China Aerospace Science and Technology Group Corporation, and some private enterprises attended the meeting, showing the latest achievements of China's spaceflight, including various launch vehicles, satellites and aerospace science and technology application products.
The International Astronautical Congress has been held annually since 1950 and is the world's largest event in the world aviation community.
The conference is held for five days and co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Center for Applied Science and Technology and Microgravity of the University of Bremen, and the International Space Law Society.
BEIJING, Nov 5 (Reuters) - China's foreign trade center said in a press release issued on Sunday that the Canton Fair showed that China's foreign trade situation is still complex and severe, and 80.6% of companies expect exports for the full year in 2018 to be better than the previous year or flat.
However, considering the continuous rise in the cost of domestic raw materials, labor and other comprehensive factors, and the external environment affecting the impact of Sino-US trade frictions, exhibitors also believe that the export situation next year is not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, Deputy Secretary-General, Press Spokesperson and Deputy Director of the China Center for Foreign Trade, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions at the Canton Fair declined slightly year-on-year.
The buyers attended the meeting of 189,812 people, from 215 countries and regions, down 1.11% year-on-year.
Exports traded 2,064.94 billion yuan (compared to $298.6 million), down 1% year-on-year.
From the market point of view, the turnover of Japan, ASEAN ten countries, the "BRICS" and the "BRICS" and the Korean Exchange increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2%, and 2.5% in traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union, respectively, and decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8%.
From the industry point of view, transportation, machinery and equipment, construction and decorative materials, consumer goods and information products, bathroom equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1%, and 7.6%, respectively, and textile and clothing and household appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7%, respectively.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer and vane of China's foreign trade, the situation of buyers attending the Canton Fair and export transactions data show that China's foreign trade development still faces many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the deepening of supply-side structural reform, as well as the recent introduction of "six stability" and other policy measures, China's foreign trade development is accelerating the accumulation of new momentum, enterprise market diversification continues to make new progress, these are important foundations and strong conditions for the development of foreign trade.
"Integrating all factors, it is expected that China's foreign trade imports and exports will maintain steady growth throughout the year, and the quality and efficiency will be further improved," Xu said.
China's General Administration of Customs announced that exports in September, which were denominated in U.S. dollars, increased 14.5% year-on-year, imports increased by 14.3% year-on-year, the trade surplus in September was $316.9 billion, and the export growth rate and trade surplus in September were the highest since February this year.
Despite the escalating trade friction between China and the United States, China's export performance in September still exceeded expectations, strong external demand, enterprises before the United States tariffs to seize the RMB exchange rate depreciation, or the main supporting factors, but the Sino-US trade war on confidence, the impact on the industrial chain should not be underestimated, analysts believe that the challenges of China's foreign trade may appear in the fourth quarter or next year.
A Reuters survey showed that U.S. fund managers in September recommended an increase in cash holdings, continuing to remain cautious as the U.S. and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs and the dispute showed no signs of easing.
But according to the 12 fund managers involved in the survey, North American asset allocation increased to its highest level since June 2017, while positions in the UK, the euro zone, particularly in emerging markets, declined.
Global equity allocation accounts for an average of 56.6 per cent and bonds at 35.5 per cent, largely in line with last month ’ s survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash ratio has risen to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
One fund manager for a large fund company said, “Some of the economic data has brought confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so it ’ s best to be prepared to enter when the market is back down. ”
But fund managers still preferred stocks in September, especially in the U.S., even if U.S. stocks were considered to be at high prices.
Today, Shanghai, an open landmark in China, the world's first import-themed large-scale national exhibition, China International Import Expo, officially kicked off in the expectation of all.
An exhibition is like a "window" that can give the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the Expo, people see the "open China" moving towards a higher level; with the "window" of the Expo, we welcome the world and China's mutual benefit and win-win situation with the "re-opening" of China.
"For a country, openness is like breaking a cocoon into a butterfly, although it will experience a moment of pain, but it will be in exchange for new life."
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of the road to opening up speaks to an important reason why "why China can."
Looking back at the 40th year of reform and opening up, China, which dares to enter the world market, has encountered a whirlpool and waves, but always faced all risks and challenges with an open attitude, continuously releases endogenous power and continuously improves its competitiveness.
It can be said that China has effectively interpreted the value and significance of opening up with its own solid achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point and holding an import-themed expo, a major decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core to promote a new round of high-level opening-up, a major decision made by China to open up its market to the world, and China's practical actions to support economic globalization and trade liberalization.
Exhibitors from all over the world, and the "one difficult thing to find" is the biggest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a wider range, wider field and deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have built a wall of trade protectionism and returned to the old path of unilateralism, which has increased the international community's concerns about the prospects for free trade and added many uncertainties to the world economy that is warming up.
In the context of such an era, the Huangpu Riverside event reflects China's defense of free trade, so the world can see China's self-confidence and China's responsibility to open up the market and share the future.
Lonely fast, the crowd is far away.
China's open mind and embrace the world, not only effectively promote its own development, but also bring surging "China opportunities" to all countries and regions in the world.
In recent years, advocating and promoting the joint construction of the “Belt and Road ”, the launch of the AIIB, the establishment of the Silk Road Fund... China has provided a series of international public goods, provided real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, and allowed enterprises from all over the world to take the “fast train ” of China ’ s development.
The Expo is also a big platform for public goods and a global economic and trade cooperation.
On top of this platform, more than 3000 companies in more than 130 countries and regions have made a new step in the Chinese market with their own high-quality products and services.
In addition to companies in various countries, there are domestic consumers who really benefit.
By building this "preferred and preferred" platform, it provides a multi-channel high-quality supply for consumption upgrading, and meets the personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs of the people.
As China's door of opening up, the goods are flowing smoothly, and the best of things will be used, and the pace of a better life will be more solid.
From a more macro perspective, the significance of the Expo has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade, but focuses on the future, conveys the concept of openness, inclusiveness, inclusiveness, balance and win-win results, and forms a consensus to jointly address today's challenges.
The world is good, China can be good; China is good, the world is better.
We expect that the Expo will bring the world wonderful and complete; we will look forward to a glorious future for a higher-level "open China" and the world to work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind.
Foreign media: The United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement includes Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States, and the U.S. will not impose tariffs on Canadian-made cars for the time being.
According to foreign media reports, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of September 30th that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
According to the statement, the agreement includes Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States, and the United States will not impose tariffs on Canadian-made cars for the time being.
On the 27th of last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary agreement in principle on updating the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement before the August 31 deadline set by the United States to extend the negotiation period until September 30th.
Earlier, a spokesman for Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Canada would only sign favorable agreements, "with a focus on substance, not timetable. We will continue to negotiate and hope to reach an agreement that is in line with Canada's national interests."
More than nine out of ten Brazilian women voters said the presidential candidates did not take into account the needs of women.
According to a recent data released by the National Geographic Institute of Brazil (IBGE), more than 90% of Brazilian women do not think that presidential candidates consider the needs of women.
At present, the number of women in Brazil has reached 1.07 billion, and if the whole of Brazil's women is gathered to form a country, the country's population will rank 13th in the world, more than two times the number of people in Spain.
In Brazil, the number of female voters makes up 52 percent of the total electorate and 48% for men, and while women are very high among voters, the proportion of women in Brazil's Congress is only 10%.
In 193 countries around the world, Brazil's women's participation in politics is only 154th, higher than in Arab countries.
After more than two decades of struggle over the rights struggle, Brazilian women still have not succeeded in gaining the rights they deserve.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori points out that the phenomenon is due to the result of the combination of ancient patriarchal societies, racism and the role of capitalist values.
"Politics should be the people who claim the rights of citizens, their identities, the acquisition of public goods and the same society, and the same society. But Brazil's politics belongs to a monopoly of a certain group, and the majority of the population is not represented."
A previous study by the Locomotiva Institute of Brazil also pointed out that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that the elected politicians can represent their rights, 90% of Brazilian women do not agree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93% do not agree with the current government's governance policies.
"We need to reverse the problem of underrepresentation of women in parliament, and Brazil's political system is still affected by inequality. So far, there is still a serious gender, class and racial discrimination in Brazil's political sphere," Natalia Mori said.
Despite women's underrepresented rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76% of women believe they can make a difference in the democratic elections, and 72 per cent of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55 percent of women believe that democracy is the best way to expose women to less prejudice.

Despite the ongoing global financial market shock, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the foreign exchange fund's investment income in the third quarter of this year was significantly reduced by 97% per year but better than the previous quarter, as overseas stocks rose under the Sino-US trade war and foreign exchange losses were significantly narrowed.
According to the latest data from the HKMA, the foreign exchange fund recorded investment income of HK $116 billion in investment income in July-September 2018, which was significantly lower than HK $618 million in the same period last year, but it was better for the revised HK $1.1 billion in the second quarter of this year.
At the beginning of the Sino-US trade war, the Hong Kong and emerging market equities index ran counter to the US stock index, and until the end of September and early October, after the U.S. stock market index peaked, market sentiment began to reverse, because investors gradually realized that the trade war was also detrimental to the United States itself.
"Changes in market sentiment are a good thing, if the trade war only has a unilateral impact, it will not help solve the matter."
But he also pointed out that “if the Sino-US trade war fails to resolve, financial market volatility will continue to rise. ”
In the third quarter of this year, the foreign exchange fund's stock investment loss in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK $47 billion in the previous quarter, while the overseas stock investment income increased by 172% to HK $1.28 billion; foreign exchange loss of HK $162 billion, bond income of HK $97 billion, decreased by 24% and 31%, respectively, according to the quarterly decline, mainly reflecting the general rise of the US dollar against major currencies in the quarter and the United States's yield rate in September.
The foreign exchange fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Hong Kong has implemented a linkage exchange rate regime linked to the US dollar since 1983.
Regarding the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that the uncertainty of the economy and asset markets have increased, and the downside risks have increased, but Hong Kong's financial system is also stable, and it is also a good defense, and the earthquake resistance is sufficient.
"Hong Kong's international investment position is abundant, with a net worth of $1.4 trillion equivalent to four times GDP, higher than Singapore's 2.5 times and 0.6 times and Japan's 0.6 times, to cope with the economic downturn or reversal enough."
Recently, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate continued to fall and expand the spread of the US dollar, Chen Delin pointed out that the Hong Kong dollar exchange price has risen more than 400 basis points on September 21st, the market generally believes that it is mainly related to the rise of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, and then the Hong Kong dollar hovering around the level of 7.80-7.84, to the recent Hong Kong dollar interest release continued to fall, and the dollar spread, which may attract the increase in the market gu and buy the dollar's carry-on, which may once again trigger the opportunity of the weak party exchange guarantee.
But he believes that with the start of the Hong Kong bank's interest rate hike cycle, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate will be carried out in the normalization, and the situation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate below the dollar interest rate will change in the future.
"The Hong Kong dollar interest rate and the trend of the US dollar interest rate will be more in line with the trend, and we must be more careful about managing risks, preparing for market fluctuations."
Due to the abundant funds of the Hong Kong dollar, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate was further pulled back, and the three-month interest-taking fell by 0.9% to 2.0879 per cent on Monday, expanding from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the one-month interest release was at a new five-month low and the dollar interest rate spread expanded from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From mid-September, the Hong Kong dollar spot exchange was most of the close to $7.85 to $1.
During the period, due to factors such as the outflow of funds from Hong Kong dollars after the completion of the carry-on activities and large-scale prospectus activities, the weak party exchange guarantee was triggered several times in May and August after being triggered for the first time in April.
The HKMA bought Hong Kong dollars at the 7.85 level in accordance with the linked exchange rate system to sell the US dollar to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
The HKMA bought a total of HK $521 million in May and under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism in May and August.

There is no "threshold" of the month center: quality certification promotes quality improvement.
With the pull of the "two-child economy" and the prosperity of the mother and baby market, from the north to the third and fourth tier cities, various grades have sprung up various grades of monthly clubhouses.
At present, the month of the month of the meeting to meet the consumption needs of the masses, charging from tens of thousands of yuan or even hundreds of thousands of yuan, but at the same time in an awkward situation, this institution has no threshold so far, there is still a blank area of supervision.
The State Administration of Market Supervision recently launched the 2018 "Quality Month" series of activities, and the reporter came to a five-star monthly sub-center in Tianjin to visit the maternal and child care service certification experience.
General monthly centers provide services such as newborn care, nutritious meals, and postpartum repair and shaping.
In this month's center, the reporter saw that the nurse checked the daily breastfeeding of the newborn, and the professional carer provided detailed care services such as bathing and touching for the newborn.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, from the early days of the month wound care, to the mid-to-late period of the mesomatic care and other services, to provide Chinese medicine treatment and beauty and other nursing projects, to help mothers to restore their posture.
A new mother who lives in told reporters that she had booked the month clubhouse eight months in advance.
The service program of the month club directly affects the comfort of the maternal month and the physical recovery situation, and some small monthly will only provide some simple monthly services, there are problems such as irregular disinfection and hygiene, easy cross-infection, and single unscientific diet.
The head of the Yuezi Center said they were the only one in all five-star moon-based centers in Tianjin to receive B-class service certification.
"Although some customers do not understand the meaning of B-level certification at first, they have forced enterprises to strictly standardize process management through certification, so that customers can benefit, which is of great significance to the long-term development of enterprises," he said.
Pan Lifen, deputy director of the certification supervision department of the State Administration of Market Supervision, said that service certification is based on a new type of certification system based on customer perception, attention to the degree of organizational quality management and service characteristics, and is an important part of the national quality infrastructure, which plays a positive role in improving the proportion of high-quality service supply and enhancing the international competitiveness of China's services.
China started from 2004, after more than 10 years of development, service certification project has gone through from scratch, the process of gradual development, such as financial services certification, maternal and child care service certification, commodity after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification, health service certification and a number of services with a certain influence.
According to the statistics of the State Administration of Market Supervision, there are more than 130 service certification bodies in China, more than two thousand service certification personnel, and nearly eight thousand valid certification certificates.
Pan Lifen said that it is necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually expand the coverage of service certification in the fields of health, education, sports, finance, e-commerce, etc., and promote the supply-side reform and quality improvement of the service industry.
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong property prices have fallen back after peaking for two consecutive months, Hong Kong's Monetary Authority President Chen Delin said on Monday that it takes time to see if the property market has entered a downward cycle, and if confirmed, it can be considered that the tightening of counter-cyclical measures can be considered at an appropriate time.
Chen Delin also pointed out that if the real estate price is adjusted, the first time it will be affected people who will be affected at the peak of the property market, but it is expected that the price of the property will fall at the time of the Asian financial storm in 1997, and the opportunity for the public to sell the property is much lower.
Chen Delin led a number of senior executives of the HKMA to the Legislative Council briefing, saying that if it is confirmed that the property market has entered a downward cycle, measures can be relaxed in due course.
"But at present, only a few weeks of data, the relaxation is still too early, there is still more time to see whether the property market has entered a downward cycle."
Since 2009, the HKMA has introduced eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to significantly tighten mortgages for various types of properties, including reducing the number of mortgages and the need for mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests to enhance bank risk management and earthquake resistance.
As Hong Kong officially entered a rate hike cycle, the Hong Kong-wide private residential real estate price index peaked for two consecutive months in August-September, and the monthly decline in September expanded to 1.44%.
But the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year is still 10.2%.
According to the HKMA, the financial situation of families with earthquake resistance to financial risks is still healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the ratio of self-occupation residents with no mortgages in Hong Kong reached 66%, which is higher than the average of 60% in 2009-11; the average number of new mortgages and the income ratio of new mortgages and the income ratio of new mortgages are 47% and 34%, respectively, and have improved significantly compared to 64% and 41% respectively in 2009-11%.
But Chen Delin said that the high earthquake resistance does not mean that the already real estate citizens will not be damaged by the economic downturn, because the property valuation will fall, and the people who buy buildings at the peak will bear the brunt.
While the HKMA has tightened up bank lending to mortgage lenders, property owners can also get high-quality mortgages through mortgage insurance or by developers.
Chen Delin said that at present, together with mortgage loans provided to developers, the number of mortgages in borrowers can reach 85-90%, and if the property price falls by one percent, there will be negative assets (i.e., the market value of properties falling below the total amount of unrendered mortgages).
However, Nguyen Guoheng, vice president of the HKMA, pointed out that the total amount of mortgages estimated by the developers to provide a high number of mortgages, only accounts for 2-2.5 percent of the total bank mortgages, and the proportion is still low.
At the peak of Hong Kong's negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22 percent of the number of people in the supply.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive quarters.

Systematic lupus erythematosus is a chronic problem of tired and multi-organizing organs throughout the body, and has been considered "unsustainable disease" in the past.
Because its pathogenesis is unknown, diagnosis and treatment are difficult to find, and there is no cure for effective treatment.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the School of Life Sciences of Tsinghua University, and the director of the Center for Rheu-Wemmun Immunology at Peking University People's Hospital, Knutoro, found that there are molecular variants that increase systemic lizum erythematosus sluphosis, and this variant is involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors of the article and the Peking University People's Hospital, the Chestnut National team collected nearly 2000 large samples of systemic lupus erythematosus patients and conducted research and found that patients with immunoglobulin variants produced disease-causing cells and a wide range of species, a large number of autoantibodies, nephritis, arthritis, generalitis, vasculitis and other inflammation, the incidence and severity of inflammation increased significantly.
Through a variety of research methods such as immune cell stracity, animal testing, and sequencing, Liu Wanli's team found the immune signaling pathway activated by this immune molecular variant and promoted the pathogenic mechanism of B cells secreting a variety of autoantibodies.
The reporter learned that the two teams are strong and united, giving full play to their respective advantages, and realizing the close integration of basic research and clinical applications.
Liu Wanli's team is committed to B lymphocyte immunocommentation and immuno-reactive research, while the Chestnut Country team has long been engaged in clinical research on systemic lupus erythematosus.
"This study is one of the results of many years of cooperation between the two teams, and for the first time in the academic community has recognized that immunoglobulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lizum erytheusus, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted therapies."
This is not a short care, but it does it according to law.
The lawyer carries the court on the axe head?
The news was really exciting at first glance, and it also blew up the pot in the legal circle.
Fujian Quanzhou China Law then fined the lawyers involved 500 yuan and recommended in writing that the Quanzhou Municipal Bar Association should investigate and deal with it.
According to the Beijing News, a few days ago, the Quanzhou Municipal Law Association issued a formal notice that the behavior of the two lawyers does not involve violations of the law, and shall not be punished according to law.
Judging from the multi-party reports, Quanzhou Municipal Law Association's treatment is not to protect short or confrontation, but has been recognized by the Quanzhou Central Court.
An incident that could have caused tension within the legal community was eventually properly resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete truth reduction: the lawyer involved carries the axe with the defendant's murder weapon, the same model, but not on the edge, only in the evidence link to make supporting evidence, there is no act of intimidation or "sealing the court's safety" subjective intention.
There are four very important details to determine whether the lawyer's behavior is illegal and illegal, and there are four very important details to pay attention to: First, the local court has two previous sessions, only presented an axe photo, from the point of view of defense, showing the original axe has its necessity; second, the axe was purchased only an hour before the trial, not the lawyer did not seek the judge's consent, but objectively failed to contact the judge; the whole axe was not used too much or improperly; its four, the lawyer involved publicly recognized the error for the first time, and expressed apologies to the court.
Combined with these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer involved "take the court in court" has nothing to do, only to defend.
After clarifying the whole facts, the Quanzhou Municipal Law Association did not push the boat with water, but took a decision not to punish the pressure.
This decision can also stand the test of facts and laws.
As for the axes that will be brought to court as a control knife without court permission, it is indeed easy to cause unease and misunderstanding.
Out of safety and caution, the Quanzhou Middle Court's previous fine penalties and judicial advice were also understandable.
In order to safeguard the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from making trouble to lawyers, the Supreme Law issued the Rules for the Security Inspection of the Judicial Police of the People's Court in 2014, which establishes the principle that lawyers do not need to carry out personal safety inspections in court.
Since the release of the rule, lawyers have led by example, and there have been few incidents of security violations due to security checks.
In a very rare example of Quanzhou, as long as it is in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding, misunderstanding is not difficult to eliminate.
As a self-regulatory organization for the lawyers industry, the Bar Association undertakes the dual mission of punishing illegality and safeguarding legality.
In the past, individual legal organizations were criticized for being more focused on punishment and failing to guarantee.
The Quanzhou Law Association's decision, both in terms of process and results, is commendable, setting an example for more Correspondents to perform their duties correctly.
Which tax benefits will affect our money bags from October 1st?
Xinhua News Agency Shanghai October 1st (Reporter Sang Tong) The new personal income tax law will be implemented from November 1, 2019, in order to allow the broad masses of the people to enjoy the tax reduction dividend as soon as possible, from October 1st, the actual salary income of taxpayers will be deducted according to the starting point of 5000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate table will be applied.
With the landing of the New Deal, what are the benefits that will affect the people's money bags?
One of the benefits: the tax reduction in salary and salary is obvious
Taxpayers who obtain salary and salary after October 1st can deduct the basic deduction of 5000 yuan / month and apply the new tax rate scale, and most taxpayers have different degrees of tax cuts, especially the tax cuts for middle- and middle-income people are more obvious.
According to the tax reduction table of different income groups, after deducting the "three insurances and one gold", the monthly income of 8000 yuan, 20000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, after tax reform tax payable is 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan, 9090 yuan compared with the monthly starting point 3500 yuan, the corresponding tax reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, 18.8%.
It is worth noting that due to holiday reasons, the wages that should have been paid in accordance with the law at the end of September by law can apply the new basic deduction fees and tax scale.
To this end, the withholding client software used by the tax department has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax tax still needs to be declared during the statutory filing period.
Good two: the low tax bracket is obviously pulled up
In addition to raising the starting point, the new tax rate table will be applied from October 1st.
The seven-tier tax rate of salary and salary income is consistent with the previous, there is no change, but the tax rate level has changed significantly, 3%, 10%, 20% three-grade low tax rate range has been significantly expanded, and the tax rate range of 25% has been reduced, while the grade level of 30%, 35%, 45% of the three tranches of higher tax rates has remained unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the tax rate of production and operation income, of which the lower limit of the highest 35% tax rate has been raised from 100,000 yuan to 50 million yuan.

A three-way trade deal between the US and Canada will bring new opportunities for half a billion people.
According to foreign media reports, the Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a joint statement published on the Canadian government's website that the United States, Canada and Mexico reached a three-way trade agreement, which will be called the "USMCA" (the three-state agreement between the United States and Mexico).
Previously, Canada's CTV News TV, citing senior U.S. sources, said Canada and the United States had eliminated their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post, citing two sources with knowledge of the situation, reported that the agreement between the United States and Canada on September 30th will keep the North American Free Trade Agreement as a three-way trade agreement, and the three heads of state will sign a new agreement within two months.
"Today, Canada, the United States, and Mexico agreed on a new trade agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada] Agreement, which will provide high standards of trade agreements for our workers, farmers, and companies, and it will lead to freer markets, fairer deals, and more sustainable economic growth. The agreement will strengthen the middle class, create high-paying jobs, and bring new opportunities for about half a billion people, ” the statement said.
The current North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1994 by the United States, Mexico and Canada.
After taking office, Trump announced plans to reconsider the agreement and sign a new agreement.
The three countries began this negotiation process from 2017.
The Okinawa governor's election, which was held in advance due to the illness of former governor of the former governor, announced the results in the early hours of the 1st local time, and Yucheng Dian, who opposed the relocation plan of the U.S. military base in Japan, was successfully elected.
The election was held on September 30, and the final results showed that Yucheng received a total of 39.6632 million votes, which was the largest in the history of the Okinawa prefectural governor's election, and more than eighty thousand votes were more than the main opponent of the campaign.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a turn of 63.24%, down 0.89 percentage points from the 2019 Okinawa prefectural governor's election.
Yucheng told the media on the 1st that the results of the election show that the countyrs did not want the efforts of Governor Weng Chang Dynasty to waste, and he will continue to work with the Japanese government and the U.S. government and the United States government on the relocation plan against the U.S. military base and the closure of the Putenian base.
The U.S. military base in Putian, located in Yisho Bay, Okinawa Prefecture, has been criticized for being criticized. The Japanese and American governments have previously agreed to relocate them to the border area of the city of the city, but the people of Okinawa strongly oppose it and hope to completely relocate the base out of Okinawa.
As for the relocation plan strongly opposed by the countyrs and the request for revoking the permit for reclamation along the border, Yucheng said that he did not stand in an opposition and divisive position with the central government at first, and hoped that the two sides could fully exchange views and show the intention to resolve through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also told the media on the morning of the 11th that he would earnestly accept this result and make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden on the base.
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference on the 1st that there has been no change in the government's policy on relocating US military bases as soon as possible.
At the same time, he also expressed his intention to talk with Yucheng.
Yucheng will officially take office as governor of Okinawa Prefecture on the 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oilseeds has grown, U.S. North Dakota farmer Paul Thomas has planted more and more soybeans in his land.
The shift peaked at the peak this year, and he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres, reaching a size that had never been seen before.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to convert to staple crops in the former U.S. agricultural region in 2019: corn and wheat.
U.S. farmers have more soybean cultivation this year than corn, for the first time in 35 years.
The reason for the transfer of other food crops is that American farmers are facing difficulties in selling soybeans against the backdrop of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war against China.
China typically buy about 60 percent of U.S. soybeans, but because of the trade war, almost zero purchases of U.S. soybeans in recent months, has caused soybean prices to fall to a decade-old low.
Thomas intends to grow more wheat next year, hoping to make more money by reducing his reliance on crops that depend on China's needs.
Thomas said soybean prices "bring us a blow to our pain."
He said that without China's purchase needs, the spot price of soybeans near its farm is $7.10 per bushel, and the price necessary to cover the cost is $8.50.
U.S. farmers have set a record high in soybean cultivation this year, and the harvest is also expected to hit a record high.
Just in such an easy-to-hit moment, they've been hit by a trade war.
In response to Trump's tariffs on imported Chinese goods, China imposed import tariffs on U.S. soybeans in July.
The USDA will release its first estimate of acreage next year, which is expected to include considerations of the impact on the tariffs.
It is expected that the estimate will confirm the expectation that the soybean planting area will be reduced by private institutions.
According to a report seen by Reuters, Informatica Economics expects corn acres to increase by 4% to 9,270 million acres (37,5.5 million hectares) in 2019, and soybean acres will be reduced by 7% to 8.3 million acres.
Informa also expects a 4% increase in U.S. wheat acreage.
The area of soybeans planted before retaliatory tariffs rose to 8,960 million acres this year, up about 11,5 million acres higher than a decade ago.
The corn-growing area has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008 to 8,9.1 million acres, and wheat cultivation this year is 4,780 million acres, close to the lowest level in 100 years.
Iron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Plow Association, has a total of 3,600 acres of its own, and nearly half of him will be used to grow soybeans this year, but plans to cut back in the future.
He said it could increase corn cultivation by up to 20 percent on his farm in northern Illinois; the state is the largest soybean-growing state in the U.S.
Soybeans produce less than corn per acre, but they also require less fertilizer, which makes soybeans generally lower the cost of planting.
If farmers move to the final value of corn, it may raise costs, but it will benefit some businesses, including Andersons Inc., a fertiliser seller.
Andersons chief executive Pat Bowe told Reuters he expected the conversion of corn to be beneficial for fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the conversion of farmers to corn.
Director General of the Don Muang Airport Administration in Bangkok, Thailand, Sutilawa, held a press conference on the 29th to apologize for the incident of a Chinese citizen at the airport, saying that Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists, and the relevant departments will strengthen management, raise awareness of services and avoid similar incidents.
According to reports, on the 27th, the security guard of the Donman airport had a physical confrontation with a Chinese man who was refused entry.
Suttila said the security guard involved was a serious violation of discipline, and the airport authority had suspended it and set up a commission of inquiry to investigate the matter in accordance with the procedure, and if the matter was true, the security guard would be dismissed.
At present, the Thai Immigration Department has arranged for the man to return to China by plane.
Sutirawa expressed regret for this incident, which damaged Thailand's image, said that the Thai side attaches great importance to this matter, is willing to do its best to reduce the impact of the incident on the tourists being hit by the tourists, and will send an apology letter to the parties through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that the Donman Airport is willing to facilitate the Chinese tourists to Thailand, and the Thai Immigration Service has set up special access for Chinese tourists at the five major Thai international airports such as Suvarnapu, Donum, Chiang Mai, Phuket and Heai in Bangkok.
He said that in the next step, the Airport Authority will rectify the landing visa area, express the cost of the landing visa, and improve the quality of the staff's service and communication ability.

Xinhua International Time Review: Defend multilateralism, China knows and works together.
At a time when unilateralism is surging, international rules and multilateral order have been hit.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible major country, China, with the concept of common ground and solid and strong actions, work with the international community to jointly safeguard multilateralism and promote multilateralism.
In the face of new challenges, China has made a loud voice on the development direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in his speech at the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should be guided by win-win cooperation, based on rules and order, based on fairness and justice, and guided by effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the construction of a global development cooperation pattern with the United Nations at its core, North-South cooperation as the main channel and South-South cooperation as a complement, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind.
China's thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voices of the international community.
As the President of the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly Espinosa said, under the current circumstances, “the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and safeguard the rules-based international system more than ever. ”
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said that the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules, and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the balance of global economic and political power, the rise of some emerging market and developing country groups has played a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, providing new development impetus for multilateralism that has encountered headwinds.
Standing in this dimension, China advocates the concept of multilateralism such as building a family rather than a patchwork of small circles, insisting on consultation and building rather than winning, conforms to the trend of the times, is an inevitable choice to deal with global challenges and solve world problems, and represents the common aspiration of most countries in the world.
There are advanced ideas and more solid actions.
China's proposed "Belt and Road" initiative has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China has launched international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the 16+1 Cooperation to promote international and regional cooperation, improve and supplement the existing international system and order, bring innovative vitality to multilateral cooperation, and contribute to promoting the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.
As a defender of the international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China's actions have become increasingly powerful in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices in international hotspots, addressing climate change, participating in peacekeeping operations, vigorously reducing poverty and poverty alleviation, and helping other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As UN Secretary-General António Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the “trust deficit ” facing the world is intensifies, when the trend of populism and polarization is rising, it is the moment when the world ’ s need for multilateral cooperation is most urgent.
At such a historical juncture, the international community needs to join hands to turn consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

The fifth "Disabled Voice Month" comes to pay attention to the issue of sexual education for disabled young people - China New Network
In recent years, the topic of sex education among young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenges for the sex education of disabled people are still difficult.
Recently, a comprehensive sexual education challenge and practical strategy seminar for people with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to educate children and young people with disabilities has become an important topic of this seminar.
The "China Report on Sexually Integrated Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviors" released at the meeting shows that the proportion of children with disabilities who have been sexually harassed and sexually assaulted is higher than that of healthy children.
For children and adolescents with disabilities, it is also the concern of giving more to "sexual protection" in society.
The seminar aims to explore the promotion of comprehensive sex education for children and young people with disabilities in China in terms of family support, school education, and institutional services, and provide support to children and adolescents with disabilities and adolescents at the source, so that they can enjoy the right to love as others.
Experts believe that for a long time, the Chinese public's understanding of the disabled group has remained at a level that is not deep enough.
Due to factors such as traditional attitudes, China's comprehensive sex education for people with disabilities, especially children and adolescents with disabilities, is not sufficiently in-depth.
However, in recent years, with the support of UNESCO and public welfare, the comprehensive development of sexual and reproductive health education practices and the path of full-cycle development of people with disabilities in China have developed with a welcome development.
The report shows that children with visual impairment, hearing impairment, intellectual disability and physical disabilities and physical disabilities will have more difficulty in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships than the average person, but overall it has developed to convenience and enrichment.
"Created Sexual Education Challenges and Practice Strategies for Persons with Disabilities Seminar" was organized by the Shanghai Foundation for Public Welfare, the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the International Disability Alliance (France) Beijing Representative Office, and the United Nations Population Fund Representative Office in China. In the context of the Great Strategy for Healthy China, we will jointly explore the path of sexual and reproductive health education practice and realization of the comprehensive development of people with disabilities, and promote the international policy of education, educators, researchers, social services organizations, parents and other stakeholders in the field of inclusive education.Carry out comprehensive sex education with young people to discuss and develop a blueprint to form a support network.
BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - China's central bank on Sunday released data showing that the central bank's foreign currency-to-norm side of the local currency forward contract and futures contract short margin position as of the end of August this year was zero for 12 consecutive months, and there were still long positions in the month.
The central bank's previous data showed that as of the end of August last year, the central bank held a total of $60.44 billion in foreign currency to the far-term forward contract and futures contract short position, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the size of the short position in the SDR (Special Drawing Rights) was 42.76 billion SDRs.
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange forward short position has been zero.
The central bank first released the data at the end of March 2016; the data showed that the central bank's foreign currency for the local currency forward contract and futures contract long position at the end of February 2016 was 24.38 billion dollars, and the short position was $289 billion.
September data released at the end of October of the same year showed a net short increase of $164.01 million to $453.01 billion.
The central bank has previously said that the forward and futures short positions in foreign currencies in the local currency mainly reflect the foreign exchange forward operation carried out by the central bank to meet the demand for the hedging of the foreign currency liabilities of enterprises and commercial banks, and will continue to provide forward-term safe-haven products according to the principle of real needs, and the long-term operation of the central bank has less impact on the scale of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20th this year, on the K158 train, Qiao students who read junior year in Zhengzhou took a car to Hebi.
A master on the train bought a seatless ticket, but took up her seat: "Slap it on a movie."
Two hours by drive, the conductor advised him to be an hour still ineffective.
Eventually, a male passenger in the same carriage could not see and drag the master up.
Judging from public opinion, although most of the final results are overbearing people being condemned by the public, administrative punishment by the public security department, and even included in the blacklist of integrity, the public still feels that they are not "hating": why can't they let the overlords be punished on the spot?
Why can't it be prevented on the spot from being unethical or even illegal, but to punish them afterwards?
And for the "overlord" unreasonable behavior, how just a male passenger "difficult road" and drag it up?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police, short-distance trains generally do not; even if there is a police officer, the police are worried about the possible rogue response to the overlords without taking compulsory evacuation measures.
Repeated overbearing incidents have made people realize that it is necessary to allow the overlords to be forcibly removed or even punished on the spot to play a deterrent effect.
This requires that our train police should dare to take strong measures in a timely manner, and trains without police officers should be configured as soon as possible to ensure timely stop and crack down on illegal acts.

The two suspects are currently under review by police.
The plainclothes police told reporters that in the crowd who is suspicious, this issue is very simple for the police.
"Crush thieves to catch more will find that their eyes, theamorphous and ordinary passengers are different, in addition to staring at the pockets and backpacks of people, they also like to drill in the crowd, rather than hiding people away."
The police also told reporters that the suspect's waiting for the car is often not purposeful, like to wander at the station, find the object of handpicking and then follow the car.
"These are all experience, plainclothes dry for a long time, naturally know."

To activate rural consumption, we must purify the market by normalizing the mechanism, guide the demand for healthy consumption, and enhance the sense of gain in farmers' consumption.
The data show that the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released, and the retail sales of rural consumer goods have increased by 10.5% in the first half of this year, and the growth rate is 1.3 percentage points higher than that of towns and cities.
In a poor village in a western county visit, the whole village only a convenience store, into the store, some goods familiar, "golden dragon fish" marked "golden dragon oil", "Wang Chai" has become "Wang milk", "cottage" goods are many.
Over the years, similar phenomena have been exposed frequently, and some rural fake and inferior goods are brand-named, similar names, similar packaging, and false and real, which is invincible.
A consumer survey report released by a city in the west shows that the problem of over-counterfeiting in rural commerce is serious, and 66% of users have bought fake goods in the township offline supermarket, of which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant departments to remediate the rural market, shouting and fighting every year, why "Li ghost" is still repeatedly beaten?
Unlike urban markets, farmers' awareness of rights protection is relatively weak, coupled with many remote rural positions, blind spots where regulatory forces are not enough, so that fake and inferior goods have breeding soil.
A commodity long tube, some departments control the price, some tube production, some control market, function cross, annual fake, centralized governance of a gust of wind, fake goods dodge the limelight, and slowly come out, just after the old fake, the new fake and came out.
The lack of a long-term regulatory mechanism, the rural market is difficult to purify, the cost of illegality is low, and the interests are large, which has led some unscrupulous vendors to move up the mountain to the countryside, and some rural areas have become "disposal market".
From food and clothing to well-off, the majority of farmers are moving towards development consumption.
A few days ago, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued a number of opinions on improving the mechanism of promoting the consumption system to further stimulate the consumption potential of residents, which proposed to promote the upgrading of rural residents' consumption ladders, the purpose is to allow the majority of farmers to "can consume", "willing to consume" and "dare to consume", so that rural consumption can truly flourish.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen reform, eliminate the drawbacks of market supervision and long-term management, adapt to local conditions, improve the food safety and product quality supervision network, and continuously compress the space for rural counterfeiting and sale.
On the other hand, it is necessary to increase law enforcement, open up the supervision of "capillaries", and never allow counterfeiting and shoddy to spread in rural areas.
Strict punishment of the camperland is to protect the farmers, no matter how hidden the counterfeiters, should not become a reason for the breeding of fake and inferior goods, the relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, the grass-roots regulatory forces sink, which link the problem, it is necessary to be held accountable, so that counterfeiters have nowhere to hide.
Strict market access, strict qualification review of production operators, the market circulation, so that the product is right, to clear the road, from the source, the root of a way to find a way, so that the legal distributors can operate with peace of mind, so that farmers can buy at ease.
Activate rural consumption, to guide healthy consumption demand.
With the upgrading of consumption, many farmers not only pursue full and good food, but also pursue high-quality life such as culture and health, and can't equate the rural market with "low quality" and "cheap".
This requires promoting the extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, unblocking urban and rural two-way linkage sales channels, promoting the combination of offline industrial development platforms and online e-commerce trading platforms, supporting the expansion of new consumption models to the rural market; promoting the conditional township combines commercial and logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc.; improve the modern rural circulation network system, optimize the integration of stock facilities resources, and effectively reduce the cost of rural circulation.
Create a clear and assured market environment for rural areas, so that farmers can't worry about consumption, and rural consumption can be more and more prosperous, so as to enhance the sense of gain and happiness of farmers' consumption.

This action and measures show that China will unswervingly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-wining strategy of opening-up, while enhancing its own development momentum.

The Embassy met with the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mongolia, the General Administration of Police and the General Emergency Department for the first time to inform the relevant situation, and asked the Mongolian side to carry out search and rescue as soon as possible, and maintain close communication with the Mongolian side during the search and rescue process to ensure that the latest progress is in a timely manner.
At the same time, the Embassy assisted the family in releasing the search notice in Mongolia, and widely mobilized the active participation of overseas Chinese and Chinese enterprises in the search, provided effective clues, and provided relevant assistance to a number of blue sky rescue team members who went to Mongolia to assist in the rescue.
Under the strong promotion of the embassy, the Mongolian side sent a rescue team for the first time and promised to waive the cost of search and rescue.
The General Directorate of Police and the General Directorate of Emergency Situations have instructed the police and emergency departments of the province of Kusugur to do their utmost to search and rescue.
Due to the fact that Lake Kusugur is located on the border between northern Mongolia and Russia, it is remote, the transportation and communication are extremely inconvenient, and the current Mongolia has entered a severe winter, the temperature is as low as minus 20 degrees, the local police and the emergency department have overcome great difficulties, almost all the police force, and launched local herders, through horse riding, walking, visiting the herdsmen, etc., around the missing location of the two to carry out carpet search and rescue.
At the same time, in view of the special situation of the pastoral area, the Mongolian side has been publishing the search notice through the broadcast loop for many days.
The relevant staff of the domestic blue sky rescue team has also come to Mongolia to actively participate in the rescue with the Mongolian side.
The safety of the two missing people has always touched our hearts.
So far, the two have been missing contact for more than ten days, and the embassy has received some clues, but still has not found the two, and the search and rescue operation is still under intense progress.
The Embassy will always follow the principle of "people-oriented" and continue to pay attention to this matter, promote the Mongolian side to continue its efforts in search and rescue, and provide maximum assistance to the families of the parties concerned.
The Embassy appealed to the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia to contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia if they learned about the relevant clues.
