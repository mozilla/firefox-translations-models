Adm. William Moran, undersecretary of command for the U.S. Navy, said that even as the U.S. Navy is revitalizing its power to deal with an increasingly worrisome Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States continues to focus the Asia-Pacific region, which the Pentagon has expanded to include the Indo-Asia-Pacific.
According to the British "Jane's Defense Weekly" website reported on September 24, the United States listed China and Russia as strategic competitors in the new national defense strategy announced at the beginning of the year.
Since then, the U.S. Navy has resumed the Second Fleet in order to more directly counter Russian activities.
The moves have raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts that the U.S. Navy could move away from the “Asia-Pacific rebalancing” strategy that marked the Obama administration.
But Admiral Moran said the U.S. Navy’s focus remains on the Western Pacific.
“For us, there have been no major changes,” he said at a roundtable discussion called “Responding to the Challenges of the High Seas,” hosted by the National Bureau of Asian Studies in Washington, D.C., on January 24, 2018.
“The focus is still on rebalancing, shifting the center of gravity, or how you want to describe it,” Moran says.
He acknowledged that the United States has close ties with Europe.
“We’re going to continue to focus on growth on the West Coast and balance what we can do,” he said.
While Moran pointed to the overall policy regarding Russia falls within the purview of the U.S. defense secretary, he warned: "Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history proves that they will be very tough if we clash with them."
As part of a renewed U.S. effort to counter Russia, China and other competitors, the U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying troops into a “new mode of operations,” which would help catch adversaries off guard against where U.S. carrier battle groups or other assets will be deployed at any given time and place, Admiral Moran said.
“We in the Navy and Marine Corps support it — the concept of operational unpredictability, not to be in the same place again and again, almost like a shipwork — that’s what we do,” he said.
The first to attempt this new approach was the Harry Truman carrier strike group, whose early deployment included working visits to ports and patrolling areas that were usually only through.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is working to ensure allies know that the ships will still patrol in traditional areas and is also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment process.
The commander of the Royal Australian Navy, Lt. Gen. Michael Noonan, also spoke at the event, saying Australian troops could work seamlessly with U.S. carrier battle groups.
He said the situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to procure nine more frigates equipped with Aegis combat systems.
Since October 5, a number of airlines have raised or resumed fuel surcharges, and next Friday, the plane will have to increase the cost of travel.
Yesterday, Xiangpeng Airlines, Okay Airlines and other airlines announced that since October 5, 2018 (the ticket date), the domestic route fuel surcharge of 800 km (inclusive) per passenger will be charged a fuel surcharge of 20 yuan per passenger, and more than 800 kilometers of routes per passenger will charge a fuel surcharge of 30 yuan per passenger.
Xiangpeng Airlines, Aokai Airlines and other companies announced that since October 5, 2018, the standard for fuel surcharges on domestic routes of 800 kilometers (including) has increased from 10 yuan / person to 20 yuan / person, and the fuel surcharge on domestic routes above 800 kilometers has increased from 10 yuan / person to 30 yuan / person per passenger.
Children and military and police disabled are all 10 yuan / person; infants continue to be exempt.
According to the person in charge of Ctrip ticket, the airline has indicated in the notice that the charge for the fuel surcharge is based on the original ticket date, and when the ticket is exchanged, the fuel surcharge is not refunded.
This means that domestic airline tickets issued before October 5, if you want to change to October 5 (inclusive), do not have to pay the fuel surcharge according to the new standard.
Since June 5, 2018, Air China, China Eastern Airlines, HNA, Shanghai Airlines, Spring and Autumn Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Western Airlines, Aokai Airlines and other airlines have resumed charging the fuel surcharge on domestic routes that have been cancelled for three years, and the standard is 10 yuan / person.
This time, Xiangpeng Airlines and Okai Airlines took the lead in announcing the increase in fuel surcharges, and as of the press release, they have not yet seen the news that the four major domestic airlines have announced to follow up the adjustment.
It is also understood that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department stipulates that airlines can decide whether to charge fuel surcharges in November.
Cathay Pacific announced on September 27 that it will re-charge fuel surcharges on November 2.
Cathay Pacific’s website shows that all tickets issued or re-issued by Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon on or after November 2 will include fuel surcharges for long-haul flights to and from Hong Kong and the South West Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, Africa with a fuel surcharge of $652 and short-haul flights for $146.

Japan's Itochu Corporation on Friday recognized $1.3 billion in impairment losses on Chinese CITIC shares in its investment, a write-down of its largest corporate investment deal due to trade tensions between China and the United States.
A man walks past the headquarters of Marubeni Co., Ltd. in Tokyo, Japan, in May 2016.
Marubeni said that the trade war hit its U.S. grain division Gao Hong, which has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies and other companies have warned about the impact of Sino-US trade frictions when they announced the latest results, and now these Japanese trading houses have joined the ranks.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods, and U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to expand the tax to more than $500 billion of Chinese exports if the dispute is not resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Itochu’s chief financial officer for business, said the trade dispute could have a bigger impact on the Chinese economy next year.
Ito Corporation and Thailand’s Bumble Group invested $10 billion in CITIC in 2015 and acquired a 20% stake.
Hachimura said Ito Corporation lost 144.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) in respect of this part of the shareholding because it believed that CITIC's stock price would not recover in the near future.
Itochu Corporation maintained its profit forecast for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 at 500 billion yen.
China imposed a 25 percent import tariff on U.S. soybeans in July to counter Washington’s moves in the trade war.
"Our grain business has been hit by the U.S.-China trade friction," said Mr. Yan Hong, Chief Financial Officer of Marubeni.
He said that Gao Hong has stopped financial transactions in his own accounts since September.
Gao Hong spokesman Pat Burke said in a statement on Friday that the company's move is "restricted in accordance with internal policies and due to a lack of market opportunities."
He also said the suspension of financial transactions would not lead to a loss of jobs.
Marubeni kept its annual profit forecast of 230 billion yen unchanged, helped by pulp and paper and power generation.
Sumitomo Corporation on Thursday reported a 16 percent profit increase from April to September, stressing that "the outlook for U.S.-China trade problems have led to an uncertain future."
Mitsubishi Corporation on Friday raised its annual profit forecast to record levels, attributed to higher coking coal production and higher prices for commodities such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Corporation also announced a new business plan to increase its profit in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, from an estimated 64 billion yen this year to 900 billion yen ($7.98 billion).
Comprehensive report, the US midterm election voting has entered the countdown.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic opponents actively "taped the vote" from their core voters.
Both parties have pointed out that voter turnout will be the key to the right and right election.
According to reports, 48 hours before the popular vote in the United States, Trump was busy attending the campaign of Republican candidates, and former President Obama went to Indiana to stand on the platform of Joe Donnelly, the Democratic Senate candidate who was eager to choose, and shouted to the masses before the final appeal.
On Nov. 4, Trump went to May Hill, Georgia, to stand for Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, saying, "You have to go to the polls on Tuesday, you have to vote."
"The contrast to this election could not have been clearer."
Voter enthusiasm has risen to a rare peak, with early voting in some states far more than usual.
Successive U.S. presidents face the first mid-term elections, and his party often has fewer seats in Congress.
According to a new poll released by the Washington Post and ABC News on the 4th, although the Democratic House of Representatives election still maintains an advantage, Republicans can benefit from economic evaluation and Trump's strict focus on border security.
Polls show that registered voters prefer Democratic House candidates more than Republicans, at 50 percent to 43 percent, but that's down from a 14 percentage point lead in August.
A separate poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal also showed Democrats still lead Republicans by seven percentage points.
It is reported that Obama told the crowd on the occasion of Senator Donnoley's campaign: "When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, it will inevitably have bad results.
Democracy cannot work when people lie on their own.”
"The only way to stop these Republicans is you and your vote."
Democrats face the most difficult election in the Senate in decades, with Republicans now hold more than half of the 51 seats.
But the House is more favorable, and Democrats need to win another 23 seats to control the 435-seat House of Representatives.
Analysts at FiveThirtyEight.com, a prediction campaign site, estimated the Democratic Party's chances of winning the House of Representatives by as much as 85 percent.

It is necessary to strengthen the guidance of the work of the local CPPCC, take the direction, do demonstration, solve the problem, and improve the overall level of the work of the CPPCC.
In order to deeply study and implement Xi Jinping's socialist ideas with Chinese characteristics in the new era and the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Party, the CPPCC system began to carry out General Secretary Xi Jinping's important ideological research activities on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC in May, holding 8 regional symposiums and 7 expert and scholar symposiums, identifying 18 key topics and 6 basic theoretical topics, with a total of 793,800 CPPCC members and 239,000 government cadres at all levels participating in learning and seminars, forming more than 36,000 research papers.
BEIJING, Nov. 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) Under the current wave of "mass entrepreneurship and innovation", more and more technology companies have begun to attach importance to patent research and development and related protection work, dig deep into the potential value of patents, and occupy the market dominance.
Similarly, many technology companies have encountered a lot of infringement in terms of patent technology licensing and patent technology use.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province took the developer of "Didi Travel" APP Beijing Xiaoqing Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiaoqi Technology), operator Didi Travel Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Chuxing), and the seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately stop the act of manufacturing, selling, promising sales and using the plaintiff's patent.
On October 30, 2018, China Referee Documents Network announced the "First Instance Civil Ruling of Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoqing Technology Co., Ltd. and Beijing Xiaoqing Technology Co., Ltd.", which disclosed the details of some cases of patent infringement that Didi Chuxing APP was sued.
The three plaintiffs believe that the patentee and inventor of the patent "carpooling service system and method based on mobile terminals", and the entire operation process of the "downwind" application in the "drop travel" APP corresponds to the technical scheme of the patent protection, which constitutes patent infringement.
However, during the court ruling, Xiaoqing Technology believes that Guangdong Pacific is not a qualified defendant, it only provided free download of the APP "drop travel" on the network, did not implement the patent method involved in the case, there is no direct or indirect infringement, should not be listed as the defendant in this case.
Second, the violation in this case is not in Guangdong.
According to the law, the infringement of the patent involved should be the place where the patent method involved was fully implemented, so it objected to the jurisdiction of the court and asked to transfer the case to the defendant's residence court, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the accused of infringing Didi Travel APP products on its online platform, and it was not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list the defendant Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
And the defendant Guangdong Pacific domicile is in Guangzhou City, which belongs to the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant Xiaoqing Technology advocated the transfer of the case to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial, and rejected the defendant Xiao Tang Technology Co., Ltd.'s objection to the jurisdiction of the case, and bear the cost of the acceptance of the jurisdictional case.
At present, other cases of the case have not yet been announced, and the reporter will pay close attention to the follow-up details of the patent infringement case of Didi Chuxing.
Interview with the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization: Australia-China scientific and technological cooperation has achieved remarkable results
"China's science and technology have developed rapidly in the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve fruitful results in hand in the field of science."
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Australian Federal Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, said in an interview with China News Agency in Beijing that from the cooperation of climate change to the "eye of heaven" project, Australia and China's cooperation in the field of science and technology has shown vitality.
As the largest national scientific research institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many innovative research results in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials, astronomy and other fields.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
“It was an enduring friendship that included a tradition of trust in our partners and long-term cooperation,” Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-meter-caliber spherical radio telescope, the "China Eye", installed the world's first 19-beam L-band receiver.
At present, the most advanced 19 beam feeder receiver in the world is jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on the years of CSIRO technology accumulation, after the launch, the FAST survey speed will be increased by 5 to 6 times, at the same time, will also expand more scientific observation targets.
“This is a contribution of CSIRO to FAST.”
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO also cooperates closely with Chinese scientific research institutions in building square kilometers array radio telescopes, developing new fuel technologies, and energy conservation and emission reduction.
"In the past, scientific research has often focused on the problems of hundreds of years later, and now more scientific research forces are needed to solve the problems in front of them."
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and both countries face a series of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather is frequent around the world, droughts and floods have led to food production, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, the population explosion, aging, chronic diseases and other issues are also currently facing serious challenges.
"Australia-China cooperation in recent years is mainly focused on solving these current problems."
Marshall said that the focus of the International Southern Hemisphere Marine Research Center jointly established by CSIRO and Qingdao National Laboratory of Marine Science and Technology is to observe the El Niño phenomenon and La Niña phenomenon, study the relationship between the two and extreme weather, and establish an early warning facility for extreme weather; CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly developed a new variety of grains to overcome extreme weather can also alleviate the food shortage caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, scientific and technological innovation is difficult to complete alone, the need for extremely high costs, to solve a lot of problems, so cooperation is particularly important today."
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it is to make breakthroughs, which is also the significance of Australia and China to strengthen cooperation under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative.
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly for us in science and technology cooperation."
Marshall said, for example, CSIRO's latest development of a cyanide-free gold purification method, because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a way to purify gold with small environmental pollution.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology to China, which is one of the results of our participation in the Belt and Road cooperation."

North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening North Korea's distrust of the United States, and it was impossible for North Korea to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Lee told the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea had taken a "very friendly approach" over the past year, including halting missile and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“But we don’t see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
"If we don't trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and in this case, we can't unilaterally give up our weapons first."
While Mr. Ri is repeating North Korea’s complaints about U.S. opposition to “phased” denuclearization, his speech is significant because it has not completely rejected unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea has done before.
Ri Yong-ho referred to Kim Jong-un and Trump’s June 12 joint statement, when Kim agreed to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised to protect North Korea’s security.
North Korea has sought to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says it must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States has also refused to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearizing first', and increases sanctions pressure to achieve its goals in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue a 'Declaration to End the War'," Li said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us kneel and ask for forgiveness is that people who don’t know us are daydreaming.
But the problem is that these persistent sanctions are deepening our mistrust.”
Lee did not mention the second special summit plan the U.S. president mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months, saying, “If the other side of the denuclearization is South Korea, not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so deadlocked.”
China has reduced import tariffs on 1,585 tariff lines from November 1, 2018.
Since the beginning of this year, China has taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1 this year, the drug tariff reduction was comprehensively reduced, and the import tariffs on 28 tax items, including anti-cancer drugs, all ordinary drugs and alkaloids with anti-cancer effects and actual imports of Chinese medicine, were adjusted to zero.
At the same time, it has also greatly reduced the value-added tax burden on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs.
On July 1, taxes were reduced on 218 vehicles and parts.
After the tax reduction, China's automobile vehicle tax rate has been lower than the average of developing countries, which is in line with the actual situation of China's automobile industry.
This tax reduction will promote the adjustment of industry structure and the optimization of resource allocation, accelerate the survival of the fittest, help improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to promote the adjustment of automobile prices to a certain extent, so that consumers can get more benefits.
On July 1, taxes were reduced on consumer goods for 1,449 tax items.
The tax reduction of consumer goods is closely related to the needs of the people for a better life.
The tax reduction is not only a large number but also a large amount, the average tax reduction rate of 56%.
The reduction of taxes on consumer goods directly benefits the majority of consumers and promotes the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On November 1, tax reduction will be implemented for industrial products such as mechanical and electrical equipment, parts and raw materials for 1,585 tax items.
The appropriate reduction of import tariffs on some domestic urgently needed industrial products can attract more foreign investment, which is conducive to increasing domestic effective supply and helping industrial upgrading, while helping enterprises to allocate resources on a global scale, reduce production costs, and also help reduce the pressure carried by the domestic environment.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the above four independent tax reductions, as well as the third step of tariff reduction implemented on July 1 this year, will reduce China's total tariff level from 9.8% last year to 7.5%.
The adjusted overall tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than that of most developing countries, and at a moderately low level, which basically matches the status and development stage of China's developing country.
The person in charge introduced that the overall level of tariffs, as one of the important indicators of the openness of China's trade in goods, should be compatible with China's economic development stage and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China's trade in goods is the first in the world, and it already has the economic foundation for further opening up, but there is still a gap between the quality and efficiency of trade development and the developed economies, so the overall tariff level should be appropriately reduced.
Tariff is a means of protection for compliance, and the level of tariffs should be compatible with industrial competitiveness, encouraging healthy competition, and excessive protection is not conducive to industrial development and improving quality.
The adjustment of tariff rates should take into account the needs of production and consumption.
Focus on reducing the export rate of goods with large domestic demand and conducive to industrial transformation and upgrading, and strive to increase the import of characteristic and advantageous products with concentrated needs of the people, continuously enhance the sense of enterprise and public access, and meet the upgrading needs of industrial structure and consumption structure.
Tax reduction should take into account the affordability of fiscal revenue and industrial development.
In the selection of specific tax reduction commodities and tax reduction amplitude, it is necessary to coordinate and coordinate the two markets at home and abroad, the upstream and downstream aspects, and the two relations between production and consumption, and maintain the steady and good development momentum of China's economy.
The person in charge stressed that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, and China's initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure made according to China's own high-quality development needs, which is conducive to the overall utilization of international and foreign resources, promote the quality improvement of the domestic supply system, and meet the needs of the people's consumption upgrading.
This action and measure shows that China will unswervingly pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win results, firmly support economic globalization, firmly uphold the principle of free trade and the multilateral trading system with the WTO as the core, continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the world, and let China's development benefit the world better.
Serbia announces top readiness, president of Serbia to meet tomorrow to discuss Kosovo
According to the office of the Serbian president, in view of the Kosovo special forces occupying the passage of the gasivauda hydropower station in northern Kosovo controlled by Belgrade, Serbian President Vucic ordered the country's armed forces to enter the highest state of readiness.
On September 29, Serbian Defense Minister Vulin declared that the Serbian army had entered a state of full combat readiness.
Wulin stressed that as long as the order issued by Vucic remains in force, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo, and the Serbian army will respond no matter which direction the situation is moving in.
According to Russia's TASS news agency, on September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he has briefed the United States, Russia and Europe on the current situation, and will travel to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Putin to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
Asked if Serbia needed Russia's military support, as in Syria, Vucic replied in a negative way: "I don't want a major military conflict on our territory."
Vucic also said that the Serbian army has entered a state of full-scale combat readiness only to form a deterrent to prevent the conflict from happening, but it is also a clear warning: no violence in Kosovo will be tolerated.
The reason why the army has improved its combat readiness is related to the two major actions on the Kosovo side.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, Albanians have been mass-arresting Serbs living in the northern region of Kosovo for generations, and these arrested Serbs have not violated any law.
Vucic said that since March 26 this year, the head of the Serbian government's Kosovo and Metohija office, Makojuč, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo Albanian army, the Albanians have escalated the situation in the region, and the Serbs have been nevolently arrested and expelled.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the ROSU special forces, armed police and snipers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, which had recently been self-declared, occupied positions near the reservoir of the Gaziboda Hydropower Station, entered the ecological and sports center near the levees in the northern part of the Kosovo region, and blocked all roads in the vicinity, which were originally controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucic pointed out that this military adventure in Kosovo was carried out at the instigation of the Western countries, and the Kosovo army's move did not inform the Serbian side in advance, in violation of the Brussels Agreement, Chapter IX, paragraph 1, and also in violation of UN Security Council resolution 1244 and the military-technical agreement between Serbia.
Vucic has spoken to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, criticizing the hypocrisy of Western countries on Kosovo.
The root cause of the current conflict is the centuries-old historical annoy between the two communities in Kosovo.
With regard to the affiliation of Kosovo, Serbs and Albanians have their own statements.
Serbia saw Kosovo as the birthplace and cultural cradle of the nation, because it established its most powerful state here in the 12th century, and the Albanians moved in in large numbers only after the Ottoman invasion and the Serbian army retreated from the north.
The Albanians insist that the Illyrians, the primitive tribes that lived in Kosovo in the 4-5th century BC, are the ancestors of the Albanians, and therefore Kosovo has been the territory of the Albanians since ancient times.
The subjective political division has resulted in fierce conflicts between different ethnic groups, religions and cultures, and has created a fierce confrontation between Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, the Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, the proportion of Serbs increased relatively, in the view of the Serbs "just to take back their own land" approach, but by the Albanians as "Great Serbism" plunder, the contradiction between the two families intensified.
Kosovo became the "powder keg" of the Balkans.
In 1999, an armed conflict between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which is composed of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Kosovo War broke out.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Since then, although there have been reports that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, due to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints, the agreement, which is subject to the United States, Europe and Russia and other forces, has not been signed.
Just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he advocated the separation of Serbs from Albanians in Kosovo, and once again made the contradiction between the two communities public.
Electricity communication is still interrupted, Indonesia earthquake and tsunami rescue is difficult
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency released figures in the early morning of the 30th, a strong earthquake and tsunami caused by the Donggala County in Central Sulawesi Province of the country on the 28th have killed 420 people.
Wilem Rampangilei, head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, said that the figure is only the preliminary statistics of Palu City, the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, about 80 kilometers from the epicenter, because of the lack of large-scale search and rescue machinery, many of the city's hotels, shopping malls, warehouses and other densely populated buildings damaged by the earthquake have not yet been searched and rescued.
On September 29, 2018, local time, a bridge damaged by the earthquake and tsunami collapsed into several sections on the Bar Road, Indonesia.
Due to the severe damage to power and communication facilities, the epicenter of the earthquake in Donggala County and the neighboring Xiji area are still "islands" that cannot be contacted, and the number of victims cannot be counted.
According to media reports, Indonesian Vice President Carla said the death toll could be in the thousands.
Power outages, communications, road disruptions, airport damage... rescue efforts after the earthquake and tsunami were difficult.
Due to power outages, some hospitals and rescue settlements in Palu rely on fuel to generate electricity.
Roads in and out of the city were blocked by landslides, and large transport vehicles, including tankers, were unable to enter, making fuel supplies very tight.
Indonesian Social Minister Agous said that due to road damage, the ministry's emergency relief supplies such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothing, food and household kits from the neighboring provinces of South Sulawesi and Kolundalo provinces in the earthquake area have not yet arrived in the disaster area.
Disaster relief supplies transferred from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster area via air transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to the tower and runway of Palu airport in the earthquake, in order to ensure safety and ensure rescue, all commercial flights have been grounded, and military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel have taken off and landed only.
Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, who directs the rescue in the earthquake area, called for the resumption of power supply and commercial flight services at the airport as soon as possible to ensure the operation of rescue agencies such as hospitals, so that more rescue workers and volunteers and aid materials can reach the disaster area.

In 2014, there were only 12 companies related to the digital economy and the Internet in the town, and by the third quarter of this year, there were more than 500.
This is a microcosm of the development of the digital economy in Wuzhen.
The convening of the Internet Conference allows local enterprises to accept the enlightenment of the digital economy and the digital wave at zero distance, and the desire for enterprise transformation and upgrading is very strong, and traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased their investment and research and development in machine substitution and intelligent management.

At the same time, Tongxiang City, where Wuzhen is located, as the first county-level city in the country to build a special channel for international Internet data, has also become a hot land for the development of the Internet industry.
Since the first World Internet Conference, Tongxiang has introduced a total of 565 digital economy projects, with a total planned investment of 37.725 billion yuan, and the core manufacturing industry of the digital economy has achieved a total output value of 8.73 billion yuan in the first three quarters of this year, with an increase of 13% in added value year-on-year.

Indonesia earthquake sparks tsunami, killing at least 410 people
According to the evening of the 29th, the director of the Jakarta police public information bureau said that the earthquake in Central Sulawesi Province has killed 410 people, of which 97 have been identified.
Another 29 people are missing and 540 are injured.
Palu airport is currently closed.
Actively treated, the survival rate of premature babies aged 29 weeks and above in China reached 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries.
SHANGHAI, Sept. 30 (Xinxin.com) -- The National Children's Medical Center and Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital disclosed on the 30th that it introduced Canada's advanced methods in leading the "China NICU Hospital Premature Prognosis Quality Improvement Project".
The results of the project show that after active treatment, the survival rate of premature babies aged 29 weeks and above in China has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in the survival rate of premature and premature infants of very small gestational age.
For nearly 20 years, the Chinese government has been concerned about the treatment of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in the Shanghai region has dropped to 3.71 ‰, which is significantly lower than the national average and has reached the advanced level of developed countries.
The "China NICU Hospital Premature Prognosis Quality Improvement Project" has greatly improved the quality of life of premature babies through four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature babies, paying attention to reducing the quality of premature babies, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the prognosis of neurodevelopment, and improving the overall outcome of children, is of great significance to improving the overall survival quality and population quality of premature babies, which is an important issue of concern to the pediatric and neonatal circles at home and abroad.
"China NICU hospital preterm prognosis quality improvement project" through 4 years of unremitting efforts, including tens of thousands of cases of gestational age 33 weeks and below premature infants, so that the domestic small gestation age and small birth weight premature birth rate fell by 1/3, while the incidence of serious complications of premature infants decreased significantly, greatly improving the quality of life of premature babies.
The project has established a national newborn quality improvement collaboration network, introduced a collaborative quality improvement concept, radiated 25 collaborative hospitals across China, and established a complete, systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement method suitable for domestic and national conditions to improve the prognosis of premature infants and improve the level of newborn treatment.
Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital is working with the national neonatal department to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections according to the accumulated experience of the project, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of newborn infections in China.
It is understood that in the "China Premature Prognosis Quality Improvement Project", Pediatric Hospital introduced the EPIQ method to 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces across the country, and is committed to solving the problem of premature baby infection that plagues the neonatal care unit in China.
After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, the non-complication survival rate of premature babies in Canada has increased by about 1/3, and Canada has now become one of the best countries in the world for premature babies.
EPIQ has been applied to all NICUs in Canada and has been adopted in six countries.
According to the paediatric hospital, the results showed that after two years of EPIQ intervention, premature infections fell by 35%, while antibiotic use fell by 20%.
In the future, Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital will continue to promote and implement this method nationwide, with the aim of comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications in premature infants and improving the quality of treatment for newborns nationwide.
At present, the difference in the level of treatment in various regions of China and the unevenness of the average is an indisputable fact.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important construction unit of the National Children's Medical Center, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role in radiation, and this study covers many western provinces such as Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, in order to gradually promote the homogenization and standardization of newborn treatment nationwide.
It is understood that Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital is working with the national neonatal department strength to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections according to the accumulated experience of the project, and provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of newborn infections in China.
It is revealed that in 2019, the China Neonatal Collaboration Network, located at Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital, will jointly with 63 hospitals across the country to carry out the next stage of national quality improvement, in order to promote the homogeneous development of newborn treatment in China.
Wu Xianlei, director of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Life Planning Commission, said that Shanghai can become the central city of the Asian center, which is not only reflected in the research and the construction of the entire service system, but also the quality of service and service results should have a place in Asia, so as to truly reflect China's medical level.
Xin Zhiping: Building a "Hero Monument" in the heart - written on the fifth Martyrs' Day.
On September 30, on the eve of the 69th anniversary of the Republic, we ushered in the fifth Martyrs' Day, and Xi Jinping and other party and state leaders came to Tiananmen Square to attend the ceremony of presenting flower baskets to the people's heroes.
Wherever you are, please pay tribute to the hero.
Remembrance Day is a re-enactment, and a wake-up call.
Open the heavy history, behind the name of each martyr, is a living life.
They also have a fiery youth, a sincere love, and a family that cares about.
However, because of their conviction that "theism we believe in is the truth of the universe", they are willing to sacrifice everything for themselves in order to "exempt the suffering of the next generation."
"I have to live one day to cry out for China."
Through time and space, the heroes set up spiritual signs to guide the direction of the way forward.
"Where to come from, where to go" "What kind of person to be", to read Yingliu, it is not difficult to get the answer.
To commemorate the hero, the most important thing is to build a "hero monument" in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the Revolutionary War, about 20 million martyrs have bravely sacrificed their lives for national independence, people's liberation, and the country's prosperity and strength.
For various reasons, many of the martyrs did not even leave their names.
Countless heroes water ideals with blood, practice their faith with their lives, remember their English names, and pass on their spirit, which is to protect the roots and soul of the nation.
This "Hero Monument" does not allow any defacement or destruction.
For some time, historical nihilism, pan-entertainment and other undercurrents have surged.
All kinds of practices that distort history and demean the British, challenge the conscience of justice, and deform the value judgments, arouse the public anger and alarm of the whole society.
Heroes cannot be blasphemed, heroes cannot be forgotten.
The act of touching the bottom line cannot be left behind, and we must dare to shine the sword and defend the dignity of the hero with the rule of law and justice.
On May 1 this year, the Hero and Martyrs Protection Law was officially implemented.
From the perspective of judicial practice, the judgment of some cases is very happy, which not only effectively maintains the glorious image of Yingliu in accordance with the law, but also releases the positive energy of advocating heroes and honoring martyrs.
A nation that pursues cannot be without heroes, and an ideal country cannot be without pioneers.
Remembering the martyrs and calling for heroes has become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are millions of commemorative facilities of all kinds in the country, and more than 100 million people visit the Martyrs' Cemetery every year.
The human heart is the strongest cornerstone.
Let the heroes, defend the heroes, learn the heroes, and care for the heroes, let the spirit of the hero be integrated into the national bloodline, and the "Heroes Monument" will stand between heaven and earth and the depths of the heart.
BRUSSELS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The European Union took a standoff with Italy on Friday after Italy flouted its demands for a massive budget deficit plan, but the bloc may take a more aggressive stance if it sticks to too bold a target.
Italy's Euroskeptic government is aiming for a budget deficit of 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) for the next three years, suggesting that there is still no debt reduction in the face of deficit reduction demands.
"We have no interest in the crisis between the Commission and Italy," the European Commission's Economic Affairs Commissioner for Economic Affairs said on Friday, "and he responded cautiously as the EU's recommendations and sanctions may have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will be able to persuade Italy to adjust its budget before it is formally presented to the European Commission in mid-October.
After the government announced its plans, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, while Italian bond yields hit their highest in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged by the October deadline, the European Commission could veto Italy’s draft budget, something the commission has never done to any country.
European Commission Vice President Dombrovskis later said at a meeting in the Latvian capital Riga on Friday that Italy's current fiscal plan "seems inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Pact," referring to the EU's fiscal rules.
But he did not say how that would trigger a reaction from the EU.
Bidders can submit applications to participate in the open tender by October 26 this year.

Experts from the national filmless cotton on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities walked into the experimental field and listened to the presentation of the representative of the academician team of Yu Shuxun of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Shaya, Xinjiang, September 30 (Geng Dandan Wang Xiaojun) is located in Shaya County, Xinjiang, the filmless cotton planting test base, filmless cotton is happy, compared with the ground film cotton "not inferior", a cluster of snow-white cotton competing "open", hanging branches.
From September 27 to 28, the national filmless cotton on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
The reporter learned at the observation meeting that the filmless cotton technology system with "China Cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body has initially achieved the goal of filmless cultivation in cotton fields, reducing the pollution of the cottonfields to the ecological environment and raw cotton, and making significant progress in comprehensive research and demonstration of film-free cotton.
Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, famous cotton genetic breeder, and chief scientist of the cotton system of the national modern agricultural industry technology system, introduced the growth of filmless cotton to Zhou Guom, secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang University of Agriculture and Forestry.
"We developed a comprehensive filmless cotton technology can fully realize the use of film planting cotton, can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution, to achieve green cotton planting."
The Chinese Academy of Engineering academician Yu Shuxun introduced.
Xinjiang is China's most important cotton-producing region, according to the National Bureau of Statistics statistics, in 2017 Xinjiang cotton planting area of 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of land film into China in 1982, the filming area of various types of crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million mu, and the annual use of land film is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, cotton film coverage rate reached 100%, cotton field film accounted for about 60% of Xinjiang's land film use.
Filmless cotton for measurement and production, cotton production can be fully achieved 320 kg to 350 kg per mu.
With the increasing input of the film in Xinjiang, the recovery rate of the residual film is low, the amount of residual film in the soil is gradually increasing, and the residual film causes a series of problems such as the destruction of soil structure, which seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great impact on the quality of cotton fiber.
At present, more than one-third of cotton fields in Xinjiang have been mechanized.
In 2017, Xinjiang's cotton harvest area was about 14 million mu.
In the process of cotton harvesting, a large amount of surface and cotton film is mixed with the broken film on the cotton, and the shredder in the raw cotton is difficult to remove in the raw cotton processing process, and it cannot be completely removed in the subsequent textile processing process, which seriously affects the quality of textile products.
On September 28, the national filmless cotton scene observation and discussion and exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
In order to solve the cotton field membrane pollution, simplify cotton planting technology, improve the efficiency of cotton fields, Yu Shuxun led his team through 8 years, the implementation of "China Cotton 619" filmless cotton technology planting, for the green development of Xinjiang agriculture "add wings".
Yu Shuxun introduced, through innovative breeding new ideas, cultivate a special precocious, salt-resistant, low-temperature, abundant land cotton new line "China cotton 619".

At present, Aksu, Kurle, Aral and other places have established filmless cotton demonstration bases, with a output of 4,800 kilograms per hectare.
Filmless cotton cultivation has achieved abundant production, savings, environmental protection, and comprehensive efficiency improvement.
Zhang Donghai, a agronomist of the Third Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through nearly six years of research and demonstration of filmless cotton cultivation technology, the output of filmless cotton seed cotton can be completely achieved by 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, and may even be higher.
"Fleet-free cotton cultivation technology promotion prospects are very large."
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, filmless cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is still a certain gap between the economic benefits compared to the cultivation of the film.
"Cotton purchase price support will be conducive to future promotion."
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and large-scale promotion and application of filmless cotton, make the filmless cotton industry bigger and stronger, and completely solve the soil pollution caused by the film.

Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a speech at the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations on Friday that at present, China-US relations have once again reached a crossroads, and if the two sides can look at each other positively and inclusively, expand and deepen positive cooperation, and properly manage differences and contradictions, they can open up a better prospect.
"China-US relations are our common assets, we need to protect together."
He expressed the hope that people from all walks of life in the two countries will safeguard the healthy and stable development of China-US relations with practical actions and jointly promote the continuation of China-US relations in the right direction.
Wang Yi also stressed once again that China will surely walk a different development path than traditional major countries.
This road with Chinese characteristics determines that China will not and cannot repeat the mistakes of national power, and also determines that China will neither become the United States, challenge the United States, and will not replace the United States.
In his speech entitled "Opportunities or Challenges, Partners or Opponents", Wang Yi said that the deep-seated crux of the current problems is that some American friends believe that China will also dominate the country and even challenge and replace the leadership of the United States in the world.
“This is obviously a major strategic misjudgment.”
But this self-imagining suspicion is spreading, he said, amplifying existing contradictions, creating new doubts, and making it more difficult for China and the United States to solve specific problems and encounter more resistance.
Wang Yi pointed out that China is following a path of peaceful development.
The Chinese never had the gene to expand abroad.
It is believed that countries can live together in harmony and exchange and learn from each other.
Whether in the past, present or future, China will neither copy the foreign model nor ask other countries to copy China’s practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in New York, he said that Sino-US cooperation will win-win and confrontation will inevitably lose.
China has always been committed to developing long-term, healthy and stable China-US relations and achieving non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.
The new office of the State Council held a press conference on Tuesday to introduce and interpret the white paper "Facts on Sino-US economic and trade frictions and China's position".

According to the trade agreement announced on Monday, the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will preserve the ability of U.S. President Donald Trump to implement the threat of a 25 percent tariff on imported cars, while essentially exempting imports of passenger cars, pickups and auto parts from Canada and Mexico from tariffs.
If Trump imposes so-called “Chapter 232” tariffs on cars for national security reasons, Mexico and Canada will have a quota for exempting 2.6 million cars from paying taxes to the United States each year.
Under the subsidiary arrangement, pickup trucks produced in both countries will be fully exempted from tariffs.
If Trump imposes auto tariffs, Mexico will get an annual auto parts exemption tax quota of $108 billion, and Canada will get a $32.4 billion quota.
Both quotas are much higher than the current production levels of the two countries, providing room for growth in their exports.
WASHINGTON/MEXICO (Reuters) - After days of debate, U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and Canada are making concrete efforts to resolve trade policy differences, Mexico said on Friday, raising hopes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will remain in the form of a three-way agreement.
Although there is a lack of detail, the obvious progress is enough to prompt the Mexican and US governments to suddenly stop publishing the text of the two-party trade agreement and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government had made new counter-recommendations to the Canadian government and said he would continue to push all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said the time frame for submitting the text of the trade agreement between the two sides to Mexico and the United States was delayed because the Canadian and U.S. governments were “very serious” trying to reach an agreement.
"In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a text of the tripartite agreement or whether we have to publish the text of the two-party agreement," Guajardo said.
Guajardo said his U.S. and Canadian counterparts at the same level had "specially requested" to delay the release of the text.
A spokesman for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement and the U.S.-Canada consultations.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister and the Office of the Foreign Minister did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-recommendations.
According to foreign media reports, in a conservation center on the outskirts of Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, two young lions play together, it is difficult to see any abnormalities, but they are unique.
The University of Pretoria announced: â€œThis is the first pair in the world to be born in artificial inseminationâ€ , the first in the world.â€
Scientists in the school are working on the reproductive system of the female lion.
Gans Winter, director of the Institute of Mammal Research at the University of Pretoria, said the two cubs, born on August 25, were healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally reached this breakthrough.
“We take sperm from a healthy lion,” Gans Winter said in an interview with the media.
Next, the researchers and other lionesses have artificial insemination when the hormone content in the body is suitable.
Gans Winter said: "Fortunately, the result was successful."
He said the researchers "tried several attempts, but unexpectedly, they didn't take much effort."
He said the breakthrough could be repeated, and scientists hope to use the technology to save endangered big cats.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, lions have become extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of surviving wild lions has dropped by 43% in the past 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
African lions are classified as vulnerable animals by this group.
Gans Winter said, "If we don't do something for these animals, they're going to be extinct."
He said the new technique doesn’t have to be kept in lions, but rather to inject sperm into fertile lionesses, just as they do with captive elephants in North America and Europe.
South Korea's exports fell in September by the most in more than two years, but analysts blamed fewer working days for the decline, saying global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite rising U.S.-China trade tensions.
Indeed, South Korea’s daily exports increased last month.
In addition, preliminary data released earlier showed double-digit growth in exports in the first few weeks of September before the long holiday.
South Korea's exports fell in September from the largest year-on-year since July 2016, and the decline was larger than the 5.7 percent drop in the forecast of 11 analysts polled by Reuters.
Preliminary values released on Monday showed exports of $5.6 billion in September, down from $51.2 billion in August.
South Korea's exports to China rose 7.8 percent in September, expanding for the 23rd straight month, despite concerns that the growing U.S.-China trade dispute could hurt other Chinese neighbors, which is also hurting other Chinese neighbors.
South Korean exports to the United States fell 11.8 percent as sales of petroleum products fell.
Overseas sales of South Korean memory chips and petroleum products increased by 28.3% and 13.5%, respectively, although the market is worried that the so-called chip "super cycle" may have peaked.
“However, the impact of the trade conflict will be inevitable, as South Korea’s exports are heavily dependent on the U.S. and Chinese markets.”
Imports fell 2.1 percent to $40.4 billion, or 3.1 percent growth as forecast in a Reuters poll.
The initial trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that thanks to the United States and EU countries, the global manufacturing industry will remain prosperous, which is a favorable factor for South Korean exports.
"The increase in export prices caused by the rise in oil prices will also be beneficial to exports in the second half of this year," the statement said.
"However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with the increase in market volatility after the United States raised interest rates, are negative pressure on exports."
Exports on average on business days rose to $2.6 billion in September, compared to $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea's Mid-Autumn Festival falls from September 24-26 this year, so there are only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.
South Korea's exports in January-September increased by 4.7% compared with the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers’ Index, South Korea’s manufacturing activity picked up in September, but was supported by domestic orders as orders from China and Japan fell, which could cloud the prospect of another export.
North Korean media criticizes U.S. for not easing sanctions
North Korea's "Labor News" published a signed opinion piece on September 30, criticizing the United States for seeking dialogue with the DPRK without relaxing sanctions, calling it a "contradictory" approach.
The article said that US Secretary of State Pompeo said on the 14th that "the key to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is to fulfill the sanctions against the DPRK", stressing that the US position on continuing to implement the UN sanctions resolution remains unchanged.
In the Singapore-U.S. joint statement, the two sides pledged to establish a new DPRK-US relationship that is compatible with the aspirations of the two peoples to look forward to peace and prosperity.
While the United States has increased sanctions and pressured, it is undoubtedly contradictory to demand dialogue.
If we want to establish new DPRK-US relations, build a permanently consolidated peace system on the Korean Peninsula, and achieve the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, we should put the building of trust in the first place and solve it in stages one by one from the beginning of what can be done.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions and suppression of North Korea will not work.
The article said that even the "North Devinsk" before the "Kazan" was also praised by the US military.
National Interest magazine quoted the U.S. Navy as saying, "We're going to have a strong potential adversary. It's enough to just look at the North Devinsk submarine."
The current commander-in-chief of the US Navy in Europe, Fogo, also praised the "North Devinsk" submarine.
"This submarine is impressive. If you look at the development of the Russian Navy and how you use the resources, your main efforts in research and development are first and foremost to strengthen the submarine fleet," he said.
But National Interest still sees the U.S. maintaining an advantage over Russia in this area.
“I believe that Western countries still have asymmetric advantages,” Foggo said.
Earlier, it was reported that the Russian Navy will install the "Kazan" submarine in 2019.
"Kazan", "New Siberia", "Krasnoyarsk", "Akhangelsk" multi-purpose submarines are "Affute-M" improved type, displacement of 13,800 tons, diving depth of 520 meters, staffing of 64 people, underwater speed of 31 knots, will carry mines, torpedoes and "caliber" and "onyx" cruise missiles.

EU to reach crude oil purchase agreement with Iran
The U.S. government recently announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions on Iran in November, and even urged other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
But America’s allies don’t seem to be listening.
According to the New York Times, on the 29th, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed in an interview that despite the threat of the United States to impose sanctions on any country doing business with Iran, Tehran is approaching an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil.
The core purpose of the agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, that is, to replace the US dollar transactions in barter or local currency.
The aim of the approach is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from blocking financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is working on brokering the deal, some French and British officials are also concerned that if the agreement is realized, it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States, which opposes the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement.
In an hour-long interview, Zarif’s words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement has the ability to "strip" the traditional allies of the United States and effectively break the US's attempts to reduce Iran's revenue.
"This ensures that we sell and benefit from oil," Zarif said, under the 2015 agreement, countries have the legal right to trade with Iran.
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini recently said, "No sovereign state or organization can accept others to decide who they can trade with."
But she also predicted that before the U.S. government steps next sanctions in November, U.S. leaders may adopt a series of financial measures aimed at targeting banks, businessmen and countries that do business with Tehran.
In May, the U.S. government unilaterally withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that the agreement was flawed, saying it could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The U.S. then threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other goods from doing business in the United States.
The threat caused some companies to leave Tehran and Iran’s currency plummet.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Total have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iran.
British and French officials have said the U.S. government could "have the upper hand."
Of course, according to a recent report by the Turkish media, the US sanctions do not seem to have a great impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iran's oil minister recently revealed that no other country except South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani believe that the purpose of a series of US actions is to "tempt" Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also dismissive of a series of verbal attacks by the U.S. side, and when asked whether the United States would topple the current Iranian government with increasing fiscal pressure, Zarif even laughed, "It is a regime change strategy, which is the real purpose of the United States."

Adolescents should undergo regular physical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight, and detect and scientifically determine whether overweight and obesity occur in a timely manner.
For adolescents who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gangqiang recommends that in addition to actively and scientifically arranging meals and exercise, adolescents are in a special physiological stage, and should avoid using hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and reduce weight, and must not blindly take weight loss drugs.
Facebook (FB.O) said on Friday that hackers had stolen digital login codes that gave them access to nearly 50 million user accounts, the largest ever security breach.
Facebook, which has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, said it had not yet determined whether the attackers had misused any accounts or stolen personal information.
The company also did not find the location of the hackers, nor is it certain whether the hackers targeted specific victims.
Its initial analysis revealed that it was a large-scale attack.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg called the incident "really serious" in a media conference call.

In September, China's comprehensive PMI increased the manufacturing PMI month-on-month decline.
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China on the 30th, in September, China's comprehensive PMI output index was 54.1%, higher than the previous month and the annual average of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that the production and business activities of Chinese enterprises remained generally stable.
In the same month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which constitute the composite PMI output index, were 53.0% and 54.9%, respectively, down one month-on-month.
Among them, China's manufacturing PMI was 50.8%, down 0.5 percentage points from the previous month.
Zhao Qinghe said that this month's manufacturing PMI has five main characteristics:
First, the manufacturing industry fundamentals are generally stable.
Among the 21 industries surveyed, the PMI of 14 industries is in the expansion range, of which the manufacturing PMI of medicine, special equipment, electrical machinery and equipment is at a high operating level of more than 53.5%, and the growth rate is faster.
Second, there is a small fluctuation between supply and demand.
The production index and the new orders index were 53.0% and 52.0 percent, respectively, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, and supply and demand continued to maintain a state of prosperity, but the expansion slowed slightly.
The new export orders index and the import index were 48.0% and 48.5%, respectively, lower than 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points in the previous month, and the prosperity fell to the lowest level in the year.
Fourth, the cost of raw material procurement has increased.

Fifth, the operation of large enterprises is stable, and the operating conditions of small enterprises continue to improve.
Large enterprises PMI was 52.1%, the same as last month, the index has been in the expansion range of 52.0% and above this year, and this month's production index and new orders index have increased month-on-month, is the main driving force for the manufacturing industry to maintain expansion; medium-sized enterprises PMI was 48.7%, lower than the previous month's 1.7 percentage points, in the contraction range; small business PMI was 50.4%, up from 0.4 percentage points in the previous month, rising for two consecutive months.
In the same month, China's non-manufacturing business activity index was 54.9%, up 0.7 percentage points from the previous month, rising for two consecutive months.
Zhao Qinghe believes that the non-manufacturing industry as a whole continues to maintain a steady and good development momentum.
The business activity index of road transportation, securities, real estate and other industries continued to be below the critical point, and the total volume of business decreased.
Nagoya, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Harada said on Monday the central bank was aware that a long-term implementation of ultra-loose monetary policy could squeeze the profit margins of financial institutions and destabilize the country’s banking system.
But he said the BOJ needed to maintain its massive stimulus package, given the low inflation and uncertainty in its economies abroad, while keeping a close eye on the pros and cons of its policies.
"The Bank of Japan fully recognizes that the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected under continued monetary easing," Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions are more active in undertaking risks to compensate for the impact of narrowing profit margins caused by low interest rates for many years, the banking system may be turbulent in the event of a serious negative impact.
"Although these risks are not large at present, the central bank will pay close attention to the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures," he said.
Minutes of the Bank of Japan meeting, released earlier on Monday, showed that at its September meeting, the Bank of Japan’s policy committee discussed the rising cost of long-term easing.
According to the minutes, one member said that if the economy continues to expand, "the Bank of Japan will have more flexibility in policy in the future."
Another member said the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan could maintain stimulus, given the limitations of the policy period.
Kuroda said the Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks posed by easing, while also taking into account the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic outlook, as Sino-U.S. trade frictions and rising protectionism could affect global demand.
"The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is limited for the time being," Kuroda said.
"But how the problem persists, the impact on the Japanese economy is likely to be greater," he added.
"Strong monetary easing needs to be sustained, while considering the positive and negative effects in a balanced manner," Kuroda said.
While the malpractice of the radical stimulus program has increased, such as the long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, the low inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the program.
The Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the global trade war dispute, Kuroda ruled out the possibility of a recent interest rate hike.
June 1, 2018, Cardiff, the corporate logo on Tesla's electric car.
Under a settlement, U.S.-based Tesla Motors and its chief executive, Musk, have agreed to pay $20 million in fines to financial regulators, and Musk will step down as chairman of the company but remain CEO.
The settlement will bring an end to two months of turmoil for Tesla.
The settlement of the securities fraud allegations disclosed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday will give investors a breath.
Investors had feared a protracted legal battle would only further blow the losing-lose electric car company.
The SEC sued Musk on Thursday for fraud, saying its August 7 tweet misled investors.
The tweet said he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share and had secured financing.
The SEC said the tweets were virtually unfounded and that the market turmoil they triggered hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the deal could strengthen Tesla, which has been hit hard by Musk’s recent actions.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common Asset Management, said the settlement should put Musk under more oversight and did not take “devastating” measures to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management firm holds shares in Tesla’s battery maker Panasonic.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors, and a board committee to develop controls on Musk’s external communications.
"It is in the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, to resolve this matter quickly and on agreed terms," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday's allegations caused Tesla's market value to evaporate about $7 billion, and the company's market value was $45.4 billion on Friday, down from GM's $47.5 billion.
In the settlement agreement, the SEC withdrew the request to remove Musk from the head of the company.
Many investors said the penalty would be catastrophic.
"I think this is the best possible outcome for everyone involved," said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a "null" rating and called the SEC's penalty a "light penalty" for Musk.
"He's still CEO is important to Tesla."
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC’s allegations in the settlement, nor did they immediately respond to a request for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
Beijing Morning News (Reporter Wang Ping) Beijing Morning News reporter recently learned from the Beijing Construction Industry Group that one of the core buildings of the 2019 Beijing World Garden Association Park - Beijing World Garden Performing Arts Square Project will adopt the multi-color ETFE puzzle film structure for the first time, and the film structure of 5,440 square meters will present six colors of deep red, dark green, orange, blue, red, and green.
According to Liu Changbao, project leader of Beijing Construction Engineering Five Construction Group, the performance square project construction area is 4,500 square meters, the total amount of steel installed is 1182 tons, and the steel structure roof is supported by the cantilevered steel truss of 26 umbrellas, which shows the shape of "butterfly wings" under the tensile of the lint.
"From the air overlooking the performing arts square, the colorful roof is like wearing flowers, dancing colorful butterflies, and bright colors will not fade due to time and frost, rain and snow."
Previously, the monochrome ETFE membrane structure was widely used in bird nests, water cubes and other projects, but the multi-color puzzle ETFE membrane structure is the first in the country.
The reporter learned that because there are very few suppliers with a variety of color membrane structure production capacity in the world, so each inch of membrane structure material is very "precious".
Liu Changbao said that in order to avoid overlapping and "fight" and other issues in the position of the end of the rope, the "double fork ear" cable head structure will be innovatively used to ensure that the "fight" rope head is in the right place.
At present, the construction of the 2019 Beijing World Park Park is in progress.
Among them, the International Pavilion project has completed the hoisting construction of all "flower umbrellas".
It is planned that the project will have the conditions for the exhibition at the end of October.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private enterprise symposium, injecting firm confidence into the private economy towards a broader stage.
General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that "let entrepreneurs unload the burden of thought and move forward lightly" has aroused strong resonance among the majority of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes from people, especially entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the 40 years of reform and opening up, there are thousands of stories of entrepreneurs entrepreneurship and innovation, and the growth and growth of the entrepreneurial group have continuously promoted the breakthrough of China's economy.
For some time, some people in the society have made some negative and suspicious remarks about the private economy.
The so-called "private economy departure theory" and "new public-private partnership theory" and other erroneous statements have aroused the doubts and concerns of some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have an impact on some export enterprises; the rapid adjustment of demand structure has brought pressure on transformation and upgrading; some policies are not coordinated with each other, policy effects are superimposed, or the working methods are simple, resulting in some policies with good intentions.
The various factors are intertwined, the private economy is experiencing difficulties, some private enterprises are facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs have shown a lot of anxiety.
In this context, correcting the misunderstanding of understanding, unloading the ideological burden of entrepreneurs, allowing enterprises to single-mindedly seek development, and the government's single-mindedness to promote development, which is related to market confidence and development expectations, has a particularly profound practical significance.
At this symposium, the important assertion of "three unchanged" was re-emphasized: "The status and role of the non-public economy in China's economic and social development have not changed!"
From the in-depth promotion of decentralization, the establishment of the power list system to create a rule of law environment to protect the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, to create a fair competition market environment, and shape the atmosphere of the whole society to respect entrepreneurs, in recent years, the Party Central Committee has paid unprecedented attention to entrepreneurs and institutional protection.
The symposium clearly put forward policies and measures to strongly support the development and growth of private enterprises in six aspects, and launched a series of pragmatic actions committed to private enterprises to "lightly move forward".
All these have greatly encouraged the entrepreneurial community and put more expectations from all walks of life.
The fog is gone, the policy is set, the key is to implement.
We must constantly create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve the difficulties in development, and help realize China's economic transformation and upgrading; let entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legitimate business, feel respected in social life, and stimulate innovation vitality and creative potential.
China's economy has entered the process of moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to show their ambitions, and providing greater space and stage for entrepreneurs to use their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with the further deepening of reform and the removal of obstacles, the private economy will usher in better development prospects and development opportunities, and move towards a broader stage.

China-Vietnam border estuary port held a national gate flag-raising ceremony to celebrate the National Day
"I can't imagine that there is such a magnificent flag-raising ceremony on the border, which is even more shocking than watching the flag raising in the mainland."

The estuary port is the largest port in the Yunnan section of the Sino-Vietnamese border, located in Hekou County, Red River State, and across the river from the old city of Vietnam, which is a national type of port.
With the deepening of the construction of the country's "Belt and Road", as one of the most convenient channels connecting China to Southeast Asia, the flow of estuaries and inbound ports has steadily increased.
At 7:30 a.m. on the same day, the sun had just emerged from a corner, and the limited area of the estuary at the mouth of the river port had gathered early to watch the flag-raising ceremony of the local people and Chinese and foreign tourists.
At 7:45, the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the members of the State Guard of the estuary border checkpoint were in good spirits and escorted the flag to the flag-raising platform at a healthy pace.
After the commander issued the flag-raising instructions, the flag-bearer waving his arms to draw an arc, and the bright five-star red flag was like an "eagle spread its wings" to ease the flag, with the national anthem's rousing and majestic melody slowly rising.

During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, various parties released some positive information on the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in relayed North Korea's "irreversible" determination to denuclearize and said U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea's top leader, Kim Jong Un, could meet before the end of the year.
The U.S. State Department later said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to advance the implementation of the U.S.-North Korea leaders' Singapore meeting commitments.
Since the beginning of this year, the DPRK and the ROK have broken the ice and opened the road of dialogue, the leaders of the DPRK and the ROK and the DPRK and the United States have held meetings, and the general trend of easing the situation on the Korean Peninsula has continued, and the principle of resolving the Korean Peninsula issue has been adhered to.
First of all, the fact that the "mainty of the Korean Peninsula issue is security issues" has not changed. The key to achieving peace on the Peninsula is to properly and balance the reasonable security concerns of all parties, rather than blindly exerting pressure on the other side and emphasizing their own demands.
Second, in the dialogue on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the parties concerned are still divided on the steps and methods of realizing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the US, the game thinking of "who comes first and then" is still strong.
At the Security Council Open Meeting on the Korean Peninsula issue held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York a few days ago, the different voices of all parties on the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted that these two points on the Korean Peninsula issue have not changed.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted that sanctions on North Korea would not be lifted until the Korean peninsula was fully denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stressed the principle of "responding to action by action", noting that "the trend of weakening sanctions should be the same steps as North Korea's steps on the path of gradual denuclearisation."
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the DPRK-related resolutions of the Security Council in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but pressure is not the goal, and the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of political solutions are the requirements of the Security Council resolutions.
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in inter-Korean and DPRK-US relations, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider the timely initiation of reversible clauses to encourage the DPRK and relevant parties to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back, every progress in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the peace process requires sufficient political courage on all sides.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community to promote the political settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue, the relevant parties should especially show political strength and make political decisions, implement commitments and resolve difficult problems, continue to take steps to meet each other, advance the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and establish a peace mechanism on the Peninsula in parallel, and jointly create a permanent peace on the Peninsula.

A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday, and more than 400 people have been confirmed dead, many of them swept away by tsunami waves triggered by the quake.
Authorities expect the total number of deaths to increase significantly on Sunday as new figures are reported in remote areas.
Dozens of people are still reportedly trapped under the rubble of a hotel and a shopping mall in Baru.
Large waves of up to six meters (20 feet) high caused by the earthquake hit the city of Baru.
Only the death toll from Baru has so far been reported slowly in Dungra, northern Baru, and authorities are preparing for a worse situation.
Dungra has a population of 300,000, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Indonesian Vice President Carla said the total number of deaths could rise to thousands.
As the twilight waves hit the coast on Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate the festival, many of whom were swept away by the waves, and everything they went to destroy.
TOKYO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Confidence among Japan’s biggest manufacturers hit their lowest level in more than a year in September, according to the Bank of Japan’s quarterly report on Monday, as rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters have weighed on companies.
The survey did little show that escalating global trade frictions have dampened the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-blown trade war has hit companies’ business prospects and could threaten their capital spending.
Active capital spending is a bright spot in the Japanese economy.
The survey calls into question the Bank of Japan’s view that a robust economic expansion will help accelerate inflation toward its 2 percent target, despite signs that companies are gradually passing on costs to customers.
"In the face of concerns caused by the global trade war, the confidence of manufacturers has stagnated due to the slowdown in exports and weak factory production," said Nan Wuzhi, chief researcher at the Institute of Agriculture and Forestry.
"Fun confidence is still high. And because corporate earnings are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to decline."
The short-term survey showed that the large-scale manufacturing business sentiment judgment index fell to 19 in September from positive 21 three months ago, worsening for the third consecutive quarter.
The median market estimate is positive 22.
The large non-manufacturing sentiment judgment index fell to positive 22 in September from 24 in the June survey, the first deterioration in eight quarters.
Reuters polled at 22.
According to the survey, the large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing economic judgment indexes are expected to remain stable in December.
Investors were unconcerned about the decline in the short-term business sentiment index, with the Nikkei .N225 rising to a 27-year high on Monday as the yen’s continued depreciation helped improve the export earnings outlook for Japanese companies.
Capital expenditures are robust.
While business confidence has declined, the latest short-term outlook highlights the robustness of corporate capital spending plans, helped by increased capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation in response to an aging population.
According to the central bank's short-term survey, large enterprises plan to increase capital expenditures by 13.4% in the fiscal year ending March 2019.
The previous short-term survey was 13.6%.
Nan said that all corporate capital expenditure plans for the fiscal year will grow by 8.5%, close to the pace of Japan's bubble economy.
“Given that small businesses are raising their profit forecasts from now on, there is still room for further growth in capital spending, but that depends largely on the impact of the trade war on business confidence,” he said.
The increased ability of companies to pass on costs and a positive seven-year high in the output price index of large companies is a decade-old high, a sign that reflects progress in Japan’s efforts to combat deflation.
The index, which measures employment in large enterprises, hit minus 23, the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
Thanks to strong corporate spending, Japan’s economy rebounded in the second quarter from its contraction in January-March.
But the escalating trade frictions in the summer and the disruption of the supply chain due to natural disasters have clouded the economic outlook for export-dependent Japan.
In US dollars, the growth rate of import and export of services is 16.4%.

69th International Astronautical Congress opens in Germany
Xinhua News Agency, Bremen, Germany, October 1 (Reporter Ren Ke Zhang Yirong) The 69th International Astronautical Congress kicked off on October 1 at the Bremen Convention and Exhibition Center in Germany, attended by more than 6,300 astronauts, space agencies and business representatives, experts, scholars and young students from all over the world.
Jean-Yves Legal, President of the International Astronautical Federation, said in his speech at the opening ceremony that the global space industry is no longer the participation of only a few countries and institutions, and the number of participants this year has increased significantly compared with the previous one, indicating that more and more institutions and people are joining it.
He called on all countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation and jointly promote the development of the space industry.
Zhang Kejun, Vice Minister of Industry and Information Technology of China and Director of the State Space Administration, introduced China's space program when he attended the exchange event and said that China will expand international cooperation in the space field and contribute to the human space industry.
Representatives of relevant institutions such as China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation and China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, as well as some private enterprises, participated in the meeting, showing the latest achievements of China's aerospace industry, including various types of launch vehicles, satellites and aerospace science and technology applications.
The International Astronautical Congress has been held annually since 1950 and is the largest event in the world aviation community.
The five-day conference was co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Center for Applied Science and Microgravity Research at the University of Bremen and the International Society of Space Law.
BEIJING, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The Canton Fair shows that China’s foreign trade situation is still complicated and severe, with 80.6 percent of companies expecting exports in 2018 to be better than they were or flat in 2018.
However, considering the continuous rise in the cost of comprehensive factors such as domestic raw materials and labor, and the external environment of the Sino-US trade friction has increased, the exhibitors also believe that the export situation next year is not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, deputy secretary-general of the Canton Fair, spokesman and deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions of the Canton Fair have decreased slightly year-on-year.
The current buyers attended 189,812 people from 215 countries and regions, down 1.11% year-on-year.
Export turnover of 206.494 billion yuan (equivalent to 29.86 billion U.S. dollars), down 1% year-on-year.
From the market point of view, the transactions with Japan, the ten ASEAN countries, the "BRIC countries" and South Korea increased by 74.4%, 10.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, and the traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union fell by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively.
From the perspective of the industry, transportation vehicles, machinery and equipment, construction and decoration materials, consumer electronics and information products, and sanitary ware equipment increased by 24.8%, 21%, 20.0 %, 15.1%, and 7.6% respectively, while textile and clothing and household appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer and weather vane of China's foreign trade, the current Canton Fair buyers' participation in the situation and export transaction data show that China's foreign trade development will still face many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the deepening of the supply-side structural reform and the recent national and local policies and measures such as "six stability", the new momentum of China's foreign trade development is accelerating, and the diversification of the enterprise market has made new progress, which is an important basis and strong condition for the development of foreign trade.
"Integrated by all parties, it is expected that China's foreign trade imports and exports will maintain steady growth throughout the year, and the quality and efficiency will be further improved."
China's General Administration of Customs announced that exports in dollar terms in September increased by 14.5% year-on-year, imports increased by 14.3% year-on-year, and the trade surplus in September was 31.69 billion US dollars.
Despite the escalating Sino-US trade frictions, China's export performance in September still significantly exceeded expectations, strong external demand, enterprises in the United States before the imposition of tariffs to seize exports superimposed devaluation of the RMB exchange rate, or the main supporting factors, but also to a certain extent shows the resilience of China's foreign trade, but the Sino-US trade war on confidence, the impact on the industrial chain can not be underestimated, analysts believe that China's foreign trade challenges may appear in the fourth quarter or next year.
A Reuters survey showed U.S. fund managers in September recommended increasing their cash holdings, continuing a cautious stance as the United States and China began the latest round of import tariffs and the dispute showed no signs of easing.
However, according to the 12 fund managers participating in the survey, North American asset allocation increased to the highest since June 2017, while the United Kingdom, the euro area, especially emerging markets, fell positions.
The global stock allocation accounted for an average of 56.6%, and bonds accounted for 35.5%, which is basically in line with last month's survey.
The most significant change is the cash ratio rising to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
"Some of the economic data has brought confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so it's best to be prepared to go in when the market pulls back," said a fund manager at a large fund firm.
But fund managers still preferred stocks, especially U.S. stocks, in September, even though they were considered high.
Today, in Shanghai, China's open landmark, the world's first large-scale import-themed national-level exhibition, the China International Import Expo, officially kicked off in the expectation of all.
An exhibition is like a window, which can make the world better understand a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the Expo, people see the "open China" to a higher level; with the help of the Expo this "window", welcome the world and "re-opening" China's mutual benefit and win-win situation.
"For a country, openness is like a cocoon into a butterfly, although it will experience a momentary pain, but will be a new birth."
General Secretary Xi Jinping summed up the road of opening up, an important reason for "why China can".
Looking back on the 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which dares to enter the world market, has encountered vortexes and storms, but has always faced all risks and challenges with an open attitude, continuously releasing endogenous power and continuously improving its competitiveness.
It can be said that China has effectively interpreted the value and significance of openness with its own solid achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point, holding an import-themed expo is a major decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core to promote a new round of high-level opening up, a major measure for China to take the initiative to open its market to the world, and a strong and clear willingness to support economic globalization and trade liberalization.
The active registration of exhibitors from various countries and the "difficult to find" booths are the greatest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a wider, wider and deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have built up the wall of trade protectionism and retreated to the old path of unilateralism, which has increased the international community's concern about the prospects for free trade and added a lot of uncertainty to the warming world economy.
In the context of such an era, the event on the banks of the Huangpu River reflects China's defense of free trade, and allows the world to see China's self-confidence and China's commitment to open markets and a shared future.
Go alone and go far.
China's openness and embrace of the world not only effectively promote its own development, but also bring surging "China opportunities" to countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, advocating and promoting the joint construction of the "Belt and Road", the establishment of the AIIB, the establishment of the Silk Road Fund... China has provided a series of international public goods, provided real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, and allowed enterprises from all countries to take the "fast train" and "happy ride" of China's development.
CIIE is also a public product and a big platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises in more than 130 countries and regions have made a new step in the Chinese market with their own distinctive high-quality products and services.
In addition to companies from all over the world, domestic consumers are also really benefiting.
By building this "preferred" platform, it provides a multi-channel high-quality supply for consumption upgrading to meet the personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs of the people.
As China's door of opening up becomes wider and wider, the goods flow smoothly, make the best use of it, and the pace of moving towards a better life will be more solid.
From a more macro perspective, the significance of the Expo has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade, but focused on the future, conveying the concept of openness, inclusiveness, inclusiveness, balance and win-win results, and forming a consensus to jointly address today's challenges.
If the world is good, China can be good; if China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to the Expo to bring wonderful and complete to the world; we look forward to moving towards a higher level of "open China" and the world to build a bright future of the community of human destiny.
Foreign media: the United States and Canada reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and the temporary non-tariff on Canadian-made vehicles.
According to foreign media reports, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of September 30 local time that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
According to the agreement, the agreement includes Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States, and the United States does not impose tariffs on Canadian-made cars for the time being.
On the 27th of last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary agreement in principle to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement before the August 31 deadline set by the United States to extend the negotiation period until September 30.
Earlier, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Canada would only sign a favorable agreement, "with a focus on substance, not timetable. We will continue to negotiate and hope to reach an agreement that is in Canada's national interest."
More than 90 percent of Brazilian voters say presidential candidates are not considering women’s needs.
According to data released by Brazil's National Geographic Institute (IBGE), more than 90% of Brazilian women do not think that presidential candidates consider women's needs.
At present, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million, and if women from all of Brazil are gathered to form a country, the country's population will be ranked 13th in the world, more than twice the population of Spain.
In Brazil, women account for 52% of the total electorate and 48% of men. Although the proportion of women in the electorate is very high, only 10% of the Brazilian Congress is female.
Of the 193 countries in the world, Brazilian women are only 154th in politics, higher than in Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of rights struggle, Brazilian women have not succeeded in gaining their rights.
Natalia Mori, a Brazilian sociologist, points out that this phenomenon is the result of ancient patriarchal society, racism, and the combination of capitalist values.
"Politics should be the people who advocate for civil rights, identity, access to public goods and the same society by multiple social groups. But Brazilian politics is a monopoly of a certain group, and the majority of the population is not represented."
A previous study by Locomotiva also pointed out that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that the elected politicians can represent their rights, 90% of Brazilian women do not agree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93% of women do not agree with the current government's governance policies.
"We need to reverse the underrepresentation of women in parliament, where the political system is still affected by inequality. So far, there are still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in Brazil's political sphere," said Natalia Morrie.
Despite women’s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76 per cent of women believed they could make a difference in democratic elections and 72 per cent were interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democracy is the best way to expose women to less prejudice.

While Barclays is optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook by the end of the year, the bank acknowledged that it would be more difficult to make predictions about further periods of time.
"Existaging fiscal policy will not be sustainable in the absence of more sustainable investment growth potential to boost growth," Barclays economists said in a research note.
“In the absence of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing in 2020 will rise,” they said.

The Eurozone and U.S. manufacturing surveys scheduled for Monday will be watched, with the services sector survey due to be released on Wednesday.
But next week’s data will certainly focus on U.S. nonfarm payroll data to be released next Friday, which will provide clues as to whether the tight job market is driving a big pay rise.
Its importance is not only important for corporate profitability and consumer purchasing power, but also because of higher wages or triggering overall inflation, which may unnerve Federal Reserve officials.
“Sales will be of much interest because there could be another sharp rise from the previous month.
The increase in September compared to the same period last year may not exceed 3%, but we can expect a breakout next month," ING economists wrote in a research note.
At a time when holidays in China and other parts of Asia are causing the region’s data to be light next week, European politics is likely to become a source of market volatility.

"The strong winds blowing from the shore continued, and the sea conditions were too violent."
"In this case, no one knows when the gusts are blowing towards the ship.
Close to the city's arena, in the current wind conditions, cancel the game is the most sensible choice.
The crew was still a bit disappointed.
"The race is ready to stop, we are in good shape."
Max Richardson, the helmsman of the Qingdao team, said: "But I know that the rescheduling of the game is the right choice, and I hope that today's wind energy is smaller, we can show our skills."

Despite the continued global financial market volatility, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the foreign exchange fund's investment income in the third quarter of this year fell by 97% year-on-year, but better than the previous quarter, because under the Sino-US trade war, overseas stocks rose, and foreign exchange losses also narrowed significantly.
According to the latest data from the HKMA, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$1.6 billion in July-September 2018, significantly lower than HK$61.8 billion in the same period last year, but it was better than HK$100 million revised in the second quarter of this year.
Chen Delin, president of the HKMA, said at the legislative meeting that at the beginning of the Sino-US trade war, Hong Kong and emerging market stock indexes ran counter to the US stock index, and until the end of September and the beginning of October, the US stock market index peaked, and market sentiment began to reverse, because investors gradually realized that the trade war was also unfavorable to the United States itself.
"Change in market sentiment is a good thing, if the trade war only has a one-sided impact, it will not help to solve the problem."
But he also pointed out that "if the Sino-US trade war fails to resolve, financial market volatility will continue to rise."
In the third quarter of this year, the foreign exchange fund's equity investment loss in Hong Kong was 8% narrower than the previous quarter to HK$4.7 billion, and the overseas stock investment income increased by 172% to HK$12.8 billion; the foreign exchange loss was HK$16.2 billion, and the bond income was HK$9.7 billion, respectively, which decreased by 24% and 31% respectively, mainly reflecting the general rise of the US dollar against major currencies in the quarter and the US interest rate in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Since 1983, Hong Kong has implemented a linked exchange rate system for the pegging of the Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar.
For the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that the economic and asset market uncertainty has increased, and the downside risks have increased, but Hong Kong's financial system is stable, it is also well-defended and has sufficient earthquake resistance.
"Hong Kong's international investment position is abundant, with an external net asset value of $1.4 trillion, equivalent to four times of GDP, higher than Singapore's 2.5 times and Japan's 0.6 times, to cope with the economic downturn or reverse enough."
Recently, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate continued to fall and expand with the US dollar spread, Chen Delin pointed out that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate on September 21 once rose more than 400 basis points, the market is generally believed to be mainly related to the Hong Kong dollar interest rate increase, after the Hong Kong dollar against the dollar around the level of 7.80-7.84, to the recent Hong Kong dollar interest rate continued to fall, and the dollar spread expanded, may attract the market to Hong Kong dollar, buy the dollar interest rate increase, so that the Hong Kong dollar again.
However, he believes that with the start of the Hong Kong Bank interest rate hike cycle and the normalization of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, the situation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate lower than the US dollar interest rate will change in the future.
"The Hong Kong dollar interest rate and the US dollar interest rate trend will be more consistent, we must be more careful to manage the risk, be prepared to cope with market fluctuations."
Due to the abundant funds of the Hong Kong dollar, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate reduction further fell, the three-month interest rate cut fell by 0.9% to 2.08179 % on Monday, and the spread with the US dollar was widened from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the one-month interest rate cut was a five-month low, and the interest rate difference with the US dollar was expanded from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate was close to 7.85 to the dollar for most of the time.
During the period, due to factors such as the outflow of some of the funds from the Hong Kong dollar after the completion of the carry activity and the large-scale prospectus, the weak party exchange guarantee was triggered many times in May and August after the first time was triggered in April.
The HKMA bought Hong Kong dollars and exported US dollars at the 7.85 level in accordance with the linked exchange rate system to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
The HKMA bought a total of approximately HK$52.1 billion in May and August under the Weak Party Exchange Assurance Mechanism.

There is no "threshold" moon child center: quality certification promotes quality improvement.
With the pull of the "two-child economy" and the prosperity of the mother and baby market, from the north to the third and fourth tier cities, various grades of moon clubs have sprung up.
At present, the hot moon club meets the consumption needs of the masses, and charges range from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan, but it is also in an embarrassing situation, this institution has no threshold so far, and there is still a blank area of supervision.
The State Administration of Market Supervision recently launched the 2018 National "Quality Month" series of activities, and the reporter came to a five-star monthly center in Tianjin to visit the experience of maternal and child care service certification.
The general monthly children's center provides neonatal care, nutrition meals, postpartum repair and other services.
In this lunar center, the reporter saw that the nurse checked the breastfeeding situation of newborns every day, and professional carers provided fine care services such as bathing and touching for newborns.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, from the initial wound care of the moon to the beauty care and other services in the middle and late moon, medical treatment and beauty care programs are provided to help mothers restore their posture.
A new mother who lives in the house told reporters that she had booked the clubhouse eight months in advance.
The service items of the monthly club directly affect the comfort level and physical recovery during the maternal month, and some small-scale monthly club can only provide some simple monthly services, and there are hidden problems such as irregular disinfection hygiene, easy cross-infection, and single unscientific diet.
The head of the Yuezi Center said that they are the only one of all five-star children's centers in Tianjin to have obtained B-level service certification.
"Although some customers do not understand the meaning of B-level certification at first, but through certification forced enterprises to strictly standardize the process management, so that customers benefit, the long-term development of the enterprise is of great significance," he said.
Pan Lifen, deputy director of the certification supervision department of the State Administration of Market Supervision, said that service certification is a new type of certification system based on customer perception, paying attention to the degree of organizational quality management and service characteristics, which is an important part of the national quality infrastructure, and plays a positive role in improving the proportion of high-quality service supply and enhancing the international competitiveness of China's services.
China started from 2004, after more than 10 years of development, service certification project has experienced from scratch, gradual development process, the emergence of such as financial services certification, maternal and child care service certification, commodity after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification, health service certification and a number of service certification have a certain influence.
According to the statistics of the State Administration of Market Supervision, there are more than 130 service certification bodies in China, more than 2,000 service certification personnel, and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.
Pan Lifen said that it is necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually expand service certification coverage in the fields of health, education, sports, finance, and e-commerce, and promote the supply-side reform and quality improvement of the service industry.
HONG KONG, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Hong Kong property prices fell for two consecutive months after peaking, and Hong Kong Monetary Authority President Chen Delin said on Monday that fashion needs time to observe whether the property market has entered a downward cycle, and if confirmed, it can consider easing the tightening of counter-cyclical measures in due course.
Chen Delin also pointed out that if the property price correction, the first to be affected will be those who buy a home at the peak of the property market, but it is expected that the opportunity for property prices to fall sharply during the Asian financial crisis in 1997, and the public will sell the property significantly.
Chen Delin led a number of senior officials of the HKMA to attend the Legislative Council briefing, saying that if it is confirmed that the property market has entered a downward cycle, measures can be relaxed in due course.
"But now only a few weeks of data, relaxation is still too early, there is still more time to see whether the property market has entered the downward cycle."
Since the 10th of 2009, the HKMA has launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to significantly tighten the mortgages of various properties, including reducing the number of mortgages and the need for mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests to improve bank risk management and earthquake resistance.
As Hong Kong officially entered the rate hike cycle, the Hong Kong private residential property price index peaked for two consecutive months in August-September, and the monthly decline in September expanded to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year still reached 10.2%.
In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of households living in Hong Kong without mortgages reached 66%, up from an average of 60% in 2009-11, compared with an average of 60% in 2009-11; the contribution-to-income ratio of newly approved mortgages and newly approved mortgages was 47% and 34%, respectively, compared with 64% and 41% in 2009-11.
However, Chen Delin said that the high seismic capacity does not mean that the citizens who have already bought the property will not be damaged by the economic downturn, because the valuation of the property will fall, and those who buy buildings at the peak will bear the brunt.
Although the HKMA has tightened bank lending to mortgage lenders, homebuyers can also obtain high-volume mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Chen Delin said that at present, together with the mortgage loans provided to developers, the mortgage ratio of borrowers can reach 85-90%, and if the property price falls by 10%, there will be negative assets (that is, the market value of the property will fall below the level of the total amount of outstanding mortgage loans).
However, Nguyen Guo Heng, vice president of the HKMA, pointed out that the authorities estimate that the total number of mortgages provided by developers accounts for only 2-2.5% of the total number of mortgages in banks, and the proportion is still low.
At the peak of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of the number of people providing for buildings.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive quarters.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic and difficult disease that involves multiple organs throughout the body and has been considered an "incurable disease" in the past.
Because of its unclear pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment are difficult, and there is a lack of effective treatment.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the School of Life Sciences of Tsinghua University, and the joint team of Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatological Immunity Center of Peking University People's Hospital, discovered that human immunoglobulin has molecular variation that increases the susceptibility of systemic lupus erythematosus, and this variation is involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of the systematic onset of lupus erythematosus.
According to one of the authors of the article, Sun Xiaolin of Peking University People's Hospital, the team collected nearly 2,000 large samples of systemic lupus patients and conducted research, and found that patients with immunoglobulin variants produced disease-causing cells and a wide variety of autoantibodies, and the incidence and severity of inflammation such as nephritis, arthritis, plasma, and vasculitis increased significantly.
Through various research methods such as immune cell tracking, animal testing, sequencing, etc., Liu Wanli's team found that the immune signaling pathway activated by this immune molecular variant and the pathogenesis of B cells to secrete a variety of autoantibodies.
The reporter learned that the two teams are strong and united, giving full play to their respective advantages, and achieving a close integration of basic research and clinical applications.
Liu Wanli's team is committed to the study of immune recognition and immune activation of B lymphocytes, and the team of Li Zhanguo has long been engaged in clinical research on systemic lupus.
"This study is one of the results of years of cooperation between the two teams, and the first time in the academic community to recognize that immunoglobulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted therapy."
This is not short-term, but to act in accordance with the law.
Lawyer with an axe in court session?
The news is really exciting at first glance, and it also exploded in the legal circle.
Fujian Quanzhou City China and France subsequently fined the lawyers involved 500 yuan and suggested in writing that the Quanzhou Bar Association investigate and deal with it.
According to the Beijing News, a few days ago, the Quanzhou Municipal Law Association issued an official notice that the behavior of the two lawyers does not involve illegal violations and is not punished according to law.
From the multi-party report, the treatment of Quanzhou City Law Association is not to protect short or confrontation, but has been recognized by the Quanzhou Middle Court.
An incident that could have triggered tensions within the legal community was finally properly resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete truth restoration: the axe carried by the lawyer involved is the same style and model as the defendant's murder weapon, but it is not bladed, only to provide auxiliary evidence in the cross-examination process, and there is no act of intimidation or "endangering the court's security" subjective intention.
There are four very important details to pay attention to in determining whether the behavior of the lawyers involved is illegal: first, the local court has only shown the axe photo, from the defense point of view, the original of the axe is necessary; second, the axe is purchased only 1 hour before the trial, not the lawyer does not want to seek the consent of the judge, but objectively failed to contact the judge; third, the whole axe was not over-used or improperly used; fourth, the lawyer was first.
Comprehensively combining these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyers involved "showcase in court with axes" have nothing to do with it, but only to defend.
After clarifying the whole facts, the Quanzhou Municipal Law Association did not push the boat along the water, but resisted the pressure and made a decision not to punish.
This decision also stands the test of facts and laws.
As for bringing the axe of the controlled tool to the court without the permission of the court, it is indeed prone to anxiety and misunderstanding.
For safety and prudence, the previous fines and judicial recommendations of the Quanzhou Middle Court are also understandable.
In order to safeguard the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from using difficult lawyers, the Supreme People's Court issued the Rules for Security Inspection of Judicial Police in the People's Courts in 2014, which established the principle that lawyers do not need to conduct personal safety checks in court.
Since the issuance of the rule, the majority of lawyers have led by example, and there are few incidents that endanger the security of the court due to security loopholes.
In rare cases such as Quanzhou, as long as it is communicated in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding, misunderstandings are not difficult to eliminate.
As a self-regulatory organization in the lawyer industry, the Bar Association has the dual mission of disciplining illegality and safeguarding legality.
In the past, individual legal organizations were criticized for their emphasis on punishment and lost their protection.
The decision of the Quanzhou Law Association, both in terms of process and results, is commendable and sets an example for more lawyers to perform their duties correctly.
From October 1, which tax benefits will affect our wallets?
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1 (Reporter Sang Tong) The new personal income tax law will come into effect on January 1, 2019, in order to allow the broad masses of the people to enjoy tax reduction dividends as soon as possible, from October 1, the actual wage and salary income of taxpayers will be deducted according to the starting point of 5,000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate table will be applied.
With the landing of the New Deal, what are the benefits that will affect the people's money bags?
Benefit 1: The tax reduction rate of wages and salaries is obvious
Taxpayers who receive salary after October 1 can deduct the basic deduction fee of 5,000 yuan / month and apply the new tax rate table, and most taxpayers have different degrees of tax cuts, especially for low- and middle-income people.
According to the tax reduction table of different income groups, after deducting the "three insurances and one gold", the monthly income of 8000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, after the tax reform should be 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan, 9090 yuan, compared with the monthly levy of 3500 yuan, the corresponding tax reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61%, 490%, 18.8%.
It is worth noting that due to holidays, the wages that should be paid in October according to law by various units at the end of September can be applied to the new basic deduction fees and tax rates.
To this end, the withholding client software used by the tax department has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid during the statutory filing period.
Good two: low tax rate grade distance is obviously large
In addition to raising the starting point, the new tax schedule will be applied from October 1.
The seven tax rates of wages and salary income are the same as before, and there is no change, but the tax rate level has changed significantly, and the three-grade low tax rate of 3%, 10%, and 20% has been significantly expanded, and the tax rate margin of 25% has been reduced, while the three higher tax rates of 30%, 35% and 45% remain unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the tax rates of production and operation income, of which the lower limit of the highest 35% tax rate has been increased from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan.
This means that individual businesses and sole proprietorships will benefit from tax reform.
"From the early assessment of individual tax cuts for Shanghai taxpayers, the majority of taxpayers will fully feel the dividends of individual tax reform, especially for low- and middle-income people.
Lan Min, head of the personal income tax department of the Shanghai Municipal Taxation Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation, said.

A three-way trade deal between the United States and Canada will open up new opportunities for 500 million people.
According to foreign media reports, the Canadian government website published a joint statement by Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer said that the United States, Canada and Mexico reached a trilateral trade agreement, the agreement will be called "USMCA" (the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement).
Earlier, Canada's CTV News TV quoted senior US sources as saying that Canada and the United States had resolved their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post, citing two sources familiar with the situation, reported that the agreement reached between the United States and Canada on September 30 will retain the North American Free Trade Agreement as a trilateral trade agreement, and the three heads of state will sign a new agreement within two months.
“Today, Canada, the United States, and Mexico agreed on a new trade deal – the USMCA, which will provide our workers, farmers, and companies with high standards of trade, and will lead to freer markets, fairer transactions, and more sustainable economic growth. The agreement will strengthen the middle class, create high-paying jobs, and bring new opportunities to about 500 million people,” the statement said.
The current North American Free Trade Agreement was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
After taking office, Trump announced plans to review the agreement and sign a new agreement.
The three countries began this negotiation process in 2017.
The Okinawa Governor's election, which was held in advance due to the illness and death of former governor Weng Changxiongzhi, announced the results in the early morning of the 1st local time, and Yucheng Danny, who opposed the relocation plan of the US military base in Japan, was successfully elected.
The final results showed that Yucheng received a total of 396,632 votes, the highest number of votes in the history of the Okinawa Governor's election, more than 80,000 votes more than his main opponent, Sasuke.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a turnout of 63.24%, down 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 governorship election in Okinawa Prefecture.
Yucheng told the media on the 1st that the election results showed that the county people did not want Governor Weng's efforts to be wasted, and he will inherit the legacy of Governor Weng and continue to make efforts to the Japanese government and the US government on opposing the relocation plan of the US military base and the closure of the Futenma base.
The U.S. military base in the city of Iino Bay, Okinawa Prefecture, has been criticized, and the Japanese and U.S. governments had previously agreed to relocate it to the former area of the famous guard city, but the Okinawan people strongly opposed it and hoped to completely move the base out of Okinawa.
For the relocation plan strongly opposed by the county people and the request to revoke the permission to reclaim land along the ancient coast of the border, Yucheng said that he did not stand in opposition and division with the central government at the beginning, and hoped that the two sides could fully exchange views and show their intention to resolve through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also told the media on the morning of the 1st that he earnestly accepts this result and will make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden on the base.
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference on the 1st that the government's policy on relocating the US military base as soon as possible has not changed.
At the same time, he also expressed his intention to talk with Yucheng.
Yucheng will officially become the governor of Okinawa Prefecture on the 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China’s demand for oilseeds has grown, Paul Thomas, a North Dakota farmer, has grown more and more soybeans in his land.
The shift peaked this year, with him planting 1,600 acres of soybeans on 5,000 acres of land, a scale never seen before.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch to the staple crops of the former U.S. agricultural region in 2019: corn and wheat.
U.S. farmers planted more soybeans than corn this year for the first time in 35 years.
The reason for the plan to switch to other food crops is because in the context of US President Trump's trade war with China, American farmers are facing difficulties in selling soybeans.
China typically buys about 60 percent of U.S. soybeans, but because of the trade war, nearly zero purchases of U.S. soybeans in recent months have sent soybean prices to a decade-long low.
Thomas plans to plant more wheat next year, hoping to make more money by reducing dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Thomas said soybean prices "have hit us hard."
Without Chinese demand, he said, the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per bushel, while the price necessary to cover the cost was $8.50.
U.S. farmers planted a record amount of soybeans this year, and the harvest is also expected to hit a record high.
At such a time when they are vulnerable, they have encountered the blow of the trade war.
In response to Trump's imposition of tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, China imposed import tariffs on imports of U.S. soybeans in July.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its first estimate for next year’s planting area, which is expected to include considerations of the impact of the tariffs.
The forecast is expected to confirm the expectations of private institutions for a reduction in soybean planting area.
According to a report seen by Reuters, Informa Economics on October 19 expected corn planting to increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019, and soybean planting area to decrease by 7% to 83 million acres.
Informa also expects U.S. wheat acreage to increase by 4%.
Soybean grown before retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres higher than a decade ago.
Corn cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008 to 98.1 million acres, and this year’s wheat planting area is 41.8 million acres, near its lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Growers Association, has a total 3,600-acre acre plant, and he’s spending nearly half on soybeans this year, but plans to cut back in the future.
He said it was possible to increase corn cultivation by up to 20 percent at his northern Illinois farm, the largest soybean-growing state in the United States.
Soybeans yield less per acre than corn, but also require less fertilizer, which makes soybeans generally less expensive to grow.
If farmers move to final corn, it may raise costs, but it will benefit some businesses, including Andersons Inc. fertilizer sellers.
Andersons chief executive Pat Bowe told Reuters he expected the conversion of corn would be beneficial for fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the conversion of farmers to corn.
The director of the Don Muang Airport Authority in Bangkok, Thailand, held a press conference on the 29th to apologize for the beating of a Chinese citizen at the airport, and said that Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists, and the relevant departments will strengthen management, improve service awareness, and avoid similar incidents.
According to reports, on the 27th, the security guard at Don Muang Airport had a physical conflict with a Chinese man who was refused entry.
Sutirava said that the security involved in the serious violation of discipline, the airport authority has suspended him, and in accordance with the procedure to set up a commission of inquiry to investigate the matter, if the matter is true will be dismissed.
At present, the Thai Immigration Department has arranged for the man to return to China by plane.
Suratava apologized for the incident that damaged Thailand's image, and said that the Thai side attaches great importance to this matter, is willing to do its best to reduce the impact of the incident on the tourists, and will send a letter of apology to the person through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that Don Muang Airport is willing to facilitate Chinese tourists to Thailand, and the Thai Immigration Bureau in Bangkok Suvarnabhumi, Don Muang, Chiang Mai, Phuket, Hoai and other five international airports in Thailand to set up a special entry channel for Chinese tourists.
He said that in the next step, the Airport Administration will rectify the landing visa area, express the cost of the visa-on-arrival, and improve the service quality and communication ability of the staff.
After the Chinese Embassy in Thailand learned of the matter, it was the first time to contact the person concerned to understand what had happened.
At the same time, representations were made to the heads of the Thai Immigration Bureau, the Airport Authority and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, asking the Thai side to thoroughly investigate the incident, severely punish the perpetrators, and will continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side to properly handle the matter and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the parties concerned.
Xinhua International Review: Defend multilateralism and unite China's knowledge and action.
At a time when unilateralism is surging, international rules and multilateral order are under attack.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible major country, with the concept of following the trend and the road of cooperation and solid and powerful actions, China has worked with the international community to safeguard multilateralism and promote multilateralism.
In the face of the new situation and new challenges, China has issued a loud voice on the development direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in his speech at the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to the goal of win-win cooperation, based on rules order, fairness and justice as the main purpose, and effective action-oriented.
At the same time, China calls for the construction of a global development cooperation pattern with the United Nations as the core, North-South cooperation as the main channel and South-South cooperation as the supplement, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind.
China's thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As Espinosa, President of the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, said, under the current circumstances, "the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and safeguard the rules-based international system more than ever."
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said the international community should continue to firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules, and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the balance of global economic and political forces, some emerging markets and developing countries have risen to play a greater role in major international multilateral mechanisms, providing new development impetus for multilateralism that has encountered headwinds.
Standing in this dimension, China's advocacy of building a large family rather than piecing together a small circle, adhering to the concept of multilateralism such as co-construction rather than engaging in winner-take-all, conforms to the trend of the times, is an inevitable choice to deal with global challenges and solve world problems, and represents the common aspirations of most countries in the world.
There are advanced ideas and more solid actions.
The Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China has launched international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the 16+1 cooperation to promote international and regional cooperation, improve and complement the existing international system and order, bring innovative vitality to multilateral cooperation, and contribute to the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.
As a defender of the international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China's actions are becoming more and more powerful in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
We will mediate international hotspots, address climate change, participate in peacekeeping operations, vigorously reduce poverty and alleviate poverty, and help other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As UN Secretary-General António Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the world’s “trust deficit” intensifies, when populist and polarized trends are on the rise, it is the world’s most pressing need for multilateral cooperation.
At such a historical juncture, the international community needs to work together to turn consensus into action, resolutely safeguard multilateralism, and jointly promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.

Five years ago, the Martyrs' Day was set on the eve of the National Day, showing the great course of the Chinese nation from suffering to glory, and we must always be alert: "Where do we come from and where do we go?"
General Secretary Xi Jinping profoundly pointed out that "abandoning tradition and losing it is equivalent to cutting off your spiritual lifeline."
"Don't forget history can open up the future."

The fifth "disabled voice month" comes to pay attention to the issue of sex education for disabled adolescents
In recent years, the topic of sex education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenge for sex education for adolescents with disabilities is still arduous.
Recently, a comprehensive education challenge and practice strategy seminar for people with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to provide sex education for children and young people with disabilities has become an important topic of this seminar.
The "Report on Sexual Knowledge, Attitudes and Behavior of Children and Youth with Disabilities in China" released at the meeting shows that the proportion of children with disabilities who have been sexually harassed and sexually assaulted is higher than that of healthy children.
For children and adolescents with disabilities, the society has given more attention to "sexual protection".
The purpose of this seminar is to explore the promotion of comprehensive education for children and adolescents with disabilities in China from the aspects of family support, school education and institutional services, and to support children and adolescents with disabilities at the source, so that they, like others, can enjoy the right to love freely.
Experts believe that the Chinese public's understanding of disabled groups has always remained on a level that is not deep enough.
Due to traditional attitudes and other factors, China's comprehensive education for people with disabilities, especially children and adolescents with disabilities, is not deep enough.
However, in recent years, with the support of UNESCO and public welfare personnel, the practice and realization path of sexual and reproductive health education for people with disabilities in China have developed in a comprehensive cycle.
The report shows that although children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical disabilities will have more difficulties in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships than the average person, but they have generally developed to convenience and enrich.
The "Sensitical Challenge and Practice Strategy Seminar for People with Disabilities Comprehensive Sex Education" is sponsored by the Shanghai Public Welfare Foundation, supported by the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the International Disability Alliance (France) in Beijing, and the United Nations Population Fund Representative Office in China, to jointly explore the full-cycle comprehensive development of sexual and reproductive health education practices and realization paths for people with disabilities in the context of the Greater Strategy of Healthy China, and promote the wide range of policy makers, educators, researchers, social service organizations, parents and other stakeholders in the field of special education.Comprehensive sexuality education is discussed and a blueprint is developed to form a support network.
BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The People’s Bank of China on Sunday released data on short-term outflows of foreign currency assets, which showed that the central bank’s short positions on foreign currency forwards and futures contracts as of the end of August were zero for 12 consecutive months, with no long positions remaining in the month.
The central bank's previous data show that as of the end of August last year, the central bank held a total of foreign currency to local currency forward contracts and futures contracts short positions of 6.044 billion US dollars, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the short position in SDR (special draw rights) was 4.276 billion SDR.
Since then, the central bank’s foreign exchange forward short position has been zero.
The central bank first released the data at the end of March 2016; the data showed that the central bank's foreign currency foreign currency forward and futures contracts long positions at the end of February 2016 were US$2.438 billion, and the short position was $28.9 billion.
The September data released at the end of October of the same year showed a net increase of $16,401 million to $45,301 million.
The central bank has previously said that the foreign currency forward and futures short positions mainly reflect the central bank's foreign exchange forward operations with commercial banks to meet the hedging needs of corporate foreign currency liabilities, and will continue to provide forward-haven products in accordance with the principle of real demand, and the central bank's forward operation will have less impact on the scale of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, Joe, a junior in Zhengzhou, took a ride to Hebi.
A man on the train bought a seatless ticket, but took her seat: "Shoot it."
After a two-hour drive, the conductor persuaded him that an hour would still be ineffective.
In the end, a male passenger in the same car could not see and drag the master up.
From the public opinion, although most of the final results are that the overlords are condemned by the public, punished by the public security department, and even included in the integrity blacklist, the public still feels that they do not "resolve their hatred": Why can't they let the overlords be punished on the spot?
Why can't they be prevented from acting immoral or even illegal behavior on the spot, but after the fact that they can be punished?
And for the unreasonable behavior of the "hegemonic master", how can a male passenger "see the road" and pull it?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police, and short-distance trains are generally not available; even if there are police officers, the police are more concerned about the possible rogue reactions of the overlords and do not take compulsory removal measures.
Repeated hegemonic incidents have made people realize that they must be forcibly removed or even punished on the spot to play a deterrent role.
This requires that our train police should dare to take strong measures in time, and trains without police should be equipped as soon as possible to protect and stop and crack down on illegal acts in a timely manner.
On October 1, the first day of the National Day holiday, the number of vehicles in the direction of Songpan in Songpan, Mao County, through Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County in Sichuan Province, soared.
At about 13 o'clock, the Beichuan traffic police received a call for help, saying that his family had a traffic accident in Songpan, and due to limited local medical conditions, it was urgently needed to send to Mianyang for treatment.
Coinciding with the implementation of one-way traffic control on the lake ring road in Tangjiashan, Beichuan, I would like to ask the traffic police to release 120 emergency vehicles.
After receiving the call for help, the police on duty quickly reported the situation to the brigade, the captain Huang Xuemin simply understood the situation, immediately arranged the control point on duty police and helpers contact, asked to do a good job in escort.
"At that time, there were more than 1,000 vehicles entering the control section, and after contacting 120 emergency vehicles, it was expected that the time to arrive in Beichuan was about 15:00, and we immediately arranged the deployment."
Beichuan traffic police Yuli squadron leader Wei Wei introduced, emergency vehicles need to detour from Tangjiashanyan Lake Lake, and the road is steep and narrow, in order to prevent the vehicles that have entered the road in parallel, the traffic police one hour in advance of the road, the three points of the vehicle to implement segmentation control, and remind all passing drivers to open the road, for the emergency vehicle wrong.
Subsequently, the police of the Drum Squadron also temporarily stopped the vehicle from entering the control section and queued for 120 emergency vehicles to arrive.
At about 15 o'clock, a Sichuan U license plate ambulance drove into the territory of Beichuan, and the Beichuan traffic police sent a police car to drive the emergency vehicle all the way to the control section.
It is understood that some places around the lake road can only pass one car, the police in advance of the temporary control of these places, to ensure the smooth passage of 120 emergency vehicles.
When I arrived in Shilibei Village, Luping Township, there was a section of the road that could not be wrongly allowed, so the traffic police contacted the village committee in advance, borrowed the village road, and banned social vehicles from entering.
"From the Beichuan traffic police received 120 emergency vehicles to enter 302 provincial roads in only 40 minutes."
Wei Wei said that according to the normal situation, the entire passage time will take 4 hours.
"This arrangement, successfully for the patient to get valuable treatment time."
It is reported that at 17:20, critically ill patients were sent to Mianyang for treatment in time.

"My message to my party is, let's work together to find the best deal for Britain," May said.
Former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called May's plans "disordered" and slammed her for not having confidence in Brexit.
He and former Brexit Secretary David Davis are pushing for a Canadian-style free trade deal with the EU.
Mrs May said the proposal would allow Northern Ireland to enforce different tariff rules, which would be the result of a split from the United Kingdom.

To activate rural consumption, it is necessary to purify the market by normalizing the mechanism, guide healthy consumption demand, and improve the sense of gain in farmers' consumption.
Data show that the consumption potential of rural residents continued to release, in the first half of this year, rural consumer goods retail sales increased by 10.5%, the growth rate is 1.3 percentage points higher than that of urban towns.
In a poor village in the western county to visit, the whole village only a convenience store, into the store, some goods déjà vu, "golden dragon fish" marked "golden dragon oil", "Wangchai" became "Wang milk", "cottage" a lot of goods.
Over the years, similar phenomena have frequently been exposed, and some rural fake and inferior goods have brand names, similar names, similar packaging, and false confusion, which is invincible.
A consumer survey report released by a city in the west shows that rural businesses have serious problems with fake goods, with 66% of users buying fakes in township and offline supermarkets, of which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant departments to rectify the rural market, shouting year after year, why "Li ghost" is still fighting?
Unlike the urban market, farmers' awareness of rights protection is relatively weak, and many rural remote locations are in blind areas that cannot be trusted enough, so that fake and inferior commodities have a breeding ground.
A commodity long pipe, some departments manage prices, some management production, some management market, functional crossover, annual anti-counterfeiting, centralized governance of the wind, fakes dodged the breeze, and slowly emerged, just after the old fake, new fakes and came out.
Lack of long-term supervision mechanism, rural market is difficult to purify, low cost of illegality, large benefits, resulting in some illegal traders began to "down the mountain to the countryside" crooked, some rural areas become "waste market".
From food and clothing to well-off, the majority of farmers are moving towards development-oriented consumption.
A few days ago, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Several Opinions on Improving the Mechanism of Promoting the Consumption System to Further Stimulate the Consumption Potential of Residents", which proposes to promote the upgrading of rural residents' consumption ladders, with the aim of enabling the majority of farmers to "consume", "willing to consume" and "dare to consume", so that rural consumption can truly flourish.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen reform, eliminate the shortcomings of market supervision and multi-headed management, adapt to local conditions, improve the food safety and product quality supervision network, and constantly compress the space for rural counterfeiting and selling fake.
On the other hand, it is necessary to increase law enforcement efforts, open up the supervision of "capillaries", and never allow counterfeiting and shoddy to breed and spread in rural areas.
Severe punishment of pit farmers is to protect farmers, no matter how much hidden counterfeiters, should not become a reason for the breeding of fake and inferior goods, the relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, the grass-roots supervision force sinks, which link is a problem, we must be held accountable, so that counterfeiters and counterfeiters have nowhere to hide.
Strictly control the market access, implement strict qualification review for production operators, put the market circulation gate, let the product come to the right way, go to the road, from the source, the root to find a way, so that the legitimate distributors can operate with peace of mind, so that farmers can buy with confidence.
To activate rural consumption, it is necessary to guide healthy consumption demand.
With the upgrading of consumption, many farmers not only pursue to eat well and eat well, but also pursue high-quality life such as culture and health, and cannot equate the rural market with "low quality" and "cheap".
This requires promoting e-commerce to extend coverage to the vast number of rural areas, unblocking urban and rural two-way linkage sales channels, promoting the combination of offline industrial development platforms and online e-commerce trading platforms, and supporting the expansion of new consumption patterns to the rural market; promoting qualified townships to combine commercial logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc.; improve the rural modern circulation network system, optimize the integration of stock facilities, and effectively reduce rural circulation costs.
To create a clear and reassuring market environment for rural areas, so that farmers can consume more and more prosperous, in order to enhance the sense of farmers' consumption, happiness.

Lamb meat, yellow rice wine, buckwrate noodles, swallow noodles soft and other local snacks are often remembered in other towns.
With the continuous improvement of China's urbanization level, the urban population has increased rapidly, and a large number of rural young people have left their hometowns to start urban life.
Yang Qiaojia, a research expert on Chinese agricultural brands, said: "Now the pace of urban life is fast and the pressure is high, more and more people are beginning to miss the rural life as a child, but, 'the most beautiful memory is the countryside', the 'rural people' brand design is named after the countryside and nostalgia in the countryside."
The climate conditions of Huanxian County are special, the sunshine time is long, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the special small miscellaneous grain planting conditions are unique.
The territory is rich in more than 20 kinds of small grains, which is the hometown of small grains in China, and its output ranks first in Gansu, and the quality is at the forefront of the country.
Wang Xiaoli is in Tianjin to go to school in the ring county girl, this time as a volunteer to participate in the promotion meeting, she said: "home people most close, the taste of the hometown is the most beautiful, the 'ringer' brand has aroused our too much nostalgia, memories, remember is the food there, I hope the 'homeland people' brand goes farther and farther, the bigger and bigger."

Chaichun, secretary of the Huanxian County Party Committee, said that through the release of the "Rural People" brand, it can further improve the quality, standardization and large-scale innovation and development level of Huanxian's high-quality agricultural products, which is conducive to shaping the overall image of agricultural products in Huanxian County and rapidly improving visibility, competitiveness and added value.
Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) rose 0.2% in July from the previous month, a higher-than-expected increase, raising expectations that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If it does raise interest rates, it would be the central bank’s fifth rate hike in more than a year.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters had previously forecast growth of 0.1%.
Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 of the 20 industries are growing.
The reason for this is that the central bank predicted earlier this month that temporary factors may weigh on third-quarter GDP data.
Bank of Canada Governor Poroz on Thursday promised the central bank would continue to raise interest rates gradually and would keep a close eye on economic data.
The Bank of Canada’s next interest rate decision will be on October 24.
As the Canadian economy strengthens and unemployment nears record lows, the Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at Capital Economics, said that the third quarter of the country's economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 2%.
“This will be higher than the Bank of Canada’s expectation of 1.5%, and will be another reason to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month,” he said in a note.
The overnight index swap showed that the market's estimate of the Bank of Canada's rate hike in October rose from 76.46% to 78.27%.
The first joint visit of the Han River into the mouth of the Han River by the ROK in 65 years
The South Korean Ministry of National Defense confirmed on the 5th that the ROK and the DPRK launched a joint inspection of the waters of the Han and Linjin Rivers into the sea on the same day.
The initiative is in preparation for the free navigation of civilian vessels on both sides.
According to the notice provided to the media by the South Korean Ministry of National Defense on the same day, this is the first joint inspection of the Han River into the sea since the signing of the Korean War Armistice Agreement in 1953.
The ROK and the DPRK signed a military agreement in September this year, agreeing to jointly visit waters such as the Han River into the mouth of the sea from November to ensure environmental protection and development of the waters in the future.
In October, the two Koreas planned a joint study of the waters at a general-level meeting.
On November 5, the joint investigation of inter-Korean waters was officially launched.
The joint delegation consisted of 20 people from the ROK military and experts.
According to the South Korean Ministry of National Defense, during the visit, personnel from both sides did not carry weapons and prohibited the use of words and deeds that stimulated each other.
"Because there is no military demarcation line near the entrance to the sea, the area was once a high-incident area, but through joint inspection, the future here will become a new peace area."
The waters jointly visited by the ROK and the DPRK are about 70 kilometers long and have a total area of about 280 square kilometers.
According to the South Korean Ministry of National Defense, the South Korean side will send six research vessels to detect the depth of the seawater and so on, providing basic information for the safe navigation of the waters; after the completion of the investigation, it will provide navigation maps for the exchange of civilian ships.
The two Koreas held a summit meeting in Pyongyang in October 2007 to reach an agreement on jointly using the Han and Linjin rivers into the mouth of the sea, but subsequent negotiations were stranded due to tensions on the peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed by the two Koreas in September, in the future, ships of the two sides need to inform each other in advance before sailing in common waters.
