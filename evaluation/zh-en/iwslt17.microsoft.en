Well, I'm going to tell you a story about how we know what we know.
The story is about this woman, Natalia Lichenski.
She's a paleontologist, and her specialty is digging up old stuff everywhere.
Natalia Lichenski: "Yes, some people call me Dr. 'Dead Things.' "
I think she's particularly interesting because the places where she digs are in the high latitudes of the Arctic Circle, in the far reaches of Canada.
One day in the summer of 2006, she was at an archaeological excavation site called the Fars leaf bed, which was less than 10 degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole.
NR: "Seriously, that doesn't sound like much fun. "You've got to carry a bag all day, with a GPS navigator and a notebook," "You've been traveling long distances and picking up what might be fossils. ”
At one point, however, she noticed something.
"A rust-colored little thing,' about the size of the palm of my hand. “
And it lay on the ground. ”
Her first thought was that it was nothing more than a piece of wood, because this was something that had been found in the Fars leaf bed -- a prehistoric plant body.
But that night, back to the camp......
NR: “...... I pulled out my hand-held microscope and said, "I looked more closely, and I suddenly realized," 'This thing doesn't look like it has growth rings.' ”
"It's possible that it's because of the preservation," "But it really looks like ......"
"Bones. "
So over the next four years, she went back and forth to that location, and eventually collected 30 fragments, all from the same bone, many of which were very tiny.
"It's not a lot, actually. A small zip-lock bag will fit all the way. "
Then she tried to put the pieces together like a jigsaw puzzle.
But it's very challenging.
"It broke into a lot of tiny pieces," "We tried to restore it with sand and putty, but it looked terrible. "
"In the end, we used a 3D surface scanner. "
Wow! "Pretty handsome, right?"
In the end, it turned out that it was much easier to restore virtually.
"When they all come together, it's really magical. "
How sure are you that you put it right, just the way it is?
Is it possible that you spell it the other way, and finally spell it out...... A little parrot or something?
"Well, no. We've got it right. "
And she found out that she had put together a tibia, a calf bone, and that it came from a mammal of the order Artiodactyls, such as cows and sheep.
But this absolutely cannot be a cow or a sheep.
It's just too big.
"This thing is really too big. It's a huge animal. “
So what kind of animal will it be?
Now she had a bottleneck, so she showed a piece of it to some of her colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea.
"We used a little saw, and we scraped a little bit around the corners of the debris," "and then something really amazing came out of there. “
It smells a bit like burnt skin.
It's a smell that Natalia recognizes, and she smelled when she cut the skull in the gross anatomy lab, and that is collagen.
Collagen gives our bones their hardness.
Generally speaking, after so many years, it will naturally decompose.
In this case, however, the Arctic is preserved as a natural freezer.
A year or two later, Natalia went to a conference in Bristol, and she saw a colleague of hers, Mike Buckley, demonstrating a new technology that he called "collagen fingerprinting."
In fact, there are slight differences in the structure of different species of collagen, so if you have collagen information from an unknown bone, you can compare it with the collagen information of a known species, so who knows, maybe you've found a match.
So she sent Mike a piece of debris, with FedEx.
"Of course, you'll have to keep an eye on the delivery. It's important. ”
And then he processed the sample and compared it to 37 mammalian species that are known today.
A match was found!
And the final conclusion is that the 3.5-million-year-old bone that Natalia found in the high latitudes of the Arctic Circle came from .......
A camel.
"I was thinking, what are you kidding?" "If we're not mistaken, it's amazing. ”
So they tested a whole bunch of pieces and got the same results on each of them.
However, judging by the size of the bone that they found, that means the camel was 30 percent larger than a modern camel.
So this camel is about 2.7 meters tall, and it weighs a ton.
(exclaims) yes.
Natalia discovers an "Arctic camel".
Now when you hear the word "camel," you think of something like this: the Bactrian camel in East and Central Asia.
But it's more likely that the image in your mind is more like this: dromedary, the quintessential desert animal, that haunts hot desert areas, like the Middle East or the Sahara, with an oversized hump on its back that stores water for long journeys in the desert, and wide paws that help them tread through the dunes.
So how the hell did these guys get to the High Arctic Circle?
In fact, scientists have known for a long time, before Natalia's discovery, that camels first originated in the Americas.
(Music: The American National Anthem "Song of the Star-Spangled Banner") They originated here.
Of the 45 million years that camels have existed, 40 million years have been around you can only find them in North America, and there are 20 different species, maybe more.
"If we put them in a row, do they look different?"
"Yes, their bodies vary greatly in size. ”
"Some of them have particularly long necks," "so they function a lot like giraffes." “
Some also have long snouts, like crocodiles.
"They're very primitive, and some of the earliest ones are probably very small," "almost like a bunny." “
What? A camel the size of a rabbit?
"Some of the earliest ones are. ”
"You probably won't even recognize that. “
Oh my God, I want a "bunny camel" as a pet!
"I know, it's going to be great, right?"
And then, about 3 million to 7 million years ago, one branch of the camel migrated south to South America, where it evolved into llamas or alpacas, and another branch crossed the Bering land bridge to Asia and Africa.
Around the end of the last glacial period, the camel population in North America went extinct.
Well, scientists have known this for a long time, but that doesn't fully explain how Natalia found camels so far north.
Here, in terms of temperature, it's the opposite of the Sahara.
Truth be told, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius higher than it is now.
So it could be kind of a northern forest, kind of like the Yukon River Valley or Siberia today.
But they still have a six-month long winter, and all the ponds are frozen.
You will encounter a blizzard.
You will encounter 24 hours of continuous darkness.
Finally...... What the hell is going on?
How could these Sahara superstars survive in such freezing conditions?
Natalia and her colleagues felt they had found the answer.
And this answer is quite witty.
What if these characteristics of the camel were not developed to adapt to the conditions of the Sahara, as we think, but to survive the harsh winters?
What if those wide soles weren't meant to step over the dunes, but over the snow like snow boots?
And if those humps -- that's big news, and it's not water but fat, and the humps are actually used to get the camels through a six-month-long winter when food is scarce?
What if it wasn't until long after they crossed the land bridge that they adapted these winter traits to the hot desert environment?
For example, those humps might be good for camels in the heat, because when your fat is deposited in the same place, you know, like a fat backpack, it means that your body's insulation doesn't have to cover your whole body.
This makes it easier to dissipate heat.
It's this crazy idea that makes camels suddenly look like typical desert characteristics and evidence that they originated in the high latitudes of the North Pole.
Actually, I'm not the first person to tell this story.
Others have spoken about it as a way to marvel at the wonder of biological evolution, or as a glimpse into the future of climate change.
But I love this story for a different reason.
For me, it's a story about us, about how we perceive the world, about how that perception changes.
I am a historian by profession.
And what I've found is that a lot of scientists are also historians.
They make sense of the past.
They tell the history of the universe, the earth and its creatures.
As a historian, you have to have a train of thought in your head about how this story is going to go on.
"We make up stories, and then we go along the lines of thought," "It's like a camel in the desert, right?"
"It's a great story! Camels are simply perfect for the desert. ”
"Obviously, the camels have always lived there. “
But at any given moment, you may find small clues.
You may find little things that force you to reinvent everything you think you know.
Like this example, this scientist discovered this piece of debris, and she thought it was wood, and because of that discovery, the scientific community came up with a new, counterintuitive theory of why this strange, hairy-looking creature grew the way it is.
For me, it was a complete upend in the way I thought about camels.
It went from being a creature that existed only for this particular environment to being a globetrotter that just happened to be in the Sahara Desert, and could appear anywhere at any time.
This is Azul.
Hi Azuli!Are you okay?
Come, I've got something to eat for you.
Azulli has just finished her special show from Radio City Music Hall in New York.
This is no joke.
Whatever...... Seriously, Azulli is here as a vivid example of how the story of this world can change in a hurry.
We need to have the initiative to make bold changes and re-imagine.
Azulli, are you right?
Really, we're just a piece of bone away from a new perspective on the world.
Thank you.
Computers today are so amazing that we even lose sight of how bad they actually are.
Today I'm going to talk to you about this and how we can use neuroscience to solve it.
First of all, I'm going to take you back to a cold night in Harlem in 2011, which had a profound meaning for me.
I'm sitting in a bar next to Columbia University, where I'm majoring in computer science and neuroscience, and I'm having an interesting conversation with a classmate about the power of holographic photography, which is going to replace computers one day.
Just as our conversation was reaching its climax, as expected, his phone rang.
He picked up his phone, looked down and began typing.
And then he looked up at me from time to time and said, "Go on, I'll listen." ”
But it was clear that his eyes were not focused, and a wonderful moment was fleeting.
At the same time, on the other side of the bar, I noticed that another student was holding his phone, and this time there was a crowd in front of the screen.
He's looking through the Instagram photos, and the kids are laughing.
The contrast between them being so happy with the same technology and I being so frustrated immediately got me thinking.
And as I thought about it more and more, it became clear that the problem here was not electronic information, but simply the location of the information that separated me from my friends and brought these kids together.
It's clear that they're being connected to something, like our ancestors evolved their social cognition, like storytelling around a campfire.
In my opinion, that's exactly what tools should do.
They are supposed to extend our bodily functions.
I think today, computers are doing the exact opposite.
Whether you're sending an email to your wife, composing a music for a symphony, or just comforting a friend, you're pretty much doing so in the same way.
You bend over the blocks, playing around with the buttons and menus, and more blocks appear.
I think that's the wrong way, and I think we can start using a more natural machine.
The machines we use should be able to bring our work back to real life.
We should use machines that can use the principles of neuroscience to extend our senses, not limit them.
Now I have exactly one such machine here.
It's called Meta 2.
Let's try it.
Now I can see the audience, and I can see my hands.
And on the count of 3, 2, 1, we're going to see a holographic image appear, a very real hologram in front of me, in front of the glasses that I'm wearing.
And of course it can be anything that we're going to buy, or something that we're going to learn, and I can easily control the movement of it with my hands.
And I think Iron Man would be proud.
We'll be back later.
If you're like me, you're already thinking about what you can do with this technology, so let's take a look at some examples.
My mom was an architect, so naturally the first thing I imagined was to draw a three-dimensional building, not a floor plan with these plans.
In fact, she's now touching on the blueprints and trying to choose an interior décor.
These were captured by the GoPro in my glasses.
The next use case, which is very personal to me, is Professor Adam Godzere's Glass Brain project, thanks to the authorization of UCSF.
As a neuroscience major, I'm always amazed at the ability of a real machine to learn and memorize these complex brain structures, so that I can touch and fiddle with different brain structures.
Now what you're seeing is called augmented reality, but for me, it's just part of a much larger story -- about how we started to use digital devices to extend our bodies, not limit our bodily functions.
So—
In the next few years, humanity is going to go through a transformation, I think.
We're going to start overlaying a whole layer of digital information in the real world.
Take a moment to imagine what this means for storytellers, for painters, for brain surgeons, for interior decorators, and perhaps for all of us here today.
And I think what we have to do as a group is to really try and try to imagine how we can create this new reality, in a way that extends the human experience, rather than gamifying our reality, or mixing reality with digital information.
That's what I'm very interested in doing.
Now, I want to give you a little secret.
In about five years -- this won't be the smallest device -- in about five years, these will look like strip glasses placed in front of your eyes that can project holographic images.
In the same way that we don't care much about the hardware parameters of different phones -- which phone we buy is based on the operating system -- as a neuroscientist, I'm always looking to build a brain-based iOS, if I can.
It's very, very important that we make sure that it works, because these things probably don't stay with us any less time than we spend with the Windows graphical user interface.
I don't know about you, but living in Windows is a little scary to me.
In order to isolate the most intuitive interface to infinity, we use neuroscience to guide our design, rather than having a bunch of designers arguing in the design room.
The principle of our evolution is called the "Neural Pipeline of Least Resistance."
At every moment of change, we connect our brain's iOS system with our brain, the first time, with our brain language.
In other words, we're trying to create a computer with zero learning curve.
We're building a system that you've always known how to use.
These are the three earliest design guidelines that we used in this new form of user experience.
First, you are the operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract, and they make your brain have to go around a few more bends to decode them.
We are taking the opposite route to the "least resistance neural pipeline".
And at the same time, in augmented reality, you can certainly put your holographic TED display in here, put your holographic email on the other side of the table, and your spatial memory evolves just right to extract that information accurately.
You can put a hologram of Tesla that's shopping online -- or whatever pattern my legal team told me before I went on stage.
Well, your brains do know how to get back to reality.
The second interface guide is what we call "Contact Visual".
What do babies do when they see something they're interested in?
They will try to reach for it.
That's how natural machines work.
In fact, the visual system gets a very basic impulse, which we might call proprioception -- the feeling that parts of our body are in space.
By reaching directly with the people we work with, we not only control it better, but also understand it on a deeper level.
This is called "contact visibility".
But it's not enough for us to experience things on our own.
We are social primates.
This reminds me of our third guide, from our first story, "The Campfire of Holographic Photography":
Our mirrors -- neural subsystems -- show that we can better connect with each individual and our work if we can see a three-dimensional image of each person's face and hands.
So, if you look at the footage behind me, you can see that two Meta users are working on the same holographic image, making eye contact, focusing on the thing, rather than being distracted by an outside device.
Let's try again with the concept of neuroscience.
And once again, our favorite interface, iOS for Brain.
I'm going to take a step forward now, go to the front and grab the pair of glasses. And then it's on the table.
I'm in a moment with you right now, and we're connected.
My spatial memory is working, and I can go over and grab it and bring it back here to remind myself that I'm an operating system.
Now that my proprioception is working, I can go over and pop the glass into a thousand pieces, and then touch the sensor that is scanning my hand at this very moment.
But that's not enough, so soon, my co-founder, Ryan, will be making a 3D call to me -- Ryan?
Hi Ryan, how are you?
Guys, I can see this person in front of me in the form of a three-dimensional projection.
And his images are very realistic.
(Audience applauds) Thank you.
My mirror — the neural subsystem shows that this will be in the near future an alternative to the phone.
Ryan, how are you?
Ryan: I'm fine. We can finally demonstrate it live.
Ryan, give you a little gift from the holographic brain that we saw earlier in the video.
Guys, it's not just going to change the way we make calls, it's going to change the way we work together.
Thank you so much.
Thanks, Ryan.
Ryan: You're welcome.
MYRON GRIBEZ: Well, guys, here's what I found out in that bar in 2011: that the future of computers isn't locked inside these screens.
It's here, in our bodies.
So if I could leave you with one thought today, it would be that the natural machine is not just an imaginary of the future, it's here, in 2016.
That's why at Meta, hundreds of employees, executives, designers, engineers -- before TED2017, we're going to throw away our external display and replace it with a real and more natural machine.
Thank you so much.
(Audience applauds) Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question, and there's been a lot of holographic presentations in the last year.
Sometimes there's a debate in technology about whether we're actually seeing the real thing on the screen.
And that's one of the problems in this field, because in a way, technology is revealing a much broader perspective than what you can actually see with your glasses.
Did we just see the real effect?
Meron Gribez: Absolutely real.
Not only that, but we also used additional measurement technology to shoot with a GoPro with real lenses, and we got all the different short films that you see here.
We want to try to authenticate the experience of the world through what we see through our glasses, not just see parts.
CA: Thank you so much for showing us.
MG: Thank you very much.
I'm from Seattle, Washington, one of the most liberal, tolerant, and promising cities in the United States.
I grew up in a wonderful Seattle family.
My mother was an artist and my father was a university professor, and I am grateful for raising them, because I was able to plan my life the way I felt fit.
In reality, my choice was different from what my parents had in mind.
When I was 19 years old, I dropped out of college -- dropped out, or more accurately, was expelled.
I embarked on the path of becoming a professional French trumpeter, and that was my lifelong dream.
I've been performing chamber music all over the United States and Europe, and I've been touring for a couple of years, with a very good jazz guitarist, Charlie Bird.
When I was in my twenties, I was excited to join the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a life!
And my parents never complained,
They have supported me from beginning to end,
Even if that's not their dream.
They used to tell their neighbors and friends, "Our son is going to take a break for 10 years."
And there's an awkward conversation about my life that I want to share with you guys.
I was 27 years old, and I came home from Barcelona, and it was Christmas, and I came home to visit my parents, and I was helping my mother with dinner, and there were just the two of us in the kitchen.
She was silent, not saying a word.
I felt that something was wrong.
So I asked my mother, "Mom, what are you thinking?"
"Your dad and I are really worried about you," she said. ”
I was surprised: "What? What do you have to worry about now?"
She replied, "I want you to be honest with my question: Did you vote for the Republicans?"
The truth is, I don't have much interest in politics, I'm just a French trumpet player.
But I kind of understood, they sensed something, so they were a little confused.
I was a big fan of capitalism, and let me tell you why.
Believe it or not, it has its roots in my research on poverty.
When I was a kid in Seattle, I remember that was the first time I was exposed to real poverty.
My family belonged to the lower middle class, but it was certainly not really poor.
Not at all.
The first time I saw poverty was in the early '70s, when I was six or seven years old
Like many of us, this example is ordinary.
It was a drawing from National Geographic, a child about my age from a country in East Africa, with flies flying in his face and his belly swelling.
I know he can't make it, I know, and I can't do anything about it.
Some of you may remember a painting that wasn't necessarily exactly the same, but it was very similar.
It showed the Western world the unbearable poverty of the rest of the world.
That image lingered in my mind, as I grew up, went to school, dropped out, and started my own family.
I'm curious to know, what happened to that kid?
Or what happened to people like him in other parts of the world?
And I started looking at this question, and even though I was no longer in college, I was still looking for the answer: What happened to the poorest people in the world?
Is it getting worse, or is it getting better? What the hell is going on?
I finally found the answer and changed my life. I want to share it with you.
In fact, most Americans think that since they were children, from the time they saw it,
Poverty has become more severe. If you were to ask Americans, "Is the problem of poverty in the world getting worse or is it getting better?" 70 percent would say that hunger has gotten worse since the early '70s.
However, this is the case.
It was a moment that made me change my mind and gave me an epiphany.
Since 1970, the percentage of the world's hungry population who live on less than $1 a day has fallen by 80 percent after adjusting for inflation.
Since I was a kid, the percentage of the world's poorest people has decreased by 80 percent.
And I don't know that fact.
It's a miracle, my friends!
This is something to celebrate.
This is the greatest achievement in the fight against poverty in human history, and it happened in our lifetimes.
When I knew this fact, I thought, what makes it possible to get out of poverty?
Because if you don't know why, it's just a flash in the pan.
We're going to replicate that success, we're going to get the 200 million people who are still struggling with poverty out of the status quo, because that's what we've been talking about: the 2 billion poorest people, our brothers and sisters, have been lifted out of poverty since I was a child.
I want to save the remaining 2 billion people, so I have to know why.
I'm looking for answers,
It's not a political answer, because I don't care about a political answer.
Now, I still don't care.
I'm desperate to get the best answers from mainstream economists, on the left, on the right, and on the center.
below
I'll start with the specific reasons.
From childhood to the present, 2 billion people have been lifted out of poverty
There are five reasons for this. First: globalization
Second: free trade
Third: property rights
Fourth: the rule of law
Fifth: Entrepreneurship
These were the result of the free-market economic system that swept the world after 1970.
I'm not naïve.
I know that a free market economy isn't perfect, and I know that a free market economy doesn't meet all of our needs for a better world.
But it's great.
And it is beyond politics.
This is something I learned and had an epiphany.
Capitalism is not just the accumulation of capital
And what's great about it is that it's about ambition, and that's what a lot of people on this stage have talked about, it's ambition born of dreams, and it's rooted in the free market system.
We need to make this more people aware of this.
Now, I'm going to talk about my second epiphany, which has to do with the first one, which I believe will not only contribute to the development of the world, but also to the development of our country.
To paraphrase someone else's argument about lifting people out of poverty, it is: "The free market has created the most wealth in history."
and lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. ”
Whose quotes?
Like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
Wrong!
It's Oba President Ma!
Why do I remember so much?
Because he said it to me.
I can't think of it.
I was like, "Hallelujah!"
Not only that, but I said, "What a great opportunity. ”
Do you know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, we were doing an event at Georgetown University about what we were doing.
That's when I came up with a solution to the biggest problem facing America today. So what is it?
It's that both liberals and conservatives come together to talk about these ideas and help the people who need our help the most.
I don't have to say that everybody in this room knows that we're in crisis, in the United States and other countries around the world that are politically divided.
This issue is imminent.
This is worrying.
Last year, an article was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, one of the most influential and cutting-edge scientific journals in the West
It was a 2014 article on the asymmetry of political motivation.
What's that? Psychologists describe this phenomenon as assuming that your thoughts are based on love and that the other person's thoughts are based on hate.
This is very common in world disputes.
For example, between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this article found is that in the United States today, a large percentage of Republicans and Democrats are divided on political motivations.
Most of the politically active people in our country today think that they are driven by love, and the rest of us are driven by hate.
Think about it.
Most people always say, "My thinking is based on charity, and I want to help people, and the other part of people, they are evil, and they try to bring me down." ”
A society with such divisions cannot progress.
It's impossible.
How can we solve this problem?
First, let's be honest: there are differences.
We can't reduce the differences, because that's childish.
There is quite a bit of in-depth research on this.
My friend Jonathan Haight is a regular at TED.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
He studied the thoughts, values and morals of different people, and how they differed.
And he showed that conservatives and liberals have very different views on what they think is important.
For example, Jonathan Haight illustrates that liberals care more about poverty than about economic freedom by 59 percent.
And conservatives care about economic freedom 28 percent more than poverty.
Seems irreconcilable, right?
It's impossible for us to come together?
Our strength lies precisely in our differences.
Keep in mind what stopped poverty:
It's the obsession and concern for poverty, and the liberal economic order around the world.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people, we want to lift another 200 million people out of poverty.
There is no other way.
Well.
How do we do that?
It's a delicate thing, isn't it?
We need to think innovatively.
A lot of innovative ideas are on this stage.
Yes, those extraordinary social entrepreneurship.
We want to invest overseas, in a sustainable, responsible, and ethical way.
But do you know what we really need?
We need to open up new horizons of flexible thinking.
We need less "predictable",
Is that right?
Have you ever felt that your mind is starting to become predictable?
Starting to follow the rules?
Do you feel that you are always listening to people who agree with you?
Why is that dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, there are conservatives on one side, and it's always about taxes, rules, and big government.
And on the other side are the liberals, who talk about the economy always about income inequality.
Right? Those are important, important to me, important to you.
But when people who are starving need our help, it's just a distraction.
We should come together in the best way to reduce poverty as much as we can, only when conservatives realize that they need liberals to worry about poverty, and liberals need conservatives obsession with the free market.
We will succeed. It is only when we choose this path that this diversity will give birth to the great power of the country of the future.
How do we do that? How?
I have some advice for action, for you and for myself.
Code of Conduct 1: Remember that it is not good enough to tolerate the different opinions of others.
Far from enough.
We have to remember that we need people who disagree with us, because there is a group of people who need the help of all of us, and they are still waiting.
What are you going to do? How are you going to behave?
Where to start?
All of you here, we are all happy.
We have people who listen to us,
We're successful, and we have leadership.
When people hear ideas that we don't know about ideologies, maybe they'll listen to us.
Maybe that's where success begins.
That's the first point. Second.
And the second point: I'm asking you, and I'm asking myself, to be a specific individual who blurs the line, a vague, indefinable person.
If you're a conservative, be a conservative who talks about poverty a lot, and a fighter who insists on the moral obligation to fight for the poor.
If you're a liberal, be a liberal who always praises the charm of the free market that we run responsibly.
If we do that, two goals are just around the corner.
Number one: We're starting to work on helping the next billion people solve so many problems in the same way that we've done before, and we're going to solve many more problems in the future. This is something we can do.
The second is that we may be able to overcome this terrible ideological war that has caused us so much and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
Maybe then, just maybe, we'll find that what we call our differences aren't so irreconcilable.
Thank you!
When I was in college, I was a government major, which meant I had to write a lot of papers.
When an average student writes an essay, they might spread out the task like this.
So, you know, it might be a little slow at first, but after a week you've written a lot, and then sometimes you write a little bit more, and then it's all done, and things don't mess up.
I want to do that too.
At least that's what my plan is.
I was ready to start, but, in fact, when it came time to write my dissertation, I did.
And every time I write a paper, I do it.
Finally, when it came time to write a 90-page dissertation, a dissertation that should have taken a year to write.
I knew that for a paper like this, what I would normally do would not work.
The dissertation is a big project.
So I planned it, and I decided to do it.
That's how the year's work is arranged.
At first, a little less, a little more in the middle of the months, and finally the high gear goes all out like a little step.
How hard can it be to climb steps?
Not a big deal, right?
But then, something interesting happened.
Those first few months?
Came and went, I didn't do anything.
And so we have this great modification plan.
And then ...... And the last few months went by, and I barely wrote a few words, so it became like this.
And then from two months to another month, to two weeks.
And then one day I realized that there were only three days left before the deadline, and I hadn't written a word, so I did the only thing I could: I spent 72 hours writing 90 pages, two full days of work that people weren't supposed to stay up two nights in a row, walk through the campus at full speed, sneak in in slow motion, and turn in the paper before the deadline.
I thought that was the end of it.
And a week later, I got a phone call from the school.
They asked, "Are you Tim Erban?"
I said, "That's right."
They said, "We need to talk to you about the paper." ”
I replied, "Okay."
And he said, "This is one of the best papers we've ever seen. “
That didn't happen.
This paper is very, very badly written.
I just want to enjoy this moment when you all think, "This guy is awesome!"
No, that paper sucks.
Anyway, I'm a blog writer now.
I write blog posts for "Breaking the Casserole and Asking the End".
A few years ago I decided to write an article about procrastination.
My procrastination has always confused the people around me who don't procrastinate, so I wanted to explain to the people who don't procrastinate what the procrastinators are thinking in their heads, and why we procrastinators do the way they do.
My hypothesis is that the brains of procrastinators are different from those of non-procrastinators.
To prove it, I found an MRI lab that allowed me to scan my own brain and a brain that wasn't proven to be a procrastinator, and then I could compare the two brains.
Today I brought them all.
I hope that you will seriously compare whether there is any difference between the two.
I know you're not trained brain specialists, and it may not seem obvious, but let's take a look, shall we?
This is the brain of a person who does not procrastinate.
Right now
It's my brain.
There is a difference between the two.
In both brains, there's a rational decision-maker, but in the procrastinator's brain, there's a monkey called instant gratification.
What does this mean for procrastinators?
It means that everything is fine before this happens.
[There's never been a better time to get to work.] [Not really!] So when the rational decision-maker makes a rational decision and wants to do something productive, the monkey doesn't want to do it, so he takes the wheel and says, "Actually, let's read the Wikipedia scandal about Nancy Kerrigan/Tonny Jahardin, because I just remembered about it."
And then let's go to the fridge and look through the 10 minutes to see if there's anything new.
After that, let's go ahead and browse through the video sites, starting with Richard Feynman talking about magnetism, and going all the way to the interview with Justin Bieber's mom and the hell.
"It all takes time, so we can't find time on our schedules today.
I'm sorry!"
What's going on?
The instant gratification monkey doesn't seem to be the one you want him to put behind the wheel.
He lives completely in the moment.
He has no memories of the past, no knowledge of the future, he only cares about two things: simplicity and happiness.
In the animal world, that's fine.
If you're a dog, and you spend this life simply and happily, it's already a huge success!
And for monkeys, humans are a different kind of animal.
You sleep well, you eat well, you breed the next generation, and that might have been fine in the tribal era.
But, if you haven't noticed, we're not living in tribal times right now.
We're in an advanced civilization, and monkeys don't understand what that is.
That's why we have another guy in our heads, the rational decision-maker, who gives us the ability to do things that other animals can't.
We can foresee the future.
We can look at the big picture.
We can think long-term.
And he wants to take it all into account.
He wants us to do anything worth doing now.
Sometimes it makes sense to do something simple and happy, like eating, sleeping, or having the leisure time you deserve.
That's why there's an overlap between instant gratification monkeys and rational decision-makers.
Sometimes they agree.
But sometimes, it's more rewarding to do things that are harder and less enjoyable, and that's for the big picture.
At this point, there will be a conflict between the two.
For the procrastinator, every conflict ends in this way, which is that he spends a lot of time in the orange zone, which is the simple, happy, but meaningless zone.
I call this area the Dark Playground.
The dark playground is a place that all procrastinators know well.
It's a place for leisure and entertainment when it's not supposed to be.
Happiness in the dark playground isn't actually happiness, because it's completely unearned, and it brings guilt, fear, anxiety, self-hatred, which is what all procrastinators feel.
And the question is, in this case, with the monkey at the wheel, how can the procrastinator take him to the blue zone, which is not so comfortable, but there are a lot of important things to do.
In fact, the procrastinator has a guardian angel who always looks down on him and watches over him, and in those darkest moments it is called the Panic Monster.
The Panic Monster hibernates most of the time, but it wakes up suddenly when the deadline is near, or when it's in danger of making a fool of itself in public, or when it's facing a career disaster, or when there's some other terrible consequence.
And importantly, he's the only thing the monkey is afraid of.
Panic monsters have become quite important in my life lately, because the TED staff contacted me six months ago and asked me to give a talk.
Of course, I agreed.
I've always dreamed of being able to do a TED talk.
But in the midst of this excitement, rational decision-makers seem to be thinking about something else.
He'll say, "Do we know what we just promised?
Do we have the capacity we need now to accomplish that task in the future?
We had to sit down and get to work. ”
And the monkey said, "Absolutely, but let's turn on Google Earth and push the camera 200 feet into India, and then spend two and a half hours scrolling up to the surface of this country to get a better feel for India." “
That's what I did that day.
When six months became four months, then two months, then one month, TED staff started publishing speakers.
I opened the website and saw my face staring at myself.
Guess who's awake at this time?
And then the panic monster went crazy, and after a few seconds, the whole system was in chaos.
And the monkey, remember? He was scared of the panic monster, and with a bang, he climbed up the tree!
And so finally, rational decision-makers can finally take the wheel, and I can start preparing for this talk.
In the eyes of the panic monster, all that pretty stupid procrastination -- for people like me who spent two weeks not being able to start writing the opening sentence of a paper, and then miraculously had an incredible enthusiasm to work and stayed up all night writing eight pages.
And that whole thing, plus those three roles, is the system of procrastinators.
It's not pretty, but at least it's useful.
This is something I decided to write about in my blog a few years ago.
After the release, I was blown away by the response I received.
I've received thousands of emails from people from all over the world who are doing all sorts of different things.
There are nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and many, many Ph.D. students.
The content is basically the same: "I have this problem too. ”
But what struck me was the contrast, the light-hearted tone of the posts and the heavy tone of the emails.
These people have a strong sense of frustration because procrastination affects their lives, because the monkeys control their thoughts.
After thinking about it, my question is, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on?
Why do all these people have such a dark corner?
As a result, I found out that there were two kinds of procrastination.
And the examples that I've talked about today, all of which have deadlines.
When there is a deadline, the effect of procrastination is limited to a shorter deadline because the panic monster will step in.
But for the second type of procrastination, it happens when there is no deadline.
For example, if you want to start your own business or work in the arts, there's no deadline at first, because nothing is going to happen until you start working it, and there's no impetus to keep things going.
There's no deadline for important things other than your career, like visiting your family, or exercising to keep your body healthy, trying to improve your relationship, or leaving an unhappy relationship.
If the procrastinator does these difficult things with only one mechanic, which is the Panic Monster, then the problem is that in these situations where there is no deadline, the Panic Monster simply doesn't show up.
He doesn't need to wake up when the consequences of procrastination are unlimited, they just postpone indefinitely.
And this kind of long-term procrastination is less obvious and less talked about than the more interesting, shorter, deadline-based kind of procrastination.
It usually affects us quietly, quietly.
It can be a source of a lot of chronic unhappiness, guilt.
And I think that's why those people are sending emails, and that's why they're in such a bad situation.
It's not because they're rushing for a project,
It's this long procrastination that makes them feel like they're just a bystander in their own lives at times.
Their frustration is not because they can't achieve their dreams, it's because they can't even start chasing their dreams.
So after reading these emails, I came to realize that I don't think there's anyone who doesn't procrastinate.
That's right, I think we're all procrastinators.
You may not be like us, you're a mess in every way, and maybe some people can deal with deadlines very well, but remember: the monkey's most despicable trick is that there's no deadline.
Now I want to give you one last thing to see.
I call it the Life Calendar.
Let's say a person can live to be 90 years old, and every week is a grid.
Not a lot of grids, especially since we've lived for so many years.
And I think we all need to take a moment to take a hard look at this life calendar.
We need to think hard about what we're really procrastinating, because everybody is procrastinating on something.
We have to be aware of the existence of this monkey of instant gratification.
This is what we should all do.
And because there aren't many lattices, maybe the work should start today.
Well, maybe not today, but ...
You know.
In the near future.
Thank you.
We're right there. Souls and bodies huddled together in a church in Texas, and it was the last night of our lives.
It's like this room now, except that it's all creaking wooden benches, with strips of tattered red cloth, the organ on my left, the choir behind me, and a baptismal font on the wall at the back.
All in all like this room.
The same strong sense of suspense, the same deep desire for redemption, the same sour sweat in the palms, and the same group of absent-minded people in the back row.
It was December 31, 1999, and that night, as far as I know, Christ came to earth and the world was coming to an end.
I was 12 years old, and I was old enough to be responsible.
I realized how unfair it was for Jesus to come back at this time, and I was taking responsibility for what I had done before. But when I stopped complaining, I thought I'd better get my house in order.
I go to church as often as I can.
I was afraid of the silence around me, like a man is afraid of noise, just to make sure that God didn't play tricks on me, and to come back early and leave me behind.
But in case he did come early, I had a backup plan, which I read about in the popular book "Doomsday."
I see in the text that if it's past midnight revelry, and I'm not taken away, I'll have one more chance.
I just need not to be called a heretic, to defeat demons, to overcome the plague, and to defeat the Antichrist.
It's going to be hard -- but I'm sure I can do it.
But the time to prepare is long overdue.
It's already 11:50 p.m.
We had 10 minutes left, and the pastor told us to get up from the bench and go to the altar below, because he wanted us to pray together at midnight.
So the congregation divided into groups and arrived at the designated location.
The choir was still on the small stage, and the church deacons and their wives -- I prefer to call them "Baptist bourgeoisie" sat down in the first row in front of the altar.
You know, in the United States, even Adventist Night has VIP seats.
And just behind the Baptist bourgeoisie are the older generation -- men and women, young backs, bent by the blazing sun in the cotton fields of East Texas, whose faces are burned as noble brown, like the clay of East Texas, whose fantasies and dreams about life and the world outside of East Texas, sometimes more broken than their backs.
Yes - these men and women are my idols and stars.
They've waited all their lives for this moment, just like their medieval forefathers who longed for the end of the world, just like my grandmother longed for the Oprah talk show, which aired every day at four o'clock on Channel 8.
As she walked towards the altar, I slipped behind her, because I was so sure that my grandmother was going to heaven.
I thought that if I had held her hand tightly during this prayer, I might have walked with her.
So I grabbed it, I closed my eyes, I listened, I waited.
The prayer was louder.
The cries of prayer are also louder.
The organ sounded, intertwined with the sound of an elegy.
The heat wave swept in, and the sweat in the palms of the hands became even more sour.
My hands clenched tighter, I didn't want to be forsaken by God.
My eyes closed even tighter, and I didn't want to see the essence taken away and the dross dropped.
Suddenly, a voice echoed overhead: "Amen. ”
It's over.
I'll look at the bell.
It's past midnight.
I watched the elders, whose savior had not come, who were so proud that they didn't show even the slightest bit of loss, who had believed too deeply, for too long, and who doubted it too late.
But I'm angry for them.
They were fooled, they were deceived, they were deceived, and yet I was deceived with them.
I did the prayers they did, and I tried to resist the desires of my heart.
Not once, but twice, I fell headlong into that cold-chilling baptismal pool.
I had believed it.
Now what?
I went home and turned on the TV, just in time for Peter Jennings to announce the new millennium, and the whole world was celebrating the new year.
It dawned on me, no matter how strange I thought, that Jesus was coming again and again, just because the time zones were different.
It made me feel even more uncomfortable, it hurt, really.
But that night, I didn't stop believing.
I just believed in another thing: "It's possible not to believe."
It's possible that all the answers that I know are wrong, and it's possible that the question itself is wrong.
Now, the mountain that once stood the mountain of faith, There is a spring that flows all the way to the foot of the mountain, A clear spring of doubt, which is destined to become a great river.
All the dramatic stories of my life can be traced back to the night in church, when my savior did not come, and what I am so sure of, if not called a lie, is not at least the truth.
While most of you are welcoming the millennium in very different ways, I believe you're here because some of you have done the same things that I did, after the beginning of the new century, after my mother died, after my father ran away from home, after my Savior didn't come.
I stretched out my hands, searching for something to believe.
When I came to Yale when I was 18 years old, I searched, and I believed that all the way from a small town in Texas, I would have a chance to get rid of all the hardships and hardships that I had been through, from all those broken dreams, from my disabled body.
But when I came back home during the winter break, with my head on the ground, my hands tied behind my back, and the bandits' pistols against my head, I knew that even the best education wouldn't save me.
When I interned at Lehman Brothers in 2008, I was searching.
Hopeful -- I excitedly called my family and said we would never be poor again.
But when I watched the temple of finance crumble before my eyes, I knew that even the best jobs wouldn't save me.
When I went to Washington, D.C., as a young journalist, and I searched, I heard a voice from Illinois: "It's been too long," "but this election is going to change America." ”
But when parliament came to a complete standstill, when the country was all but falling apart, and when hope and change turned into a cruel joke, I knew that even the new birth of politics would not save me.
I knelt down at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the great men of our time, praying for success, praying for money, praying for power.
But every time, when the clock struck midnight, I opened my eyes and saw that all these myths were dead.
From this grave, I began to search again, not because I was brave, but because I knew that if I had not faithd, I would have died.
So I went on a pilgrimage to another holy place, Harvard Business School -- and this time, I knew that I couldn't simply accept the salvation that the college was offering.
No, I know I have more to do.
It all started in a dark corner of a crowded party, late one night in the middle of a brutal early winter in Massachusetts, and three friends and I asked a question, and some of the young people who really wanted to ask for a long time were, "How about we go out on a road trip?"
We didn't know where or how we were going, but we knew we had to go.
Because what we've been longing for all our lives, as Jack Kerouac wrote: "Dive into the endless darkness of the night, and disappear into the distant sky." Go out and see what people all over the country are doing.
So even though there was opposition that we had taken too much risk and that we had nothing to gain, we set off.
In the summer of 2013, we traveled 13,000 kilometers across the United States, walking through the cow ranches of Montana, walking through the abandoned city of Detroit, walking through the swampy wetlands of New Orleans, and we found people there who worked for them, who started small businesses, who had a goal as the bottom line.
After studying at the "capitalist West Point" military academy, we found this idea to be revolutionary.
The idea spread and eventually grew into a non-profit organization called "Master of Business Management Across the United States," and that's the main reason I'm on stage today.
And it's spread because we've found in this generation a strong desire to achieve goals, to live worth.
It's spreading because we've found millions of entrepreneurs in the corners of America who are creating jobs, making a difference in people's lives, and they need a little bit of help.
But to be honest, it spreads, and because I'm desperate to get it. In order to spread this gospel,
There's nothing I don't do, in order to convince more people that we can heal the wounds of this broken country, by small businesses.
But it was this process of evangelism that led me to a different gospel that I'm going to share with you today.
One evening about a year ago, we were at the Museum of Natural Sciences in New York for an alumni dinner at Harvard Business School.
Underneath a full-size model of a whale, I sat side by side with the giants of our time, singing the praises of their companions and their causes.
There was a lot of pride in the room, and the combined assets of these people were more than 500 billion dollars.
We look down on all creation and think it's good.
And so it happened, and two days later, I went to Harlem, New York, and I was sitting on an urban farm in an abandoned parking lot, and I listened to a guy named Tony talk about the kids, and they would go there every day.
All of them are below the poverty line.
A lot of people put all their belongings in their backpacks for fear that someone else might steal them from the shelter.
Some people came to Tony's farm, called "Harlem Growth," to get their only meal a day.
Tony told me that he started Harlem Growth on his own pension, and he worked as a taxi driver for 20 years.
He said he didn't keep a penny for himself because, while the project was a success, resources were scarce.
He said that he would accept any help he could find.
And I'm here to help him.
But when I left Tony, I felt a sting in my heart and tears wet the corners of my eyes.
I felt the weight of enlightenment, and one night I could sit in a room and talk to hundreds of people worth 500 billion dollars about the world, but two days later in another room, 50 blocks away, a man with no salary was providing the only meal a day for his children.
But it's not this glaring social inequality that brings tears to my eyes, it's not these hungry, homeless kids, it's not anger at the 1 percent, it's not pity for the 99 percent.
No, I can't be at peace because I finally realized that this country needs a radical change, and I'm just making small fixes.
I realized that my story represented a group of people who wanted to be self-reliant, even if they were poor, and that my organization represented all the basic, systematic help, but never got to Harlem, or the Appalachian Mountains, or the Lower Nine of New Orleans, and my cries represented voices, voices that sounded unsubstantial, unembellished, out of place.
And this shame, this shame washed away me, like the shame of sitting in front of the TV at that time, watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, over and over again, over and over again.
I was fooled, I was deceived, I was deluded,
But this time, the hypocritical savior is myself.
You know, I came all the way from that altar, and that night I felt like the world was going to be destroyed, and I came from a town in all tongues, thinking that suffering was God's gift to mankind, and that I took it as a creed, as an eternal truth.
Yes, my journey was so long that I went all the way back to square one.
Because we can't simply generalize and say that there is no faith in this era. No, we're believing in something, as much as ever.
Some people may believe the prophecies of Brynn Brown or Tony Robbins. We might believe the New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review motto.
We may believe in what we worship in TED church, but we want to believe so badly, we need to believe.
We emulate the rhetoric and demeanor of charismatic leaders who promise to solve all of humanity's problems.
We feel that suffering is a gift from the capitalist "God," and that we take technological development as an article of faith, as an eternal truth.
But we never realized the human price we were paying, and we didn't question a brick, because we were afraid that the whole building would collapse.
But if you're upset about the things that we're used to doing things that don't go against the law, the time for questioning is coming.
So I'm not preaching the gospel of breakthroughs, innovations, or sustainability.
I don't even have the gospel of faith to share with you.
The only thing I have is the gospel of questioning.
The Gospel of Questioning is not to stop you from believing, it asks you to believe something new: "It is possible not to believe. ”
It's possible that all the answers that we know are wrong, and it's very likely that the questions themselves are wrong.
Yes, questioning the gospel may mean that our existence, on this stage, in this room, is all wrong.
Because it begs the question: "Why?"
We have so much power at our hands, why are people still in dire straits?
This skepticism led me to make a decision that the organization that I founded, "Master of Business Management Travels All Over the United States," was going to cease operations.
We've disbanded our staff, we've closed our doors, and we've opened up this model to everybody, as long as they feel they're capable of doing it, without our approval.
This kind of questioning forced me to take off the "savior" hat that someone else had put on my head, because our lives were too short and our odds were too low to wait for Christ's return, and the truth is, there are no miracles in this world.
And this questioning, which drives me, gives me hope, when difficulties are about to crush us, when the path of fate seems to lead us astray, when our savior cannot heal the wounds, it is not our blind faith, but our simple questioning, that will shed a little light into the darkness of our lives and the world. Let's whisper,
It's okay to shout, or to put it simply, it's very simple to say, "Surely, there's another way." ”
Thank you.
Food crisis.
Featured in the Daily News.
What is that?
There are parts of the world where food is too scarce, and there are places where food is abundant.
In some places, genetically modified foods have saved the world.
Maybe genetically modified foods are a problem?
Too much genetically modified agricultural wastewater creates polluted oceans, toxic seawater, and nutrient-thin.
And so on and so forth.
I find the discussion today to be so influential.
How do we make this discussion understandable?
What about the apple food crisis?
I'm sure that in the past week, each of you has eaten an apple.
How long do you think it took for an apple to reach your hands from picking?
Fortnight?
Two months?
11 months -- that's the average time it takes for an apple to be sold in a U.S. store.
I think it's about the same in Europe, it's about the same in the world.
We pick apples, we keep them refrigerated, we put oxygen into the freezers -- in fact, there are documented cases of workers trying to get an apple back and then die because it's in a cold storage environment, and the air in the cold storage is toxic to people.
Why doesn't any of you know about this?
Why didn't I know about it?
Ninety percent of the nutrients in apples -- all the antioxidants in apples -- were lost when we bought them.
It's just a small candy.
Why don't we know about these messages? What can be done to improve this situation?
I think we're missing a platform.
I know the platform -- I use computers, and I've been on the web since I was very young.
I've done a lot of really weird things -- on platforms like this.
But I also met other people, and I was able to express my thoughts.
What do you think about food?
If we had a platform, we might find the question very advantageous "What if?"
I would like to ask: What if the climate was democratic?
This is a map of the global climate.
The most efficient agricultural production areas are green, and the worst are red.
They're going to be changing, they're going to change, and the farmers in California are now the farmers in Mexico.
China gets the land in Brazil to grow better food, and we're all slaves to the environment.
What if each country had its own climate suitable for production?
How will that change our lives?
How will that change the quality of our lives and nutrition?
The problem that the last generation had was, that we needed more food and that it was cheaper.
Welcome to World Farms.
We built a huge simulated farm.
These lines -- are cars, planes, trains, cars.
It's a miracle to be able to provide enough food to 7 billion people, with very few people involved in the food making process.
But what if...
Let's build a digital farm?
Digitized World Farm.
And if you could take this apple, in a way, digitize it, transport it through the particles in the air, and then reassemble the particles on the other side?
If?
If you look at these quotes, you know, they encouraged me to do that.
Article 1: "There are no young people, no water, no land, and no future in Japanese agriculture. This was the day I arrived in Minamisanriku, one station further south of Fukushima, after the nuclear accident.
The children all went to Sendai and Tokyo, the land was contaminated by the nuclear power plant accident, and they imported 70% of their food.
But this is not a phenomenon unique to Japan.
Only 2% of the population of Americans work in agriculture-related jobs.
Two percent of the population is engaged in agriculture, and what answer does it give us?
If we look at the rest of the world, 50 percent of Africa's population is under the age of 18.
80% of them are reluctant to become farmers.
Farming is too hard.
Smallholder life is too hard.
They choose to go to the city.
In India: Farmers' families do not have access to the most basic farm implements, and more farmers commit suicide than in the last 10 years.
It's so sad to talk about that.
Where are they going?
to the city.
There are no young people, and young people are going to the cities.
So what kind of platform do we need to build to encourage young people?
Take a look at this new tractor.
This is my combine.
A few years ago, I went to a home chain and started looking for tools.
I've made stupid things, I've made plants dance, I've connected them to my computer, and I've destroyed them -- a lot.
I ended up keeping them alive.
I've created one of the most intimate relationships I've ever had in my life, because I've learned the language of plants the most.
I want them to grow bigger.
They said, "Son, go all out!"
This is an electronic studio that no one uses.
What can you do?"
And together with the team, we set up a farm in the Media Lab, a place that used to be thought to be about digital life rather than biology.
In this 60-square-meter space, we made enough food for about 300 people for a month -- not too much.
There's a lot of interesting tech here.
The most interesting?
Beautiful, white rhizomes, dark green plants are harvested once a month.
Is this a new style restaurant?
Is this a modern sales experience?
Is this a modern store?
What I know for sure is that for the first time in a media lab, you can uproot any plant.
We put the salad in bags; there's nothing wrong with that.
But what happens when you have an image processing guy, a data scientist, a roboticist, uprooting a plant and thinking, "Well, I know about -- I can make this happen, I want to give it a try. ”
And throughout the process, we're going to take the plants out and we're going to take some of them back to the lab, because if you had grown them, you wouldn't throw them away, because they're precious to you.
I have this weird tongue right now, because I don't want anybody to eat them before me, I want it to be delicious.
I eat lettuce every day and I can tell that lettuce has a pH of less than 1
I'm like, "No, that's 6.1 -- no, no, you can't eat it today." ”
This lettuce was very sweet that day.
That's because lettuce feels a lot of pressure, and it produces its own chemistry to protect itself: "I don't want to die!"
The taste of the plant that doesn't want to die tastes sweet.
Scientists are back to studying plant physiology.
I think everybody can try to participate.
We were looking forward to seeing what you were doing, so we envisioned a lab that could be shipped somewhere else.
Make such an idea.
In front of this media experiment building is my lab, and each plant has 30 sensing points.
If you know genomics or genetics, that's the phenome, right?
Phenotypic group presentations.
And when you say, "I like strawberries in Mexico," what you really like is the strawberries that are produced in those climates.
You can code the climate -- how much carbon dioxide, how much oxygen, and you can create recipes -- and you can program the state of the plant, and the nutrient content, the size, shape, color and texture of the plant.
We need data, so we put a lot of sensors to give us data.
You can think about the plants in your house, and you look at the plants in your house and you're sad because you think, "Why did you die? Will you talk to me?"
Farmers have the most beautiful eyes to see the future, and when they're in their sixties and seventies.
They can tell you that the plant is dying because the soil is lacking in nitrogen, because it is lacking in calcium, or because it needs more humid air.
These beautiful eyes don't go down.
These are the eyes of the peasant.
We collect data on an ongoing basis.
We combine these data points with individual plants.
These are the IP addresses of all the cauliflower in my lab that day.
We have cauliflower with traceable IP addresses.
And if that's not weird enough, you can click here to see the plant archive.
And this shows you how the plant grows in a downloadable way, not just as you think, and not just notifies you when it's edible.
When will its nutrients meet my needs?
When will it taste as I expected?
Is there too much moisture?
Is it too long in the sun?
will prompt.
It's able to talk to me, it can communicate, we can talk to each other.
I guess that's the first plant Facebook user, right?
That's when the archives of the plants will start to make friends.
And I mean really -- plants are starting to make friends with plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium.
We're going to start to understand the complex things that are now just guesses.
They may not be friendly with us -- I don't know, but maybe they will be friendly with us, depending on our behavior.
This is my current lab.
It's a little bit more systematic, and my background is designing data centers for hospitals, and I know how to create a controlled environment.
And so -- in this environment, we experiment with all sorts of things.
This program, the air plantation method, was developed by NASA for the Mill space station to reduce the amount of water that they need to send into space.
What this app does is give the plants exactly what they want. water, minerals and oxygen.
The roots are not that complicated, and when you deliver these to them, you can see amazing results.
Plants have two hearts.
Because it has two hearts, it grows 4-5 times.
It's a perfect world.
We've been through a long period of technological development, and we've been looking for a different world, and we're going to continue to do that, but we're also going to have new tools, and it's going to be a perfect world.
We grow all sorts of things.
These tomatoes have not been commercially produced for the past 150 years.
Did you know that we have rare, old-fashioned seed banks?
Seed Banking.
It's amazing.
They have live germplasm that you haven't eaten before.
I'm the only one in this room who has eaten this tomato.
The problem is, it's a sauce tomato, and we don't know how to cook it, so we don't think the sauce tomatoes are delicious.
But we've grown all sorts of protein-containing things.
We've planted humans -- maybe you can, but we can't.
We realized that the tools were too big and too expensive.
I started placing them all over the world worth about 100,000 dollars.
It's not easy to find someone who can spend $100,000 at will, so we want to make small tools.
This is actually a project of one of my students -- Camille, an undergraduate in mechanical engineering
Camille and I, and my team, spent the whole summer experimenting with how to make it cheaper, how to work better, how to make it workable.
And then we send these tools to schools to kids in grades 7 to 11.
If you want to be humble, try to teach your child what to do.
And I went to this school and said, "Set it at 65 percent."
A child in Year 7 asked, "What humidity?"
So I said, "Oh, it's water in the air." ”
He said, "There's no water in the air, you idiot." ”
So I said, "Okay, don't believe me.
In fact -- don't believe me, do you?
Set it to 100.
He set the humidity to 100, what happened?
It starts to condense, it creates a mist, and eventually it starts to drip.
Then he said, "Oh, the humidity is rain.
Why didn't you tell me that before?"
We created an interface that looks like a game.
They have a 3D environment, the ability to log in from anywhere in the world from a mobile phone, on a computer.
There are different parts of the program -- physical adjustments, sensors.
They chose recipes that children in other parts of the world had already created.
They select and activate the recipes, plant the seeds.
When the seed grows, the children can make changes.
They said, "Why do plants need carbon dioxide?" Isn't carbon dioxide a bad thing?
It's suffocating. ”
Raise the supply of carbon dioxide, and the plant dies.
Reducing the amount of carbon dioxide, plants live well.
Harvesting the plants, you create new e-recipes.
It's an iterative process of design and development and exploration.
They can download all the data for the new plant that they've developed, or the new e-recipe and what does it do -- is it better or worse?
Imagine that these are the core elements of processing.
We can learn a lot.
It's a thing we call a food computer, and it's been in a school for three weeks.
This is a three-week planting.
What's more, for the first time, this kid thinks he can be a farmer -- or that he wants to be a farmer.
So we're making those resources public.
It's all online, go home, try to build your first food computer.
It's going to be hard -- I'm telling you this.
We're in the beginning, but the resources are there.
It's very important to me to make these things accessible.
We will continue to do the same.
These are farmers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, botanists, economists, urban planners.
On one platform, do what they are good at.
The team has become too big.
This is my new lab equipment that is up and running.
This warehouse can be built anywhere.
That's why I chose it.
In this warehouse, we're going to build shelves like this.
You can see it now.
Take a look at this,
This also exists.
One grows green vegetables, and the other grows Ebola vaccine.
And what's great is that the plants and this Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency winning project are what makes our research on the Ebola virus so productive.
These plants are producing proteins that fight the Ebola virus.
So medicines and health supplements, to lettuce growing.
But those two things look completely different, and that's my part of my own field.
But many things are not what they seem.
We're still in the "We're right" phase where it's like, "This is my little black box -- No, buy mine." ”
"No, no, no -- my intellectual property is absolutely valuable.
Don't buy this, buy mine. ”
The fact is, we're just in the beginning, and society is changing.
When we want more, cheaper food, we now need better, environmentally friendly food.
But you see that McDonald's advertising the ingredients of Chicken McNuggets, the most mysterious food in human history -- McDonald's marketing campaign is changing -- everything is changing.
Now look at the world today.
Personal food computers, food servers, food data centers, operate in public phenotyping groups.
It's like opening up the genome, but we're going to put together a little climate recipe, like Wikipedia, where you can overturn it, start it, and plant it.
How does this look?
Do you remember that the world is connected by strings?
Bacon is starting to appear.
We started sending out information about the food, not distributing the food.
It's not just my fantasy, it's something we're already working on.
Food computers, food servers, and soon food data centers, are connecting people together to share information.
The future of food is not its wrong struggle,
We all know where the fault is.
The food of the future is about connecting the next billion farmers and empowering them with a Q&A platform, "What if?"
Thank you.
There are times when I'm very ashamed to be a European
In the last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our reaction, frankly, has been very sad
There are too many contradictions here
We mourn the tragic death of a two-year-old boy, Alan Cody, and yet since then, more than 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean
We have international conventions that recognize that accepting refugees is a shared responsibility of all countries, and yet we accept more Syrians in small Lebanon than in all of Europe
We denounce human smuggling, and yet we make it the only viable way to seek asylum in Europe
We're short of labor, and yet we're preventing people who can meet our economic and demographic needs from entering Europe
We claim that our liberal values are the opposite of what the fundamentalists of Islam live by, and yet -- we use heavy-handed policies to detain child asylum seekers, to separate children from their families, to forcibly confiscate refugee property
What we're doing
And how it's come to this point that we're responding to a humanitarian crisis in an inhumane way
I don't believe it because people don't care, at least I don't want to believe it
And I think it's due to the lack of vision on the part of our politicians on how to adapt to what was proposed 50 years ago in response to a changing and globalized world
The International Refugee System, so what I want to do is take a step back and ask two very fundamental questions that we all have to be aware of
First of all, why the existing system doesn't work
Secondly, how do we solve it
The modern refugee system was developed after World War II by these people
It's meant to make sure that when a country collapses, or worse, the regime is hostile to its people, those people have a place to go and live in safety and dignity until they can go back home
This is exactly what we see in Syria today
Through the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, signed by 147 governments, and an international organization, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has committed itself to allowing other nationals to enter their territory to escape war, strife, and persecution
But now the system is collapsing
Theoretically, refugees have the right to seek asylum
The reality is that our immigration policies are blocking this path to safety
Theoretically, refugees have the right to seek equal treatment or the right to choose to return to their home country
But in practice, they're stuck in a state of stagnation that is almost indefinite
Theoretically, the refugee problem is the responsibility of all States
In practice, geography means that countries in close proximity to conflict are overloaded with the vast majority of refugees
The provisions of the old refugee system were not the cause of its collapse
It's that we're not using it enough as the world changes, and that's something we need to reconsider
So I'd like to explain to you how the system works today
How does the current refugee reception system work?
But it's not from a top-down macro perspective, it's from the perspective of individual refugees
So imagine a Syrian woman
Let's call her Amira
Amira represents the many refugees I have met in the region
Amira, like about a quarter of the world's refugees, is a woman with a child, and she can't go home because her city, the city of Homs, which you see now, is now devastated by the beautiful and historic city
So Amira couldn't go back
At the same time, Amira has no hope of rehousing in a third country, because that would be like winning the lottery, and less than one percent of the world's refugees will have access to it
So Amira and her family were faced with an almost impossible choice
They have three basic options
The first is that Amira can take her family to the refugee camp
In the camp, she might be helped, but for Amira and her family, the prospects are very slim
The camp is located in a desolate and barren place, usually in the middle of a desert
In the Zatalina camp in Jordan, you can hear shells across the Syrian border at night
Economic activity there is restricted
The quality of education is often low
And around the world, about 80 percent of the refugees in camps have to stay there for at least five years
This is the sad place, and it may explain why, in reality, only 9 percent of Syrians choose this option
Or Amira can travel to a city in a neighboring urban area, such as Amman or Beirut
Seventy-five percent of Syrian refugees choose this option
But even there it was difficult
Refugees in urban areas often do not have the right to work
They often do not have access to assistance
So when Amira and her family run out of basic savings, they have very little left, and they are likely to face poverty
There is a third option that is being chosen by more and more Syrians
Amira can find hope for her family and embark on a perilous journey that could cost her life to another country, which is what we see in Europe today
Globally, we leave refugees with an almost impossible choice of the three options: refugee camps, urban poverty, and dangerous journeys
For refugees, this option is the global refugee system we have today
But I think it's the wrong choice
I think we can revisit that option
The reason we're restricting these options is because we think these are the only options available to refugees, but they're not
Politicians have portrayed it as a matter of gain and loss, and if refugees benefit, citizens have to bear the losses
We seem to subscribe to the assumption that refugees are an inevitable burden and expense to society
But this is not the stereotype: refugees can contribute
So what I want to show is that we have a way to increase that option and still benefit everybody: the host countries and communities, our societies, and the refugees themselves
I would like to propose four ways to transform the way we think about refugees
One thing that these four approaches have in common is that we've all taken advantage of globalization, social mobility, and markets to renew our thinking about refugees
And I think the first thing to think about is the concept of creating an environment, which comes from the most basic understanding that refugees are like all other people, but they are in certain circumstances
My colleagues at Oxford University and I started a research project in Uganda on the economic life of refugees
We did not choose Uganda because it is the quintessential representative of the receiving countries
It is precisely an exception
Unlike most host countries in the world, what Uganda does is give refugees economic opportunities
Give them the right to work, give them freedom of movement
The results are staggering, both for refugees and for host countries
In Kampala, Uganda, we found that 21 percent of refugees start their own businesses and hire others, and 40 percent of the people employed are nationals of the host country
In other words, refugees are creating jobs for the citizens of the host country
Even in the refugee camps, we find examples of vibrant, thriving start-ups
To use an analogy, in a refugee camp called Nakiwale, we found Congolese refugees who were in the business of trading digital music
We found a business for Rwandan refugees that allowed young people to play computer games on recycled consoles and monitors
Breaking through extreme constraints, refugees are innovating in front of you with a Congolese man named Damon Kay
He arrived at the camp with nothing, but he wanted to be a filmmaker
So, with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station, he rented a video camera, and he's making movies now
He's made two documentaries with our team, and for our team, and he's got a successful career from very few resources
It's the kind of examples that should dominate our response to refugees
Rather than thinking that refugees are inevitably dependent on humanitarian assistance, we need to give them the opportunity to achieve human prosperity
Yes, clothing, blankets, shelter, food are all very important in an emergency, but we also have to think long-term
We need to provide internet connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, funding and business access
All the pathways we take for granted access to the global economy can and should be offered to refugees
The second idea I would like to discuss is economic zones
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have adopted Uganda's policy
Most host economies are not open to refugees, but we still have effective alternatives
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, development economist Paul Koria, and we discussed an idea there with the international community and the local government, which was to bring jobs to Syrians and to promote Jordan's national development strategy
The idea is to create an economic zone in which we can combine the employment of refugees with the employment of nationals in the host country, Jordan
Just a 15-minute drive outside the Zaatali refugee camp, where 83,000 refugees are housed, is the current economic zone, known as the King Hussein Development Zone
The government has spent more than 100 million dollars to connect the power grid and roads, but there are two things missing: labor and foreign investment
So what if refugees were able to work there, instead of being trapped in camps, and be able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before they returned to Syria?
We recognize that this is beneficial to Jordan, whose national development strategy calls for upgrading its manufacturing sector as a middle-income country
And this will benefit the refugees, and it will also contribute to the post-war reconstruction of Syria by recognizing that we need to train refugees as the best resource for the eventual reconstruction of Syria
We published this opinion in the journal Foreign Affairs
King Abdullah of Jordan also adopted this idea
Two weeks ago, it was announced at the Syria conference in London that the pilot project would begin this summer
The third idea that I want to show is the preference matching between countries and refugees in order to achieve this satisfying outcome in this selfie, which shows German Chancellor Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee
We rarely ask refugees what they want or where they want to go, but I argue that it can be done for the benefit of everybody
Economist Evan Ross coined the concept of a paired market, in which the order of preference of the two sides determines the final match
My colleagues, Will Jones and Alex Tetboyne, are looking at how to apply this concept to the refugee problem, and they ask refugees to rank their preferred countries, but at the same time allow countries to rank the types of refugees they want to receive, based on criteria based on skills or language, and finally match the two rankings
Of course, you need to build quotas in terms of diversity and vulnerability, but it's a way to increase the likelihood of a match
This concept of pairing has been successfully applied to, for example, matching students with universities and matching kidney donors with patients and it also highlights the importance of algorithms in dating sites
So why not use it to give refugees a better option?
And the same applies to the national level, where the biggest problem we face is convincing local communities to accept refugees
At the moment, in my country, for example, we often send engineers to remote areas, farmers to cities, and it doesn't make sense at all
So the matching market provides a potential way to match those preferences and reflect the needs and requirements of the people of the host country as well as the refugees
My fourth thought is a humanitarian visa
Much of the tragedy and chaos that we see in Europe is completely avoidable
This stems from a fundamental contradiction in European asylum policy: In order to seek refuge in Europe, you have to get to Europe on your own, through the dangerous journeys that I described earlier, but why are these journeys necessary?
In an era where low-cost airlines and consulates exist?
These were completely unnecessary journeys last year that led to the deaths of more than three thousand people on European borders and within Europe
If refugees could go directly to Europe and seek asylum, we could avoid these deaths, and that could be done through humanitarian visas, which allow people to pick up their visas at the embassies or consulates of neighboring countries, and then pay for their own travel to Europe by cruise ship or plane
It costs about a thousand euros to bring a stowaway from Turkey to the Greek Islands
For just 200 euros, you can fly from Bodrum in Turkey to Frankfurt in Germany on a low-cost airline
If we allow them to do that, it will be very fruitful
This would save lives by eradicating illegal smuggling markets and removing the chaos we see on the fringes of Europe in regions like the Greek Islands
What is holding us back from doing this is politics rather than rational solutions
And it's an idea that's already been applied
Brazil first adopted this policy and more than 2,000 Syrians were granted humanitarian visas to enter Brazil and to apply for refugee status upon entry
In that program, every Syrian was granted refugee status and confirmed as a real refugee
There is also a historical precedent
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports served as entry and exit documents that allowed 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, and Chechens to travel across Europe and apply for refugee status elsewhere in Europe
Nansen International Refugee Agency has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for this viable response
So the four ideas that I'm showing you are all ways we can add to Amira's options
So that refugees can have a better option that is not limited to just three basic, impossible options, as I said before, and still benefits everyone
Overall, we need a fresh perspective to increase the options for refugees, while recognizing that they don't have to be a burden on society
It is not a fixed formula for refugees to become expenses
It's true that refugees are our humanitarian responsibility, but they're also human beings with the skills, the talents, the aspirations, the ability to contribute to society -- if we allow it
In a new world, migration is not going away
What we see in Europe will be there for many years to come
People are going to be on the move, people are still going to be uprooted, and we need to find a rational and realistic way to manage it -- not based on the old logic of humanitarian aid, not on the logic of philanthropy, but on the opportunities that globalization and markets and mobility bring
I want everybody to recognize that, and I implore our government officials to rise to the challenge
Thank you
As a child, I always fantasized about the ocean.
It's colorful and vibrant, and it's home to animals that look like alien creatures.
I've imagined the big sharks at the top of the food chain, and I've imagined sea turtles dancing gracefully among the coral reefs.
As a marine biologist-turned-photographer, I've spent most of my career looking for places that appeared in my childhood fantasies.
As you can see, I've been venturing in the water since I was very young.
But the first time I actually dived into the water was when I was 10 years old.
I can still vividly remember paddling hard to get to a rusty cannon barrel lying on a coral reef.
Eventually, I managed to get to the barrel, and when I looked up, I saw myself surrounded by schools of fish, all kinds of colored fish, like rainbows.
From that day on, I fell in love with the ocean.
Over the past 40 years, I've had the privilege of exploring some of the most beautiful oceans on Earth, contributing to National Geographic and the Save Our Oceans Foundation.
My subjects range from giant sharks to small enough to swim in the palm of your hand.
In the cold sea by the Canadian Bear Rainforest, I have encountered humpback whales feasting on my side, and the fishy smell is unforgettable.
In the Mozambique Channel, I saw the courtship ritual of green sea turtles.
Each and every one of us influences the ocean, and is affected by the ocean.
And the pure ocean that I dreamed of as a kid is getting harder and harder to find.
Their scope is shrinking and their threats are increasing.
We humans have always been at the top of the food chain on Earth, and I've seen and documented this behavior with my camera.
For a long time, I thought that only powerful photographs could alert my audience.
And of course, there's a good thing about that, and that's that it brings me back to square one.
I believe that the best way to make a difference is to spread love.
I feel like a bridge between people and animals, and as a photographer, I have the rare opportunity to unravel the mysteries of animals and ecosystems hidden deep in the ocean.
If you don't even know something exists, how can you love it and protect it?
And that's where our environmental photographers excel.
I've been to hundreds of different seas, but there are only a few that I'll never forget.
The first time I was struck by this was almost a decade ago, on the rugged and steep coast of South Africa.
Every year in June and July, countless sardines migrate north, which we call the "sardine tide".
Trust me, these fish have to do it.
Because there are hordes of hungry and agile hunters chasing after them.
For example, dolphins hunted in groups, they separate a portion of the sardines from the school and gather them into balls.
Dolphins will herd these sardines closer to the surface and rush into the schools of fish to feast on the feast of movement.
It was followed by sharks.
Most people think that sharks and dolphins are natural predators, but in the "sardine tide" they coexist.
In fact, with the help of dolphins, sharks eat more refreshingly.
Without dolphins, sardines are difficult to gather into balls, and sharks often pass through schools of fish, as if they were through a doughnut, and sometimes they can only drink a belly of water.
I've had a couple of close encounters with sharks during the sardine swarm, and I understand that the sharks don't take me seriously.
But I kept getting bumped and swept by the tail, just like the other guests at this raucous feast.
We sailed east from the African coastline, across the Indian Ocean, to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral reefs.
During the stormy southwest monsoon season, the manta rays that live in the archipelago flock to the Baa Atoll, near a small island called Hanifaru.
Schools of small shrimp and crabs, most of which are smaller than our pupils, are the main food of manta rays.
When these plankton are scattered, manta rays hunt alone, rolling backwards in the water, like a puppy chasing its own tail.
And as the plankton gathers more and more, the manta rays start to line up end to end, and they line up in a long feeding formation, and the manta rays at the head of the line are swallowed up by their companions.
As the plankton in the bay gathers more and more, the manta rays gather more and more, and this unique method of predation is called "cyclone predation."
Manta rays are layered on top of each other, rotating in tight formations, forming a whirlpool that sucks the plankton into its massive mouth.
Diving among hundreds of manta rays is something I will never forget.
When I first went to Hanifaru to take pictures, it was not yet protected and the ecology was threatened by local development.
And by working with NGOs like the Manta Ray Trust, my photographs eventually helped make Hanifaru a marine protected area.
Fishermen from nearby islands used to kill many manta rays and use their skins to make traditional drums.
Today, they're the staunchest protectors of manta rays, which bring in more than $8 million a year for the Maldives.
I've always wanted to go back in time, to a time when most of the maps were blank, or when they said, "There's a dragon here."
So far, the most similar places I've been to are some of the remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean.
It's far away from the fishing grounds and the fishing boats, and diving there always makes me sad because it reminds me of what the ocean used to be.
Few people have heard of Indian Reef, which is a tiny coral atoll located in the Mozambique Channel.
The outer reef forms a protective barrier, and the lagoon in the middle becomes a nursery for the Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are never shy, even during the day.
I guess they're going to be more lively at night, and they're going to be more numerous.
I've never seen so many sharks in a coral lagoon before.
Recording and sharing moments like this – always reminds me why I chose this path in the first place.
Earlier this year, I came to the California Peninsula to complete a National Geographic contract shoot.
In the middle of the peninsula, on the Pacific side, lies the San Ignacio Lagoon, an important breeding ground for gray whales.
For the past 100 years, this stretch of coastline has been a huge slaughterhouse, where more than 20,000 gray whales have been killed, and only a few hundred survivors remain.
And now, the descendants of these gray whales will push their calves to the surface, play and even interact with us.
The species has made a surprising recovery.
On the other side of the peninsula is Cape Pulmo, a small peaceful fishing village.
Decades of overfishing once brought the village to the brink of bankruptcy.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded the government to designate the area as a marine protected area.
What happened next was nothing short of miraculous.
In 2005, after just 10 years of conservation, scientists found that the local fish population had recovered at a record level.
Seeing is believing, come with me.
Take a deep breath and dive with me to see what the biggest, densest school of fish I've ever encountered looks like.
We all have the power to create hope.
And I wanted to use my photographs to send a message that it's not too late to save the oceans.
In particular, I want to focus on nature's resilience when it faces 7.3 billion people.
And I hope that in the future, it's going to be harder and harder for me to take these kinds of photos, but more about people living in harmony with the ocean.
I wish I could take pictures like this every day.
To make a name for yourself in our business, you have to be a hopelessly optimistic person.
I'm always taking pictures with the assumption that the next great picture of change is waiting for me, maybe behind the next reef, in the next lagoon, or else, the next one.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice issues were at the heart of Zimbabwe's national health policy
Immediately after the new government emerged from the long war of independence, it announced a socialist policy: to make health care and primary education basically free
The massive rural health services that make it possible for 80 percent of the population to be within a two-hour walk is a truly remarkable step forward
In Zimbabwe's independence year of 1980, 25 per cent of children were routinely immunized
By 1990, just ten years later, that was 80 percent.
I am very honored to be a part of this transformation, this revolution
The excitement and comradeship are very real
Working side by side with the extraordinary people of Zimbabwe, scientists, doctors, activists, I feel that I am part of not just an African independence movement, but a progressive global public health movement
I've also faced some daunting difficulties
In 1985, the year I arrived, Zimbabwe reported its first case of AIDS.
I was caring for a couple of AIDS patients in the early 1980s when I was training in medicine at Harlem Hospital, but... We had no idea what we would encounter in Africa
When I first got there, the infection rate was about 2 percent.
And that rate is growing rapidly, and when I left Harare 17 years later, one out of every four adults was infected
By the mid-'90s, I had told hundreds of energetic young people who had tested positive for HIV.
I've seen my colleagues and friends die, and my students and hospital patients have died as a result
Faced with this situation, my colleagues and I opened a clinic
We demonstrate how to use condoms
We carry out advocacy in schools and in the workplace
We do research and we give advice to couples of people living with HIV on how to protect themselves.
We worked very hard to do all of this, and I'm sure I did my best
I offered the best treatment, at least under the conditions
But I didn't make constructive changes
Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan once frankly admitted that it was his personal mistake that led to the genocide in Rwanda
In 1994, he was the head of the United Nations peacekeeping component
At the 10-year commemoration of the Holocaust, he recalled, "I believed I had done everything I could, but it wasn't until after the Holocaust that I realized that there was a lot more that I could and should have done, to sound the alarm, to seek support
The AIDS outbreak has caught the medical community off guard, and the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people are dying from the disease today, and many, like me, feel remorse and regret for not stopping it sooner
But when I lived in Zimbabwe, I didn't realize I was an advocate or a politician
I thought I was there because of my medical knowledge because of my clinical and infectious disease research
I've always felt that my job is to take care of the sick and to better understand the demographics of the infection through research, and I hope to slow down the spread of the virus
And I realized that the rate of people on the margins of society contracting and dying from AIDS is surprisingly high
In sugar plantations, which are more feudal than modern businesses, 60 percent of pregnant women test positive for HIV
My job is to show people that being infected is not a moral depravity, but it has to do with patriarchal ideology, about forced migrant labor and colonialism.
Whites are mostly unharmed
As medical professionals, our means are regrettably powerless: begging people to change their personal behaviour by using condoms and reducing the number of partners
Infection rates are still climbing as our most effective weapon against the virus when treatment is already feasible in the West and for the public sector across Africa, treatment is unaffordable
I didn't have the audacity to say that inequalities in access to life-saving medicines, or underlying problems in the economic and political system, are the driving forces behind the high rates of infection in such a large population
I made excuses for my silence, reminded myself that I was just a visitor to this country, sounded the alarm that I could be deported, and kept me from doing my job of caring for my patients and doing much-needed research
So I didn't speak out about the government's early HIV policy
I didn't express my concerns loud enough
A lot of doctors, health care workers, might feel like I'm not doing anything wrong
Our commitment to the patient, like the Hippocratic Oath and its different versions, is the sacrosanct doctor-patient relationship
I do my best for each of my patients
But I know that the contagion that goes with the divisions in our societies is not only a biological phenomenon, but also a phenomenon of marginalization, intolerance, racism, sexism, and classism
The same is true for AIDS
This is true for the recent Ebola
Medical anthropologists, such as Paul Famar who works on AIDS in Haiti, call it structural violence: structural, because inequality is rooted in the political and economic organization of our social environment and is often ignored by privileged and political regimes; violence because of its effects such as early death, suffering, disease, and violence
We do very little for the sick if we don't realize these social injustices
Sounding the alarm is the first step in the right direction to guide public health, and it's how we seek support to break through and create real change
So now, I'm not silent
I'm bold and outspoken about a lot of things, even though it makes the listener uncomfortable, even though it makes me uncomfortable
A lot of it is about apartheid and organized racism, things that shouldn't happen in this country, things that shouldn't exist in medical practice or public health
But they do exist, and we pay the cost of shortening our lives
That's why it's a wake-up call in the United States about the impact of racism on health care -- the persistence of organized, interpersonal violence against people of color that is tied to our tragic history -- 250 years of slavery, 90 years of racism, 60 years of imperfect equality -- and that's the alarm bell is at the heart of my job as New York City Commissioner of Health
In New York City, where the premature mortality rate -- death before the age of 65 -- is 50 percent higher among blacks than whites
In 2012, black women faced more than 10 times more risk of childbirth-related mortality than white women
Even though we've made tremendous progress in reducing infant mortality, black babies still have nearly three times the first year of life when they die at nearly three times as much as white babies
New York City is not an exception
These statistics are similar throughout the United States
A recent New York Times analysis reported that there are about fifteen million missing black men across the country
The authors note that at least one out of every six black males between the ages of 25 and 54 disappears from everyday life either from prison or from premature death
It's so unfair that young black people face disproportionate violence on a daily basis, and that's all in the recent protests with the slogan "Black Lives Matter."
But we need to remember the current state and outcomes of general care, and the persistent, incredibly high rates of disease, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, diseases that slowly and quietly eat away at life, diseases that prematurely kill more black people
As the Black Lives Matter movement unfolded, I felt frustrated and outset that the medical community was hesitant to even use the word "racism" in their research and work
Every time I say it, you probably already feel it
Medical students dressed in white robes are dying protesting against chemical and biological weapons, but the medical community has largely stood by in the face of ongoing racial discrimination on disease conditions and mortality
I'm worried that the move toward personalized and accurate drugs, the search for biological and genetic targets, to better design therapies, could inadvertently distract us from the big picture, and that's exactly what happens in everyday life, where a person lives, grows, works, loves each other, has a significant impact on the health of the community, and for many of us, ill health
In our daily lives, as health care workers, both in the clinic and in our research, we are witnesses to great injustices: the homeless, unable to follow the doctor's orders, because he has to prioritize more urgent matters; young transgender people, planning suicide, because our society is too unforgiving; Single mothers, who are forced to feel the need to take responsibility for their children's ill health.
As health care workers, our role is not just to treat our patients, it's to be a wake-up call for change
Whether it's reasonable or not, our social positions make our voices more credible, and we shouldn't waste them
And I regret that I didn't speak openly in Zimbabwe, and I've made a promise to myself that as the New York City Health Commissioner, I'm going to use every opportunity I have to sound the alarm and seek support for health equity
I'm going to speak out against racism, and I want you to join me, and I'm going to join you, when you're going to speak out against sexism, or any kind of inequality
It's time for us to rise up and speak out against structural inequality together
When it comes to advocating for change, we don't need to have all the answers
We just need courage
The health of our patients, our own health, depends on it
Okay, so I want you to raise your hand, how many people have blocked people on Facebook because they've made inappropriate remarks about politics, religion, child rights, or food?
How many people have at least one person they don't want to meet, because you just don't want to talk to them?
You know, in the past, if we wanted to have a polite conversation, we just had to follow Henry Higgins's advice in My Fair Lady: Just talk about the weather and your health.
But over the years, with climate change and the anti-vaccine campaign -- it hasn't worked very much.
So it's not normal for us to live in a world where every conversation has the potential to turn into an argument, where politicians can't talk to each other, and even people are emotionally up and down for trivial things.
The Pew Research Center did a survey of 10,000 American adults and found that we're more polarized, we're more definitive, than at any other time in history.
We're less inclined to compromise, which means we're not listening to each other.
The decisions we make, where we choose to live, who we marry and who we befriend are based solely on our pre-existing beliefs.
Again, it's a sign that we're not listening to each other.
Conversation requires a balance between telling and listening, and somehow, we lose that balance.
Technological advancements are partly to blame.
Smartphones, for example, are now in your hands, or right next to them, and you can get them at your fingertips.
According to Pew's research, about one-third of American teens send more than a hundred text messages per day.
And a lot of people, almost all of them, are more likely to text their friends than to talk face-to-face.
The Atlantic magazine had a great article,
The author is high school teacher Paul Barnwell.
He gave his students a communication task.
I want to teach them how to give a speech on a topic without the help of notes.
Then he said, "I began to realize ......"
"I'm starting to realize that communication skills are probably the most neglected skills that we're not teaching well.
Children spend hours a day engaging with creatives and other peers through screens, but rarely have the opportunity to explore their interpersonal skills. ”
It sounds funny, but we have to ask ourselves: What skill is more important in the 21st century than maintaining a coherent, confident conversation?"
Now, my profession is talking to people. Nobel laureate, truck driver, billionaire, kindergarten teacher, governor, plumber.
I talk to people I like, and I talk to people I don't like.
I talk to people who disagree with them on a personal level.
But I still have good conversations with them.
So I'm going to spend the next 10 minutes teaching you how to talk, how to listen.
Many of you have heard countless suggestions, such as looking each other in the eye, thinking about interesting topics to discuss in advance, looking, nodding and smiling to show your focus, repeating what you just heard, or summarizing.
I want you to forget all of this,
It's all useless.
There's no need to learn how to behave as attentive, if you're really attentive.
I'm actually using the same techniques as a professional interviewer in my daily life.
Okay, so I'm going to teach you how to interview people, and that's actually going to help you learn how to be a better communicator.
Learn to start a conversation, not to waste time, not to get bored, and, most importantly, not to offend anyone.
We've all had great conversations.
We've all had it. We know what it's like.
It's the kind of conversation that you have at the end of the conversation that makes you feel like you're having a real connection with somebody, or it's something that makes you fully understood.
There's no reason to say that most of your human interactions can't be like that.
I have 10 ground rules. I'm going to explain it to you, but seriously, if you pick one and master it, you're already going to be able to enjoy a much more enjoyable conversation.
Rule 1: Don't be half-hearted.
I'm not just talking about just putting down your phone, tablet, car keys, or whatever you hold in your hand.
I mean, being in the moment.
Get into that situation.
Don't think about the arguments you had with your boss before.
Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner.
If you want to quit the conversation, quit the conversation. But don't be in Cao Ying, and your heart is in Han.
Rule 2: Don't be a good teacher.
If you want to express your opinion, but you don't want to leave any opportunity for people to respond, argue, refute, or elaborate, write a blog.
There's a good reason why I don't allow "expert preaching" in my conversations: because it's really boring.
If you're a conservative, you hate Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
If the other side was a liberal, he would hate the big banks, the oil companies, and Dick Cheney.
Totally predictable.
You don't want that.
You need to go into every conversation with the assumption that you can learn something.
The famous therapist M. Scott Peck once said that true listening requires putting oneself aside.
Sometimes, that means putting your personal opinion aside.
He said that by feeling this acceptance, the person speaking becomes less vulnerable and sensitive, and thus more likely to open up his inner world to the listener.
Again, let's say you need to learn something new.
Bill Nye said, "Every person you're going to meet has something you don't know. ”
Let me retell: Everyone is an expert at something.
Point 3: Use open-ended questions.
In this regard, please refer to the question asked by the reporter.
Start with "who", "what", "when", "where", "why", or "how".
If you ask a complex question, you're going to get a simple answer.
If I ask you, "Were you scared?"
You'll respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, "fear," and the answer will be "yes" or "no."
"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was angry. ”
Let the other person describe it, and the other person is the one who understands the situation.
Try asking the other person something like, "What does that look like?"
"How are you feeling?"
Because then the other person may need to stop and think about it, and you'll get a more interesting answer.
Point 4: Go with the flow.
That is, ideas flow naturally into your mind, and you need to express them.
We often hear interviews where the guest speaks for a few minutes, and then the host comes back and asks a question that seems to come from somewhere or has already been answered.
This means that the moderator probably wasn't listening two minutes ago, because he had this very clever question in mind, and he thought about asking it.
We will do the same.
And when we were sitting down with somebody talking, we suddenly remembered that chance encounter with Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
Then we stopped listening.
Stories and ideas will always come to you,
But even if you can't stop them, don't let them linger in your head too much.
Point 5: If you don't know, say you don't know.
People on the radio, especially on NPR, know very well that their conversations are going to be broadcast. So they're going to be more careful about what they claim to be professional about and what they say they are.
Learn to do that. Be cautious in what you say and do.
Conversations should be conducted responsibly.
Rule 6: Don't compare your own experiences with those of others.
If the other person is talking about the loss of a family member, don't start talking about the loss of a family member.
If the person is talking about a problem at work, don't tell them how much you hate your job.
It's not the same, it's never going to be the same.
Every experience is unique.
And, more importantly, it's not about you.
You don't need to prove at this moment how capable you are, or how much pain you've endured.
Someone once asked Stephen Hawking what his IQ was, and he replied, "I don't know. People who brag about IQ are dicks. ”
Conversations are not meant to sell themselves.
Rule 7: Try not to repeat your own words.
It's pushy and boring. But it's easy for us to do that.
Especially at work, or with children. We wanted to make a point, so we kept saying it in a different way.
Don't do this.
Rule 8: Less nonsense.
To put it bluntly, nobody cares about the years, the names, the dates, all the details that you're trying to remember in your head.
Others don't care. They're focused on you.
The other person cares about what kind of person you are and what you have in common.
So forget about the details. Leave them alone.
Article 9: This is not the last, but the most important.
Listen carefully.
I can't tell you how many important people have said that listening is probably the most important, the first important skill that you can improve.
The Buddha said, and I paraphrase, "If you don't stop talking, you can't learn." ”
Calvin Coolidge once said, "No one has ever been fired for listening too much. ”
Why don't we listen to each other?
First of all, we prefer to speak.
When I speak, I'm in control.
I don't have to listen to anything that I'm not interested in.
I'm the focus.
I can strengthen my sense of identity.
But there's another reason: we're going to be distracted.
The average person speaks about 225 words per minute, but we can hear almost 500 words per minute.
So our minds are occupied by these other 275 words.
I know it's a lot of energy to really pay attention to what people are saying. But if you don't, you're not talking.
You're just two people in the same place, yelling at each other for unrelated words.
You have to listen to each other.
Stephen Covey has a wonderful argument about this.
"Most of us don't listen for the sake of understanding," he said.
We listen in response. ”
Last, Article 10: Be concise and to the point.
"A good conversation is like a miniskirt that's just right; short enough to be inviting, and long enough to encompass the subject -- my sister's metaphor" All of this is condensed into the same concept, which is: Becoming interested in others.
I grew up with a celebrity grandfather, and I had a lot of guests in my house.
Visitors would come and talk to my grandparents, and when they left, my mother would come and say, "Do you know who that is?
She is the runner-up of Miss America.
He is the mayor of Sacramento.
She won the Pulitzer Prize. He was a Russian ballet dancer. ”
Growing up, I assumed that everybody has something wonderful that no one else knows.
Seriously, I think it's all that makes me a better host.
I try to talk as little as possible, but keep my mind open, always ready to be surprised, and I'm never disappointed.
You can do the same.
Go out the door, talk to others, listen to others, and most importantly, get ready to be amazed.
Thank you.
Hello everyone
My name is Matthew Williams and I'm a champion
I've won medals in three different sports, as well as the Canadian National Games, I've played basketball at an international level, and I'm very proud to represent Canada on the world stage
I work with top coaches and homework counselors five days a week to train basketball and speed skating to be at my best
To add, these are all because of Special Olympics
Has this made any difference to me and my accomplishments?
The world doesn't treat everyone like me as a champion
Not so long ago, people like me were not welcomed
Since the Special Olympics in 1968, this phenomenon has improved dramatically, but in reality it is often seen that people with mental disabilities are often ignored compared to the average person
People called me "stupid" in front of me, thinking I wouldn't care
They call me a "fool" and call me dull is a completely derogatory usage
They don't know how much it hurts me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here to get mercy
And I'm here because the problem is still there: there are a lot of people who have problems with the way they look at people with mental retardation, or, many more, who don't recognize their existence at all
You all know that the World Games are being held this year, right?
I'm one of the 6,500 mentally challenged athletes from 165 countries, competing in Los Angeles
More than 62,000 people watched the opening ceremony, and TSN and ESPN livestreamed
But do you know about it?
What do you think when you see someone like me?
I'm here today to be bold and make a bold statement that we are treated as equals
Special Olympics has changed the self-perception of athletes with intellectual disabilities and also changed the perception of spectators
If you're not familiar with Special Olympics, let me explain, it's for people with mental retardation
It is independent of the Paralympic and Olympic Games
We have high-quality, year-round sports for mentally retarded athletes that change our destiny and our perceptions
Special Olympics has changed my life, and it has changed the lives of many people, and it has changed the way the world thinks about people with intellectual disabilities
I was born with epilepsy and mental retardation
I played hockey until I was 12 years old
The older I get, the more difficult it becomes to keep up with other people, and I feel angry and frustrated
For a while, I didn't have any sports and didn't have many friends who felt abandoned and uncared for
There was a time when mentally retarded people were segregated from the public
No one thinks they can play sports, let alone be a worthy member of society
In the '60s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of normal exercise on the health of children with mental retardation
Dr. Hayden and other researchers, through rigorous scientific research, have come to the conclusion that the cause of the decline in the health of mentally retarded children is simply a lack of physical activity
A lot of people question whether people with mental retardation can benefit from sports or athletic competitions
But it's because of Dr. Hayden, and the founder of Special Olympics, Eunice Kennedy Sharif, that they've stuck with the benefits of sports, and Special Olympics athletes have proven that sports do have benefits no less than 4.5 million times
Before I went to Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, unconfident, and didn't have many friends
But when I got there, I found that everybody was friendly, helpful, didn't discriminate against me, and made me feel like myself
Now, I'm a basketball player, I'm a speed skater, I've competed at provincial and national levels, and this year I played at the Special Olympics Summer Games in Los Angeles, where I represented the first Canadian basketball player to compete in the world
I'm one of the 4.5 million athletes in the world, and I've heard a lot of similar stories
Being an athlete in Special Olympics helps us regain our confidence and dignity
The Games also pointed to important health needs
Studies have shown that, on average, men with mental retardation live 13 years less than men without mental retardation, and women with mental retardation live 20 years less than women without mental retardation
Special Olympics keeps us healthy and gets involved in sports
Our coaches also taught us about nutrition and health
Special Olympics also offers free health checkups for athletes who have trouble communicating with their doctors, or who have difficulty getting health attention
At the 2015 Special Olympics Summer Games, the members of my Canadian team and I played against the Nigerian basketball team
The day before the game, the Nigerian basketball team took part in a health check-up for the Games, and seven of the 10 players received free hearing aids, and for the first time in their lives, they could hear better
The changes they have made are staggering
They are more excited, happy, and confident because their coach is finally able to communicate with them in words
They're very excited because they can hear the sound of the basketball, the sound of the whistle, and the cheers of the fans standing next to them, the sounds that we take for granted.
Special Olympics doesn't just change athletes in sports
It also changes the lives of athletes
This year, research shows that nearly half of adults in the U.S. don't know a single person with intellectual disability and 44% of Americans who have not been in contact with someone with intellectual disability are significantly more intolerant and less positive
And then the word "stupid" proves that people with mental retardation are still being ignored and feeling isolated
People use this word, either casually or swearing
Last year, it was used more than 9 million times on Twitter, and it hurt me and the 4.5 million fellow athletes around the world
People don't think it's swearing, but it is
My fellow athlete and global messenger, Franklin Stephens, wrote a letter to a political commentator who used the word "stupid" to "find a day to see Special Olympics.
See if you still have the same thoughts when you leave. ”
This year, at the 2015 Special Olympics Summer Games, people lined up for hours just to see the last night of weightlifting
When my teammate Jackie Barrett came on the court, people stood up and he was known as the Newfoundland Moose, and he deadlifted 665 pounds and squatted and lifted 611 pounds to set a number of new records for Special Olympics
Jackie is the record holder among Newfoundland weightlifters, not just in Special Olympics, but in all weightlifters.
Jackie is now a big star in Los Angeles, and ESPN tweeted in real time about him breaking the weightlifting record and was shocked by his performance
Fifty years ago, almost no one could have imagined that a mentally retarded person could do that
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremony and cheer on athletes from 165 countries around the world
We are congratulated and cheered, not hidden
Special Olympics teaches athletes to be more confident and proud of themselves
Special Olympics also teaches the world that people with mental disabilities also deserve to be respected and included
Now, I'm in my athletic career, I have dreams and achievements, I have good training, I am respected, I live a healthier life, and then I'm trying to move forward as a personal trainer
I'm not being hidden, I'm being bullied, I'm doing TED Talk here at TED
With Special Olympics, the world is different, but there's still a long way to go
So the next time you see people who are mentally retarded, I hope you see their potential
The next time someone uses the word "stupid" around you, I want you to tell them how hurtful that word is
I hope you'll want to see a Special Olympics
I'd like to share one last thought with you
Nelson Mandela once said, "Sport has the power to change the world. ”
Special Olympics is changing the world, it's changing 4.5 million athletes, it's giving us a place to be confident, to make friends, to be discriminated against, to be a champion
Thank you!
You've probably never heard of Kenema in Sierra Leone, or Arua in Nigeria.
But I think they're two of the best places in the world.
There, in the hospital, there's a community of nurses, surgeons and scientists who've been fighting for years one of humanity's deadliest threats, the Lhasa virus.
The Lhasa virus is very similar to the Ebola virus.
It can cause severe febrile symptoms and is often fatal.
But these people risk their lives every day to protect every member of the community, and at the same time, protect all of us.
One of the best things I've learned from them is that when I first visited many years ago, during those challenging, front-line days, they started every morning -- singing.
They gather together to show their pleasure.
They show a spirit.
Many years later, when we visited each other year after year, I would get together with them and sing about it, and we would record it, and we loved to do that because it reminded us that we don't just have to search for scientific truth together, but that there is a human bond that binds us together.
And as you can imagine, when things change around us, that connection becomes extremely important, even indispensable.
In March 2014, a big change happened. An Ebola outbreak broke out in Guinea.
This is the first outbreak in West Africa, on the border between Sierra Leone and Libya.
The situation was terrible and each of us was shocked.
In fact, we even suspected that the Ebola outbreak in Lhasa and Lhasa was spreading more widely than we thought, and we were worried that one day it would spread to Kenema.
So my team immediately set out, got there and joined Dr. Humar Khan and his team, and we set up diagnostic equipment to do some sensitive molecular tests that we could detect when Ebola crossed the border with Sierra Leone.
We've had this scale of equipment set up for the Lhasa virus, and we know how to deal with it, and this team is fantastic.
We just need to give them the equipment and the space to study Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day came.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the delivery room of the hospital, and our team performed those important molecular tests and confirmed the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
That's actually quite remarkable.
They can diagnose the disease as soon as possible, safely treat the patient, and begin contact tracing to follow up on the spread of the disease.
It could have prevented something.
But when that day came, the outbreak had been brewing for months.
After hundreds of cases were detected, it dwarfed all previous outbreaks.
And it wasn't that single case that the virus came to Sierra Leone, it was a huge shockwave.
We have to work closely with the international community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema on the ground, to deal with these cases. The next week there were 31 patients, then 92, then 147 -- all of them coming to Kenema, because this is one of the few places in Sierra Leone that can deal with the outbreak.
We're working day and night, trying to help every patient, trying to get attention, but we're also doing something simple.
In order to detect the Ebola virus, we took samples from the patient's blood, and of course we could just throw them away.
But actually, the other thing that we can do is add chemicals to the sample to inactivate it, and then seal it in a box and transport it across the ocean. And that's exactly what we did.
We sent the samples to Boston, where my team works.
We were working in shifts every day, day and night, and we were able to sort out the 99 genomes of the Ebola virus very quickly.
That's a blueprint -- the genome of the virus is a blueprint.
We humans also have it.
It details everything that makes up our body and tells us so much information.
The result of these works is simple, but also powerful.
And we can take these 99 different virus mutations, look at them and compare them, and we can clearly see that, compared to the three genomes that were released in Guinea, we can see that the disease started to spread in Guinea a few months ago, and once it broke into the population, it was quickly transmitted through person-to-person contact.
This information is actually crucial, especially when you're looking at how to stop the spread of the virus. But the most important thing is contact tracing.
And we can also see that as the virus spreads from person to person, it mutates.
Every variant is extremely important, because all the diagnostics, all the vaccines, and the treatments that we use are basically based on that particular genome sequence, which is the root cause of the spread of the pandemic.
So health professionals around the world have to respond quickly, they have to improve their research methods, they have to adapt everything they do.
But in the position I was in, the way of scientific research was that I had the data, and I would have to be locked up in a lab for months, and I would have to analyze the data carefully, write a paper and send it in, and then revise it over and over again, and finally the paper would be made public, and the data would be made public.
This was the state of scientific research at that time.
Well, at that particular point that that method definitely won't work, right?
Some of our friends are on the front lines of the fight against the disease, and obviously what we need most is outside help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we did, as soon as the sequencing results came out of the machine, we immediately posted that data online.
We open it up to the world, and we say, "Help us!"
And so help followed.
Before we could even react, a large group of people around the world reached out to us, and they were pleasantly surprised to see that the data was publicly available online.
Some of the best virus trackers in the world are suddenly part of our team!
We're working together in this virtual way, we're sharing information, we're talking on the phone, we're in touch all the time, hoping to be able to track the spread of the virus and find a way to stop it.
Actually, there are many ways to form such a group.
Everybody, especially when the pandemic is breaking out around the world, is constantly getting informed, engaged, engaged.
Everyone wants to make something to contribute.
The power of all the people in the world is amazing, and the Internet connects us.
Can you imagine? We're no longer afraid to communicate with others, and all of us say, "Let's get to work."
Let's work together, we can do it!"
But the problem is that the data that all of us use, the data that we search Google, is far from what we need to do our jobs.
When that happens, we miss out on a lot of opportunities.
So at the beginning of the outbreak in Kenema, we had 106 patient clinical records, and again, we made them public.
In our own lab, you give us 106 records, and we can have a computer predict what's going to happen to Ebola next, and it's close to 100 percent accurate.
We've also made an app that publishes these predictions so that health professionals around the world can make that information available.
But 106 reports are not enough to make this approach work.
So we're waiting for more clinical reports before we can release that software.
And these reports have not come.
We're still waiting, we're tinkering with the software, we're staying in the lab instead of working with everybody.
This is really ...... We are totally unacceptable.
Right? You, all of you can't accept it.
Now is the time when fate hangs by a thread.
But in fact, a lot of people died, a lot of people who worked in the medical field, including my beloved colleagues, there were five colleagues: Mbaru Funi, Alex Mubi, Dr. Humar Khan, Alice Kovoma, and Mohamed Fuller.
These are just five of the thousands of health workers who have died in Kenema and elsewhere, while the world has been waiting, and we have been working with our heads, and we are all separate and uncommunicative.
Ebola, like all other threats to humanity, is exacerbated by mistrust, dispersion and estrangement between people.
When we build barriers and fight each other, the arrogance of the virus becomes even more arrogant.
But Ebola is not like any other threat, because this time, we are a family.
We are all on the same front.
If one person has Ebola, we may be next.
So we live in the world, with common weaknesses, common strengths, common fears, common hopes, and I sincerely hope that we can work together with joy.
One of my graduating students read a book about Sierra Leone, and she discovered that the word Kenema, the name of the city, the hospital, when we were working in Sierra Leone, means "as clear as a river, clear as a river, and accessible to all eyes."
It's very profound for us, and we don't realize it, but we've always felt that in order to honor all of us in Kenema, where we've struggled, we have to be open and collaborative, we have to share information, we have to work together.
We have to do it.
Everybody should ask of ourselves and others -- when disaster strikes, we should all open our hearts to each other and fight this battle together.
Because this isn't the first outbreak of Ebola, and it's not going to be the last, there are a lot of other microbes in the world that have been lurking around us, like the Lhasa virus and other organisms.
The next time a disaster strikes, it could be in a city with a population of a million, and it might erupt there.
The virus can spread through the air.
The virus may even be deliberately spread.
I know it's scary, and I can understand it, but I also know that this experience has taught us that we have the technology and the ability to win this battle, not just to win this battle, but to be able to fight all viruses.
But we can only do it if we work together, and we have to be happy.
So for Dr. Khan, and for all those who have died on the front lines of the fight against the disease, and for those who will always be with us, let us always fight with them.
Our world should not be defined by the devastation caused by a virus, but by the solidarity of billions of hearts and minds that shine across the earth.
Thank you.
