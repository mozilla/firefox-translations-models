Is there any way to punish him?
To avoid this happening again.
Or how long will the restaurant be ready? but can you help me ask?
Student singing at the University Art Annual Meeting is the main theme of the research that has opened a brain hole.
Air washing, breathing to determine disease, accurate searching for the source of the mist last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements were recognized for their brain-growing.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, whose research covers a wide range of fields, including environmental, mechanical, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities, and other, and they have started from a curious point of view, creating many high-end inventions with applied value, some of which have won national and international awards.
zh Biosensors: Your family physician
The team of Dr. Zhang Dizh from the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering on the ground showed a bio-sensor for a smartphone, only half the size of a smartphone.
All you need to do is breathe a little, and this instrument can test the composition of the gas you breathe and make a preliminary physical test.
Zhang said that the sensor is connected to the smartphone, and after exhausting the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
A smart ring that can detect health status on the market, usually detecting physical parameters such as temperature, pH, and pulse.
This biofilter uses graphene, a new material that targets chemical elements, a keen sense of smell that allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect physical health.
Smart surgical light: the doctor's high-energy eye
In addition to smart phones, the operating room also uses a smart operating light.
This invention won the silver prize at this year's 44th Geneva International Exhibition.
The team of Dr. Julin Yus, Ph.D., Ph.D., Ph.D., Ph.D., and Dr. Shenjunfei, who opened a new way of thinking about the flaws of traditional operating lamps, invented the intelligent LED operating light without a shadow.
Many diseases are not detected early, and are associated with the lights used in the doctor's operating room.
For example, when cancer is diagnosed early, if the doctor cannot examine all the tumor tissue in time, the cancer cells will spread again afterwards, says Shen Junfei.
This type of smart surgical lamp has four discs, which, by adjusting the spectrum, enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color homogeneity and shadowlessness of the spot at any time, depending on the needs of the operation and individual habits.
This type of smart operating light has already been tested in hospitals such as Zhejiang University Medical School affiliated Liyev Hospital, Zhejiang University Medical School affiliated Children's Hospital, and received better reviews.
In October last year, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Hand washing with air: water saving and cooling.
The average person washes their hands with water, top-screens soap, and top-screens, while Li Xiaochang and other scholars invent a hand-washing device with air.
As long as we are on the washing machine, our weight can compress the air.
zh is like a balloon.
The compressed air, forming a liquid at the tap, and the water combine with it.
This way, we can wash our hands! zh
The reaction of the color and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of washing hands using this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can both ensure a cleanliness of the water, and can save 90% of water, the entire process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Challenges Summit, the invention stood out among many of the world's leading universities, winning the only gold medal.
Please arrange a refund for me as soon as possible,thx
Please cancel the order and return the cash, do not score, and no more #PRS_ORG#!
Bone and bone broths are not suitable for children to eat.
If so, please order as soon as possible.
 Not for the time being, thank you.
He asked me to tell you where he was.
I can't wait, cancel the order.
I bought it, but I wrote the address wrong.
Can I change it?
Or cancel the order.
Okay, well, we're in trouble.
A certificate that I found very useful is an emergency certificate.
This is one of the skills certificates that I consider important beyond a driver's license!
 Get widespread: Emergency measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As you know, there is still some time left in the process of arriving at the ambulance after the accident, but that is the most crucial time.
This is the time when emergency services are needed.
If I really had a heart attack, a brain hemorrhage, a breathing arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, four golden minutes!
So people around you understand how important emergency care is!
When someone falls down around us, we can use our expertise to rescue them, instead of standing there and doing nothing, a feeling of helplessness that is terrifying.
In China, according to our official data, three million people die each year from sudden deaths, the most dangerous of which is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% of the nation's population is recovering.
In the casino hotel in Las Vegas, seventy-eight percent could be saved, while Shanghai, Beijing, and less than one percent.
This is the first reaction, says the founder of the company, Luzhong.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, you have no role in any of them.
It is necessary to perform an artificial breathing, and to apply pressure outside the chest, it is possible to save a person.
I find that few of us today are aware of the need to learn emergency medicine, but when it comes down to it, it's not the right time, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in a timely manner to emergencies.
It is certainly possible to save a life!
The Emergency Certificate can be registered at your local Red Cross training center, I am registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students have a bonus.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goal I had to accomplish before the age of 25, adding an ambulance to the target list was also a few months ago, but it was indeed accomplished!
Then to go and check other certificates you want to check, to plan to check a dive certificate, before you see a dive emergency certificate in the Little Red Book, to check this certificate as if there were an emergency certificate to check, so in fact an emergency certificate is still useful!
I ordered ##NUMBERzh#

Because it's clear that when I first entered code, seeing it was effective.
To conclude, I personally consider 四海 to be a complete piece of rubbish, in various ways.
But you're saying that the film is neither a highlight nor a failure, which is not at least a good soundtrack.
The rotten pieces are of many kinds, allowing you to fall asleep in the cinema, allowing you to watch the aftermath of the outrage, and are like a cat on a mountain to the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
On this point of insulting the audience, Hanh Kham is truly a genius.
The most painful part of this film is that it is as if it were a creation of a galactic novel, difficult to name, and as flawed as the cloak of a young man.
Even after reading it, you'll doubt whether there is a metaphor for the director, but when you think about it carefully, you'll find that it's actually a metaphor.
To begin with, I'll say a few things that are hard for me to understand.
The male's residence should be on some small island far south, where his grandmother lived.
Her grandmother had a dream of watching the snow, and then the plot was arranged for a neighboring man to drive her to the northeast to watch the snow.
An elderly man sits in a van watching snow from the south to the northeast??
He and his wife are very confident about this.
Then the old man had no context.
How did the bride-to-be get her business license while opening a hotel on a discarded ferry?
Why is it so easy to turn a mountain road into a roadblock?
Then the truck that was delivering the steel straps in the middle of the road stopped by the side of the road, and no truck driver could be found.
This sense of propensity is obviously too.
Why would a small party of illegal and unsigned people become an assistant police officer?
Faced with the lack of police reporting for the loan, the police in the film also specifically asked if there was a problem.
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to open a hotel door, then makes a forced arrangement to find the hotel owner, sits outside the door and sleeps for a night?
This unusual plot is rife throughout the film, and it makes me sick when I remember it because the plot is too out of sync.
Beyond the plot, what's worse is that the film's theme, or even the film's plot, is a disgusting, disgusting, and disgusting hoax.
At the beginning of the movie you'd think he wanted to make a comedy, and maybe 20 minutes later you'd guess it might be a motivational film, halfway through the movie you'd think it might be a drama about a small town youth who's not easy to survive, and then you'd be shocked and uncertain if you'd actually seen it, followed by deep doubts about yourself, why you should run to the movies to see the shit.
For most people, the plot of the movie is actually very familiar, like if you want to shoot a motorcycle rider, then you want to do a motivational+comedy and then tell the audience how a talented bird steps towards success.
If you want to make a love film, you're talking about the bitter struggle between a young man and a waitress sister in a small town who really like to ride motorcycles.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot appear in something that is contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that was playing was just burned, and then the singing character still can), it is impossible to open some brain holes that even Kennedy saw not live in.
As for Miss Ming Ming-ming, who is not weak-minded enough to act like a five-year-old child in some ways, I don't know if that's the reason for acting or the director's demands.
Another thing I'm not sure about, why is Han Khen, as a racing driver, so eager to add a crash scene to his own film?
Is this kind of film arranged in the Spring Festival section to add to the crowd?

South African doctors: Although the transmission of omega-3 is strong, it is more easily transmitted.
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the Bidarta variant of the disease caused by the new coronavirus variant is milder, although it spreads faster.
As the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of doctors comprising more than 5,000 doctors in the province of Hauden, South Africa, reported that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they are currently treating are all mild, such as body pain and coughs and flu-like symptoms.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the group's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but no patients need hospitalization.
Pile said:  They can control illness at home, most people recover within 10 to 14 days of quarantine 
He said this included elderly patients and those with health problems, who were more likely to get sick from coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the previous Delta outbreak, the patients he treated had difficulty breathing, low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized in a matter of days.
Within two weeks of the first report of the Olympic variant strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, medical observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of new corona patients hospitalized in recent weeks were seriously ill, or half the severity of the previous wave; the average stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent new corona patients died, while the mortality rate in South Africa's early outbreaks was 20%.
William Hanekom, director of the Institute of African Health, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports as saying: "At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a more mild disease.
He also said: zh  now or early, we need to get later data.
Usually, hospitalization and death occur late, while we entered this wave of outbreaks only two weeks later.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the world's leading strain of coronavirus, cases of Omikzh are emerging in dozens of countries, including South Africa, which is the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, new cases detected in Hauen Province in the first week of December increased by 400%; tests showed that cases of the variant represented more than 90% of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes have been sent out in their entirety!

Education Time Review: What is the basis for saving abducted children?
If the analogy without buying and selling does not kill famous public-interest slogans, then, in a good environment without demand for kidnapping, gang-protection, mass kidnapping, making trafficking unprofitable, high-risk, high-cost, such crimes would not happen.
Recently, the Public Security Department's Criminal Investigation Office launched an emergency release platform for the information about missing children who were abducted and developed.
This is an Internet information platform established to establish the authority channel for the publication of missing children's information, and to find children who have been abducted in a timely manner.
Heard of thisApp called 团圆 , zh觉暖意十足.
New technology means not only to name the artistic and emotional, but also to inform the right, practical, effective use of information.
The primary goal of child abduction enforcement is to find the kidnapped child, protect their safety, safety, and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be summarized in many words.
But before a trafficking case is settled, the safety of the victim should be given priority.
Things are considered urgently, under the urgent need for rescue, such as whether or not child trafficking should be punishable by death, controversial topics can be suspended, carefully discussed; but rescue of abducted children cannot be done.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, human traffickers are used to moving away from the scene as quickly as possible after being caught.
The kidnapping operation takes more than a minute, the child may be a step further away from the parent, and the difficulty of detecting a case increases by a factor.
In this case, coming up with a platform like the Rodeo that directly helps to uncover cases and find an effective way to get the child back is indeed a pragmatic move.
After all, the "turn" is a big task that needs to be done to get the entire legal system working properly.
To combat crime, to protect the rights of children and parents, from perfect legislation to judicial protection, and to the strictness of law, there is no need to carry out the care of the child with disabilities without the need to carry out the care of the child with disabilities.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from family to society, can also be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three is resting at the train station, parents fall asleep, and when they wake up, they find that the child is missing.
You can't expect a two-year-old to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should have at least a fair amount of protection awareness.
Routine resting or placing the child under stable protection is the least effective way to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of police fighting trafficking, one side of the kidnapped child's purchase should also be monitored and punished.
Individual wrongdoing, often merely a link in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Code of China, the maximum sentence for child trafficking is five years; the crime is particularly serious, punishable by death, and property confiscation is punishable.
The maximum penalty is high, and in the light of the large trend towards lighter sentences, the crime of child trafficking is clearly a more serious crime.
But still, a number of trafficking cases occur every year.
You see, some people are behind in their notions of child rearing, and their legal awareness is weak.
Legal education for this part of the population should be followed at the same time.
To effectively control trafficking, enforcement cannot be limited to strict enforcement.
If the market for smuggling is widespread, if the smugglers are willing, if they are constantly innovating the means of smuggling, if they are fighting law enforcement, then smuggling operations will inevitably fall into the dirt of inefficiency.
Thus, breaking down backward ideas, spreading common sense of the law, also helps to root out the crime of child trafficking.
At the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the State Party Congress, 东 preached the spirit of the party at the Mazh Mountain.
Drawing on the centuries-old history of the party's struggle to achieve its goals is a driving force.
On the morning of December 10, according to a unanimous arrangement by the provincial committee, the provincial committee's standing committee and the provincial commission's propaganda minister, Zhongdong, conducted an interactive campaign in the Mazhong Video Village, deepened learning about the spirit of the party's nineteenth session, learned about the spirit of the party's sixth session, learned about the spirit of the speech of Xi Jinping's general secretary to the main event in Hunan, learned about the spirit of the twelfth party session.
From the three aspects of ideal belief and primary mission, self-revolution and youth party, party leader and party theory, 东 combined his own insight, personal experience, deep insight, and comprehensive systematically outlined the core values and practical requirements of the whole assembly spirit.
He noted that to emphasize the spirit of the General Assembly and the important speech of Xi Jinping's Secretary General to Hunan, the importance of directing the spirit of critique, the spirit of the provincial Party Congress to combine learning, integration and integration, to strengthen the defense of the two established zh, to achieve the two maintaining  thoughts, political consciousness, action consciousness, and to move forward steadily in the direction of the direction of Xi Jinping's Secretary General.
In the interactive exchanges, the representatives of the grassroots, the representatives of the corporations, the youth table were asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of the two established ones, how cultural enterprises can take direction, how the youth of the new era can draw strength from the centuries of party history, how to use common language, how to live life, how to parrot youth members, how to draw strength from the centuries of party struggle, how to unite close to the party center, how to stay firmly in the party, how to dedicate the youth to the responsibility of writing and writing books.

In fact, we don't know if we've made a mistake in the store or the rider's mistake.
There was no evidence in the bag.
Can't track down the name.
I hope you understand the situation.
Because the delivery time is 30 minutes faster than the display.
No more, thank you.
Yes, I have already replaced a rider.
He's been waiting a long time.
That restaurant has been saying that it is in the process of processing.
I waited for a few hours.
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two major categories, namely Virgin Olive Oil and refined olive oil, into five categories.
Primitive olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the fat obtained directly from fresh olive oil after it has been mechanically refrigerated, filtered, and treated to remove the foreign matter.
 The difference in acidity can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin: is the highest quality olive oil, a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, the aroma of the plants of the people of Tayazhya has a pleasant aroma, the acidity is not more than 1%.
Fine Virgin olive oil: slightly higher in acidity, but not more than 2%, pure in taste, and fragrant in aroma.
Ordinary Virgin olive oil: taste and flavor are still available, with an acidity of no more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil obtained after refining the original olive oil with a acidity of more than 3.3%, or becoming a secondary oil.
zh refined olive oil can be divided into two classes:
Olive Oil: refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of primordial olive oil to match flavor and color, its acidity is less than 1.5%, and it is transparent to a pale yellowish yellowish color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: is an olive oil extracted from refined oil and obtained by dissolving it in oilseed.
You should have noticed, having looked at the grade classifications, that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
Remember, olive oil, like grapes made from wine, comes from different production areas, different olive varieties, and produces different olive oil standards.
The best growing areas for olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for olive oil growth, such as temperature, sunlight, humidity and rainfall.
Other areas besides the Mediterranean coast can only grow small parts in the habitable zone.
The main production areas of the Mediterranean Sea are:
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and similar climates are also found in the far south of Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc.
Monthly extract of olive oil:
Every year from 3 to June, the olive tree blooms and bears fruit, from 7 to October the fruit begins to develop and ripen, the fruit transitions from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February of the following year is the fruit harvesting season, but the freshness of olive oil is important.
The nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely, oily and essential fatty acids, and ammonia, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most nutritious oil of all the fats found to date.
At the end of the Democratic Summit, Biden called the fire of freedom "unquenchable".
The Summit for Democracy, an online democracy summit convened by US President Biden and attended by leaders of governments, civil society and the private sector in 110 countries around the world, concludes on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burned in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that authoritarian regimes could never put it out.
He also said that he plans to hold the second Global Democratic Summit next year.
Representative of the Taiwanese government, State Council member Dong and Hong Kong democracy rights activist Rozhong Shom, currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit the following day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the task ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because I have said before, as this summit has shown, that the democratic world is everywhere.
A dictatorial regime can never put out the micro-fire of freedom, it burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world.
Biden also said that defending democracy requires a concerted effort by society as a whole.
He said:   As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen democracy, promote reform, achieve accountability governance that is transparent, more able to withstand the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to pursue power first and foremost before the public interest       
The theme of the second day of the Democratic Summit was to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and oppose authoritarianism, and counter digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values.
This day coincides with the International Day of Human Rights.
In his opening speech, UN Secretary-General Guterres also said that democracy faces global challenges, especially those posed by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "It is time to reaffirm common values and positions, as well as democracy".
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, indigenousism and extremism, including all tools offered by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong's democracy rights activist Roh Cwon Shom spoke at the summit via pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and minority ethnic groups in China such as Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said:   For a long time, the World Bank was directly supported by China, but no mechanism was established to hold it accountable.
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use all the resources we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority.
Rozh Chunyang also called on the free world to unite against the threat posed by the Communist Party of China.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy Xi Jinping, some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, some of you don't realize the threat to our democratic values.
And that is why we have failed.
This is also why we must change.
 Taiwan's Administrative Council of State Member, Tao Tao, attending a roundtable discussion on the fight against digital dictatorship, affirming democratic values, released a video of the State of the Union Declaration, stressing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience of how to fight the coronavirus outbreak through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said:  At the height of the Taiwanese Democratic Party, we have always been determined to be at the forefront of global counter-authoritarianism, and to play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments everywhere have shown signs of a downturn in global democracy in the name of public health and the collective interest, justifying human rights violations, and justifying the use of force.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to block the city to control the epidemic, we do not have to get off the ground to defeat false information.
Just as the second day of the Democratic Summit was underway, the US Treasury announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China, North Korea, who were found to be in serious violation of human rights, and investment restrictions against a Chinese company found to be using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

I know that.
But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying delivery times.
It was supposed to be #NUMBER#zh.
I didn't call you anyway.
I haven't eaten much yet.
I'm sure I'll complain about it.
If you can't send it, why not tell me early?
I've been waiting for you so long.

Hello, the food from the restaurant is fresh.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up, so I'm looking for a more or less pricey coach first.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices are often in proportion to the degree of friendliness, and if you can't tell, expensive normal situations will be more friendly than cheap, industrial garbage.
They are very low in intensity, the ball hits the beat, the vibration is very high, the hard ball cannot move, the high-handed can hardly drive.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, knowing that you will not learn, or know that you can afford to buy expensive, messing up cheap stuff, you two players, never playing again, so that the beat is cheap, and you will not feel pain.
Until you can really tell good and bad, show you've made progress, when you come back to me to buy expensive, I'll pay you twice.
Suggesting to spend similar prices, buy a second hand ball shot, choose Prince, or a Pu, these two brands are notorious enough, so a good ball shot doesn't sell for much, a new shot 500, 600 is fine, a second hand 200 is fine, and having a thousand yen shot is a disgusting pleasure?
They are friendly to newcomers, but they are just as bad after the newcomer stage, but most people, especially girls, are not good enough to get through the newcomer stage.
The order has been delayed several times for delivery.
Can you please help me keep up?
 delayed delay  delayed delay
Thank you.
I mean, do I actually already have credit?
Do I need to reorder next, without the original word being used?
Well, I've tasted the food in this restaurant, but the food delivered was missing a lot, and the mouthwash was also fresh.

In fact, there is a lot of discussion about how to dress for a fat girl.
The skirts worn by fat girls should not be too short or too long, the length is almost at the knee, just where the fat thighs can be covered.
Short periods of time will reveal the fatness of the legs.
Being too long can make you feel short and fat.
If you go out and split up the upper and lower three sections, it turns out that you have naturally increased in height, that is, the upper body, the upper body and the upper body with different colors, and it seems to produce a sense of healing.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the hallmark of obese girls (the author has already seen this), dark-colored is also a good way to mask your body fat, and elegant black shorts are also the preferred choice for obese girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially black shorts, will make you look slimmer.
If your thighs are fat, don't wear your pants and shoes too noticeably.
The more popular the better, the more colorless the color.
So that when people pay attention to your legs and feet, you don't make them feel fat.
For a slightly overweight girl, it is important to talk about the appropriate dress and grooming.
Fat girls should not wear tight shorts, and coats should not be too short or too tight in the pants, which will make people look uncomfortable, if legs are thick, black long pants or the kind of shorts), choose a material-soft printing horn, paired with a tight collar coat, can well cover up fat girls' shortcomings.
Of course, the fat little girls are also very careful about wearing shorts.
Fat girls wear shorts, should choose a shirt that matches the shorts' color, so that you can increase the height of your fat body.
A short pair of high-heeled shoes can make your legs look longer, but this is the most IN summer pair!
If you are fat on the body but have thin legs, we recommend choosing a luxurious short skirt.
Not only can it cover the large belly, but it can also showcase your strengths.
A short word will be thin, more suitable for fat girls, a coat to choose tighter, forming a layered feel will be thinner.
 simple simple simple white T-shirt with short, fatMM can also be tried
Fat girls are also capable of wearing fashionable clothes.
As long as they can master the rules of dress and grooming, skinny girls will also be the focus of attention.
With changes in dress and exercise in your life, try to get rid of the label of a fat girl a day early.

The girl was given the opportunity to donate to her sister: " To think of it as a skin injury is also good " - Newsnet
A girl in Hangzhou's Wuhan Square was standing in front of a large wooden board, on which was written 人肉子, ten yuan one arrow.
Yesterday morning, a Hangzhou girl who was photographed as a fundraiser for her sister blew up her circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in Hangzhou's Wozhong Square in front of a slightly larger wooden board, with the inscription on the board 人肉子, ten-yū arrow, showing the wayfarer's payment, using a bow-shoot.
This behavior has sparked a heated debate among netizens.
Last night, the head of the suburban propaganda division of the Hangzhou City Public Security Office confirmed to the Xinjing newspaper that the police confirmed that the girl had taken such an extreme step to raise money for her sister, but that this behavior was not worth advocating, after being warned that the girl had left the local post yesterday.
Girls in the streets are being charged with money laundering.
In the image, a tall-haired girl with a zh-type font stands before a large wooden board, on which black ink is written with 人肉子, the words of a ten-yū arrow, and on another board in front of her her is written her bank account and WeChat, payment account, etc.
The image sparked controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believe this is a begging act, and many have expressed sympathy for it.
What we found was that on the 23rd, around 10am, we were patrolling the square, when the crowd was already a lot.
The local police, who were interviewed by local media, said that two girls in the stands, all in their 20s, dressed as teenagers.
Among them, the girl who was playing the game of human flesh was crying, asking the street people to play the game; another girl was helping her drink on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia, now urgently needed surgery, please help everyone.
 We contacted the local police in Guizhou, learning that the girl was being funded for the treatment of her sister's leukemia.
Last night, the head of the publicity division of the Hangzhou City Public Security Agency told a reporter for the New York Times that the girl, named Gujari, had made a donation to her sister Gujarizh.
But since treatment still required over 300,000 dollars, he only committed this act when he could not think of a good way to raise funds.
He said that during the whole process, two girls, one as a shooter, one in charge of hand-shaking, but not involved in it, did not find anyone shooting arrows, but just someone surrounded and took pictures posted to Weibo.
After police and security personnel identified the bow used was not regulated.
The person in charge said that he did not advocate for this kind of fundraising.
After being warned by the people of her post, she left the post.

What's the hottest 2021?
It was definitely the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only the Olympic Games can win prizes?
The article is hot, which mentions that on many projects, project managers can definitely be on the front lines, without anyone else: moving, going, going is the project manager's daily routine, rescuing fires, backing, apologizing, and even not speaking.
An article that seemed like a joke, but also exposed the daily bitterness of project managers, which was behind the lack of attention paid to current project management work.
And people who work in project management also gradually choose to get out of the workplace by taking some action.
From the year-on-year increase in enrollment for PMPs, more and more project management practitioners are improving their own project management skills through learning.
According to the China Project Management Twentieth Century Development Report (1999-2019): As of September 2019, the country's cumulative PMP® number of applicants was nearly 600,000, about 420,000 certified PMP®, and about 300,000 validly certified PMP® holders, accounting for 31.2% of the global PMP® total.
The number of PMPs holding witnesses has been increasing year by year for the past decade, indicating that more and more project managers are realizing that simply by moving past past past experiences to do things that are no longer possible, a changing work environment lets us know that we need to learn, stand on the shoulders of science giants and explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP exam ensure that project management is smoothly conducted?
Many project management beginners say that by studying related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master relevant knowledge points such as the top ten areas of project management and the top five process groups, but it is still a foggy time to actually do project management work.
Many project managers often face the following questions:  Project management is not in place, relies solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, does not know how to practice;  Lack of systematic project management process system support, failure to land at work, poor project estimates, lack of control sensitivity, delay in project;  Member division is unclear;  Team membership is unclear;  Cross-sectoral assistance is not communicated properly, project progress is difficult......
Therefore, the focus on product innovation and R&D management has helped many excellent companies to develop a large number of key R&D talent such as product managers, project managers, and has earned the honorary title of China China Enterprise R&D Manager Training Demonstration Base, which has come with the R&D Project Manager Training Online Course.
This is an online method of learning fragments chemistry, combining real-world cases, tools and methods from numerous R&D companies, to help you master the essential knowledge and standards of project management, and to take the next step in managing your own projects.
It is also an opportunity for businesses to use lower costs and less investment, facilitate the process of training project managers, and bring more efficient operating results to the enterprise.
Let's see how other students evaluate the course: This course is not only developed by a team of experts in China, but combines international advanced project management methodology with real-world business scenarios from many well-known companies, providing in-depth, professional presentations of the course content.
It will also provide scientifically practical management tools and methods, rich templates, and help students translate their learning content after class to apply to specific tasks.

On the eve of the meeting, the consumer was advised to advocate for rational consumption - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website.
This year, the volume of transactions in the national network payments business reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a relatively high innovation from the previous year.
The abundance of red-hot, eye-catching live broadcasts once again brought consumers a huge boost, this consumer boom, which on the one hand has made national consumption more powerful, and on the other hand, we must calmly reflect on the impact of consumerism on society and on the mainstream consumer groups of today.
On the eve of the arrival of the newly-formed company, Zhejiang Consumer Financial Limited (Zhejiang) has issued a rational consumption initiative, reminding the general public, especially young people, to develop good consumer awareness and consumer habits, rejecting blind consumption and overconsumption.
According to the People's Bank's Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released this year, the results show that the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 from 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents perform better in terms of financial consumption, but there is a large disparity in financial behavior and skills, and there is a need to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The relatively low level of financial literacy among older adults and young adults,  old and young,  will remain a focus of ongoing attention in financial education; the Nielsen report on China's youth debt situation and the 2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report published by CFC Finance show that young people have a huge consumption potential, credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumerism, 86.6% of young people use credit products, almost half of them have no debt accumulation, and the younger generation, although the overall trend is rational consumption, despite the over-exercise of the over-exercise of the over-exercise of the over-exercise of the over-exercise of the over-exercise of the over-exercise of the over-exercise of the over-exercise of the over-exercise of the over-exercise
As a licensed consumer financial institution, JSC has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with quality, attentive services, advocating for consumers to have a good, right consumer view, and actively responding to the regulatory call to increase consumer consciousness, especially among younger groups, through practical action.
Over the past several years, JSC has been conducting a wide-ranging, diversified financial knowledge outreach campaign targeting youth groups including university students, and through collaboration with top national institutions, has been conducting innovative practice competitions in various forms, including potentially immobilizing young people's consumer needs, helping them establish rational consumption concepts, rationally planning consumer needs, and thus helping them accumulate wealth in their lives.
In the run-up to the 2012 election, Jetsin reminded all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumer awareness and a correct monetary outlook, boycott blind consumption and overconsumption, avoid consumer borrowing mistakes, and avoid affecting personal signage and future economic life.
When consuming, be sure to plan ahead, quantify and pay back on time.
If the overdue, overdue records are recorded in the personal credit report, it may have a negative impact on the economic life of the future, such as car, home, and other purchases.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also important to choose the legal institutions and channels, and pay attention to verifying that the relevant institutions have the operational qualifications.
In the future, JSC will continue to be as it has been with its mature, reliable consumer financial system and ever-changing financial products, bringing consumers more demand-friendly and diversified services, continuously helping the masses to raise their financial knowledge level, helping consumers cultivate rational consumption, the concept of moderate borrowing, and being a trusted consumer financial partner for life.

 Vietnamese People's Net - The Gulf Cooperation Commission is addressing common challenges.
The stops of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman include Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit by Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, which led to the diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In the midst of the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties to Iran.
Foreign tensions have severely affected the internal unity of the Haitian People's Congress, negatively affecting the economy of the country in the region.
Four Arab states have blocked the land-based air route to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement on solidarity and stability between the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its borders with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar by both countries.
The Arab states of the Gulf resolve their differences, and to restore relations with Qatar, they demand that they unite to secure their interests and regional stability, and that they meet common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel and integration of the supply chain for citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two companies have signed 13 Memoranda of Understanding on Cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincides with Iran's meeting with world powers to negotiate the Iran nuclear deal under the name Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal that the Gulf Arab states condemn for failing to resolve Iran's missile problem.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a long-term competitor, and have viewed Iran's nuclear program as a threat to regional security.
The Gulf states consider that failing to address Iran's missile problem and to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
In the wake of the failure of the Gulf states to meet the demands of the major powers for nuclear talks with Iran, Saudi Arabia has conducted direct negotiations with Iran.
Its aim is to reduce tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that is slowing the growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council's national economy.
The upcoming summit of the Haitian People's Congress will be the first summit of the Haitian people since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Commission to reassess the diplomatic achievements of its contribution to the restoration of the unification of the Gulf Cooperation Council, while also proposing measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate, to meet common challenges, and to contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf states.

The Zhongshan super-run is the largest emission!
This car, which our team has brought to you this time, is the dream of many men!
It was Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's next generation model  Aventador LP700-4!
If it costs almost two million yuan, a year's road tax tens of thousands of yuan, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it would be?
Even if the small group doesn't know it, the data says that the 0-100km/h acceleration takes only 2.9 seconds, probably because the small group's myvi is about to reach 30km/h, while the family is about 100km/h,
The short body, the long slit doors, the huge entrance doors that span the entire body, and the unlimited 6.5 v12 engine below the glass, perfectly interpret Lamborghini's style.
No need to say too much about the car's description, Google yourself, and the editor has compiled some explanations that Google doesn't necessarily give!
It's too popular, going wherever everyone is looking, it's so uncomfortable!
1km of oil costs about RM1 (the driver doesn't care)
Practice the posture of getting in and out of the car, otherwise you will be a little embarrassed (because you will not be able to climb out of the car and then get stuck halfway).
The engine is too loud, and you'll be deaf after you get off the car.
The car is too big, so parking in the normal parking lot will be narrow, too afraid to be knocked on the door by the next car!
A little lonely, because there was no opponent on the road (as the narrator himself said, nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, this video of the superrun is not for sale, sorry!
 Friends who would like to shoot videos for your car lover, welcome to contact us!
 More information about cars you might not know about, can be found at The Car Guide / People's Automobile Guide.
It's a car accident worth tens of millions!
The Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are both known to car owners, and the Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the Porsche 911 is also a million-dollar car!
Before that day, a million 911s and 10 million Chiron supercars had crashed abroad in just minutes!
Look at the results, you're reasonable!
Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times echo frequently.
The so-called university spirit, a set of office ideas and value pursuits that a university has developed over the course of its development, is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been vital to the political, economic, cultural, technological, social development, even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, the university has carried out a unique mission unlike any other social organization, for the University of China, which arose in the autumn of the national crisis, its spirit more deeply influenced by traditional culture and changing times, advocating for the Ming Ji, the values of Zhijiang and the patriotism of the Qing dynasty.
Currently, the information technology of higher education, the increasingly visible trends in internationalisation, the global educational competition, the technological competition, the competition among talent, the higher education sector as an important supply side, its structural reforms are facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of a comprehensive plan to promote world-class universities and top-tier academic disciplines, while demonstrating the confidence and determination of China to move from a higher education power to a higher education power, also raised higher updated requirements for university development.
How can we strive to become world leaders in a shorter period of time, accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a group of world-class disciplines on the basis of a still-definite gap, and achieve the supercar?
In addition to solid goal confidence, path confidence, capacity confidence, the university should also fully exploit three advantages: first, the backward advantage, by continuously bringing in outstanding academic talent abroad, learning to leverage the advanced experience of world-class universities, achieving a significant improvement in academic level and quality of teaching; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization in the five-thousand-year period, developing an excellent traditional culture, thereby consolidating strengths, shaping brands, enhancing image; third, the institutional advantage, playing out the institutional advantage of socialist countries, strengthening the goal drive, pooling consensus power, optimizing resource allocation, accelerating the delivery of sustainable real estate to schools beyond the advanced level of the world.
Especially be aware that building a world-class university is not possible on the one hand, and that each school, while enjoying its own advantage, must emphasize its own personality and characteristics
Office features have in common both Chinese features and reflect their unique target location, office traditions and resource allocation.
At Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three aspects of the institutional environment: first, highlighting the characteristics of innovative entrepreneurship that develops talent, building a unified teaching environment, creating a unified human resource environment that combines academic enterprises, forming a whole-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, highlighting the characteristics of cross-disciplinary organizations, promoting the optimization of the discipline system, creating a cross-disciplinary institutional environment, actively cultivating cross-disciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic cross-outcomes; third, highlighting the characteristics of office systems and social services, conducting deep international exchange cooperation, and accelerating the formation of a system of pan-industry research and development cooperation.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, to let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate frequently.
For the University of Zhejiang, the need for innovation, the common values of the discipline, the discipline, the discipline, the understanding, and the values of the university, and the newest expression of the spirit of the state, together constitute the newest system of expression of the spirit of the state.
This is an important guarantee that schools adhere to the right direction of instruction, continuously accumulate cultural heights, concentrate spiritual strength, are rich in meaning, have a deep meaning.
Among them,  Heina River emphasizes an open spirit of inclusion, reflects the spirit of innovation that I use for my  underworld talents, reflects the quality ideology of educators who are taking the world's leading schools;  启真厚德 emphasizes the spirit of truthfulness, which means that universities are more accepting of the virtues and personalities of truth while pursuing truth;  开元民 expresses the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes both the quest for knowledge, scientific innovation, and the expression of reform and development, hence                                
This series of spiritual ideas and values pursuit is the essence of the 120-year office of Zhejiang University.
The wise hear silently, the intelligent see the invisible.
As China's higher education institutions further establish the overall socialist agenda of China, take a deep grasp of the historical mission of the times and responsibilities of higher education, accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adhering to human caring and independent liberty, let the university spirit and the spirit of the age, the national spirit, interact with each other, thus providing the inexhaustible impetus for the achievement of national prosperity and national revival, the realization of the common ideal of humanity.

With the advent of NFT, the crypto community has once again come up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact on Southeast Asia, with some residents losing jobs due to the pandemic starting to earn steady income from the game.
Axis Infinity is a blockchain-based game of cat-and-mouse, bringing together a variety of gameplay including NFTs, the highest-trading NFT project to date, with over $3 billion in total transactions to date.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity earned more than $8.2 million a day, directly to the Crown.
On August 6, 2017, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily user base had exceeded 1 million.
The heat of Axie Infinity will pass a new mode of learning to more people, with the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players will no longer be a single character, but will not only be able to enjoy and benefit from the game and the economy, but also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game maker, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news story about the price of a friend's share, my biggest touch was the choice of the company on the track, that is, the choice of the industry to invest in, first to choose a large growth space, at least 100 billion or more in market size; second, to choose a future growth-friendly industry, considering the best-case scenario for industry growth in the next 3-5 years; and finally, to choose an industry with policy support.
How wide a track is indicates the size of the market, how long a track is indicates the development stage of the industry, whether the track is flat or rough indicates the competitive landscape of the industry.
Fuel for the right track!
The first thing to do in the new year is to summarize 2021  adjust the 2022 tactical layout 
Tactics is about doing the right thing, that is, doing the right thing.
Strategy is about doing the right thing, that is, doing the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about landing, and above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, over how to increase customer numbers, think about whether the current area is continuously deepening or extending horizontally; over how to improve customer retention rates, think about how to improve core customer and high-value customer retention rates; over how to set the right activity KPIs, achieve the right activity goals, such as whether to increase target customer engagement, activate high-value silent customers, and improve retention; over how to improve DAU, think about how to improve strategic thinking, think about the current growth and health sustainability.
12 years after its birth, Bitcoin has set several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador legalized Bitcoin as legal tender, making it the first time that Bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the SEC approved ProShares' Bitcoin ETF launch for the first time in eight years, and it was floated on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to enter the U.S. capital market, and the re-expansion of the cryptocurrency investment gateway.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not a main player.
Bitcoin has undergone a soft fork upgrade called Taproot, which improves the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduces the data load on transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American groups complained of discrimination in admission to three Ivy League schools, including Yale-China.
More than 130 Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting the discrimination of Asian-American applicants at Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College during their admissions process.
The Asian-American Education Union, which filed the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
At the conference, the group's chairman, Liu Yue, said that over the past decade, the number of Asian-American applicants who qualify for admission to the U.S. universities has doubled, but that of the three U.S. universities, the proportion of Asian-Americans has remained essentially the same.
Many studies have shown that these universities have long-term continuity and systematically discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process of the so-called "comprehensive examination".
A 2014 study by scholars such as Sanders showed that in these three universities, the relative number of applicants, Asian-Americans had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that of all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian-American students, while Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American students for more than 20 years.
宇空 told Xinhua News Agency that they expect that after filing a complaint, the U.S. Department of Education, Department of Justice, and the U.S. Department of Justice will be able to investigate and, after the facts have been established, take steps to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions.
They also expect the complained universities to take a more active role in this issue, changing the admissions policy for Asian-Americans.
At present, the three universities complained about have not responded.
The Asian-American Education Union was founded in 2015 when it filed a complaint about admission discrimination at Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education declined to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American community involved in the complaint, there were also American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups involved.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a house broker about a factory in the town of Zhujiang Yue丈亭, after several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, after Mr. Luozh had discussed the details of the purchase of the factory with Lin Mao, the family of the homeowner, he was able to cash the sum of 200,000 yuan on the same day through bank transfers.
Lin Mu is signed as a recipient on the terms of the purchase agreement, which states, "If the buyer does not wish to buy the factory, the purchase agreement shall be returned to the seller, if the seller does not wish to sell the factory, the purchase agreement shall be signed within one week".
However, afterwards, the parties failed to reach a consensus on the main terms of the contract, such as the extent of the sale of the factory, the method of payment, and so on, leading to the late failure of the home purchase and sale contract.
Given that the parties were unable to reach a consensus on the terms of the contract, after a few days, Lin Mao returned the 200,000 yuan settlement to Mr. Luo.
The house that seemed to be unsightly, the money was paid, the rent was ready, the contract was about to be signed, but the seller did not sell, which angered Mr. Luo.
To this end, Mr. Lu has brought an appeal against Lin Mao to the People's Court of Yuzhzheng City.
The court's referee held that the parties ultimately failed to enter into a formal contract, cannot be solely blamed on the defendant, should reasonably be presumed to have failed to negotiate, and therefore the case should not be subject to a fine, without the defendant being liable for defaulting on the double refund of the fine.
After the trial court's ruling, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.

After the end of the "Democracy Summit" on Friday, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry said in a speech that the United States was hosting the "Leader Democracy Summit", which was "led by ideological lines, democratic tooling, arming, fake democracy's name against the reality of democracy, fomenting a splinter resistance, transferring domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on people, pushed for 'democratic transformation', abused unilateral sanctions, orchestrated a 'color revolution' and caused disastrous consequences".
Democracy has long been a "weapon of mass destruction" for U.S. interference in other countries.
This summit is an act of Biden's fulfillment of his campaign promise.
The two-day conference, which was held via video, invited leaders from 111 countries around the world, including Taiwanese leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States over the issue of America's own democracy, saying that the United States was not eligible to host such a summit.
While there are also international and domestic questions, such as criticism of invited leaders including some authoritarian dictatorships, such as those in the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, some have questioned the true intent of the Biden administration to organize the summit not for democratic but geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Prime Minister Scholtz also attended the Video Democracy Summit.
In a statement Saturday, China's Foreign Ministry said that "the current American-style democratic illness, the growing problems of money politics, identity politics, political party antagonism, political polarization, social rift, racial contradictions, wealth disparity, etc".
President Biden said in a speech, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen democracy, push for reform, achieve accountability governance that is transparent, more able to withstand the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public interest".
He stressed that democracy is not a matter of course, "We must constantly update it from generation to generation, and in my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our time".
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "in the face of ongoing and worrying challenges, democracy needs a fighter to defend".
The U.S. pledged to launch a one-year campaign, including a $4244 million initiative, after the Democratic Summit to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that prior to the planned physical democracy summit in late 2022, countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems.
"Let all of our countries live up to our commitments and report on our progress next year", Biden said.
Well, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.

What is the law of red card whiskey?
Everyone has different tastes, someone likes to collect, someone likes to eat, of course, someone likes to drink, red card whiskey is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in different countries, and red card whiskey has won the International Beer Awards Gold.
Each bottle of red-card whiskey has a unique flavor, but if you don't know how to taste it, you're not spoiling the aroma.
So how about red card whiskey?
Below is a brief introduction for you.
Red card whiskey is legal:
The Zanni Red Card Whisky is a blend of about 35 varieties of Scotch Whisky, with a rich aroma and characteristics of traditional Scotch Whisky, with a sweet and smoky flavor in the rich aroma.
The fresh, slightly flavored alcohol, and the bitter tobacco flavor are added.
The drink can be directly added to ice drinks, or mixed with your favorite drink.
When red-card whiskey entered the country, bubble drinks such as red-card whiskey+coffee or snow or newt became a perennial fad to suit the tastes of the people of the country.
These sweet drinks, besides being able to taste sweet and sour, visually bring pleasure, adding to the drink, and resulting in a taste-changing effect.

The three types above are the best ways to drink red card whiskey, and you can try them as a reference, hoping the introduction to the book will help you.
Educational thinking: how to make university exams allow students to gain their own grades.
Three students at Lanzhou Transport University wrote letters to the school leadership, reflecting the confusion about the university exam, and proposed improving the difficulty of the exam, changing the test subject, so that the exam truly reflects the demands of the actual student level.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a hot topic.
On the university campus, students come from five different backgrounds, varying skill levels, plus different levels of learning, and different learning situations.
 For the evaluation of groups with such a variety of characteristics, there are different perceptions, where inevitable.
Of course, if the test subject is single, repetitive, and the subject is too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who do not use kung fu may be able to achieve a pre-exam focused attack, but if they think of other methods, they may be able to achieve a half-quantified effect.
In this way, the standard of education emerges, where students can pass or even score high without taking a regular course, work, and notes, and exams are not as good as the usual.
In this way, students who grew up in Lanzhou reflect the problems that exist in university exams, not without reason, believing that this situation does not exist only in Lanzhou.
In this sense, congratulations should be given to the three students who wrote the letter directly.
In fact, it is not uncommon for people who have gone to university to take the exam, to take the exam from the teacher, to try to cover the exam, to get the exam before the exam, to get the exam before the exam, and even to take the exam with a small copy, to ask the teacher to raise his hand after the exam.
In my opinion, as a guideline for evaluating teaching quality, measuring whether a university passes an exam is more about the teacher's comprehensive understanding of teaching and learning, and the scientific propositions on which it is based.
 entering the undergraduate phase of university, the professional began to divide, many professional courses were based on basic knowledge
Whether or not a complete mastery of a subject's basic knowledge is a matter for the university examination.
While basic knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic knowledge of the subject, from a knowledge point of view, the space for change is not large, it is basically fixed.
As some teachers have said, the basic knowledge of mathematics at the university 20 years ago is still in the works, or at the center of it.
But the knowledge points remain essentially the same, not representing a single test type, repetition of the test.
In many universities, the test is usually composed of a set of subjects, followed by a test composed of a group of senior faculty members, and the test reading is also taken by the entire faculty of the department, thus overcoming the repetition of the test to some extent.
But to develop a set of practical tests that are consistent with teaching and learning, the test is based on the overall situation of student learning, difficulty in formulating a formal distribution, a comprehensive mastery of teaching, a comprehensive analysis of student learning, so that the test proposal has a dynamic grasp of difficulty, can both highlight basic knowledge and ability tests, while innovating the design of the test.
The exam is the guiding principle of university education, what kind of exam, students will have a corresponding reserve program, will affect the results of university education in the long run.
 The student advisory letter, which is highly valued by the statewide school board, has been deployed throughout the school to improve the program.
Requiring teachers from organizing teaching units to conduct research and curriculum-based examination self-checks, formulate test subject propositions and related systems, while strengthening supervision and inspection of test subject propositions and review sections, detailing performance evaluation, and strengthening comprehensive review of all aspects of curriculum-based teaching.
From a mechanical point of view, solving the problem of single type of test, repetition of test is a problem faced by university examinations, of course, a corresponding system needs to be established, but the task is important in everyday life, it requires teachers to have full control of the teaching situation, not only to digest the teaching content, but also to digest the student learning situation, both of which are better integrated, teaching and learning will be better matched, forming a good interaction, and the examinations will also be more in line with the practical, thus making the different academic and academic standards more relevant.
If it is not possible to change the location of my branch, can I change it to an export?
Then I don't have to give you more money, do I?
The order of my colleague has already been shipped.
The whole thing is not finished.
GPS is not there yet.
Ms. 金zh married photography(South Street Shop)  For the time being there is no branch yet.
Because we had not scheduled our time before the shoot, having changed it twice, consultant Ranjlan patiently helped us to schedule our time.
Later, I chose a weather-friendly weekend shot.
Ms. Kimzh's staff, whether as consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are highly appreciated.
It was my first formal make-up in my life, and I can't believe I'm going to look so good one day, too.
Xiaojie and another sister (sorry I can't remember the name) are super patient, and make-up is natural too.
The view was taken in the city of Yangtze, and thankfully the weather was nice that day, it wasn't cold, while taking pictures, makeup artists occasionally observed our clothes, headgear, a little bit of a problem, and immediately helped us clean up.
The photographer was also very humorous, and the next day they were all happy to take pictures.
When it comes to selecting photos, because I've seen so many cases online, I don't want guests to delete too many photos, but when we choose photos, really, we don't have the slightest sense of adding photos, 24 of the direct packs, none of them are added (listening to my cousin who spent almost all my time taking wedding photos, over 7,000 packs plus over 10,000 photos, I was shocked, and I was afraid I'd choose too many)
Today's photo was fixed, and Randall sent it to me, and I saw two that didn't feel good, and they immediately helped me repair it.
Compared to taking pictures of my sister's previous photos, I feel our photos are really satisfying, just fresh, and that's the style I want.
I would highly recommend that you go and take a wedding photo of Mrs. Zhangjing!
The price of the set is $3,999 USD.
Thank you, Mrs. Kimzh, for your sincere wishes of happiness and happiness, as well as your past!
How much does this set cost?
That $32 is what conditions must be met to be used.
That's fine, no refunds needed.
Your rider said he couldn't find it.
Can't find it at all.
But I still couldn't understand his English.

Shabba3200 newborn babies without paperwork for special anti-counterfeiting paper and delivery.
The National Registry of Sabah said that due to the special anti-counterfeiting paper storage light, it was not possible to issue birth certificates to first-born babies since early October, with 3,200 affected people accumulated so far.
However, the agency's director, Keru Aminuz, has assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificate, the information has been recorded in the system, will be returned when the counterfeit paper is shipped next week.
He explained at a press conference that a news outlet, Shabazh, had been reporting on the issue of printing paper for up to 10 months.
He said that the issue had already arisen two months earlier, and Sarajevo was facing the same problem.
 One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers of specialty anti-counterfeit paper have been affected by the epidemic, causing delays in shipments to China zh.
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used by Shaba newspapers was different from other regions, and therefore could not be used to buy stocks from other states.
Keru Aminuzh revealed that the latest batches of anti-counterfeiting paper had been shipped to Kuala Lumpur on 6th of this month, and then handed over to the printing company on 8th, for partial printing work.
The Bureau will send a man to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday to collect the goods, return to Shaba immediately for the final printing phase, which is estimated to take up to 2 working days (December 20) to be delivered to the applicant.
 We will notify the applicant to travel to the various departments to obtain the application form.
He added that so far this year, Shaba's has issued a total of 24,801 newspapers.
From 7 p.m. until now.
Was that just a little too soon?

On 21st, 22nd and 2nd, the Beijing City Primary School Admissions Senior High School Examination was conducted by the Unified District Teaching Commission.
This year, Beijing's districts have reduced the number of students enrolled in special education, and the competition for special education is more fierce.

48 hours of nucleic acid negative, setting a buffer zone, the State Council's Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and the development of a request to strengthen the control of the epidemic in port cities - Xinhua Network
The State Council's Joint Defense Mechanism issued a notice on the strengthening of the work on the control of the outbreak in port cities, requiring people to leave the recent land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong, Macau) to have a 48-hour negative test for nucleic acid, to travel to the land border port city and to have at least one nuclear test after arrival of personnel.
zh According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date of the port city's establishment and announcement by the provincial municipalities to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that conditional port cities could study setting up epidemic control buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
According to the National Health and Safety Commission, the responsible person for the Office of Disease Control and Prevention, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the region, and people from both sides visit frequently.
 Implement a policy of differentiation management, changing from one controlled outflow to two, with the aim of achieving a lockdown forward, squeezing outflow risks, achieving maximum effectiveness in epidemic control with minimal social impact, minimum social costs and minimum social costs
There have been several recent outbreaks of domestic congestion in China, both outbreaks from abroad and imports through port cities.
The notice noted that this exposed some local epidemic monitoring issues such as premature alerting, failure to implement close-loop management for high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing of the flow into form, failure to eliminate cold chain items, irregular management of the concentration camp, and insufficient scientific accuracy in emergency management of epidemics.
The notification requirement is to focus on nine areas, from improving the epidemic control mechanism in port cities, to a sound epidemic surveillance and alert system, to implementing border control measures, to accelerating the completion of the shortcomings of port city control, to unrelentingly, to scientific precision in the prevention of the disease, to tightening the external and internal border entry lines.
The notice stresses that port cities must simultaneously study, deploy, publish and implement the emergency response hotline, regularly check the risks of basic life supplies, prices, and so on, and address and respond to the pressing issues reflected in the mass response in a timely manner.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include open land, water, air and water ports, the counties where the city is located, the districts where the flag is located, the districts where the city is located, the provinces where the city is located, the jurisdictions where the city is located, the specific scope of the districts where the city is located, the districts where the city is located, the districts where the city is located, the districts where the city is located, the districts where the city is located, the districts where the city is located, the districts where the city is located, the districts where the city is located, the districts where the city is located, the districts where the city is located, the districts where the city is located, the specific scope of the districts where the city is

The video of the pipeline begins with the truth about the 20 years of bloodthirsty killing of the U.S. military.
(Video source: oil pipeline)
On December 11, a microdocumentary on the oil pipeline platform called the killing machine caused widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States waging a war in Afghanistan under the name of "anti-terrorism", forcing the American democracy to be produced through war, 20 years of poor soldier fighting, bloodthirsty sex, brutal murder of innocents, and committing all sorts of crimes against humanity.
Abuse of drones and airstrikes on hospitals, schools, and other public spaces, human misrepresentation, and the formation of a homicide squad.
In 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up a black prison to torture and humiliate suspects.
Crimes against humanity have sparked more hatred among Afghans.
As the video shows, the American War on Terror is more than ever before.
War has not brought peaceful democracy, prosperity, a country full of people and countless massacres to the Afghan people.
Let's uncover America's name as anti-terrorism, the truth of the bloodthirsty killing, and the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Unintentionally, if you look at the following article, from a commercial perspective and from a conservation perspective, why would this customer want to do the logistics company in the insurance zone, although the logistics company is deeply processed, not part of the insurance company's business, the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many dairy farms, and I came in contact with many dairy farms.
In fact, the bags and the milk powder they are made of are the same raw materials, no difference whatsoever.
Then you will surely ask: Why is the shelf life of bags one year, while the shelf life of hearing aids is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price of earmuffs and bags so different?
In fact, many consumers, or even those with a higher degree of confidence, think that this is because the raw materials are different and so the quality will be much better.
As with all raw materials, only the most valuable is considered good.
Some consumers react to this attitude after eating and say that the taste or taste of the dishes is different!
Now let me tell you why it sounds expensive, where is it?
Why is there such a big price difference between the same raw materials?
Because most manufacturers consider when pricing bags that are too expensive for consumers to accept, it means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are low, or not profitable, so what does the manufacturer depend on to survive?
So, at the price of their hearing aid, there is a significant increase in the yield to secure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers focus on hearing aids, not bags.
Or do you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even billions of dollars a year on advertising?
Everyone can think of it.
So with the development of society, the cost of promoting a market, such as the cost of a salesman in a shopping mall, the cost of a showcase in a shopping mall, the cost of a gift for a product, the cost of advertising, etc., is also increasing.
So manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and the price of the product is also constantly rising, but this is actually a new product that comes with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact their raw material increase costs will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
Some brands, in order to promote their own products, by choice, connect with doctors in hospitals, by helping them promote their products, and from a single source of profit of 30 to 80 yuan.
The relevant Chinese law absolutely prohibits this kind of operation, which is actually harmful to consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy bagged milk powder in packs of milk powder at home, provided that they are available, so that costs can be saved, while increasing the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, and there is no effect on young children.
And don't think that the shelf life of the bag is the same as the shelf life of the bag, if the bag is the same after opening, just say that the bag is not easy to store, is easily deformed by the tide.

But it is also a reminder to the restaurant and the rider.
zh to avoid a repeat of it the next time.
I want to know the exact delivery time.
That time is continually delayed.
I don't know how long to wait.
If the order is cancelled, however, you cannot get a refund.
If you want to pay the service fee to the rider, how do you do it?
A rider has been confirmed for over an hour.
He is not willing to wait any longer.
Don't scare anyone at the start line.
At the book market, you can often feel the fireworks of successful textbooks.
Today's successful academic books, many of which are touted as the best principles, are to first assume or imply that you can do it, and then tell you what you need to do.
It is like saying that a child has passed the limit of how to do this most important, fundamental link.
Therefore, these books have one thing in common: either you do your best with a drum kit or you just do nothing; either you're 100 or you're 0; or you climb Mt. tai, or you just stay in the same place.
This is the best principle zh, whoever sees it will admit  correctly and incomparably , but 99% of people will be scared before the start line.
Because what this theory promotes is a path to a 180-degree transformation, where you must be determined, reincarnate, and transform, which is a deadly weakness for many.
To those who are strictly conservative, who are conservative, who refuse to change, you are more likely to shout in his ear, "You want to change", which is clearly self-deception, a gesture of bullfighting.
The vast majority of people will be afraid, unable to stand up, unwilling to make a decision; or, with a momentary impulse, unwilling to make a decision and boldly take the first step, but often with short-term prospects, unwillingness to hold out for a moment, and unwillingness to persevere.
The famous "Tomorrow's Day" sound of Mr. Ma's day is the most legendary expression of this universal humanity.
The biggest problem with the best principles is that the door is too high, it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's ability, causing the vast majority of people to stumble.
Perhaps, the "next good" principle is a possible way to get more ordinary people on the path to relative success.
The core of the  second good principle lies in the theory that it encourages a reduction of the threshold                                                                                      
In short, as long as you do something, it's always better than not doing it.
As the threshold drops significantly, there is more chance of making the average person persevere, and as long as everything is persevered, the chances of success will increase.
The path to success is only a little longer, following the principles of good governance.
In short, the best principles, despite the flag that seems to make everyone successful, are ultimately motivating, in fact, a minority; while the best principles, in effect, motivate more people, benefit as many as possible.

The volume of the Qinghai Lake's reserves increased by 0.71 million yuan this year.
Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency reported from the Agricultural and Rural Office of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results show that the reserve of resources in Qinghai Lake Naked increased by 0.71 million yuan this year from last year to 10.85 million yuan, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times from the beginning of protection in 2002.
The Qinghai Lake nudezh common name fish , a precious fish species unique to the Qinghai Lake, plays a significant role in maintaining the Qinghai Lake watershed  water-fish-bird  ecosystem chain safety and biodiversity.
In the 1960s and 1970s, influenced by factors such as the mass killing of humans, the deterioration of the environment in the bare breeding waters, the decline in the number of bare seals in the Qinghai lake, and the stock of resources in the Qinghai lake in 2002 was only 2,592 in total.
In 2004, the Red List of Chinese species in China listed the lake as endangered.
Since 2003, Qinghai has implemented a seafood ban, prohibiting any entity, group or individual from entering the main rivers and streams of Qinghai Lake and Lake District to catch naked, and prohibiting the sale of naked and its products.
At the same time, through artificial reproductive release flows and cleaning up of mainly lake-in-lake river channels, designing scientifically sound fish passageways, and other measures to continuously increase the protection of the resource, the volume of resources in the Qinghai lake is increasing year by year.
林, deputy director of the Agricultural and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, explained that, to date, Qinghai Lake Naked has cumulatively implemented nearly 180 million artificial reproductive flows, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of resources of Qinghai Lake Naked.
The Qinghai Three Rivers Basin is an important ecological barrier and watershed area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the westward spread of desertification to the east.
In order to protect the ecosystem of the Yangtze and Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wildlife, and preserve the biodiversity of the Tibetan Plateau, since this year, the first of the Qinghai to issue a catch ban on the main waters of the Yangtze, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake has built up a comprehensive catch ban management system.

The restaurant only gave me one bag, to be packed in a bag, cold weather.
Let me ask you, is the sale packed in a bag?
We only see one bag.
I wonder if it was leaked or if someone took it from us, thank you.
It's been an hour and they're not even in the Zh.
I just saw an article that was written in a fake, and it's too long.
Give a cop to a man you don't know.
Most girls experience their first case suddenly sometime between the ages of 13 and 15, closing around age 50.
zh will then be regularly compared once a month, subject to physical health.
But it's also not a regularity to predict accurately, a gap of about a week or so, needs to be prepared in advance, sometimes bad luck will roll over suddenly a few days in advance)
The length of time, blood pressure, pain level varies from person to person, some for three days, some for a week; some for a low blood flow, some for a massive blood clot; some for no reaction, some for an ambulance, pain after a change in time, previous pain does not mean a year without pain.
The menstrual cycle is uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours a day from start to finish, can only be done with a towel or a towel strap to prevent blood from flowing to the clothing chair.
The pain is mainly due to the secretion of prostate, the period at the beginning of the period is not yet in time for the pain, and the fasting of the pain can effectively relieve the pain of the month, and the pain after the start of the period is not useful.
Premenstrual pregnancy is easy due to overabundance of uterine blood and excessive release of prostate, and it is easy to pull the stomach.
If you have a period, you will have your period in two days.
Toilet wipes are best replaced every two to three hours, otherwise they are easily germinated, eliminate sleep time, worst case scenario is to replace them six times a day, seven days a month, that is, 42 pieces, if added to the pre-prepared portion, it may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
(As amended here, the toilet seat does not need to be changed regularly, you can change it once every 5-6 hours, up to 8 hours at most)
The menstrual cycle may be more violent, or the ovulation period may be more unstable due to changes in hormones in the body, which is very unstable, the body gives itself a baby.
But official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control emotions is still high, and they will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
The flow of blood is not just blood, it contains the falling out of the uterine lining.
The innermost lining of the uterus after the end of the menstrual cycle, which then gradually becomes thick, can be understood as a house, a house built monthly, ready to receive guests, guests not coming, all dismantled, and the next month rebuilt, and the next week resumed.
Menstruation is uncomfortable, decades in a row, 24 hours a day a month, and there's also a stomachache, who wants to?
But a man can be born because his mother came to menstruate, menstruation was to prepare you for the ten months you were to live in the house when you first came to this world, and everyone should thank their mother for the healthy menstrual cycle.
Many things were previously oppressed against women, society called brainwashing women dirty, shameful, and everyone thought that was the case, but the times have changed.
If anyone feels that menstruation is uncomfortable, that the female body is uncomfortable with the preparation for life, that it is not appropriate to speak out in front of a court audience, that the girls stand up, that they should not think that way, that they have never experienced it, that they will not experience it, that they will not understand it, that men are not so ungrateful, that they should not be so kind to their mothers, that they should not want their children?
Finally, sisters, try the toilet seat, it really works.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and making mistakes is disappointing.
You need to order an additional meal for the little ones to eat.
Hopefully, all the busy shops will check the product.
Is the bathtub bubble leaking?
Choosing the right shower can play a good role in healthcare, today's Kingdom News will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
As health awareness increases, shower basins are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, and a wide range of different grade products, ranging from over a hundred to thousands of yuan, have also emerged on the market, giving consumers a wide range of choices.
On the relevant data surface, healthcare-related household appliances such as foot bathtubs sell hot flashes compared to traditional household appliances, but foot bathtubs do not have specialized industry standards, so there are certain safety risks.
Soaking in electrical water is too dangerous!
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath and sent it to his father as a birthday present, but when he was soaking his feet, he felt his feet numb.
Mr. Li initially thought that the vibration of the foot bath was caused by the vibration, but he never thought about switching off the vibration, and his father still felt numb to the bottom of his feet.
Mr. Li tried using a pen, the pen was lit, Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the bathtub was electric.
Later he contacted the businessman, the businessman's attitude was good, and although he had withdrawn his bathtub, Mr. Lizh was still unhappy.
Because he discovered that this long-famous foot bath currently has no clear industry standard for setting the highest temperature, which groups of people it applies to, which materials it ensures are safe to use, and so on.
But in general, the bathtub will not have electrical problems, but it also excludes a few products that are not strictly closed when they are made.
Therefore, when buying, choose a decomposed foot bath.
Hydroelectricity is isolated, there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can easily take a power swap.

So if these foods are not hot, can they be canceled?

You've got the restaurant to send you upstairs.
I just don't want to go downstairs and buy something, and spend so much money calling it a sale.
A friend of mine.
I am very grateful to your friends for the humanitarian assistance they have provided over the 30 years since our loved ones were killed, especially since I personally appealed to humanitarian aid to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, and the assistance has not been interrupted so far.
Today, the vast majority of victims' grandparents are deceased, and the orphans have grown up in the family business.
It is your kindness to help us, these poor families, through the most difficult of times.
The current coronavirus outbreak is raging globally, with most donors retiring at the end of the year.
Therefore, I urge you to stop humanitarian donations to the unfortunate community of mothers of Tiananmen, which should have been the perfect example of this humanitarian relief effort.
I will always remember your love and love, and I am sure that your righteous acts will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Please allow me to take this opportunity to briefly describe the 32 years of humanitarian aid by the All-American College System (IFCSS) and the Minnesota-based China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian relief, the Pan American Association of Schools and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two organizations that are parallel, and project executives often cross paths.

Rescue aid often cannot be successfully delivered to six or more families.
In 1994, on the advice of the Buddhist teacher, a special group was formed by Mother Tianmenzh, who collected and distributed humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, the MCDF established a Fund for the Education of Orphans, which was implemented 11 years later, in 2009, after all six orphans had graduated from college, the MCDF subsequently established a Special Rescue Fund for the Elderly, and has been implementing it to this day.
These projects were funded primarily by campus and community contributions for the sixth year, generous donations from individuals, and supported by the Brothers College Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Research Foundation.
It wasn't until last year, 31 years later, that the Six Quarter family finally received a portion of the donation from Hong Kong that year, raised in the name of the Six Quarter.
During this time, China Human Rights Watch also independently implemented their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding stopped donating, was considering donors, we are all retired seniors, income is not as good as before retirement, and this is a special thank you to Teacher Ding's close friend, Sheng Yizh.
We will respect the decision of the non-members to terminate the project within two years and resume immediately if necessary.
To those brave fellow Americans who have persisted in generous discourse for many years, risking to deliver humanitarian aid, I would like to express my gratitude and respect.

Thank you so much for choosing our products, but before you use our chips, please take 5 minutes to read the following carefully:
After opening the box, please check if the goods are in good condition.
If there are any missing items, please contact customer service in good time.
The micro-flow control chip cover plate is made of PC material, so do not enter solvent that reacts with PCzh.
Do not use a manual push-injection to directly sample the chip, otherwise leakage is more likely.
Micro-flow control chips at the normal base are tested in pure water under sample pressure at 500mbar or 300mbar before shipment.
The glass-bottom chip is tested with pure water under a sample pressure of 800mbar before shipping, and you should be careful not to collide with sharp objects when using the glass-bottom chip, otherwise it will damage the base.
During use, please consider the viscosity of the solution and do not exceed this range, otherwise it will cause leakage.
Micro-flow control microchips at the normal base of the injection system, using pure water-injecting conditions, we recommend setting the flow rate below 150ul/min, oil phase flow rate below 50ul/min.
Please consider the overall viscosity of the actual sample liquid, increasing your flow rate parameter from slow to fast.
After the general chip experiment is completed, please clean the inner trench in time, otherwise it will be easy to cause a blockage.
Microcontrolled chips are easy to use and cannot be reused for long periods of time.
If the damage caused by the chip due to long-term use or improper operation is not reimbursed, the chip cannot be replaced.
If you need a microcontroller chip that can withstand higher pressure or flow rates, please contact customization.
The normal shipping cycle of the chip is within 1 week, stock with a current item can be shipped 24 hours after the picture is taken, please consult with customer service before ordering.

Member feedback about members of the ZZZH
[Effects] Photo effect: Taking two-piece clothing overall is better than the picture preference.
[Service] Service details: Because pregnancy was a little uncomfortable during the make-up, the make-up and staff were very kind, allowing me to rest for a while while still giving me hot water to drink.
The price of the set is 1000 yuan.
Thank you for the comments, which were actually rejected antique not suitable for antique, not thinking that the finished product was just too beautiful.
Thanks to Dandan's recognition, your satisfaction will keep us full of electricity and we will continue to refuel!
This photography studio is really great, I highly recommend all the little guys come!
There is no choice between reception, make-up, clothing, lighting, photography and the later stages.
Make-up artists are especially detailed, will match the makeup of your style with a large line of make-up that suits you.
I don't need to mention that photography is a pretty professional profession.
The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and two kittens are also playing with it.
We work in Beijing, the Beijing good spot movie palace needs to line up for the first half of the year, colleagues have been shooting in Beijing, watching the finished film feels just so so bad.
I especially sought this studio, a place with a soulful attitude.
Our facial expressions are poorly managed, and we think that this is the short version of most people's facial expressions, and the photographer will grab the picture, recording the wonderful moments of nature.
Makeup artist, photographer, later design, an excellent team.
The film was praised by us and those around us.
I have recommended honey in the past, and honey just watched the ending also rejoiced as much.
I hope that such a studio is not buried, that more people are discovered, and that they are shot in their own style, rather than one by one.
Thank you very much for the five star review, both of you are very thoughtful, creative newcomers, we are the creative studio, as long as customers like us we all do our best to complete, thank you to meet.
Sweet and caring assistant, and a cheerful photographer teacher, everyone on the team was super nice, a wonderful shot, a memorable experience, and the effect of the shoot was much better than I imagined.
Thank you for your comments.It is a privilege to meet you, too, from Ho Chi Minh City to Hong Kong.Our trust is in the thousands of kilometers of travel.
How do I pay for it?
The meal that was sent back has already been delivered.
zh without a rider receiving the receiver.
Now the restaurant staff is calling me.
A programming minor who wants to share personal experience.
If you are going to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training, but if you don't have the idea, it is still best to learn by yourself, after all, training costs a lot of money and also takes six months to learn.
But if you are going to get into this industry, training is indeed a very good option, especially for those with self-control and its weaknesses, training is even more a very good option.
If you have more self-control, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more difficult.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, if the teachers' strength of this institution is not strong enough, the training institution is meaningless, and of course some newly established training institutions are not particularly strong.
Second, before choosing a training institution, it is best to consult the students who have graduated from the institution, after all, only the students of the institution know what it is like, whether the course is good or bad.
Well, actually, I don't know how to answer your question, because there is no definite introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your personal situation.
For example, the profession, age, language you want to learn, or even the city in which you want to study, all of these will be related to the industry you want to study or pursue.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or a computer major already graduated, then if there is enough time I personally recommend self-learning, this is the most efficient and cost effective, many offline training institutions are now actually good, but one is a high learning cost, the second is more time spent, and basically requires concentrated training of 3-6 months.
But if these are the situations I'm talking about, self-study is convenient, now many learning resources on the web are free, or web sites have plenty of training resources, if you can't find resources, you can also contact me via a directory, get free resources, or get detailed advice.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video-comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer expert, but can afford to pay for some of the cost of learning money and time, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn, so that learning does not cost much, the teacher explains in detail, there are questions and answers, and also help with learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions sign employment agreements, have a job list, recommend after school to companies, so that the interview section of the job search can save a lot of things.
These are some of my views, as I said earlier because I don't understand your situation, so I'm not going to elaborate on the details, if you have any other questions, you can contact me anytime for a chat.
I said I arrived before 1am, and I saw it on the app.
What's the matter with you?
I'm not finished yet, what are you doing?
He personally undertakes various kinds of installation, cleaning, maintenance, heating, water purification, washing, air conditioning, toilets, oil and gas, lighting, glass, professional beauty, household services.
I thank those who have quietly praised me, who have struggled to live a life of hardship but have to move on.
Life will not fail every person who strives, please pay attention to me, thank those who quietly compliment me.
Life is like this, others only see results, self-isolation, life facing, we are not strong, we are going on, we have no choice, the road can look back but not the road......
Cleanliness is a job, but it is also a duty, life is beautiful because of service, service is wonderful because of service.
Cleaning is the dirtiest thing we do, but we will clean the customer's every corner with the most serious care, see the customer's happy smile and thumbs up, and all the work is worth it, paying off the ultimate payoff!
My daily work is my daily work.
zh your request, my service.
Serve with a heart, clean with a heart, stay cool.
Your concern for details, the richness of household affairs, helped you to do what I could, to serve the family.
Keep your home clean, house decor, service on site, clean home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work.
Although a crystal lamp is beautiful, it will also fade without lighting for a long time, only after it is cleaned can it shine brightly, and so is life.
The hard-working person succeeds, the fine-grained person shapes the fine, the beautiful person we are serious about.
Give me a chance, it will make you happy, quality explains everything, because profession is worth trusting, your recognition is what I encourage the most!
All the industries are not doing well at the moment!
But I have always believed that as long as I am serious, persistent, and hard enough, I will be a little better than anyone else, at least stronger than sitting around complaining!
The day is counted for the morning, all good things begin early in the morning and I hope you carry joy, good luck, health, good intentions to start a new day, keep a good mood all day long.
When you were a child, happiness was a thing, to have was happiness; when you grew up, happiness was a goal, to achieve happiness; when you grew up, happiness was a mental attitude, to realize happiness was to discover it.
Be the best you can be, live by your heart, without regrets in this life; one way in life, one way in life; two treasures in life: good health, good mood, beautiful old age!
At every stage of life, we will face different challenges.
Oftentimes, it is not your ability that holds you back, but the courage to face it positively.
Since there is no escape, it is better to face it openly.
The more you fear, the more difficult it will be to overcome; if you face the problem, the problem will eventually be solved.
The Chinese curators are working together to host the first Saudi Biennial of Contemporary Art.
Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial exhibition, the Diary of Contemporary Art biennial, officially opened to the public on 11 December at the DiaryJAX art district in northwestern Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries participating.
This biennial exhibition is co-organized by the Saudi Diary Biennial Exhibition Foundation and the China UCCA Yulens Center for Contemporary Art, with the director of the UCCA Yulens Center for Contemporary Art, China, Tan Yū as artistic director.
According to the curator team, the theme of this biennial exhibition, titled Touch a stone, is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of socio-economic transformation, and reflects the current situation in Saudi social and cultural development.
This biennial exhibition covers nearly 12,000 square meters, the showroom spans six interconnected buildings, presented in six units:                                                                                     
Among them, the work of 27 Saudi artists accounts for more than a quarter of the total exhibition, encompassing painting, installation art and various forms of performing arts; the work of 12 Chinese artists is equally of note, with some artists using recycled materials to create in a new way, such as Xu Ice in the story series The Creek Mountain Unfinished (2014), which re-constructed a classic mountain watercolor from scrap.
Barkley, CEO of the Diary Biennial Exhibition Foundation, said he hopes the biennial will establish an international dialogue, give global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction.
田宇 said:  双年展's dual objective is to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, but also to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art.
During the biennial opening week, a series of lectures will be held, with artists, curators and creative industry leaders discussing topics such as cross-cultural exchange, contemporary art development.
I ordered an axe.
The restaurant told me that riders cannot deliver bones.
zh want to ask the reason why clearly.
The bones can, so the restaurant packs the extra shipping.
The system is not very convenient, however, and all use a different system.
I am in the office at #ADDRESS#zh, New York.

云南: consolidation of regulations for rural public benefit jobs management-新华网
Xinhua News Agency (KY) has launched policies to promote rural revitalization and related policies to promote rural welfare and rural employment management, to help promote rural revitalization in a comprehensive manner.
The Yunnan Provincial Human Resources Office, a relevant official, explained that at present, Yunnan is developing a total of 44,830,000 rural public benefit jobs, to accommodate rural hard-working groups such as the poverty-stricken workforce, and plays a key role in helping the poverty-stricken populations achieve job growth, consolidate the achievements of the poverty-stricken region, and effectively enhance the public service capabilities of rural communities.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments, including Yunnan People's Association, Rural Revival, Finance, and others, to standardize the scope of job placement, fund management, job development, job management, and other aspects of the recruitment of rural public service personnel at the grassroots level.
In terms of setting up the development of jobs, the new rules specify, in accordance with the principles of on-demand setting, person-to-person, dynamic management, total control of who develops, uses, is responsible for and voluntarily publicly, and unified management.
The recruitment process must be conducted in accordance with the following steps: announcement, declaration, audit, disclosure, hiring, pre-training and appointment.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public utility jobs, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public utility jobs, stipulate that each rural public utility job development department should purchase commercial insurance for rural public utility jobs workers; require the relevant departments to periodically monitor the issue of rural public utility job subsidy.
The address is wrong.
You're all right.
Cancellation of the order is possible.
I re-ordered the order.
Whether or not the ZZ has been cancelled.
Second, although the right has a long history of being a minority, it is short because it shines a little sunshine, sweats a little water, and is a little more visible because it is hit by a blow.
But the reality is that the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right in ending the standards of truth that define culture, developing the economy, improving technology, and promoting political institutionalisation and human rights protection cannot be denied.
Three, as far as I'm concerned, although I don't completely agree with some of Li Weizhong's claims, I care about what he says, and I respect this man Li Weizhong very much; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is serious about China's social issues.
But I am against his anti-communist theory, and I believe that it is against the necessity of revolution, revolution that inevitably leads to social unrest, loss of life, political groups being thrown into the mud, and foreigners taking advantage of it.
Fourth, to change or improve China requires patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and its people, political speculation attempts to take the chaste out of the fire, that is not right-wing, that is a jerk.
We've been chatting again.
The left is, in fact, a band of era and political scum.
If the right has a positive social significance, and the Communist Party will listen to the right when needed and analyze their ideas, then the left is not so artificial, because the left wants the same shit that the Communist Party throws away!
Five, recently seeing some friends who are left-wing, and are still very active, I feel like I'm not necessarily.
Don't try to argue with both the left and the right, they're all a bit of a mess, no sense in saying it.
Nor try to prove ourselves right, nor even think about getting feedback and left-wing recognition, why not?
I told my friends this: when the left-hander sings at you, when the left-hander sings at the right-hander, it just proves that our middle way is right!
Many people have ideals as young people, but when they get older, they forget them or pursue them, becoming paranoid.
Ideals gradually drifted away, even killing teenagers eventually becoming evil dragons.
I think that generally it refers to restraint and freedom, and that the genetic inheritance of China from historical culture has led to the fact that China as a whole should be left-left.
While the right-wing in the country is free, focusing on efficiency and development, the left-wing strengthens regulation, focuses more on fairness and security.
Now society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness, while China and the US are fighting, the left is positive, and the estimates are that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, praise is over.
And I'm not saying that the flowers are so important.
In recent years, the blockade and siege of Huawei's chips by the US government has not only plunged Huawei into unprecedented difficulty, but also caused huge losses for US-based companies.
The Chinese chip industry is being suppressed by the US, demanding that its own companies and allied companies simultaneously block Chinese chip industries, and the direct result is that orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in lower R&D and production inputs, lower capacity, and a worldwide disruption of the chip supply chain.
Today, the lack of chips has affected major industries around the world, such as automotive industry shutdowns, mobile phone prices, and almost all industries using chips are severely affected.
In order to gain the autonomy of the chip industry, the tech giants of more and more countries are beginning to take the road to beautification.
To consolidate global semiconductor control, the development of China's semiconductor industry, the recent US action, and the hosting of a chip summit; to invite 64 national giants to form a semiconductor alliance and raise funds to support US-based tech giants such as Intel, to regain its dominance in the chip sector, invest $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and open a chip replacement business abroad.
While most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on the electricity generation, and it was likely to rob the power generation bowl.
The reason for this is that, as a technology giant of the old MET brand, Intel, which has been deeply involved in semiconductor for decades, with a large talent pool and technical reserves, will surely be able to rise rapidly in the short term, beating the Taiwanese electricity boom.
However, this decision by Intel was not taken seriously by the founder of the group, Zhang Zhengqiang.
At the 2021 Masters Think Tank Forum held in April this year, Zhang Zhengliang spoke out in surprise, regarding Intel's move to invest in the Wave Factory, Zhang Zhengliang was frank: Intel is building a chip factory, rather ironically.
Zhang Zhengli is not interested in the Intel Wave because Zhang Zhengli is still bitter about the same complaints about the build-up of electricity with Intel over 30 years ago.
In the sixties and seventies of the last century, Intel has been a jewel in the manufacturing industry, the global peak of its position, the world's leading semiconductor company.
Until the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chips were controlled by a small minority of powerful people.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, chips from design, manufacture to sealing were all completed by a single factory, Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model makes some small businesses overwhelmed, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face the enormous cost of building production lines that they can only look back on.
In the wake of market demand, in the late 1980s, the chip industry began to see the emergence of a division of labor, and in 1984 Zhang Zhengqian heard about a company specializing in chip design, and decided that since there was a specialized design, a factory could be set up specifically for the production of wafers.
Soon after, Zhang Zhengzhli's vision became a reality, and the electricity was brought to life.
The main business of Taiyu Electric is focused on the single unit of wave processing, not on design, providing only wave-making substitutes.
The then-newly established conglomerate was small in front of this giant Intel.
To gain capital support, Zhang Zhengli had sought investment from Intel, but at the time Intel heard that TZ was only a manufacturing unit for the chip industry, was obviously somewhat self-assuming, disregarded TZ, and decidedly refused to invest in TZ.
Zhang Zhengli also identified Intel as an unremarkable wavelength system service at the time.
I hadn't thought that the giant of wafer manufacturing services didn't look good then, but now they're also starting to do wafer substitutes.
So, Zhang Zhengli felt that it was very ironic that Intel was entering the trade-off.
Today, the market value of electricity has surpassed Intel.
Faced with the massive charge of congestion, Intel Nature is also unwilling to block itself.
Today, the battery is already on the rise for 3nm chips, while Intel still stays at 14nm seven years ago.
Trying to catch up isn't easy.
It's not like I'm waiting for you.
By 19:06 pm, we'd ordered two hours.
Today we're going to look at some weird hot searches.
What is a normal situation?
Choose three random searches: February 2 dragon rise, good friendship price, and the Wankara event, the spread of the tide forms a wave peak, then the index declines, and the smooth curve eventually dissipates, and if there is a second wave, the small peak will reappear.
They look very similar to the network evolution model that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has shown.
What is an abnormal situation?
I randomly selected six hot searches from the same event, showing a lonely peak shape, cliff shape.
孤峰状 means that people are heated, quickly rushed to the top, attracting public attention;状 means that they are periodically heated, ensuring the topics are heated;断崖状 means that they are evacuated collectively, that heat is able to fulfil its function, to take on new tasks, to rush to a new battlefield
In Figure 9, the heatwave of one event is precisely the wave valley of another event, the time per second is not different, it must be the unified batch of Marines that takes on the task, launching a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black PR is evident: dozens of searches are listed simultaneously, which attract attention, which are responsible for the COP, which are the warring forces, which are the shifting viewpoints, which affect cognition, which mislead judgments, which incite emotions, which influence decisions, which block accounts, which block nodes, and which are the focus of the campaign, taking into account almost all the elements in the spread of the spread of the word.
Communication is a science, leaving aside all subjective factors of attitude, emotion, and social relations, and nothing but objective data.
Anyone who passes by will leave a mark, such a mark, we will dig it out together.
Data source: Hot search time machine.
Countries such as Mauritius have for the first time detected cases of infection with the Omicron strain.
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 12  Xinhua News Agency reported: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported for the first time that cases of infection with the novel coronavirus variant have been detected.
On 10 March, Mauritius reported for the first time two cases of infection with the Omicron strain.
According to Mao's Health Minister Kaylash Jagutpal, one infected person was traveling from South Africa to Mauritius on November 27 for tourists arriving there; another infected person was a resident of Mauritius, who tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa.
After hospital isolation, the results of the test for nucleic acid in both infected individuals turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective homes.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on 10th of July that three cases of the first confirmed cases of the disease were confirmed in the country.
All three were students, returning from a trip abroad earlier this month, and were not admitted to hospital due to mild conditions.
To prevent the spread of the Olympic strain, the government is stepping up its prevention efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers aged 12 and over who enter the country by plane will be required to pay for a nuclear acid test at the airport after arriving.
The Ministry of Health also announced on 10th that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 years old against the coronavirus.
Malawian Health Minister Kunbize Chizhda said on Tuesday that the country had detected for the first time three cases of infection with the Omicron strain.
The country's health department conducted a genome sequencing of 12 new coronavirus-positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found these three cases of infection.
The sale was never delivered to Dazh.
Even the riders' phone numbers are fake.
I have already re-ordered the order.
Will the previous receipt be refunded?
If not, please cancel the order and refund the money.

I'll call your staff and explain.

Initially, it was a friend's introduction for trust, so I chose to check my budget at the beginning of 70,000 for a basic renovation.
When he arrived at the store, he began a series of tricks.
I first went to the store just to show them my layout, they didn't go over the house, they could certainly give me an offer to say that my 135 houses, 70,000, are available, probably show me their materials and they don't know what brand they are.
Their second trick is that you'll drag your money into the store as long as you're in the store and you'll never get out of the store unless you have enough experience to fight them theoretically.
When I hesitated to deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much we could offer you if you deposit today.
This is a crater, and I am a living example of someone being deceived, giving away over 10,000 tokens of gold at a brain surge.
He offered me a lot of questions, 70,000 not including hydroelectric conversion, no doors and cabinets, bathrooms, and all three are the main cost of basic equipment.
In addition to these, their service fees are also higher than those of other domestic companies.
I lost confidence in the company, and nothing was clear at first, so I signed a contract.
When I went to get them to cash back, they looked very experienced, with a dedicated small team to deal with you.
Either way, the customer's problem is that they are completely innocent.
All sorts of unloading responsibilities, and many details, not to mention all of them, don't choose them at all, because my friends found the house they repaired for them, too, of poor quality, and the latter will cost you a lot of money.
They were the original crooked headgear, now transformed into a beauty, as if they had fallen down and been transformed into something else.
So don't choose a repair company like that.
Then, when you choose, check out the various templates and check out these tips as the repair is not a small fee.
 if you want to ask the merchant questions, please register or register first.
It is strictly forbidden to publish any form of merchant criticism, in detail please see merchant summary statement.

So terrifying, if you're less than 30 minutes away, cancel your order!
Is there no other way to change the address, for example?
Well, then don't cancel this conversation, if you don't get your money back in 5 to 10 days, be sure to check.
I asked for less than 15 minutes if I could cancel.

The stellar sky is about 14th day of the meteor shower.
As the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the twin meteor shower, one of the three largest meteor shower in the Northern Hemisphere, will be the first to hit the extreme on December 14, astronomical experts say, friends who like meteor shower can observe it later that night.
Beijing City Astronomers Anzhokyu, the twin meteor shower that was shot in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most meteor shower bodies are cyclic comets, but the twin meteor shower bodies are the asteroid Fae, 3200, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The twin meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not to be conceived by a comet.
The director of the Tianjin City Astronomical Society, an astronomical expert, said that, like the big movie of the year, the meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the show date can last from December 4 to December 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large and steady flow, and together with the meteor shower, the meteor shower of the constellation of Incheon is known as the three great meteor shower of the Northern Hemisphere.
A notable feature of the meteor shower is that the meteorite is slower, more colorful, and less flammable, suitable for the eye and for beginners in astronomical photography.
Tianjin City Astronomers 2020 December 13, 2020 in Tianjin, China, was filmed by the twin meteor shower.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's meteor shower in the Twin Towers will be very, very large at approximately 1:15 p.m. on December 14, ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour when the radiation point is located above the top of the head under ideal conditions) is 150.
The chart of the Index of the recommended meteor shower of the twin planets.
Last year's meteor shower, which was a huge hit, left people with a big impression, but this year's meteor shower will be interrupted by moonlight, and the quality will be slightly reduced.
The 14th is a lunar month, the moon is a crescent moon, the bright moonlight interferes with the observation, so the moon will fall at the end of the night, and the radiation of the meteor shower in the twin constellations will also rise considerably higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe these hours of moonlight in the late night, but be careful of the heat and cold.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
No urban observations are recommended, but in the suburbs or rural areas you can choose a high altitude, light-small, northeast-facing viewpoint, and then patiently wait for the moon to set, or eye-sighting.
It should be noted that the flow of the meteor shower in each direction is large, so that observation does not require constantly looking at the radiation points of the meteor shower.
Friends who like photography want to shoot beautiful meteor shower shots, preferably with wide angle, wide-angle, high-ISO and maximum-circle shots.
 Based on stability and sustainability considerations, tripod, spare battery and fast-growing line are also essential 
The warning is to be given.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TVs mentioned in the subject should refer to LCD TVs, whereas laser TVs and LCD TVs differ in market positioning mainly in the following two areas:
First, laser TVs are more focused on the big screen market.
Compared to the fully-fledged market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are clearly more focused on the big screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products of the big screen.
Currently, mainstream LCD TVs range in size from 55 inches to 65 inches, while laser TVs generally range in size from 75 inches to over 100 inches, fully meeting users' needs for large screen coloring.
In recent years, the share of laser TVs in global shipments and sales has been steadily increasing, accounting for over 60 percent of total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
 According to ZhengCong's forecast, in 2020, the laser TV market will grow by more than 140%, continuing to maintain high-speed growth
The reason why the big screen market has such good results is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in the field of eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV reflection, the light emitted by a laser light source does not directly emit light into the eye, compared to the backlight of a LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the eye is less stimulated.
Experts in ophthalmology at the SYZ Laboratory and the Beijing Institute of Technology, China Institute of Electronics and Technology, conducted a rigorous comparison trial of laser TVs and LCDs watching under the same conditions as the population, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data confirm: Laser TVs do have strong eye protection properties, and even have some improvement in certain aspects.
In a time when vision health is increasingly valued, laser TVs have not only attracted more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but have also opened another breakthrough in the color electricity market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the constantly declining price of LCD TVs, currently the market price of laser TVs is mostly over 10,000 yuan, and as the size and light source are upgraded, the price gradually rises.
Why is a laser TV selling so expensive?
zh is certainly reasonable.
With the ever-evolving light source and technical level, laser TVs have many advantages that neither LCD TVs nor projection can achieve.
With ultra-short-focus projection technology, the laser TV has a shorter projection range than traditional projection equipment, can achieve a 100-inch screen experience in short distances, requires little space, and the host is small, taking up very little space.
In terms of brightness, the big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 brightness.
In addition to lower heat output, less equipment loss, and longer service life of the TV.
In addition, many high-end laser TVs are equipped with a number of cutting-edge technologies, such as true4K ultra-high resolution graphics, artificial intelligence systems, life-show, and more, which can provide users with a more immersive audio and video experience.
Not to talk about fake demand, but about product segmentation of demand, about image quality and input output, laser TV is not the food of a video player, wants to accommodate the big screen and watch inadequate environments, can try, everything is good and bad, weighing it and judging yourself, afraid to listen to the word of one side.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle close-focus projector -- a laser TV, in order to close the canvas, had to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which did not match the best optical design.
To shield some of the ambient light, using a microstructured finer case, the cost is high, an 80-inch price can basically replace a 65-inch liquid crystal.
And one more thing, I particularly hate that the projectors take a good reflection of the eye as a point of sale, please, the light on the canvas that the eye can see is direct light for the eye, you reflect it to the ceiling, the eye can't see, the TV is also direct, open the TV ceiling is not illuminated?
And, if the projection screen is not a reflection, it cannot be made into a picture.
The effect of high-growth screen cloth heat spots, which are reflected by a large amount of light to the eye from one angle, is just ignored.

In addition to the date of the WeChat appointment, Miss Schwartz sent me a timetable of choice, replying to the information in a timely manner~
Before I went to see the shops, more of the shooting was outdoors, the pictures were beautiful, and there were many different styles involved.
Later that day, she and Miss Zhi simply shared their ideas, patiently helped me try on two styles of clothes that I had entangled myself with, and finally decided to start making makeup. ~ The photographer would put some tools on before filming, guide the action, and be more thorough about every detail.
But maybe because I didn't share specific shooting ideas with him, so the shooting wasn't the style I wanted, but it should be good looking.
After a good shot, the photographer will help you pick photos, communicate later style, feel very careful.
The repair takes about half a month, sitting and so on.
The second time, the photographic category of the event included the most clothes of the whole house to be able to choose one shot.
Finally, choose a black zh, and experience different styles.
The entire shooting process took about two hours, made up of ++ shooters, the photographer in charge of the shooting was the brother after 95, feeling slightly or slightly more favourable, hoping to give more advice on guiding the customers to shoot the motion picture later, the shooting process was more enjoyable.

It's on the front page, so come and see Queen~
Call the store first and fill out the name and then choose the dress, wedding dress can be selected, change three or four sets of clothes is still very patient, the choice of clothes is long overdue, the service attitude is good, the backdrop will teach you how to shape, the image is a big face, the refinement takes half a month, three or four days to come out, feels like nothing is different from the original film.
The environment is fine overall.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are about three locations, inside of which is a camera shed.
 Service  very enthusiastic, but also very careful zh
The mold maker is very patient.
Photographers will also be very serious about teaching you how to move.
Not satisfied, the photographer would also be proactive in proposing a replacement shot.
The shape may have been slightly over-shaped, with the original double-eye leather being applied to the three-eye leather.
The eyebrow tail has also been shaved, a bit embarrassing for the everyday person who doesn't shave the eyebrows.
The photos were taken for ten days, but the PTU effect was not satisfactory, and the feeling of the two-eyed skin still made them very evident.
Because it is not clear which style to choose, I tried two sets of outcomes, or I chose a black dress, Miss Sissy said that this set is a comparison of the Hebei Renaissance style.
After choosing the right clothes, I started to make hairstyles. The hairdresser and the makeup artist's sister were super patient and were very pleased with the results.
After getting my hair done, I started taking pictures. The photographer was always in charge of my posture.
After filming, we carefully selected four of our favorite when finishing the film, which was very satisfying.
I haven't responded in 3 days......I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee scheme because your system can't recognize my credit card!
Strangely enough, every time I pay I use the same credit card.
I now have to pay for shipping every time.
Can you excuse me before you can investigate and then charge my monthly fee, right?
Do you buy insurance, reliable?
小雨 is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the setup conditions: according to the regulations of the insurance brokerage body, to become an insurance brokerage company, you must meet three key words: shareholder, issuer, and no major breach of the law in the last three years, the minimum amount of 50 million yuan can only be established, and must be approved by the Chinese Insurance Supervision Board.
These three things are actually very hard, in sum, to be strong, to pass the national authority approval of the banking regulator, to have shareholders behave well, to be a small business insurer, to be an insurance broker, to be an insurer without much doubt whether or not small business insurance is legal, after all, there are these three doors, not something that any insurance company can achieve.
In this respect, well, it is well worth the trust.
From the insurance product perspective: small rain insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star insurance products are sold on this platform, such as the latest up-and-coming and Thai Super Mario 5s, claims and underwriters are both with Thai Life, small rain insurance is just a third-party intermediary, without questioning its reliability.
From the pay model: the products of the Internet platform, due to the reduced operating costs of the business website, and the cost of employee pay, so the universal price of Internet products is relatively high, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payments, reducing the contribution pressure of insurers, while maximizing the leverage of the insurance policy.
That's still very good.
It can be considered.
This is especially important from the perspective of the professional: insurance is a very demanding industry, many Internet product customers can insure themselves, this can lead to a lot of misunderstandings, in health information and profession, non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective awareness when investing, feel healthy or fit, so there are many claims risks, the risk of being denied.
I myself have done insurance phone sales at 讯 (like small rain shovels, and Internet insurance platforms), very responsibly telling everyone.
The Internet is real, reliable, unreliable, and the Internet has no professional staff, and there are many sales misconceptions.
For example: 1 million yuan of insurance, 6 million yuan of insurance, 60,000 pounds of insurance, free health insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are lightweight, do not tell the insurer, 1 January, the following month is required to pay a normal fee, ranging from tens to 200 thousand, many customers are not sure what they buy themselves for a year or two.
In order to spend a penny, the insurance company lost $6 million.
 Free delivery of mobile phones, is only sent to the last number of the ticket, such as 6666,8888 such a special ticket number, and if a message is sent, no one is reminded of it, nor is it exchanged.
(This is another pitcher for the insurer) getting 60,000 pounds of free sickness insurance is short-term, if it's based on this alone, no other business insurance, if there's a serious illness, 60,000 pounds of energy, can't solve problems, and life after that starts to run wild.
Currently, the country is also severely punishing misconduct regarding Internet insurance sales.
So overall, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the professionalism and professional handling of the business staff.
The proposed topic is that many of the products of many online insurance brokers are broader, customers have more choice and products, and some products are priced better than Internet products.
I personally helped 59 Internet clients, provided product coverage, and saved about 2000-3000 yuan per person per year.
If anyone has any questions, please contact me and share them.
I am a business insurance agent, with over 3 years of business management training experience, serving nearly 1,000 business users, collaborating with over 100 insurance companies, before I start my business, I will start from customer needs, customize insurance products for customers, insure, ship to customers, strive for the best possible outcome, after insuring, order order ordering, order management, and keep customers safe.
Growing up with each client throughout life.
I hope my answer can help the subject!
According to the insurance regulatory authority definition, Internet insurance is insurance business where the insurer can independently complete all insurance processes by clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, nor does the insurance advisor, all the steps can be completed by the insurer himself.
While Internet insurance does not have much of a ceremonial feel, and even a paper contract may not even be printed, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of electronic contracts in the slightest.
This model is somewhat similar to the general flow line operation, but so buying insurance can also have a fatal problem, which is that the subsequent service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades, and when we buy insurance, should we think seriously about whether this insurance broker we choose is one that can accompany us for the long term and will provide us with services many years later?
So how can I contact the food delivery commissioner?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Was that to compensate me?
I said knock on the delivery door.
But the rider put it on the door, and the man left.
Another error message was sent to Zzhzh.
Your riders have already taken a sale from me on #ZUMBER, but so far they are still waiting to inform me.
Rider at 19:25  received my bid, but still refused to leave.

What to do about it?
Where did your rider go?
Do you have to wait?

zh no problem, remember no re-sending, I bought another one, don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
From then on, I have always opposed any form of contempt and slander, much less accepting such physical assault.
In a civilized society, we can include everything, but only to eliminate this villain.
If we ignore political parties and factions, the first thing we should object to is this uncivilized approach.
From the time you started sending Facebook and friend requests, then posting compelling posts, and then trying to post my alleged home location and father's name on social media, I've all been unresponsive.
You have become increasingly unpopular not only with the frequency of six meals a day, but also with your so-called friends on Facebook who continue to talk about me in a wild manner, with some obscene, humiliating comments, looks, looks, good nutrition, what kind of bed to grow weed, not to put in, etc. I... too.
Later, I received a number of friends who sent me comments about your Facebook friend account uploading a photo of you and a sexually harassing ingredient.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can't keep my mouth shut anymore.
After I uploaded the news of the police alert, you were completely untouched, but instead more and more disturbed.
I don't care what your political background is, or what your status is, in our society, it is a matter of bi-gender respect.
Yes, you can continue this kind of condescending, concealing, humiliating, insulting talk, you can continue to say that you just care and care about me, you can continue to believe that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your idea or you can continue to publish any offensive comments.
Yes, I cannot, nor have the capacity to stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you, nor do I need you to judge my appearance and appearance.
I don't even think of any girl who would be willing to let others humiliate herself so much in exchange for fame.
A friend asked me, are you okay?
I said yes, and you wouldn't believe it either.
I don't think there's a girl who can say she's okay after being bullied so much.
Whether in the workplace, society, politics or business, only those without even basic qualities would choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that the path of righteousness is self-evident.
I have intercepted some of the comments for everyone's comments.
Your own poster should be the only one who can pretend to be you.
All I can say is that you are the public enemy of civilization.
I'll have a laugh.
Vietnamese Prime Minister Van Zhe Minh-Jung attended the third Vietnamese National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum.
Two main sessions were held during the third National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum in Vietnam, discussing topics around digital technology and national digital transformation, digital technology and economic recovery and development during and after the coronavirus outbreak.

The most powerful weapon rarely visits Guam 2022-01-17  Dover Pro-CPC media reports: China-US relations latest news: The latest satellite images show three US aircraft carriers are being assembled around China; the US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal rarely visits Guam, releasing important signals to US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to China's think tank, the South Sea Strategic Positioning Platform, on January 9, a satellite detected the U.S. Navy carrier Carl Vinson near the Barbary Strait.
The Barabakh Strait, which connects the South Sea and the Suez Sea, is a strategic point on the West Pacific's First Island chain.
The platform is expected to send the Carl Venson to South Sea deployment.
This is the first time that the Carl Vensensenszh aircraft carrier has been deployed with an F-35C fighter and a CMV-22 cargo ship.
The U.S. Navy aircraft carrier currently floating up the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the Carl Vinson, is also the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, which sailed from the United States on January 3.
Lincoln also flew the F-35C carrier squadron, which is affiliated with the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the U.S. Navy currently has a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier stationed in the Asia-Pacific region and a base in Japan.
The carrier's battle groups also included the Lake Champlain missile cruiser, the Stocktal missile destroyer, and others.
The most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam on January 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Situation Sensing Platform released the latest satellite images showing three U.S. Navy aircraft carriers gathering around China.
(Wibbo@南海战略态势感知) The US Airways Group is concentrating around China, with the most powerful weapons rarely reaching Guam on January 17, 2022, the US Navy's cargo transport aircraft CMV-22B flight route.
(Wiborg@Southern Sea Strategic Positioning)  According to a US cable news network (CNN) report on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam over the past weekend.
The Russian-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US Naval Base Guam on Saturday.
The US-based carrier is assembling the most powerful weapons rarely visited Guam around China, which analysts say sends a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time a U.S. ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016, and the second time since the 1980s that it has visited Guam publicly.
The largest and rarest weapons ever to visit Guam, China has built large military installations in recent years in the Nansha Islands.
It is a picture of Yongzhot Island in the Chinese province of Nanzh.
(South Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the Russian-class nuclear submarine, USS Nevada, during her visit to Guam, strengthened cooperation between the United States and regional allies, demonstrated the U.S. capabilities, flexibility, and readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
The ballistic missile submarine is commonly referred to as the "Boomer submarine".
The traces of 14 U.S. Navy submarines are generally kept secret.
The secret of the ballistic missile submarine makes the submarine the most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad, which also includes launch-well ballistic missiles in the U.S. mainland, and nuclear-powered bombers such as the B-2 and B-52s.
Talking to a friend recently, Metazh collapsed 26%, the market value evaporated to $25.1 billion, Zuckerberg responded by saying "facing unprecedented competition" and why?
Metazh (originally Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with revenue primarily coming from advertising, today's advertising company that makes money today, itself a traffic channel.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc., regardless of the feature positioning, are all Metazh's traffic channels.
Not only that, but Metazh is also the largest ad league, with many ads outside the app, and Metazh's advertising platform is a transformation.
But times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Metazh  difficult to retrieve user data, it has affected the effectiveness of ad placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, will clearly indicate whether users allow the App to access their information, and most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google were to do it all over again, the impact on Metazh's revenue would be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in previous Meta revenue growth has also weakened, and the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist.
We all know that Metazh does not have a business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mainly from companies that do offshore business in China.
Metazh has about a hundred people in its Hong Kong office, and several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is a bypassed advertising channel, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, TT in bytes is now one of Meta's main competitors, but the first two years Meta made a lot of money from the bytes.
All the agents in the country are going to Metazh to advertise, and Meta Greater China is doing very well.
I haven't been to a specific study recently, but it certainly won't be any better than before.
The phase of large-scale money-burning by Chinese companies overseas has already passed.
Third, the new traffic channel's expansion was not successful.
Facebook is getting older, new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets not only look at middle income, but more importantly, look at what the future expects.
 obviously,Metazh's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the story of the ex-universe.
The ex-universe should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the ex-universe's realization cycle is relatively long, and this story in these two or three years should not be enough to support Meta's market value.
So the next two years, should be a more challenging Meta period.
Don't look at Facebook now as a very fancy company, with annual revenues of $100 billion to $200 billion, in fact Facebook is now in a very strong sense of crisis, with nothing like a good security fence compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although several of his social software programs are now more up-to-date and are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., in the face of the rapid growth of TikTok, Facebook has no confidence in itself, and is in the midst of a disruption.
And to make this unattainable concept of the exotic universe work, in a short time, there is absolutely no hope of success, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg changed his name again, and the fundamental reason for constantly looking for new racetracks, but I think his choice of racetracks was wrong, an irreversible one, and that's just some of my thoughts, for reference.
