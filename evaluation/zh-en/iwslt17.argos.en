Well, I'm gonna tell a story about how we know what we know.
This story is about this woman, Natalia Lichinsky.
She's a paleontologist, and her specialty is to dig around old things.
Natalia Lichinsky: "Yes, and some people call me Dr. Dead Something." "
I think she's particularly interesting, because the place where she digs is in the high Arctic, in the far Canadian thaw.
One day in the summer of 2006, she was at an archaeological excavation site called the Dorsal Bed, which was less than 10 latitudes away from the magnetic Arctic.
NR: "Seriously, that doesn't sound like a real meaning." "You've been carrying bags, GPS navigators and notebooks all day, and you've been walking long distances, and you pick up things that could be fossils."
At one point, however, she noticed something.
"A rusty little thing," probably as big as my hand. “...
"It lies on the ground."
Her first reaction was that it was just a piece of wood, because it was something that people had found in the Farsher bed -- prehistoric plants.
But that night, back at camp...
NR: "I took out the microscope," I looked at it more closely, and I suddenly found, "This thing looks like it doesn't look like it's a year round."
It may be because of the preservation problem, but it really looks like...
"Bones. "
And for the next four years, she went back and forth to that place, and eventually collected 30 pieces of debris from the same bone, many of them very tiny.
"Not really much. A little zipper can fit. "
Then she tried to put the pieces together like a puzzle.
But this is very challenging.
It's broken into a lot of tiny pieces, and we try to recover with sand and ash, but it looks bad. "
"And finally, we used a three-dimensional surface scanner. "
"It's cool, right?"
And finally, it's much easier to recover in a virtual way.
"When they're all together, it feels really amazing. "
How sure are you gonna spell it right, just like it was?
Is there any way you could spell it in another way, finally spell it out a little parrot or something?
"Uh, no. We must have got it right. "
She found out that she spelled it out as a skeletal bone, the calf bone, and that it came from a mammal with a foot and foot, like cattle and sheep.
But it can't be a cow or a sheep.
It's really too big.
"This thing is really too big. It's a huge animal. “...
So what kind of animal would it be?
Now there was a bottleneck, and she showed a piece of it to some of her colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea.
"We used a little saw, and then we scratched a little bit at the edge of the debris, and there came some very amazing smell. “...
It smells like burnt skin.
It's a smell that Natalia knows, and she's smelled when she cut her skull in the general anatomy lab, and that's glue protein.
The glyph gives our bones a hardness.
Generally, after all these years, it's naturally decomposed.
But in this case, the Arctic is like a natural freezer to keep it.
After a year or two, Natalia went to Bristow to attend a congress, and she saw one of her colleagues, Mike Buckley, who was demonstrating a new technology, which he called "the gelatin fingerprinting technology."
In fact, there's a slight difference in the structure of the adhesive protein of different species, so if you have information on a bone that you don't know, you can compare it to information on the adhesive protein of known species, so who knows, maybe you find a match.
So she sent a piece to Mike with a FedEx.
"Of course, you keep an eye on the distribution. It's important."
And then he processed the samples, compared them to 37 contemporary known mammals.
I found a pair!
And finally, what Natalia found in the high Arctic is that the bone with a 3.5 million-year-old history came from...
A camel.
"I was just thinking. Are you kidding me? "If we're not mistaken, it's amazing."
So they tested a lot of debris, and they got the same results for each.
However, judging by the size of the bone they found, this means that the camel is 30 percent larger than the modern camel.
So this camel is about 2.7 meters tall and weighs a ton.
(Exhales) Yeah.
Natalia found a Arctic camel.
Now you hear the word "camel," and what's going on in your head is this picture of the twin camels in East and Central Asia.
But it's more likely that the images in your head are more like this: single-peak camels, typical desert animals, often found in hot deserts, for example, in the Middle East or the Sahara, with a super-large hump on their backs, allowing them to travel long distances to store water in the desert, and large toes to help them step across the dunes.
So how the hell did these guys get to the high Arctic Circle?
In fact, scientists knew, before Natalia found out, that camels originated from the Americas.
They came from here.
And in 45 million years of their existence, 40 million years of time, you can only find them in North America, 20 different species, maybe more.
"If we line them up, do they look different?"
"Yeah, their sizes are very different."
Some of the necks are particularly long, so they function like giraffes. “...
Some have long noses, like crocodiles.
"They're particularly primitive, and the earliest may be very small," almost like a little rabbit. “...
What? Rabbit-sized camels?
"The first ones are."
"That you may not recognize. “...
My God, I want a rabbit camel to be a pet!
"I know, it's gonna be great, right?"
And then about 3 million to 7 million years ago, one branch of camels moved southward to South America, where they evolved into llamas or camels, and the other crossed the Bering Land Bridge, reaching Asia and Africa.
Around the end of the last glacial era, the camels of North America were completely extinct.
Well, scientists already know that, but that doesn't entirely explain how Natalia found camels so far north.
And here, from a temperature point of view, it's the reverse of the Sahara.
To be honest, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius higher.
So it could be a north forest, sort of like the Yukon Valley today or Siberia.
But they still have six months of winter, and all ponds will be frozen.
You'll meet a blizzard.
You'll meet 24 hours of night in a row.
What's going on?
How can these superstars of the Sahara survive this harsh cold?
Natalia and her colleagues felt they found the answer.
And the answer is rather smart.
What if these characteristics of camels, unlike what we think, are created to adapt to conditions like the Sahara, but have evolved because of the winter?
What if the big palms didn't step over the dunes, they were like snow boots.
If it were the camels -- it was the big news! What's stored is not moisture, but fat, and the camels actually spend the six months of the winter, which are scarce food?
What if, well beyond that, they cross the continental bridge before they adapt these winter features to the hot desert environment?
For example, those camels may be good for camels in hot zones, because when your fat piles are in the same place, you know, like a fat backpack, which means your body's insulation doesn't have to cover the whole body.
So it's easier to spread heat.
It's this crazy idea that makes camels look typical of desert characteristics, suddenly becoming evidence of their origin in the high Arctic.
I'm not actually the first person to tell this story.
Others have spoken of it as an expression of the wonder of biological evolution, or as a glimpse of future climate change.
But I love this story for another reason.
For me, it's a story about us, about how we know the world, about how that perception changes.
My profession is historian.
And I found that, actually, a lot of scientists are historians.
They understand the past.
They talk about the history of the universe, the Earth and its living beings.
As a historian, you need to think about how this story goes.
"We make up stories, and then we go along the way, "Just like desert camels, right?"
"This is a wonderful story! The camels are perfect for the desert."
Apparently, camels have been living there. “...
But at any given time, you might find a little clue.
You might find something little, forcing you to recreate everything you think you know.
And like this example, this scientist found this piece of debris, and she thought it was wood, and that's why the scientific community has come up with a whole new, anti-intuitive theory, which explains why this strange, hairy creature, has grown to look like this.
For me, it totally subverted my perception of camels.
And it went from being a living creature that only targeted this particular environment to being a world traveler, just happened to be in the Sahara Desert, and could be anywhere.
This is Azuli.
Hey, Ajuli! Are you okay?
I brought you something to eat.
Azuli just finished her special show, coming from the New York Radio City concert hall.
This is not a joke.
Whatever... seriously, Azuli is here as a living example of how the world's stories are changing.
We need to be proactive, to be bold in making changes and reimagining.
Are you right?
It's true that we're only a fraction of the distance from the new vision of the world.
Thank you.
Today's computers are so amazing, we even ignore how bad they actually are.
I'm going to talk to you today about this, and how we use neuroscience to solve it.
First of all, I'm going to take you back to Harlem in 2011 for a cold night, which has far-reaching implications for me.
I'm sitting in a bar next to Columbia University where I'm majoring in computer and neuroscience, and I'm having an interesting conversation with a fellow student about the power of holographic photography to replace computers one day.
And just as our conversation got to the point, as expected, his phone was ringing.
He picks up his phone and starts typing.
And he looked up at me from time to time and said, "Go on, I'm listening."
But it was clear that his eyes were not focused, and a wonderful moment was just passing.
Meanwhile, across the bar, I noticed that another student was holding his cell phone, and this time there was a crowd of people on the screen.
He's looking at pictures on Instagram, and the kids are laughing.
They're so happy with the same technology, and I'm so depressed that this strong contrast prompts me to think.
And as I think more and more, I become more aware that the problem here is not electronic information, but just the location of information that separates me from my friends and brings these kids together.
It's clear that they're being associated with something, like our ancestors evolved their social consciousness, like telling stories about bonfires.
I think that's what tools do.
They should extend our physical function.
I think today, computers are doing the opposite.
Whether you send an e-mail to your wife, or give a symphony symphony to a friend, you're almost in the same way.
You bend over to these squares, play with buttons and menus, and more squares appear.
I think it's a wrong way, and I think we can start using a more natural machine.
The machine we use should bring our work back to life.
We should use machines that use neuroscience to extend our senses, not limit them.
Now I have a machine like this.
It's called Meta 2.
Let's try.
Now I can see the audience, and I can see my hands.
On the count of three, two, one, we'll see a hologram coming, a very real hologram coming in front of me, in front of the glasses I'm wearing.
Of course this can be anything we're going to buy, or learn something, and I can control its movement with my hands very easily.
And I think Iron Man would be proud.
We'll be back later.
And if you're thinking what I'm thinking, you're thinking about doing something with this technology, let's see some examples.
My mom was an architect, so naturally the first thing I imagined was to draw a stereo, not plan the floors with these flats.
In fact, she's touching the design to choose an interior decoration.
These were all taken by GoPro in my glasses.
The next case of use is personalized for me, and it's Professor Adam Goserre's Glass Brain project, thanks to UCSF's authorization.
As a student in neuroscience, I'm always impressed by the ability to learn and remember these complex brain structures with a real machine, so I can touch and manipulate different brain structures.
Now what you're looking at is strengthening reality, but to me, it's just part of a more important story -- This story is about how we started using digital devices to extend our bodies, not limit our physical functioning.
Well...
In the next few years, humans will experience a transformation, I think.
We'll start covering a whole digital layer in the real world.
Take some time to imagine what that means for people who tell stories, for painters, for brain surgeons, for interior decorators, perhaps for all of us here today.
I think what we're doing as a group is really trying and trying to imagine how we can create this new reality, in a way that extends the human experience, rather than playing our reality, or mixing reality with digital information.
That's what I'm very interested in.
Now, I want to tell you a little secret.
Within about five years -- this is not the smallest device -- and within about five years, these will all look like strip glasses, capable of projecting holograms.
Just like we don't care much about the hardware parameters of different phones -- which one of the phones we buy is the operating system -- as a neuroscientist, I always wanted to build an iOS based on the brain, if that's possible.
It's very important that we make sure it works, because these things don't stay with us much longer than we do with Windows image user interfaces.
I don't know what you think, but living in Windows makes me feel a little scary.
In order to isolate the single most intuitive interface to an infinite distance, we use neuroscience to guide our design, rather than allowing a bunch of designers to argue in the design room.
And the principle of our evolution is called the least resistance neural tube.
At every moment of change, we connect the brain iOS system to our brain, for the first time in our brain language.
In other words, we're trying to create a zero-learning curve of computers.
We're building a system you've always known how to use.
These are the first three design guides that we use in this new form of user experience.
First, you are operating systems.
The traditional file systems are complex and abstract, and they make it difficult for your brain to decode them by a few more curves.
What we're doing is the opposite of the least resistance neural tube.
At the same time, in enhancing reality, you can certainly put your holographic TED screen here, put your hologram e-mail on the other side of the table, and your spatial memory evolves to extract exactly that information.
You can put Tesla's holograms in here on the Internet -- or my legal team can tell me anything before you go on stage.
Well, your brains do know how to get back to reality.
The second interface guide has been called "visibility."
What do babies do when they see what they're interested in?
They'll try to reach for it.
That's what natural machines do.
In fact, the visual system has a very basic drive, and we can call it the instinct -- - It's a feeling that all parts of our bodies are in space.
By reaching out to our target, we can not only control it better, but also understand it more deeply.
This is "visibility."
But it's not enough for us to experience things on our own.
We're social primates.
This reminds me of our third guide, from our first story, the holographic bonfire:
Our mirror -- the nervous subsystem -- shows that we can better connect to everyone and to our work, if we can see a 3D image of everyone's face and hand.
So if you look at the video behind me, you can see two Meta users working on the same hologram, creating eye contact, focusing on this thing, rather than being distracted by outside devices.
Let's try again with the concept of neuroscience.
Again, our favorite interface, the iOS system of the brain.
Now I'm going to step forward and go ahead and grab these glasses. Then put it right here on the table.
I'm at a moment with you, and we're connected.
My spatial memory is working, and I can go over and grab it, and then bring it back here and remind myself that I'm an operating system.
Now I feel like I'm working, and I can go over and break these glass into thousands of pieces, and then touch this moment is scanning the sensors of my hands.
But it's not enough to see these, so soon, my co-founder Ryan will call me a 3D call -- Ryan?
Hi, Ryan. How are you?
Guys, I can see this guy in a three-dimensional projection.
And his images are very real.
Thank you.
My mirror-neurological subsystem shows that it's going to replace the phone in the near future.
Ryan, how are you?
I'm fine. We can finally show them on the spot.
Ryan, give you a little present of the brain of the hologram we saw on the short film.
Ladies and gentlemen, this will change not only the way we call, but also the way we work together.
Thank you very much.
Thanks, Ryan.
Ryan: You're welcome.
Malone Gribez: So, guys, this is the message I found in that bar in 2011: the computer's future is not locked in these screens.
It's here, inside us.
So if I can leave you with an idea today, it's that the natural machine doesn't exist only in the imagination of the future, it's here in 2016.
That's why hundreds of employees in Meta, including administrators, executives, designers, engineers... Before TED2017, we'll throw out our outside display device, and replace it with a real, more natural machine.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a problem, and there's been a lot of hologram shows last year.
Sometimes there's a debate about whether we actually see real things on the screen?
This is a problem in this field, and technology is in a way showing a broader perspective than what you actually see with glasses.
Did we just see the real effect?
It's absolutely true.
And not only that, we used extra measurement techniques, and we used GoPro to shoot through real lenses, and we got the different short films you saw here.
We want to try to make the experience of the world real, not just to see the locals.
CA: Thank you very much for your presentation.
MG: Thank you very much.
I come from one of America's most liberal, tolerant and development-potential cities, Seattle.
I grew up in a great Seattle family.
My mother was an artist, and my father was a university professor, and I was grateful for their upbringing, because I could totally plan my life in the way I felt right.
And actually, my choices are different from what my parents think.
When I was 19, I dropped out of college -- dropped out, or, to be more precise, got fired.
I'm on the road to becoming a professional French trumpeter, which is my lifelong dream.
I'm in the U.S. and Europe, and I've been on tour for years, with a very good jazz guitarist, Charlie Byrd.
When I was in my twenties, I was excited to join the Spanish Barcelona Symphony.
What a wonderful life!
And my parents never complained.
They've always stood by me.
Even if that wasn't their dream.
They used to say to their neighbors and friends, "Our son's gonna take a decade off."
And there's an awkward conversation about my life that I want to share with you.
I was 27 years old, and I came home from Barcelona, and it was Christmas, and I went home to visit my parents, and I was cooking dinner for my mother, and the two of us were in the kitchen.
She was silent and silent.
I think something's wrong.
I asked my mother, "Mom, what are you thinking?"
She said, "Your dad and I are really worried about you."
I was surprised, "What is it? What are you worried about?"
And she said, "I want you to answer my question honestly: Did you vote for the Republicans?"
The truth is, I'm not interested in politics, I'm just a French trumpet player.
But I kind of get it, they sense something, so there's some confusion.
I became a fanatic admirer of capitalism, and let me tell you why.
Believe it or not, it's rooted in my long history of research into poverty.
When I was a kid in Seattle, I remember it was the first time that I had touched real poverty.
My family belongs to the lower middle class, but of course it's not really poor.
Not at all.
The first time I saw the true face of poverty, in the early 1970s, I was only six or seven years old.
Like many of us, this is an ordinary example.
It's a painting in National Geographic of a country in East Africa that's about my age, flies flying in his face and has a bloated stomach.
I know he won't make it, I know it, and I can't do it.
Some of you may remember a painting like that, not necessarily exactly the same, but very similar.
It shows the Western world the unbearable poverty of the rest of the world.
That's a picture that I can't keep in my head, and I grow up, go to school, drop out, start forming my own family.
I wonder, what happened to that kid?
Or what about the rest of the world?
I started to study this question, and even though I was no longer in college, I was still looking for answers: what happened to the poorest people in the world?
Is it bad or better? What's going on?
I finally found the answer, and changed my life. I want to share it with you.
In fact, most Americans feel that from childhood, from the moment they saw it,
Poverty has worsened. If you ask the Americans, "Is the world's poverty worse or better?" Seventy percent would say that hunger has been worse since the early 1970s.
But the truth is this.
This is a moment to change my mind, to make me understand.
Since 1970, the percentage of the world's hungry population that lives on less than a dollar a day, adjusted by inflation, has fallen by 80 per cent.
The percentage of the world's poorest people has decreased by 80 percent since I was a child.
And I don't know that.
My friends, it's a miracle!
It's something to celebrate.
This is the greatest achievement against poverty in human history, and it happens in our lifetime.
When I knew that, I thought, what made it possible to get out of poverty?
Because if you don't know why, it'll just be a flashback.
We're going to replicate success, we're going to get 200 million people still struggling with poverty out of the way, because that's what we've been talking about: Since I was a child, two billion of the poorest people, our brothers and sisters, were out of poverty.
I want to save the remaining 2 billion people, so I have to know why.
I'm looking for answers.
It's not a political answer, because I don't care about political answers.
Now, still don't care.
I'm eager to get the best answers from mainstream economists, whether left, right or middle economists.
Down there.
I will begin with specific reasons.
From childhood to now, 2 billion people have been lifted out of poverty.
There are five reasons. I: Globalization
II. Free trade
III. Property rights
IV. Rule of law
V. Entrepreneurship
These were the result of a free market economy that swept around the world after 1970.
I'm not childish.
I know that a free market economy is not perfect, and I know that a free market economy doesn't meet all our needs for a better world.
But it's great.
And beyond politics.
That's what I learned and learned.
Capitalism is not just capital accumulation.
It's wonderful that it's about ambition, as many people on this stage have said, it's about dreams, it's rooted in free-market systems.
We must make that clear to more people.
Now, I'd like to talk about my second consciousness, which is related to the first, and I believe that it will contribute not only to the development of the world, but also to the development of our country.
To sum up the idea of lifting people out of poverty in one sentence, it's: "The free market creates the greatest wealth in history.
And lift hundreds of millions out of poverty.”
Whose famous words?
Like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
Wrong!
It's President Obama!
Why do I have memory?
Because he was talking to me.
Surprise.
I said, "Hallelujah! "
And not only that, I said, "What a great opportunity."
You know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, we were doing an event at Georgetown University about what we did.
And then I thought of solutions to the biggest problem facing America today. What's that?
It's the liberals and conservatives that gather together to discuss these ideas and help those who need our help most.
I don't have to say that everyone here knows that we're in a crisis, in the United States and in other countries in the world with political differences.
This is an urgent matter.
This is worrying.
Last year, an article was published in one of the most influential and cutting-edge scientific journals in the West in the National Academy of Sciences.
It's a 2014 article on political motivation asymmetrical.
What's that? Psychologists describe this as assuming that your mind is based on love, while the other is based on hatred.
This is common in world disputes.
For example, between Palestinians and Israelis.
The author of this article found that in the United States today, a large proportion of Republicans and Democrats are divided on political motives.
Now most of the politically active people in our country think they're driven by love, and the rest by hatred.
Think about it.
Most people always say, "My mind is based on compassion, I want to help people, and the other part of people, they're evil, they're trying to defeat me."
A society with such divisions cannot progress.
It's impossible.
How do we solve this problem?
First, let's face it honestly: differences exist.
We can't reduce our differences because it's childish.
There is considerable in-depth study of this.
My friend Jonathan Hayt is a regular customer of TED.
He's a professor of psychology at New York University.
He studied different people's ideas, values and ethics, and how they were different.
He proved that conservatives and liberals have very different views on what they think is important.
Jonathan Hayt, for example, shows that liberals care more about poverty than about economic freedom 59 percent.
And conservatives care about economic freedom 28 percent more than about poverty.
It seems irreconcilable, right?
Can't we come together? No! No!
Our strength lies precisely in our differences.
Remember what stopped poverty:
It's the obsession and concern with poverty and the free economic order around the world.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people, we want to help another 200 million people out of poverty.
There's no other way.
Yeah.
What are we gonna do?
It's a delicate thing, isn't it?
We need to think innovatively.
A lot of innovative ideas are on this stage.
Yes! Those extraordinary social entrepreneurship.
We're going to invest abroad in a sustainable, responsible, ethical way.
But you know what we really need?
We need to open up new horizons of flexible thinking.
We need to be less predictable.
Right?
Have you ever felt that your ideas are beginning to become predictable?
Start following the rules?
Do you feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you?
Why is that dangerous?
Because when we're talking about the economy in this country, on the one hand we're talking about conservatives, we're talking about taxes, rules and big government.
And on the other hand, liberals, talking about the economy, always about income inequality.
Right? It's important to me, to you.
But when those who are starving need our help, these are just distractions.
We should be united in the best way to reduce poverty as much as we can, only when conservatives realize that they need liberals to worry about poverty, and liberals need to be conservative about free market obsessions.
We will succeed. Only if we choose this path will this diversity breed the strength of the future nation.
How do we achieve this? How do we work together?
I have some operational advice for you and for myself.
Remember, it's not good enough just to tolerate dissent.
Not enough.
We need to remember that we need people who don't agree with us, because there's a group of people who need all our help, and they're still waiting.
What are you gonna do? How?
From where? From here!
We are all happy here.
We have people who listen to us.
We're very successful, we have leadership.
When people hear our unknown ideology, perhaps they will listen to us.
Maybe this is the starting point for success.
That is the first point. Second.
Point two: I'm asking you, and I'm asking myself, to be a vague, undefined individual.
If you're a conservative, then be a conservative who keeps the issue of poverty in his mouth and insists on the moral obligation to fight for the poor.
If you're liberal, do a liberal that often praises the glamour of the free market under our responsible operation.
If we do that, two goals are within reach.
One: we're beginning to work on helping the next 2 billion people to solve problems like they did before, helping them solve problems, and we're going to do more in the future. That is what we can do.
The second is that we may be able to overcome this terrible ideological war that has afflicted us, turning it into a competition based on the idea of solidarity and mutual respect.
Maybe by then, just maybe we'll find that our so-called differences are not that irreconcilable.
Thank you!
When I went to college, I was a political major, which means I had to write a lot of papers.
When a regular student writes a thesis, they'll probably split up the task like this.
So, you know, it's probably a little slow to start, but it's written a lot after a week, and then it's written a little more, and then it's done, and it doesn't screw up.
I want to.
At least that's my plan.
I'm ready to start, but, in fact, by the time I write the paper, I do.
And it happens every time you write a paper.
And finally, when you're writing a 90-page dissertation, you should have spent a year writing it.
I know that for a paper like this, my usual practice is not working.
Thesis is a big project.
So I planned, decided to do it.
That is how one year of work is organized.
At first, less, a little more in the middle of the month, and at the end of the day, the high-speed gear was just like little steps.
How hard can it be to climb a step?
It's no big deal, right?
But then something interesting happened.
The first few months?
Coming and going, I'm barely doing anything.
So there's this great change plan.
And then... the middle months were just like this, and I basically didn't write a few words, so that's what happened.
And then from two months to another month, to two weeks.
And then one day I realized that there were only three days before the deadline, and I didn't write a single word, so I did the only thing I could do: And I spent 72 hours writing 90 pages, working all night for two days, and people shouldn't spend two nights running through campus at full speed, slowly sneaking in and delivering papers before the deadline.
I thought it was over.
I got a call a week later from the school.
They said, "Are you Tim Leban?"
I said, "Yes."
They said, "We need to talk to you about the paper."
I said, "Okay."
And they said, "This is the best paper we've ever seen. “...
That didn't happen.
This paper is very, very bad.
I just wanted to enjoy this moment, when you all thought, "This guy is awesome! “...
It's not like that. That paper sucks.
Anyway, I'm a Boven author now.
I'm writing an essay for Breaking the Sandpot.
A few years ago I decided to write an article about delays.
My procrastination is always confusing to those around me who don't delay, so I'd like to explain to those who don't delay what the procrasters think, and why we procrasters do that.
My assumption is that the procrastination brain is different from the procrastination brain.
To prove that, I found an MRI laboratory that allowed me to scan my brain and a brain that proved not to be a delayr, and then I could compare the two brains.
I brought them all today.
I want you to make a serious comparison of whether there's any difference.
I know you're not trained brain experts, but let's see, okay?
It's a brain without delay.
Now,
It's my brain.
There is a difference between the two.
There's a rational decision maker in both brains, but there's a monkey in the procrastination brain.
What does that mean for procrasters?
It means everything's fine before this happens.
So when rational decision-makers made rational decisions, and wanted to do something productive, the monkey didn't want to do it, and he said, "Well, let's actually read the Wikipedia scandal about Nancy Kriegen/Tony Yahadin, because I just remembered that.
And then let's go to the fridge, and look around for 10 minutes and see if there's anything new.
After that, let's continue to browse on the video site, starting with Richard Feynman talking about the magnetic video, and seeing the interview with Justin Bieber's mother and seeing the sky.
"It's all taking time, so our schedule today can't take time to work.
I'm sorry! “...
What's going on?
Immediate satisfaction with the monkey doesn't seem to be the one you want him to fuck the prosecution.
He's totally alive right now.
He doesn't remember the past, he doesn't know the future, he only cares about two things: simple and happy.
In the animal world, that's fine.
If you were a dog, you'd have been a great success if you'd lived a simple and happy life!
And for monkeys, humans are another animal.
You sleep well, eat well, and breed the next generation, which may be fine in tribal times.
But if you haven't noticed, we're not living in tribal times.
We're in an advanced civilization, and monkeys don't know what that is.
That's why there's another guy in our head, rational decision maker, who gives us the ability to do things that other animals can't do.
We can anticipate the future.
We can look at the big picture.
We can do long-term planning.
And he wants to take all this into account.
He wants us to do anything worth doing now.
Sometimes doing simple happy things makes sense, like eating, sleeping, or enjoying the leisure time that you deserve.
That's why there's an overlap between instant satisfaction with monkeys and rational decision makers.
Sometimes they agree.
But sometimes, the more meaningful thing is to do things that are more difficult and less enjoyable, for the sake of the whole picture.
At this point, there will be a conflict between the two.
And for the procrasters, every conflict ends in this way, and that's where he spends a lot of time in the orange area, which is the simple and happy, but meaningless area.
I call this area a dark playground.
The dark playground is a place that all procrasters know well.
It's a place for leisure and recreation when it's not supposed to be.
The joy in the dark playground is not actually joy, because it's completely free, and it brings guilt, fear, anxiety, self-hatred, which is the feeling of all those who delay.
And the question is, in this case, how can a monkey take control of the wheel, and let the procrasters take themselves to the blue area, which is not so comfortable, but there's a lot of important things to do.
In fact, the Delayer has a guardian angel, who always despises him and guards him, and in those darkest moments it is called a panic monster.
Panic monsters spend most of their time hibernation, but when the deadline is very close, or when it's in danger of being ugly in front of the public, or when it's in the face of a career disaster, or when there's other terrible consequences, it wakes up.
And what's important is that he's the only thing a monkey's afraid of.
Recently, in my life, panic monsters became quite important, because TED staff contacted me six months ago and invited me to give a speech.
Of course I promised.
I've always dreamed of doing a TED speech.
But in this excitement, rational decision makers seem to think about something else.
He'd say, "We know what we just promised.
Do we have the ability to do that job in the future?
We have to sit down and get to work."
And the monkey said, "All right, but let's open Google Earth and push the camera 200 feet below India, and then take two and a half hours to roll up to this country's surface, and let's feel India better. “...
That's what I did that day.
When six months became four months, then two months, and then one month, TED staff started posting speakers.
I opened the website to see my face staring at myself.
Guess who woke up at this hour?
So the panic monsters started to go crazy, and a few seconds later, the whole system was in chaos.
And monkeys, remember? He's afraid of panic.
And finally, rational decision makers can finally take the prosecution's turn, and I can start preparing this speech.
And in the sense of a panic monster, all those pretty stupid procrastinations, like me, took two weeks to start writing the opening words of the paper, and then magically had the incredible work passion to write eight pages all night.
And this whole thing, plus those three roles, is the system of procrasters.
Not good, but at least it's working.
This is something I decided to write on my blog a few years ago.
After the release, I was surprised by the response.
I received thousands of e-mails, people from different parts of the world, doing different things.
There are nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and a lot of doctoral students.
It's basically the same thing: "I have the same problem."
But what impresses me is the contrast, the easy tone of the post and the contrast of the heavy tone of those emails.
These people have a strong sense of frustration because delays affect their lives, because monkeys control their ideas.
After thinking about it, my question is, if the delayr system works, then what's going on?
Why do all these people have such a dark corner?
As a result, I found two kinds of delays.
What I'm talking about today, all the examples I've given you have deadlines.
There's a deadline, the effect of the delay is limited to a short period of time because the panic monsters will intervene.
But for the second delay, it happens without a deadline.
You want to start your own business or work in art, for example, there's no deadline at first, because nothing happens before you start working hard, and there's no push to get things going.
There's no deadline for important things other than career, for example, visiting your family, or exercising to stay healthy, trying to improve relationships or leaving an unsatisfactory relationship.
If the procrasters do these difficult things, there's only one mechanism -- the panic monsters -- then the problem is, because without deadlines, the panic monsters don't happen.
He didn't need to wake up, so the consequences of the delay were unlimited, and they would only extend indefinitely.
And this long-term delay is less obvious than the more interesting, shorter-term delay based on deadlines, and it's not often talked about.
It usually affects us quietly and quietly.
It could be a source of a lot of chronic unhappiness and guilt.
I think that's why those people send emails, and that's why they're in such a bad situation.
Not because they're rushing for something.
It's this long delay that makes them feel like they're just a bystander in their own lives.
Their frustration is not because they can't achieve their dreams; they can't even begin to pursue their dreams.
So after reading these e-mails, I have a little realization that I don't think there's anyone without delay.
Yes, I think we are all delaying.
You may not be like us, and everything is a mess, and maybe some people can face the deadline very well, but remember, the most despicable trick of monkeys is that there are no deadlines.
Now I want to show you one last thing.
I call it a life calendar.
Assuming a person can live to be 90, every week a grid.
Not many grids, especially we've lived for years.
I think we all need to spend some time looking at this calendar.
We need to think about what we're really delaying, because everyone's delaying something.
We have to be aware of the immediate satisfaction of this monkey.
That's what all of us should do.
And because there's not a lot of grids, this work should probably start today.
Well, maybe not today, but...
You know.
In the near future.
Thank you.
There we are. The soul and body were squeezed into a Texas church, which was the last night of our lives.
Like now we're in this room, except it's full of squeaky wooden benches, with broken red cloths, the organ on my left, the choir behind me, and a baptism pool on the back wall.
Just like this room.
The same strong sense of suspicion, the same deep desire for salvation, the same bitter sweat in the hands of the heart, and the same group of people who are absent.
It was December 31, 1999, that night, as far as I know, the world will end.
I was 12 years old, and I was in a responsible age.
I realized that Jesus came back this time was so unfair, that I was responsible for everything I'd done before. But when I stop complaining, I think I'd better clean up the house.
I'll go to church as much as I can.
I was afraid of the silence around me, just as people were afraid of the noise, just to make sure God didn't fool me, and I came back early and left me behind.
But if he does come early, I have a backup plan, which I read in the book "The Lost of the Last Day."
I saw in the text that if after the midnight party, I wasn't taken away, and I had a chance.
I just need not to defeat the devil in the name of the pagans, to overcome the plague, to defeat the antichrist.
It's gonna be pretty hard -- but I'm sure I can.
But it's too early to prepare.
It's 11:50 p.m.
We have 10 minutes left, and the priest lets us get up from the bench and go down to the altar, because he wants us to pray together at the moment of midnight.
So we split up into groups, and we got to the location.
The choir is still on the stage, the church deacon and their wives -- actually, I prefer to call them the Baptist bourgeois in the first row of the altar.
You know, in America, even on the night of Christ's return, there's a VIP.
And behind the Baptist bourgeois, it's the old people -- the young men and women who are on their backs, in the cotton fields of East Texas, tanned by the hot sun, the cleavages of the face burned into noble brown, just like East Germany's clay, and they're broken, sometimes more than their backs, by the good dreams and dreams of life and the world outside of East Texas.
Yes -- these men and women are my idols and stars.
They've waited their whole lives for this moment, just as their medieval ancestors yearn for the end of the world, just as my grandmother yearned for Oprah, and aired it on Channel 8 at 4:00 a.m. every day.
When she went to the altar, I snuck behind her, because I was pretty sure my grandmother was going to heaven.
I thought if I held her hand tight in this prayer, I might go with her.
So I grabbed it, I closed my eyes, listened, waited.
Prayer's louder.
Respond to the cry of prayer the same much larger too.
The organ rings, and the sound of the tuning is interwoven.
The heat waves roll and the sweat of your hands gets more sour.
My hands are even tighter, and I don't want to be abandoned by God.
My eyes are even tighter, and I don't want to see the fineness taken away, the bad news falling.
And suddenly a sound echoes at the top: "Amen."
It's over.
I look at the clock.
It's after midnight.
I watched the elders, their Savior not come, so proud that they didn't show even a little loss, they believed too deeply, too long, and now it's too late to suspect.
But I'm angry at them.
They were fooled, tricked, confused, and I was deceived with them.
I did what they prayed for, and I tried hard to resist my desire.
I'm not once, I'm twice, one head in that cold-blooded baptism pool.
I believed it.
Now what?
I went home to turn on the TV, just in time for Peter Jennings to announce the new millennium, and the world was celebrating the new year.
I suddenly realized that it was strange to think, that Jesus was coming back and forth again and again, just because time zones were different everywhere.
It makes me feel even worse, kind of hurt, really.
But that night, I didn't stop believing.
I just believed the other thing: "It's possible not to believe."
It's probably all wrong, it's probably wrong.
Now, the peak of the faith that once was raised, there was a spring flowing to the foot of the mountain, a spring of doubt, and it was destined to become a river.
All the dramatic stories of my life can be traced back to that night in the church, when my savior didn't come; things that I believed in were not truth, if not lies.
Although most of you have different ways of welcoming the millennium, I believe that you are here because some of you have done the same thing that I did, after the beginning of the new century, after my mother died, after my father left home, after my savior didn't come.
I'm reaching out with my hands, searching hard for something to believe in.
When I got to Yale when I was 18, I looked, and I believed that coming all the way from a small town in Texas, I had the chance to get out of all the hardship and hardship that I had, out of all those broken dreams and disabilities.
But when I returned home on a cold break, my head was put on the ground, my hands were tied behind my back, and the robber's pistol was held against my head, and I knew that even the best education could not save me.
When I went to Lehman Brothers' internship in 2008, I looked for it.
Full of hope -- I'm excited to call my family, saying we'll never be poor again.
But when I looked at this financial temple right in front of my eyes, I knew that even the best job couldn't save me.
And when I went to Washington, D.C., to be a young journalist, I looked, and I heard a voice from Illinois: "It's been too long, "but in this election, America is about to change."
But when parliamentary work is completely stalled, the country is almost divided, so so-called hopes and changes have become cruel and cold jokes, and I know that even political freshmen can't save me.
I bow before the altar of the American dream and pray to the great men of the time, to succeed, to seek money, to pray for power.
But every time, the midnight bell rings, I open my eyes, and all these myths are dead.
From this grave, I started searching again, not because I was brave, but because I knew I would die if I didn't believe.
So I went to another holy place to worship, Harvard Business School -- this time, I know I couldn't simply accept the Academy's salvation.
No, I know I have more to do.
It all started in the dark corner of a crowded party, and it was a late night in the cruel early winter of Massachusetts, and I asked three friends a question, and some young people who really wanted to do it for a long time, and they said, "How about we go out on our own?"
We don't know where to go, how to go, but we know we have to leave.
Because what we yearn for all our lives, as Jack Kelloark wrote, "Enter the endless night, disappear in the distant sky." Go out and see what people are doing all over the country.
So even if there was a voice of opposition, saying that we were taking too much risks, that there was nothing to gain, that we were leaving.
We traveled 13,000 kilometers across the United States in the summer of 2013, walking through the cattle ranch in Montana, walking through the abandoned city of Detroit, walking through the swamp wetlands in New Orleans, where we found some people, working for them, and they started small businesses, and we used the bottom line to achieve our goals.
After learning about the West Point School of Capitalism, we realized that the idea was revolutionary.
And this idea is spreading, and it's finally growing into a non-profit organization called "Master in Technology" all over the United States, and that's the main reason I can be on the stage today.
It spreads because we find in this generation a strong desire to achieve goals, values of life.
It spreads because we found countless entrepreneurs in the corner of America, who created jobs, changed people's lives, and they needed a little help.
But to be honest, it can spread, and because I'm desperate to spread. In order to spread the Gospel,
There's nothing I'm not going to do, to convince more people that we can heal the wounds of this broken country, relying on a small business.
But it's this evangelical process that led me to a different evangelical process, which I'm going to share with you today.
About one night a year ago, we started at the Natural Sciences Museum in New York, at the Harvard Business School alumni dinner.
Under the full size model of a whale, I sit side by side with the giants of this age, and they celebrate their companions and their great works.
The room is full of pride, and the total assets of these people add up to $500 billion.
We looked down at everything, and thought it was good.
And then this happened, two days later, I went to Harlem, New York, and I sat on a city farm where there was an abandoned parking lot, listening to a guy named Tony talking about kids, and they went there every day.
All of them are below the poverty line.
A lot of people put all their belongings in their backpacks for fear of being stolen from the shelter.
Some people came to Tony's farm, called Harlem Growing, to get their only meal a day.
Tony told me he started Harlem Growing on his own pension, and he was a taxi driver for 20 years.
He said he didn't leave a penny for himself, because while the project was a success, it was extremely scarce.
He said he'd take any help he could find.
And I'm going to help him.
But when I left Tony, I had a sting in my heart, tears wet my eyes.
I felt the burden of inspiration, and one night I could sit in a room, talking to hundreds of people worth $500 billion about a better world, but two days later, in another room, only 50 blocks away, a man without pay was going to provide his child with the only meal a day.
But it's not this gruesome social inequality that awakens me, it's not these hungry, homeless children, it's not the anger of 1%, it's the pity of 99%.
No, I can't calm down because I finally realize that this country needs a radical change, and I'm just a little patch.
I realized that my story represented a group of people who wanted to be self-reliant, even if they were poor; that my organization represented all-basic, systematic help, but never reached Harlem, or the Appalachian Mountains and the next nine districts of New Orleans; and that my screams represented voices that sounded unbelievably, unmodified, unbecoming.
And this sense of shame, this feeling of shame, washes me off, like the shame of sitting in front of the TV, watching Peter Jennings proclaim the new millennium, over, over, over.
I was fooled, fooled, confused,
But this time, the false Savior is me.
You know, I came all the way from that altar, and that night I felt like the world was going to be destroyed, coming from a small town that used a variety of dialects to think that suffering was God's gift to humanity, and to think of it as a creed, a eternal truth.
Yes, my journey was so long, I went back to where I started.
Because we can't just sum up, say there's no faith in this age. No, we believe in something as much as ever.
Some people might believe the predictions of Brian Brown or Tony Robbins. We might believe the motto of the New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review.
We may believe in the things that we worship in TED's church, but we have to believe, and we need to believe.
We mimic the rhetoric of the glamorous leaders who promised to solve all human problems.
We feel that suffering is a gift to us from the capitalist God, and we see technological development as a doctrine, as an eternal truth.
But we never realized the human cost, we wouldn't question a brick, because we were afraid the whole building would collapse.
But if you're uneasy about what we're used to, it's time to question.
So the evangelicals I preach are not breakthroughs, innovations, or sustainable development.
I don't even have the gospel of faith to share with you.
All I have is the Gospel of doubt.
The Gospel of the Challenge doesn't stop you from believing, it asks you to believe in a new thing: "It's possible not to believe."
It's possible that all the answers we know are wrong, and it's probably wrong.
Yes, questioning the Gospel may mean that we exist on this stage, in this room, all wrong.
Because it raises a question: "Why?"
We've got so much power in our hands, why is there anyone else in the heat?
And this kind of questioning led me to make a decision, and the organization that I created, "Master of Management travels all over the United States," is about to stop running.
We've disbanded our employees, closed the door, and we've opened this to everyone, so long as they feel they can do it, they don't need our approval.
This kind of questioning forces me to remove the "Savior" hat that someone's wearing over me, because our lives are too short, too low to wait for Christ to come back, and the fact is, there are no miracles in this world.
And this doubt, it drives me, it gives me hope, when the difficulties are about to crush us, when the path of fate seems to lead us astray, when our Savior cannot heal the wounds, not our blind faith, but our simple questioning, will spill a little light into our life and the darkness of the world. Let's whisper.
Scream, or simply, very simply, says, "There must be another way."
Thank you.
Food crisis.
In the daily news.
What's that?
Some parts of the world are too food-poor, some parts of the world are rich in food.
In some places, genetically modified food saves the world.
Maybe genetically modified food is a problem?
Too many genetically modified agricultural effluents create polluted oceans, toxic seawater, thin nutrients.
This cycle continues.
I found out that today's discussion is so unfavourable.
How do we get this discussion to be understood?
How was the apple food crisis?
I'm sure you all ate an apple in the past week.
How long do you think it took to pick apples from your hands?
Two weeks?
Two months?
Eleven months -- that's the average time from pick to sell apples at the American mall.
I think it's almost all over Europe.
We pick apples, we freeze them, and we put oxygen in the freezer -- actually, there's a record of workers trying to get into the environment to get an apple back, and then die, because the air in the freezer in the freezer in this environment is toxic to people.
Why don't any of you know about this?
Why didn't I know about this?
90 percent of the nutrients in the apples -- all the antioxidants in the apples -- were completely lost when we bought them.
It's just a little candy.
Why don't we know this? How can this situation be improved?
I think we're missing a platform.
I know the platform -- I'm going to use computers, and I was working on the Internet when I was young.
I've done a lot of really weird things -- on platforms like this.
But I met someone else, and I was able to express myself.
What do you think of food?
If we had a platform, we might have found that the question was very favourable, "if?"
What if the climate is democratic?
This is a global climate map.
The most efficient agricultural area is green, and the worst is red.
They're going to change, change, and California farmers are going to become Mexican farmers.
China gets land in Brazil to grow better food, and we are all slaves to the environment.
What if every country has its own climate?
How does that change our lives?
How will that change the quality of our lives and nutrition?
The problem with the last generation is that we need more food and less expensive.
Welcome to the world farm.
We built a huge simulated farm.
These lines are tracks -- cars, planes, trains and cars.
It's a miracle to provide enough food to 7 billion people, with very few people involved in making food.
But if...
We built a digital farm?
Digital world farm.
If you can take this apple, in a way, digitize it, transmit it through the particles in the air, and then reorganize the particles on the other side?
What if?
Look at these quotes, you know, they encouraged me to do it.
First: “Japan has no young people, no water, no land, no future.” This is the day I arrived at the southern Mt., where Fukushima went south, after the nuclear power plant accident.
The children went to Sendai and Tokyo, the land was contaminated by a nuclear power plant accident, and they imported 70 percent of their food.
But this is not unique to Japan.
Only 2% of the American population is engaged in agriculture-related work.
Two percent of the population is in agriculture. What answer do you give us?
Let's look at the rest of the world, 50% of the African population is under 18.
Eighty percent of them don't want to be farmers.
Agriculture is too hard.
Small farmers live too hard.
They choose to go to the city.
In India: Families of farmers do not have access to the most basic agricultural appliances, and more farmers have committed suicide than in the last 10 years.
It's so sad to talk about it.
Where are they going?
To the city.
No young people, young people go to the city.
What kind of platform do we have to build to encourage young people?
Look at this new tractor.
This is my joint harvester.
A few years ago, I went to a chain store and started looking for tools.
I made stupid things that I let plants dance and connect them to my computer and then I destroyed them -- a lot.
I finally let them survive.
I created one of the closest relationships in my life, because I learned the language of plants.
I want them to grow bigger.
They said, "Kids, do your best!
This is an unused electronic studio.
What can you do?"
And with the team members, we built a farm in the media lab, a place that used to be thought to be connected to e-life, not biology.
In this 60 square meters of space, we made enough food rations to supply about 300 people for a month -- not much.
There's a lot of interesting technology here.
What's the most interesting thing?
Beautiful, white roots, deep green plants harvest once a month.
Is this a new restaurant?
Is this a new sales experience?
Is this the new store?
What I can be sure of is that this is the first time that any plant can be uprooted in a media lab.
We put salad in the bag; there's nothing wrong with it.
But what happens when you have an image processor, a data scientist, a robot expert, and you pull up plants and you think, "Well, I know about that -- I can make the plan happen, and I want to try."
We'll take the plants out and we'll take some back to the lab, because if you planted them, you wouldn't throw them away; because it's precious to you.
I have this weird tongue now, because I don't want anyone eating them before me, and I hope it's delicious.
I eat lettuce every day.
And I'm like, "No, that's 6.1 -- no, you can't eat it today."
It was very sweet that day.
It's because it's very stressful, and it produces its own chemical reaction to protect itself: "I don't want to die!"
Plants that don't want to die taste sweet.
Scientists went back to studying plant physiology.
I think we can all try to get involved.
We look forward to seeing your creations, so we've conceived a laboratory that can be transported to other places.
Make it out.
The front of this media lab is my lab, which has 30 sensors per plant.
If you know the genome or genetics, that's the style group, right?
Tables show the pattern.
And when you say, "I like Mexican strawberries," what you really like is that strawberries are produced under conditions like that.
You can encode this climate -- how much carbon dioxide, how much oxygen you create -- and you can program it to control the presentation of plants, and the nutrient content, the size of plants, the shape, the colour and the quality.
We need data, so we put in a lot of sensors to give us data.
You can look back at the plants at home, and you look at the plants at home and you're sad because you think, "Why are you dead? Will you talk to me?"
Farmers have the most beautiful eyes to predict the future, when they're 60 or 70 years old.
They can tell you that the plant died because the soil lacked nitrogen, calcium, or it needed a wetter air environment.
These beautiful eyes won't pass.
These are farmers' eyes.
We will keep collecting data and information.
We put these data points together with separate plants.
These are the IP addresses of all the broccoli in my lab that day.
We have an IP address for broccoli.
If that's not weird enough, you can click here to see the plant files.
And it shows you how that plant can grow, not as you think, not just when it's edible.
When will its nutrients reach my needs?
When does it taste like I was expecting it?
Is that too much water?
Has it been too long?
It'll all come in.
It can talk to me, it can communicate, we can talk in languages.
That's the first plant Facebook user, I think?
That's when the plant files start making friends.
I mean, seriously -- plants begin to be friends with plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium.
We're going to begin to understand the complexity of things that can only be assumed now.
They may not be friendly with us -- I don't know, maybe they will, depending on our behavior.
This is my lab now.
It's a little more systematic, and my background is to design a hospital data centre, and I know how to create a controlled environment.
So -- in this environment, we experiment with all sorts of things.
This program, the air planting method, is NASA's development for the Mir Space Station, which reduces the amount of water they need to transfer to space.
What this program does is it accurately provides plants with what they want. Water, minerals and oxygen.
Roots aren't that complex, and when you get these to them, you can see amazing effects.
Plants have two hearts.
Because of two hearts, it's four to five times faster.
It's a perfect world.
We've gone through long technological advances and we're looking for a different world, and we're going to keep doing this, but we're going to have new tools, and this is going to be a perfect world.
We grow all kinds of stuff.
These tomatoes have not been commercialized in the last 150 years.
Do you know we have rare, ancient seed banks?
Seed banking.
That's amazing.
They have living seed that you haven't eaten.
I'm the only one in this room who's ever had tomatoes like this.
The problem is, it's a sauce tomato that we don't know how to cook, so it doesn't look good.
But we've grown all kinds of protein-bearing stuff.
We grow humans -- maybe you can, but we can't.
We realized that the tools were too big and too expensive.
I started putting them around the world for about $100,000.
It's not easy to find people who can dispose of $100,000, so we want to make small tools.
This is actually one of my students -- undergraduate in mechanical engineering, Camille.
Camille and me, and my team, we spent the whole summer repeating experiments, how to make it cheaper, how to work better, how to make people learn to operate.
And then we send these tools to school for children in grades 7 to 11.
If you want to be modest, try to teach the kids what to do.
I went to this school, and I said, "Just set its humidity at 65%."
One of the 7th graders asked, "What's the humidity?"
So I said, "Oh, water in the air."
He said, "There's no water in the air, you idiot."
So I said, "Okay, don't believe me.
Actually, don't trust me, right?
Set it to 100.
He set the humidity to 100. What happened?
Start condensing, create fog, finally start dripping.
And he said, "Oh, moisture is rain.
Why didn't you tell me that before?"
We created an interface that looks like a game.
They have a 3D environment, and they can log in around the world from mobile phones to computers.
There are different parts of the program -- physical regulation, sensors.
They chose the recipes that children in other parts of the world have created.
They choose and activate the recipe, plant seeds.
When seeds grow, children can make changes.
They said, "Why do plants need carbon dioxide? Isn't carbon dioxide bad?
It's suffocating."
Increasing the supply of carbon dioxide, plants die.
The plants live well by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide.
Harvesting plants, you created new electronic recipes.
It's a constant process of design and development and exploration.
They can download all the data from the new plants they're developing, or the new electronic recipes, and what does it do -- is it better or worse?
Imagine these are a core element of processing.
We can learn a lot.
This is what we call a food computer, put in a school for three weeks.
It's three weeks of planting.
And more importantly, for the first time, this kid thinks he can be a farmer -- or he wants to be a farmer.
So we made those resources public.
It's all online; go home and try to build your first food computer.
It's gonna be hard...
We're in the beginning phase, but the resources are there.
For me, making these easy to get is very important.
We will continue to do the same.
These are farmers, electronic engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, botanists, economists, urban planners.
On a platform, do what they're good at.
Team's getting too big.
This is my new experimental equipment that is starting to work.
This warehouse can be built anywhere.
That's why I chose it.
In this warehouse we're going to build this shelf.
You can see it now.
Look at this.
That too exists.
One grows green vegetables, one grows Ebola vaccine.
And what's great is that plants and this winning project of the United States Department of Defense's Advanced Research and Planning Agency are the reasons why we're working on the Ebola virus.
These plants are producing proteins against the Ebola virus.
So drugs and health supplies, go back to vegetable growing.
But these two things look completely different, and that's part of my field.
But many things are not what they think.
And we're still at the stage of "We're Right," and it's like, "This is my little black box," "No, buy me."
"No, no, no-- my intellectual property is absolutely valuable.
Don't buy this, buy mine."
The fact is, we're just at the beginning, and at this point, society is changing.
When we want more, cheaper food, we need better, more environmentally friendly food.
But you saw McDonald's ads promoting the ingredients of McNuggets, the most mysterious food in human history -- McDonald's marketing program is changing -- everything is changing.
Now look at the world today.
Personal food computers, food servers, food data centres, operating in open surface groups.
It's like open genomes, but we're going to put together little climate recipes, like Wikipedia, and you can flip, start, grow.
How does that look?
Do you remember that the world was connected by a string?
It's starting to appear.
We started sending information about food, not distributing food.
It's not just my fantasy, it's what we're already doing.
Food computers, food servers, soon-to-be food data centres, connect people to share information.
The future of food is not a battle for its mistakes.
We all know it's wrong there.
The future food is about connecting the next generation of billion farmers, and empowering them with a question-and-answer platform, "if?"
Thank you.
Sometimes, as a European, I feel very ashamed.
Last year, over a million people came to Europe and we needed our help.
There are too many contradictions here.
We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Cody, but since then, more than 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean.
We have an international convention that recognizes that hosting refugees is a shared responsibility of all nations, yet we accept a small Lebanon with more Syrians than Europe as a whole.
We condemn the existence of human smuggling, yet we make it the only viable way to seek asylum in Europe.
We have a shortage of labour, but we have prevented those who can meet our economic and demographic needs from entering Europe.
We claim that our liberal values are contrary to those of the Islamic fundamentalists, yet -- we use high-handed policies to detain child asylum-seekers, separate children from their families, forcibly confiscate refugee property.
What are we doing?
We're dealing with a humanitarian crisis in an inhuman way.
I don't believe it because people don't care.
I think it's because our politicians lack the vision to adapt to what was proposed 50 years ago to deal with a changing and globalized world.
So what I want to do is step back and ask two very basic questions that we all have to understand.
First of all, why is the existing system not working?
And second of all, what do we do?
The modern refugee system was created after World War II by these people.
It was intended to ensure that when a country collapses, or worse, the regime is hostile to the people of that country, who have a place to go and live in safety and dignity until they can return home.
That's exactly what we saw today in Syria.
Through an international conference co-signed by 147 Governments, the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and an international organization, UNHCR, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), have committed themselves to allowing individuals from other countries to enter their territories to escape from war and persecution.
But now the system is falling apart.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In reality, our immigration policy stands in the way of security.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek equal treatment or to choose to return to their homeland.
But in practice, they are trapped in a state of almost indefinite stagnation.
Theoretically, refugee issues are the responsibility of all States.
In practice, geographical location means that countries that are close to strife are overloading the vast majority of refugees.
The rules of the original refugee system are not the cause of its collapse.
It's that we're not used enough to keep the world changing.
So I want to explain to you how the system works today.
How does the refugee reception system work?
But it's not from a top-down macro-level perspective, it's from an individual refugee perspective.
So imagine a Syrian woman.
We call her Amira for the time being.
Amira represents the many refugees I met in the region.
Amira, like about a quarter of the world's refugees, is a woman with a child who can't go home because of the city that you see in Homs, which was once beautiful and historically rich, and is now devastated.
So Amira can't go back.
Amira doesn't want to be resettled in a third country at the same time, because it's like winning the lottery.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
First, Amira can take her family to the camp.
In the camp, she might get help, but the prospects for Amira and her family are very remote.
The camp is in the middle of the desert.
At the Zatalina camp in Jordan, you can hear shells at night crossing the Syrian border.
Economic activity is limited.
The quality of education is often low
And all over the world, about 80 percent of the refugees in the camps had to be there for at least five years.
It's a sad place, and it might explain why, in reality, only 9 percent of Syrians chose this option.
Or Amira could go to a city in a neighbouring city, like Amman or Beirut.
Seventy-five percent of Syrian refugees chose this option.
But even there, it's hard.
Refugees in cities usually have no right to work.
They don't usually have access to aid.
So when Amira and her family run out of basic savings, they're probably running out of poverty.
There's a third option.
Amira can find hope for her family and embark on a dangerous journey that could bury her life in another country.
Globally, we leave refugees with an almost impossible choice, of these three options: refugee camps, urban poverty, and dangerous journeys.
For refugees, this option is the global refugee regime today.
But I think it's a wrong choice.
I think we can reconsider that option.
The reason we're limiting these options is that we think these are the only options available to refugees, but they're not.
Politicians make it a problem of profit and loss.
We seem to agree with the assumption that refugees are an inevitable burden and expense to society.
But it's not a formality. Refugees can contribute.
So what I'm trying to prove is that we have a way to increase that option and still benefit everyone: our societies, our communities, our refugees themselves.
I'd like to propose four ways to change our thinking about refugees.
These four approaches have one thing in common, and we have taken advantage of globalization, social mobility and markets to update our understanding of refugee issues.
The first thing I want to think about is the concept of creating an environment, which comes from a basic understanding that refugees, like everyone else, are in a specific environment.
My colleagues at Oxford University started a research project in Uganda on the economic life of refugees.
We chose Uganda, not because it's a typical representative of the receiving country.
It's an exception.
Unlike most of the host countries in the world, what Uganda does is give refugees economic opportunities.
Give them the right to work, give them freedom of movement.
The result is amazing, for both refugees and host countries.
In Kampala, Uganda's capital, we found that 21 percent of the refugees started their own business and hired others.
In other words, refugees are creating jobs for citizens of host countries.
Even in the refugee camps, we have found examples of dynamic and prosperous start-ups.
For example, in a refugee camp called Nakivalé, we found Congolese refugees trading digital music.
We found the business of Rwandan refugees so that young people could play computer games on the recycled console and display screens.
The refugees are constantly changing.
He came to the camp with nothing but a filmmaker.
So with his friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station, he rented a camera, he's making a movie now.
He's already made two documentaries, and our team, and he's had a successful career for our team, and he's started with little resources.
That's exactly the kind of example that should dominate our response to refugees.
Instead of believing that refugees are inevitably dependent on humanitarian aid, we need to give them the opportunity to prosper.
That's right. Clothes, blankets, shelter, food are very important during the emergency phase, but we have to think long-term.
We need Internet connections, electricity, education, the right to work, funding and commercial channels.
All the ways we take for granted into the global economy can and should be given to refugees.
The second idea I want to discuss is the economic zone.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have adopted Uganda's policy.
Most host economies are not open to refugees, but we still have viable alternatives.
Last April, I travelled to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist Paul Kolya, where we discussed an idea with the international community and local governments to bring jobs to the Syrians while promoting Jordan's national development strategy.
The idea is to create an economic zone in which we can combine the employment of refugees with that of nationals of the host country, Jordan.
There are only 15 minutes outside the Zatali camp, where 83,000 refugees are housed in an existing economic zone known as King Hussein Development.
The government invested over $100 million to connect the power grid and roads, but there are two things missing: labour and foreign investment.
So what if the refugees were able to work there, instead of being trapped in camps, to afford their families and develop skills through vocational training before returning to Syria?
We recognize that this will benefit Jordan's national development strategy, which requires upgrading manufacturing as a middle-income country.
This will benefit the refugees as well as contribute to the post-war reconstruction of Syria by recognizing that we need to prepare the refugees as the best resource for eventual reconstruction of Syria.
We put it in Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah of Jordan adopted this idea.
Two weeks ago, at a meeting in London in Syria, it was announced that the pilot project would begin this summer.
The third idea I'd like to show is that there's a preference for a match between the state and the refugees, and in order to achieve this happy ending in this self-portrait, it's a picture of German Chancellor Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
We rarely ask the refugees what they want or what they want to go there, but I think we can do it for everyone.
The economist Evan Ross created the idea of a pair market, which is that the order of preference determines the final match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Erics Teterborn, working on how to apply this concept to refugee problems, asked refugees to rank preference countries, but at the same time allowed countries to rank the types of refugees they wanted to receive on the basis of skills or language criteria, and finally to match the two rankings.
Of course, you need to establish quotas on diversity and vulnerability, but it's a way to increase the likelihood of pairing.
The idea of matching has been successfully applied, for example, to students and universities, to kidney donors and patients, and it also highlights the importance of algorithms in dating websites.
So why not use it to give refugees a better choice?
The biggest problem we face at this level is to convince local communities to accept refugees.
For the moment, for example, in my country, we often send engineers to remote areas and farmers to the city.
So matching markets offers a potential way to match these preferences and to reflect the needs and demands of host populations and refugees.
My fourth idea is a humanitarian visa.
Most of the tragedies and chaos we see in Europe are entirely avoidable.
This stems from a fundamental contradiction in European asylum policy: In order to find refuge in Europe, you have to travel to Europe on your own.
In an era of cheap airline and consulates?
These are completely unnecessary journeys, which led to the deaths of more than 3,000 people at the European border and within Europe last year.
If the refugees can go directly to Europe and seek asylum, we can avoid these deaths, and that does happen through humanitarian visas, which allows people to get visas at embassies or consulates in neighbouring countries, and then pay for their own way to Europe by mail or plane.
It costs about 1,000 euros to bring a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek Islands.
It's only 200 euros.
If we allow them to do this, it will bring great results.
This will save lives, root out the illegal markets, eliminate the chaos we see on the edge of Europe, areas like the Greek Islands.
The reason we're prevented from doing this is politics, not rational solutions.
And this is an idea that has been applied.
Brazil first adopted this policy, and more than 2,000 Syrians were granted humanitarian visas to enter Brazil and apply for refugee status upon entry.
In that program, every Syrian was granted refugee status and confirmed as a true refugee.
There's a historical precedent.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports allowed 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens to cross Europe and apply for refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
The Nansen International Office of Humanitarian Affairs won the Nobel Peace Prize for a viable response.
So the four ideas I showed you were the way we could add the Amira option.
To give refugees a better choice than just three basic, impossible options, as I said before, and still benefit everyone.
In general, we need a new perspective to increase refugee choices while recognizing that they are not necessarily a burden on society.
It's not a formality that refugees are spending.
Indeed, refugees are our humanitarian responsibility, but they are also skilled, talented and aspiring human beings capable of contributing to society - If we allow it,
In a new world, migration does not disappear.
What we see in Europe will be there for many years.
People are moving and people are still leaving their homes, and we need to find a rational way to manage -- not on the old logic of humanitarian aid, not on charity, but on the opportunities of globalization, markets and liquidity.
I would like everyone to know that.
Thank you.
When I was little, I always fantasized about the ocean.
It's colorful and dynamic, and it's living with many animals that look like alien creatures.
I imagined the big sharks at the top of the food chain, and I imagined the sea turtles dancing gracefully between coral reefs.
As a cameraman who switched from a marine biologist, I spent most of my career looking for places that I dreamed of when I was a kid.
As you can see, I've been taking risks in the water since I was very young.
But for the first time in the water, it happened when I was 10.
And I can still remember clearly that I was rowing water to get enough of a rusty barrel on the reef.
And finally, I managed to reach the barrel, look up, and find myself surrounded by fish, all kinds of fish, like rainbows.
From that day on, I fell in love with the ocean.
Over the past 40 years, I've had the privilege of exploring the most wonderful ocean landscape on Earth, contributing to the National Geographic Journal and the Save our Oceans Foundation.
My target is big enough to be a giant shark, so small enough to move up your palm.
In the cold sea by the Canadian bear forest, I met humpback whales around me, and I couldn't forget that mouthful of fish.
In the Mozambique Strait, I saw the green turtle courtship.
Each one of us will have an impact on the ocean, on the ocean.
And the pure sea that I dreamed of when I was a kid, it's getting harder to find.
They're getting smaller and smaller, and they're getting more threatened.
We humans have been occupying positions at the top of the food chain on Earth, and I have seen and recorded these acts on camera.
For a long time, I thought only shock pictures would alert my audience.
And, of course, that's a good idea, and that's where I got back.
I believe that the best way to bring about change is to spread love.
I feel like I'm a bridge between humans and animals, and as a photographer, I have a rare opportunity to unmask the mystery of animals and ecosystems hidden deep in the ocean.
If you didn't know something existed, how could you possibly love it and protect it?
And that's exactly what our environmental photographers do.
I've been to hundreds of different seas, but there are only a few images that I'll never forget.
The first time I was struck by a scene like this was almost 10 years ago, on the rugged and steep coast of South Africa.
Every June and July, countless sardines migrate north, which we call the sardines tide.
Trust me, these fish have to do this.
Because there are a bunch of hungry, fast hunters chasing behind.
Like the dolphins that hunt collectively, they separate some of the sardines from the fish, and they gather them into a sphere.
Dolphins will drive these sardines closer to the surface of the sea and then rush into the fish and enjoy the feast that moves.
Followed by sharks.
Most people would think that sharks and dolphins are natural enemies, but in the sardines, they coexist.
Actually, with the help of dolphins, sharks eat better.
Without dolphins, sardines are hard to form, and sharks often go through the middle of the fish, like through donuts, sometimes with a stomach full of water.
I've been in close contact with the shark herds in the sardines, and I understand that the shark didn't look at me.
But I've been hit and swept by my tail, just like the rest of the guests at this noisy feast.
We sailed east from the African coastline, across the vast Indian Ocean, to the Maldives -- an archipelago of coral reefs.
During the rainy south-west monsoon season, the devil fish that live in the archipelagic waters gather around a small island called Hanifaru.
A bunch of shrimp crabs, mostly smaller than our pupils, are the main food for the devilfish.
And when these planktons are scattered, the devilfish tend to fish alone, and they roll back in the water, like dogs chasing their tails.
And as the plankton gathers more and more, the devilfish begin to line their tails together, and grow in a long food group, and the first devil fish lose their taste and be eaten clean by the people behind them.
As the plankton in the bay gathers more and more, the formation of the devilfish gathers more and more, this unique way of feeding, which we call the cyclone.
The Devilfish are stacked, formed in a tight formation, forming a vortex, sucking up the plankton, dropping straight into the giant devilfish mouth.
Diving in the midst of hundreds of demon fish, that's something I'll never forget.
When I first went to Hanifaru, it was not protected, and the environment was threatened by local development.
With such non-governmental organizations as the Devilfish Trust, my photos eventually helped Hanifaru become a marine protected area.
The fishermen of the nearby islands, who have hunted many demon fish, used their skins to make traditional drums.
And now they are the strongest protectors of the Devilfish, which brings more than $8 million annually to Maldives.
I've always wanted to go back to the past, to the time when most of the maps were still blank, or when there were dragons.
The most similar place I've been to date is some remote atolls in the Western Indian Ocean.
It's far from fishing grounds and fishing boats, where diving always makes me sad, because it reminds me of the way the ocean used to be.
Few people have ever heard of Indian reefs, and it's a small coral atoll, in the Mozambique Strait.
Its outer reef forms a protective barrier and the middle atoll lake becomes a kindergarten for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are never shy, even during the day.
I guess they'll be more lively at night and more numerous.
I've never seen so many sharks in a coral atoll lake before.
Recording and sharing such moments -- always reminding me of the purpose of choosing this path.
Earlier this year, I came to California to finish the contract for the National Geographic.
In the middle of the peninsula, on the Pacific side, on the San Ignacio atoll, an important breeding ground for grey whales.
In the last 100 years, this coastline has been a huge slaughterhouse, where over 20,000 grey whales have been killed, leaving hundreds of survivors.
And now, the descendants of these gray whales will push their young children to the sea, play games, and even interact with us.
The species has recovered surprisingly.
On the other side of the peninsula is Cape Plmo, a quiet little fishing village.
Decades of overfishing once brought this village to the brink of bankruptcy.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded the Government to list the area as a marine protected area.
What happens next is a miracle.
In 2005, after just 10 years of protection, scientists found that local fish stocks had recovered in record numbers.
Let's see. Come with me.
Take a deep breath, dive with me into the sea floor, and see what the largest and most dense fish I've ever encountered looks like.
We are all capable of creating hope.
I'd like to send a message through my own photo, from now on, that saving the ocean is not too late.
I want to focus particularly on the resilience of nature, as it confronts 3.7 billion human beings.
I hope that in the years to come, it will be more and more difficult for me to get a picture of people living in harmony with the ocean.
I wish I could get a picture like this every day.
To be known in our profession, you must be a hopeless optimist.
I'm always taking pictures with this assumption, and the next great picture that can make a difference is ahead of me, maybe behind the next reef, in the next atoll lake, or the next.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the heart of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
Immediately after the new government emerged from a long war of independence, it announced a socialist policy to make health care and primary education basic free of charge.
Large-scale rural health services have enabled 80 per cent of the population to reach within two hours of walking.
Twenty-five per cent of Zimbabwean children were routinely immunized during the 1980 independence year
By 1990, just ten years later, it had risen to 80%.
I am honored to be part of this revolution.
Excited and gay love is true.
I felt involved not only in an African independence movement, but also in a progressive global public health movement.
I've also faced some daunting difficulties.
In 1985, the year I arrived, Zimbabwe reported its first case of AIDS.
I took care of a few AIDS patients in the early 1980s, when I was trained in medicine at Harlem Hospital, but... we had no idea what would happen in Africa.
When I first got there, it was about 2%.
When I left Harare 17 years later, one in four adults was infected.
By the mid-1990s, I told hundreds of energetic young people that they were HIV positive.
I saw my colleagues and friends die.
Faced with this situation, my colleagues and I started a clinic.
We'll show you how to use condoms.
We teach at school and in the workplace.
We're doing research and we're giving HIV partners advice on how to protect themselves.
We worked very hard to do it, and I believe I did my best.
I offered the best treatment, at least under conditions.
But I didn't make a constructive change.
Former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, confessed to his personal mistake that led to the Rwandan massacre.
In 1994, he was the head of United Nations peacekeeping.
At the Holocaust 10-year memorial ceremony, he recalled that I believed I had done everything I could, but after the Holocaust, I realized that there was a lot that I could and should do to ring the alarm, to seek support.
The World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people today have died of the disease, and many of them, like me, feel remorse and regret for not stopping it earlier.
But when I lived in Zimbabwe, I didn't realize I was an advocate or a politician.
I thought I went there because of my medical knowledge, because of my clinical and infectious research.
I've always felt that my job is to look after patients and to study to better understand the demographic characteristics of the infection.
I realize that the rate of infection and death from AIDS among marginalized groups is exceptionally high.
In sugar plantations, these are more like feudal territories than modern enterprises.
My job is to show people that being infected is not moral depravity, but about the sense of male power, about forced labour and colonialism.
Most white people are safe.
As medical experts, our methods are unfortunately weak: begging people to change their personal behaviour, using condoms, reducing the number of partners.
The infection rate is the most effective weapon we have against the virus.
I didn't dare say that inequality in access to life-saving medicines, or problems in the underlying economic and political systems, was the driving force behind high rates of infection in such a large population.
I've made an excuse for my silence to remind myself that I'm just a visitor to this country and that the alarm could be deported so I can't do my job, take care of my patients, do urgently needed research.
So I didn't speak out about the government's early AIDS policy.
I'm not saying my concerns are loud enough.
A lot of doctors and health workers may think I did the right thing.
Our commitment to the patient, like the Hippocratic oath and its different versions, is a sacred medical relationship.
I did everything I could to every patient of mine.
But I know that the infectious diseases that accompany the division of our societies are not only biological phenomena, but also marginalization, inclusivity, racial discrimination, gender discrimination, class discrimination.
For AIDS.
For the latest Ebola.
Medical anthropologists, such as Paul Farmer, work on AIDS in Haiti called structural violence: structural, because inequality is rooted in the political and economic organization of our social environment, which is often ignored by the elite and regime; violence, because its effects, like premature death, suffering, disease, are violent.
We're doing very little for our patients.
Ringing the alarm is the first step in the right direction to guide public health, and this is the way we seek support, to break out and create real change.
So now I'm not silent.
I speak boldly about a lot of things.
A lot of this is about apartheid and organized racism that shouldn't have happened in this country, not in medical practice or in public health.
But they do exist.
And that's why the alarm bells in the United States about racism affecting health care, the continuing organized, interpersonal violence against colored people are closely linked to our tragic history, the 250 years of slavery, the 60 years of racial discrimination, and the 60 years of imperfect equality, which is why the alarm bells are the focus of my work as the New York City Health Commissioner.
In New York City, premature death rates, that is, before the age of 65, are 50% higher for blacks than whites.
In 2012, black women faced more than 10 times the risk of dying as a result of childbirth compared to white women.
Although we've made great strides in reducing infant mortality, the mortality rate in the first year of black babies is almost three times that of white babies.
New York City is no exception.
These statistics are similar across the United States.
A recent New York Times analysis of about 15 million black men missing across the country.
According to the author, black men aged 25 to 54, out of every six, at least one person disappears from everyday life, from prison or from premature death.
It's very unfair for young blacks to face disproportionate violence on a daily basis.
But we need to remember the current state and results of general health care, as well as the persistence and extraordinaryly high rates of disease, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, diseases that slowly and quietly consume life, and cause more black people to die prematurely.
As the movement began, I felt frustrated and angry that medical groups, in their research and work, even the use of the word "racist" was indecisive.
Every time I say it, you probably already feel something.
Medical students wear white robes to protest against chemical and biological weapons, but the medical community is largely standing idly by in the face of the effects of continued racial discrimination on disease and mortality.
I'm worried that a personalized and accurate drug, a search for biological and genetic targets, a better design of therapy, might inadvertently prevent us from looking at the big picture, which is the scene of everyday life, a person's life, growth, work, a place of love, which has a significant impact on group health, and for many of us, poor health.
In everyday life, as health workers, whether in clinics or in research, we are witnesses of great injustice: Travellers, unable to comply with medical orders, because he has to give priority to more urgent matters; Young transgender people, planning suicide because our society is too ruthless; Single mothers, forced to feel responsible for the poor health of their children.
As health workers, our role is not just to treat our patients, but to ring the alarm and advocate change.
And whether rational or not, our social position makes our voices more credible and we should not waste them.
I regret the lack of frankness in Zimbabwe, and I have promised myself, as the New York City Health Commissioner, that I will use every opportunity I have to ring the alarm to find support for health equity.
I will speak out against racial discrimination, and I want you to join me, and I will join you when you are sexist, or any kind of inequality, and you are against it.
It's time for us to rise up and fight against structural inequality and speak out.
To advocate for change, we don't need all the answers.
All we need is courage.
The health of our patients, our own health, depends on it.
Well, I'd like to show you how many people have ever blacked out friends on Facebook, because they have made inappropriate statements about politics, religion, children's rights, food, etc.
How many people at least have an unwanted person, because you just don't want to talk to each other?
You know, in the past, we wanted to have a polite conversation, and all we had to do was follow Henry Higgins' advice in "The Lady of the Lady": just talk about the weather and your health.
But these years with climate change and the campaign against vaccines -- that's not working.
So, in the world in which we live, every conversation has the potential to develop into a world of controversy, where politicians can't talk to each other, and even for what's going on, there's a lot of crowd approval or opposition, and that's just not normal.
The Pew Research Center conducted a survey of 10,000 adults in the United States, and found that at this point in time, we have a sharper position than ever before.
We're less inclined to compromise, which means we're not listening to each other.
The decisions we make, where we choose to live, who we marry and who we make friends with, are based only on what we already believe.
Again, that means we don't listen to each other.
And talking needs to be balanced, and somehow, we're losing it.
Technological progress is partly the cause.
Like smartphones, you have them right now, or right next to them, you can get them.
According to Pyo, about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred text messages a day.
And a lot of people in the middle, almost everyone, are more inclined to text friends than to talk face to face.
It's a great article in Atlantic magazine.
The author is Paul Barnwell, a high school teacher.
He gave his students a communication mission.
I want to teach them how not to use notes to speak about a topic.
And he said, "I'm beginning to realize..."
"I'm beginning to realize that communication is probably the most neglected of us, and that we don't have the skills to teach.
Kids spend hours a day reaching out to creative and other partners through screens, but rarely have the opportunity to discover their interpersonal skills."
It sounds funny, but we have to ask ourselves, "What skills are more important in the 21st century than maintaining a coherent, confident conversation?"
Now, my job is to talk to people. Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, governors, plumbers.
I talk to people I like, and I talk to people I don't like.
I'm talking to people at the personal level who don't agree.
But I still have good communication with them.
So I'd like to use the next 10 minutes to teach you how to talk, and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard a lot of suggestions, such as looking at each other's eyes, thinking in advance of interesting topics that can be discussed, watching, nodding and smiling to show your focus, repeating what you've just heard or summing up.
I want you to forget all about it.
It's all useless.
There's no need to learn how to show you're focused, if you really are.
I actually used the same skills as a professional interviewer in everyday life.
Well, I'm here to teach you how to interview people, which actually helps you learn how to be better communicateers.
Learn to start a conversation, don't waste time, don't get bored, and, above all, don't offend anyone.
We all had great conversations.
We all have. We know what that feels like.
The kind of conversation you feel after is over that makes you feel very enjoyable, very encouraged, or you feel like you've made a real connection with someone else, or you get a complete understanding from someone else.
There's no reason to say that most of your interpersonal interactions can't be like that.
I have 10 basic rules. I'll explain one to you, but seriously, if you choose one and master well, you can already enjoy a better conversation.
Article 1: Don't take sides.
I'm not saying just drop your phone, tablet, car keys, or whatever's in your hand.
I mean, in the moment.
Get into that situation.
Don't think about your fight with the boss.
Don't think about what you eat for dinner.
If you want to quit talking, quit talking. But not in Cao's heart.
Article 2: Do not be a teacher.
If you want to express your views, you don't want to leave any opportunity for people to respond, argue, rebut or explain, to blog.
There's a good reason why I don't have an expert lecture in my conversation: because it's really boring.
If they're conservative, they must hate Obama, food stamps and abortion.
If they were liberal, they would hate big banks, oil companies and Dick Cheney.
Absolutely predictable.
You sure don't want that.
You need to assume that you can learn something when you enter every exchange.
The famous therapist M. Scott Pike said that real listening needs to put yourself aside.
Sometimes it means putting your personal perspective aside.
He said that feeling this acceptance, people who speak become less and less sensitive, and thus more and more likely to open up their inner world to listeners.
Again, assuming you need to learn something new.
And Bill Ney said, "Everyone you're going to see has something you don't know."
Let me repeat, everyone is an expert in some way.
Third point: Use of open-ended questions.
In this regard, please refer to the question form of the interview.
The question begins with “who”, “what”, “when”, “where”, “why” or “how”.
If you ask a complicated question, you'll get a simple answer.
If I asked you, "Are you afraid?"
You'll answer the most powerful word in that sentence, "fear," and the answer will be "yes" or "no."
"Are you angry?" "Yes, I was angry."
Let the other side describe, the other side is the one who understands the situation.
Try asking each other, "What's that look like?"
"How do you feel?"
Because then the other side might need to stop and think, and you'll get more interesting answers.
Fourthly, let it be natural.
That is, ideas will naturally flow into your mind, and you need to express them.
We often hear the guest in the interview say a few minutes, and then the host comes back and asks the question, as if he doesn't know where it came from or has already been answered.
That means the host probably didn't listen two minutes ago, because he thought about this very smart question, and he thought about it.
We'll do the same.
When we were sitting with someone, we suddenly remembered the encounter with Hugh Jackson at the coffee shop.
And then we don't listen.
The stories and ideas are always coming to you.
But even if it can't be stopped, don't let them stay too much in your head.
Fifth: If you don't know, say you don't know.
People on radio, especially on the national public radio station, know very well that their conversations will be broadcast. So they'll be more careful where they claim to be professional and what they're saying.
Learn to do this. Be careful.
The conversation should be responsible.
Article 6: Do not compare your experience with others.
If they talk about losing their family, don't start talking about losing your family.
If they're talking about work trouble, don't tell them how much you hate your work.
It's different, never the same.
Any experience is unique.
And, more importantly, it's not about you.
You don't have to prove how capable you are at this moment, or how much pain you've suffered.
Someone asked Stephen Hawking what his IQ was, and he said, "I don't know. Those who take IQs and brag are dicks."
Talk is not about selling yourself.
Article 7: Try not to repeat yourself.
It's aggressive and boring. But we can easily do that.
Especially in work conversations, or with children. We wanted to make a point, so we kept saying it in a different way.
Come on.
Article 8: Cut the crap.
And frankly, no one cares about those years, names, dates and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so forth.
People don't care. They're concerned about you.
They care about who you are, and what you have in common.
So forget the details.
This is not the last one, but the most important one.
Listen carefully.
I can't tell how many important people have said that listening may be the most important, the first important skill you can upgrade.
Buddha -- I repeat, "If you keep talking, you won't learn anything."
Calvin Corritz used to say, "No one ever gets expelled for listening too much."
Why don't we listen to each other?
First, we prefer to say it.
I'm talking when everything's under my control.
I don't have to listen to anything I'm not interested in.
I'm the focus.
I can strengthen my identity.
But there's another reason: we'll be disturbed.
People say about 225 words per minute, but we can hear almost 500 words per minute.
So our brain is occupied by this other 275 words.
I know it's hard to really listen to people. But if you don't, you're not talking.
You're just two people in the same place who yell at each other without any connection.
You must listen to each other.
Steven Corvet has an excellent account of this.
He said, "Most of us listen to it for understanding.
We listen to you in response."
Finally, article 10: Simplicity.
"Good conversation is like a proper mini skirt; short enough, attractive enough, long enough to include the subject -- my sister's metaphor," all of which is condensed into the same concept, which is: to be interested in others.
I grew up next to a famous grandfather, and my family's guest contacts were endless.
The visitors came before and spoke to my grandparents, and after those people left, my mother came and said to us, "Do you know who that is?
She's Miss America's army.
He's the mayor of Sacramento.
She won the Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballet dancer."
I'm growing up by default and everyone's got an undisclosed beauty.
Seriously, I think it's all made me a better host.
I try not to talk, but open my mind, always prepared to be surprised, and I will never be disappointed.
You can do that.
Go out, talk to someone, listen to others, and most importantly, be ready to be surprised.
Thank you.
Hello.
My name is Matthew Williams. I'm a champion.
I've won medals in three different sports and at the Canadian Whole.
I have five days a week with top coaches and psychological counselors to train basketball and race for the best possible race.
It's all because of the special Olympics.
Does this make any difference to me and to my achievements?
The world doesn't think of all people like me as champions.
Not long ago, people like me were invisible.
Since the special Olympic Games of 1968, the phenomenon has improved considerably, but in reality it is common to see that people with intellectual disabilities are often invisible compared to ordinary people.
People call me stupid in front of me and think I don't care.
They call me "wit," they say I'm retarded, and it's totally derogatory.
They don't know how much it hurt me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here to get pity.
I'm here because there's still a problem: there's a lot of people who look at people with intellectual impairments in a way that's wrong, or, more than that, many people don't even recognize them.
You all know the World Games are being held this year, right?
I'm one of 6,500 intellectually handicapped athletes.
Over 62,000 people were watching the opening ceremony, and TSN and ESPN were live.
But do you know about this?
What do you think when you see someone like me?
I'm here today to make a bold offer to treat us equally.
The special Olympic Games have changed the intellectually handicapped athletes' self-perception and the audience's perception.
If you're not familiar with the Special Olympics, let me explain, it's for the mentally handicapped.
It's independent of the Paralympics and the Olympics.
We have high-quality, year-round sports for intellectually handicapped athletes that can change our destiny and our perception.
The Special Olympics have changed my life, and the lives of many people, and the way the world looks at people with intellectual disabilities.
I was born with epilepsy and mental deficiencies.
I was a hockey player until I was 12.
The older you grow up, the harder it is to keep up with people.
For some time, I didn't touch any sports, and not many friends felt abandoned and unapproved.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were isolated from this society and not made public.
No one would think that they could participate in sports, let alone be valuable members of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at Toronto University, was studying the effects of normal motion on the health of mentally handicapped children.
Dr. Hayden and other researchers have come to the conclusion, through rigorous scientific research, that the reasons for the decline in the health of children with intellectual disabilities are simply lack of opportunities to exercise.
A lot of people question that people with intellectual disabilities can benefit from sports projects or sports competitions.
But it's precisely because Dr. Hayden, and the founder of the Special Olympics, Eunice Kennedy Sharif, are insisting on the benefits of sport, and the special Olympic athletes have proved the benefits of sport not less than 4.5 million times.
Before I went to the Special Olympics, I was a nervous man because I was young and shy and had no confidence and no friends.
But when I got there, I found out that everyone was friendly and helpful and that I wasn't allowed to be myself.
Now, I'm a basketball player, and I'm a race skater who's been in provincial and national games, and this year I'm at the Special Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, where I represent the first Canadian basketball player in the world.
I'm one of the 4.5 million athletes in the world.
To be an athlete of the special Olympic Games, to help us regain confidence and dignity.
It also points to important health needs.
Research shows that on average, men with intellectual impairments live 13 years less than men without mental impairments, and women with intellectual impairments live 20 years less than women without intellectual impairments.
The special Olympic Games keep us healthy, and let's be proactive.
Our coach taught us nutrition and health.
The Special Olympics also provide free health check-ups to athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctors or who have difficulty getting health attention.
At the Special Olympic Summer Games in 2015, my Canadian team and I fought against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the game, the Nigerian basketball team took a health check on the Games, and seven of the 10 members got a free hearing aid, and for the first time in their lives, they heard it better.
It's amazing what's happening to them.
They're more excited, more happy, more confident, because their coach can finally communicate with them in language.
They're very excited because they can hear the sound of basketball, the sound of whistles and the cheers of the fans standing next to us that we think should exist.
Special Olympic Games change athletes not only in their sports.
It also changes the lives of athletes.
This year, research has shown that almost half of all adults in the United States do not know a single person with a mental disability who does not have contact with a person with a mental disability, which is clearly more intolerant and less active.
And the word "dumb" proves that the mentally handicapped are still invisible and feel isolated.
People use that word either to say it or to insult people.
Last year, on Twitter, over 9 million times, it hurt me and the world's 4.5 million athletes.
People don't think it's a curse, but it is.
My athlete companion, a global messenger, Franklin Stephens, wrote a letter to a political critic who used the word "dumb" to insult people: "Look for a day to see the special Olympics.
See if you still have the same mind when you leave."
This year, at the Special Olympics in the summer of 2015, people lined up for hours to watch the last night's heavy lifting.
When my teammate Jackie Barrett came in, people stood up and he was called a Newfoundland moose, he pulled 665 pounds hard, and he hopped up 611 pounds, and passed on many new records for the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record keeper of Newfoundland's heavy lifting, not just the special Olympic Games, but all the heavy lifting players.
Jackie is now a big star in L.A., and ESPN tweets in real time about how he broke the weight count and was shocked by his performance.
Fifty years ago, almost no one could have imagined that a mentally handicapped person could do that.
This year, 60,000 viewers filled up with the famous Los Angeles Memorial Stadium, watching the opening of the competition and celebrating athletes from 165 countries around the world.
We were congratulated and cheered, not hidden.
Special Olympics teach athletes to be more confident and proud of themselves.
The special Olympic Games also teach the world that intellectually handicapped people deserve respect and inclusion.
Now, in my sports career, I have dreams and achievements, good training, respect, better life, and then I'm trying to move on.
I'm not hiding, being bullied.
With a special Olympic Games, the world has changed, but there's still a long way to go.
So next time you see someone with a mental disability, I want you to see their potential.
Next time someone uses the word "dumb" around you, I want you to tell them how much it hurts.
I hope you want to see a special Olympic Games.
I'll share one last thought with you.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sport has the power to change the world."
The special Olympic Games are changing the world, changing 4.5 million athletes, giving us a place to be confident, to meet friends, to be free of discrimination, to be a champion.
Thank you!
You probably never heard of Kenema in Sierra Leone, or Arua in Nigeria.
But I think they're the best two places in the world.
At the hospital, there was a community of nurses, surgeons and scientists who had been fighting one of the most deadly threats to humanity for years -- the Lhasa virus.
Lhasa is very much like Ebola.
It can cause severe heat symptoms, and it's often fatal.
But these people risk their lives every day to protect every member of the community, and at the same time to protect us all.
And the best thing I've learned from them is that when I first visited many years ago, those days of challenge, of fighting on the front line, they started every morning -- singing.
They come together, show their joy.
They show a spirit.
Many years have passed, and when we visit each other year after year, I can sing with them, and we'll record this, and we love it, because it reminds us that we are not just going to look for scientific truth together, but that there is a human bond that binds us.
And you can imagine that when things change around you, this connection becomes extremely important, even indispensable.
In March 2014, major changes occurred. The Ebola outbreak in Guinea.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa, at the border between Sierra Leone and Libya.
The situation is terrible, and we are all shocked.
In fact, we even suspected that Lasa and Ebola were spreading more widely than we thought, and we feared that one day it would spread to Kenema.
So my team members immediately set out to get there and join Dr. Humer Khan and his team, and we set up diagnostic equipment to do some sensitive molecular testing, and when the Ebola virus crossed the Sierra Leone border, we could detect it.
We've already set up equipment on this scale for the Lhasa virus, and we know how to deal with it, and this team is excellent.
We just need to give them equipment and space, and let them study Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day has come.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was placed in a maternity ward in a hospital, and our team conducted those important molecular tests and confirmed the first Ebola case in Sierra Leone.
It's really amazing.
They can diagnose the disease at first, they can treat the patient safely, and they can start tracking the contacts, following the spread of the disease.
It could have stopped something.
But when that day came, the outbreak had been brewing for months.
After hundreds of cases were discovered, it overshadowed all previous outbreaks.
And the virus wasn't driven into Sierra Leone by that single case, it was a huge shock.
We need to work closely with the international community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to deal with these cases. And the next week, there were 31 patients, and then 92, and then 147 -- all of them in Kenema, because this is one of the few places in Sierra Leone that can cope with the epidemic.
We're working day and night, trying to help every patient, trying to get your attention, but we're doing another simple thing.
To detect the Ebola virus, we took samples from the patient's blood, and of course we could just throw them away.
But in fact, the other thing we can do is add chemicals to the sample and make it fail, and then seal it in the box and transport it across the ocean. And that's what we do.
We sent samples to Boston, where my team worked.
We worked in shifts all day and night, so we quickly sorted out 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
This is a blueprint -- the genome of the virus is a blueprint.
We humans too.
It details everything that makes up our body and tells us a lot of information.
The results of these efforts are simple, but powerful.
We can take these 99 different mutations of the virus, see and compare them, and we can see clearly that, compared to the three genomes released by the Guineans, we can see that the disease began to spread in Guinea a few months ago, and that once it got into the crowd, it was transmitted through human contact.
This information is really important, especially when you're looking at ways to impede the spread of the virus. But the most important thing is contact tracking.
And we can also see that when the virus spreads between people, it also changes.
Every mutation is so important, because all the diagnostics, vaccines, and the treatment we use are basically based on that particular genome sequence, which is what causes the epidemic.
So global health experts have to respond quickly, to improve research methods, to adjust everything they do.
But as far as I'm concerned, the way that scientific research is done is that I get the data, and I'm probably going to be locked in the lab for months, and I'm going to be careful with the data, and I'm going to write the papers, and I'm going to change them, and I'm going to make them public.
That was the state of scientific research.
Well, at that particular time, it certainly didn't work, did it?
Some of our friends work on the front line, and obviously what we need most is outside help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we did, the genetic sequence came out of the machine, and we immediately posted the data online.
We opened it to the world, and we said, "Help us!"
So help follow.
We haven't been able to react yet, and there's a large group of people around the world who have volunteered to contact us, and they're surprised to see these data online.
Some of the world's finest virus trackers suddenly became part of our team!
And we work together in this virtual way, and we share information, we talk to each other on the phone, we keep in touch, and we want to be able to track the spread of the virus in seconds and find ways to contain it.
There are many ways we can form such a group.
Everyone, especially when an outbreak occurs around the world, is getting information, is getting involved, is getting involved.
Everyone wants to make a contribution.
The power of everyone in the world is truly amazing, and the Internet connects us.
Can you imagine? We are no longer afraid to communicate with others, and all of us say, "Let's get to work.
Let's work together. We can do it."
But the problem is, the data that we all use, the data that we find on Google, is far from meeting the demands of our work.
And when that happens, we miss a lot of opportunities.
So in the early days of the Kenema outbreak, we had 106 clinical records of patients, and we made them public again.
In our own lab, you get us the 106 records, and we get computers to predict the next Ebola patient, and it's almost 100 percent accurate.
We also made an application to publish these predictions, so that people around the world who work in the field of health have access to them.
But 106 reports are far from enough to make this method work.
So we're waiting for more clinical reports to release the software.
These reports have not come.
We're still waiting, and we're fixing the software, hiding in the lab, not working with you.
This is really... we totally cannot accept it.
Right? You, all of you, cannot accept it.
Now is the time to die.
But in fact, a lot of people have died, a lot of people in the field of health care, including my dear colleagues, five of them: Mbarru vonnie, Alex Muby, Dr. Humer Khan, Alice Kowalma, and Mohammed Fuller.
It's just five of the millions of health workers who died in Kenema, and the world's been waiting, and we've been working, and people are independent and uncommunicated.
The Ebola virus, like any other threat to humanity, is exacerbated by mistrust, fragmentation and separation between people.
When we build barriers to each other and fight against each other, the air of the virus becomes even more aggressive.
But Ebola isn't like any other threat, because this time we became a family.
We are all on the same front.
A man with Ebola, we might be next.
So we live in the world with common weaknesses, common strengths, shared fears, shared hopes, and I sincerely hope that we can work together with joy.
And one of my graduate students read a book about Sierra Leone, and she found the word "Kenema," and when we were working in Sierra Leone, the name of the city, the hospital, in the local doorword, it said, "True as a river, clear as a river, and all eyes reach."
And it's very far-reaching for us, and we don't realize ourselves, but we've always felt that in order to pay tribute to Kenema, where we fought, we must open up our cooperation, we must share information, we must work together.
We have to do this.
All of us should ask ourselves and others in this way -- when disaster breaks out, we should all open up to each other and fight together.
Because it's not the first outbreak of the Ebola outbreak, and it's not the last, and there's a lot of other microbes in the world that have been lurking around us, like the Lhasa virus and other creatures.
The next time a disaster happens, it could happen in a million-person city, it could happen there.
The virus could be transmitted through air.
The virus could even be deliberately spread out.
I know it's scary, and I understand it, but I also know that this experience tells us that we have the technology and the ability to win this war, not only to win this war, but also to be able to do anything about all the viruses.
But we can do this only if we work together, and we have to be happy.
So for Dr. Khan, and all those who died on the front lines of the disease, who fought with us forever, let's fight with them forever.
Our world should not be defined by the devastation caused by a virus, and we must spread the light of solidarity and cooperation among billions of hearts.
Thank you.
