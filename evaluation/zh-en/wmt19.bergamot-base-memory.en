According to British media, Admiral William Moran, Undersecretary of Naval Operations, said that even as the U.S. Navy is reviving its forces to deal with an increasingly worrisome Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States continues to focus its naval priorities in the Asia-Pacific region, which the Pentagon has expanded to include the Indo-Asia-Pacific.
According to the British "Jane's Defense Weekly" website reported on September 24, the United States announced at the beginning of the new national defense strategy in the China and Russia as a strategic competitor.
Since then, the U.S. Navy has restored the Second Fleet to more directly counter Russian activities.
The moves have raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts that the U.S. Navy may stay away from the “Asia-Pacific rebalancing” strategy that marks the Obama administration.
But General Moran said the U.S. Navy remains focused on the Western Pacific.
“There have been no significant changes for us,” he said at a roundtable discussion titled “Responding to the High Seas Challenge,” hosted by the National Bureau of Asian Studies in Washington, D.C., on January 24, 2018.
“The point is still to rebalance, shift your focus, or describe it no matter what you want to describe it,” Moran said.
But he acknowledged that the United States has close ties to Europe.
“We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do,” he said.
While Moran noted that overall policy on Russia falls within the purview of the U.S. defense secretary, he warned: “Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history proves that if we clash with them, they will be very tough.”
As part of the U.S. resurgent operation against Russia, China and other competitors, the U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying troops into a "new mode of operation," General Moran said, which will help put adversaries off guard by the deployment of U.S. carrier strike groups or other assets at any given time and place.
“We in the Navy and Marine Corps support it—the concept of operational unpredictability, not to be in the same place again and again, almost like a clockwork—is what we do,” he said.
The first to attempt the new approach was the Harry Truman carrier strike group, whose early deployment included working visits to the port and patrolling the normally only passing areas.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is working to ensure that allies are aware that the ships will still patrol traditional areas and are also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment process.
The Royal Australian Navy’s commander, Lieutenant General Michael Noonan, also spoke at the event, saying the Australian military could work seamlessly with the U.S. carrier strike group.
He said that this will continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase nine more frigates equipped with the Aegis combat system.

Japan's Ito Tcho Corporation on Friday identified $1.3 billion in impairment losses on its CITIC shares in China's investment, a write-down on its biggest corporate investment deal due to trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, a man walked past the headquarters of Maru Red Co., Ltd. in Tokyo, Japan.
Maru Hong said that the trade war hit its U.S. grain department Gao Hong, which has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Some heavy equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies and so on in Japan have warned about the impact of Sino-US trade frictions when they announce their latest results, and now these Japanese trading agencies have joined the ranks.
The United States and China impose tariffs on each other's hundreds of billions of dollars of goods, and U.S. President Trump has threatened to expand the tax to all more than $500 billion of Chinese exports to the United States if the dispute cannot be resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, chief commercial finance officer of Itochush, said the impact of the trade dispute on the Chinese economy could be even greater next year.
Ito and Thai Bee Group invested $10 billion in CITIC in 2015 to acquire a 20% stake in it.
Hachimura said that Ito Tucho lost 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) to this shareholding because it believed that CITIC's stock price would not recover in the near future.
Ito Tchō Corporation maintained its profit forecast for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 at 500 billion yen.
China imposed a 25 percent import tariff on U.S. soybeans in July to counter Washington’s move in the trade war.
"Our grain business has been hit by the U.S.-China trade friction," said Yan Hong, Maruhong's chief financial officer.
He said Gao Hong had stopped financial transactions on his account since September.
Gao Hong spokesman Pat Burke said in a statement on Friday that the company's move was "in accordance with internal policy restrictions and due to the lack of market opportunities."
He also said the suspension of financial transactions would not lead to job losses.
Marue Red maintained its annual profit forecast of 230 billion yen unchanged, which was helped by pulp and paper and power generation businesses.
Sumitomo Corporation reported a 16% profit increase between April and September on Thursday, stressing that "the outlook for U.S.-China trade issues is uncertain."
Mitsubishi Corporation on Friday raised its annual profit forecast to record levels, citing higher coking coal production and higher commodity prices such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Corporation also announced a new business plan, aiming to increase its profit in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, from an estimated 64 billion yen this year to 900 billion yen ($7.98 billion).
Comprehensive report on November 5th, the US mid-term election vote has entered the countdown.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic opponents actively "ticked the vote" to their core voters.
Both parties point out that voter turnout will be the key to left and right.
According to reports, 48 hours before the US people voted, Trump was busy attending the Republican candidate's campaign, and former President Obama went to Indiana to stand for Joe Donnelly, the Democratic Senate candidate who was in a hurry, and shouted to the masses for the final appeal before the election.
On November 4, Trump went to Maygang, Georgia, to stand for Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, who said, "You have to go to the voting place on Tuesday, you have to vote."
“The contrast between this election may not be clearer.”
The political enthusiasm of voters has risen to a rare peak, and early voting in some states has gone far beyond usual.
As successive U.S. presidents face their first mid-term elections, his party tends to have fewer members of Congress.
According to a new poll released by The Washington Post and ABC News on the 4th, although the Democratic House of Representatives election still maintains an advantage, Republicans can benefit from the economic assessment and Trump's strict focus on border security.
Polls show that registered voters prefer Democratic House candidates more than Republicans, at 50 percent to 43%, but still fall from a 14-percentage-point lead in August.
Another poll by the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) and the Wall Street Journal also showed that Democrats still lead Republicans by seven percentage points.
It is reported that Obama told the crowd on the occasion of Senator Donnolly's campaign: "When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, there will be evil consequences.
Democracy cannot work when people lie to themselves.”
"The only way to stop these Republicans' behavior now is you and your vote."
Democrats face the most difficult election in the Senate in decades, with Republicans now holding more than half of the 51 seats.
But the House of Representatives election is more favorable, and Democrats need to win another 23 seats to control the 435-seat House.
Analysts at FiveThirtyEight.com estimated that Democrats were 85 percent likely to win the House.

People's Daily Beijing, November 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) under the current wave of "mass entrepreneurship, innovation", more and more technology companies began to attach importance to patent research and development and related protection work, digging deep into the potential value of patents, occupy the market dominance.
Similarly, many technology companies have encountered a lot of infringement in the licensing of patented technologies and the use of patented technologies.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province sued the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court of Beijing Xiaoqing Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Xiao orange technology), the operator of Didi Travel Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Travel) and the seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) on the grounds of patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs requested the court's order that the three defendants immediately stop manufacturing, selling, promising sales, and using the plaintiff's patent behavior.
On October 30, 2018, China Judgment Documents Network announced the "Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoqing Technology Co., Ltd. and other infringement patent rights dispute first instance civil ruling", disclosed the details of some cases of Didi Travel APP being sued for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs believe that the patentee and the inventor of the patent based on the mobile terminal's ride-sharing service system and methods, and the entire operation process of the "windmill" application in the "Didi Travel" APP corresponds to the technical solution of patent protection involved, which constitutes patent infringement.
However, during the court ruling, Xiaoqing Technology believes that Guangdong Pacific is not a qualified defendant, which only provides a free download of the APP "Didi Travel" involved on the network, does not implement the patented method involved, does not directly or indirectly infringe, and should not be listed as a defendant in this case.
Second, the infringement in this case is not in Guangdong.
According to the law, the infringement of the patent involved should be the place where the patent method involved is fully implemented, so it raised objections to the jurisdiction of the court and asked to transfer the case to the court of the defendant's domicile, that is, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the accused of infringement of the drip travel APP products on its online platform, and the plaintiff listed the defendant Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
And the defendant Guangdong Pacific residence in Guangzhou, belongs to the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant Xiaoqing Technology advocated that the case be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial, and on the basis of insufficientness, the defendant Xiaoqing Technology Co., Ltd. rejected the objection to the jurisdiction of the case, and bear the cost of accepting the jurisdictional objection case.
At present, the other trials of the case have not yet been announced, and the reporter will pay close attention to the follow-up details of the Didi Travel patent infringement case.
Interview with the CEO of the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization: the results of the Australia-China scientific and technological cooperation are remarkable
"China's science and technology has developed rapidly in the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve fruitful results together in the field of science."
Larry Marshall, chief executive of the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, said in an interview with China News Agency in Beijing that from the cooperation of climate change to the "eye of the sky" project, the cooperation between Australia and China in the field of science and technology has shown vitality.
As the largest national scientific research institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many innovative research results in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials, and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
“It’s an enduring friendship that embraces a tradition of trust and long-term cooperation with partners,” Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-meter diameter spherical radio telescope, "China's Eye", installed the world's first 19-beam L-band receiver.
At present, the most advanced 19-beam feeder in the world is jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on the CSIRO's many years of technology accumulation, after the opening, the FAST survey speed will be increased by 5 to 6 times, at the same time, will also expand more scientific observation targets.
"This is a contribution of CSIRO to FAST."
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO also cooperates closely with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of square kilometers of array radio telescopes, the development of new fuel technologies, and energy conservation and emission reduction.
"In the past, scientific research often focused on the problems of hundreds of years later, and now more scientific research is needed to solve the problems in front of us."
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and both countries face a series of challenges in development.
For example, extreme weather is frequent around the world, droughts and floods have led to food production, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, population explosion, aging, chronic diseases and other issues are also serious challenges currently facing.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years is mainly aimed at solving these current problems."
According to Marshall, the International Marine Research Center for the Southern Hemisphere, jointly built by CSIRO and the Qingdao National Laboratory of Marine Science and Technology, focuses on observing the El Niño phenomenon and the La Niña phenomenon, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather, and establishing an early warning facility for extreme weather; the new grain varieties jointly developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to overcome extreme weather can also alleviate the food shortage caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, scientific and technological innovation is difficult to complete alone, the need for extremely high costs, to solve a lot of problems, so cooperation is particularly important today."
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it is that it will make a breakthrough, which is also the significance of strengthening cooperation between Australia and China under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative.
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly for us scientific and technological cooperation."
Marshall said, for example, CSIRO recently developed a non-cyanide gold purification method, because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a small amount of environmental pollution of gold purification method.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology to China, which is one of the achievements of our participation in the Belt and Road cooperation."

North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening North Korea's distrust of the United States, and that it was impossible for North Korea to unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Mr. Ri said at the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea had taken a “very friendly approach” over the past year, including halting missile and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we haven't seen any corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.
"If we don't trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation, we can't unilaterally give up weapons first."
While Mr. Ri repeated North Korea’s complaint that the United States opposes “phased” denuclearization, his speech was of great significance because it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea had previously done.
Mr. Li referred to a joint statement by Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump on June 12, when Mr. Kim agreed to work toward “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump’s pledge to protect North Korea’s security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says it must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also refused to ease demands for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insisted on 'denuclearization first', and increased the pressure on sanctions, achieved its goal in a high-pressure manner, and even refused to issue a 'war-ending declaration'," Li said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us kneel for forgiveness is that people who don’t understand us are daydreaming.
But the problem is that this continued sanctions are deepening our distrust.”
Mr. Li made no mention of the second-time Trump plan mentioned by the U.S. president at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months, saying: “If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea, not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so deadlocked.”
China announced that it would reduce import tariffs on 1,585 tax items from November 1, 2018.
Since the beginning of this year, China has taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1 this year, the comprehensive tax reduction of drugs will include all general drugs for anti-cancer drugs and alkaloids with anti-cancer effects, and the import tariffs on Chinese medicine that have actual imports are zero.
At the same time, it has also greatly reduced the value-added tax burden of anti-cancer drug production and import links.
On July 1, tax was reduced on 218 tax items for cars and parts.
After the tax reduction, China's automobile tax rate has been lower than the average of developing countries, in line with the actual situation of China's automobile industry.
This tax reduction will promote the adjustment of the industry structure and the optimization of resource allocation, accelerate the survival of the fittest, help improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to promote the adjustment of automobile prices to a certain extent, so that consumers can get more benefits.
Taxes on daily consumer goods for 1,449 tax items on July 1.
Tax reduction of daily consumer goods is closely related to the people's needs for a better life.
The tax reduction is not only a large number but also a strong one, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
Tax reduction of daily consumer goods directly benefits the majority of consumers and promotes the improvement of domestic industry competitiveness.
On November 1, tax reduction will be implemented for industrial products such as mechanical and electrical equipment, parts and raw materials for 1,585 tax items.
Appropriately reducing the import tariffs on some domestic urgently needed industrial products can attract more foreign investment, which is conducive to increasing effective domestic supply and helping industrial upgrading, while helping enterprises to allocate resources on a global scale, reduce production costs, and also help reduce the pressure on the domestic environment.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Office of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council of China, the above four independent tax reductions, and the third step of the implementation of the implementation of the results of the negotiations on the expansion of the scope of the information technology agreement on July 1 this year, will reduce the total tariff level of China from 9.8% in the previous year to 7.5%.
The overall adjusted tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than most developing countries, and is at a moderately low level, which basically matches the status and development stage of developing countries with China.
The person in charge introduced that the overall level of tariffs, as one of the important indicators of the opening up of China's goods trade field, should be adapted to the stage of China's economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China's trade in goods, the world's first, has a further opening-up economic foundation, but the quality and efficiency of trade development and developed economies are still different, so the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately reduced.
Tariffs are a means of protection for compliance, and the tariff level should be compatible with industrial competitiveness, and healthy competition should be encouraged, and excessive protection is not conducive to industrial development and improved quality.
The adjustment of tariff rates should take into account production needs and consumer demand.
Focus on reducing the commodity tax rate of large domestic demand, which will help the industrial transformation and upgrading, and strive to increase the import of special advantages products with concentrated needs of the people, and continuously enhance the sense of acquisition of enterprises and the public, and meet the needs of upgrading the industrial structure and consumption structure.
Tax reduction efforts should take into account the affordability of fiscal revenue and industrial development.
In the choice of specific tax reduction commodities and tax reduction, it is necessary to coordinate the relationship between the two markets at home and abroad, the upstream and downstream two aspects, and the two production and consumption, and maintain the momentum of China's steady and good development.
The person in charge stressed that this year is the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening up, and China's initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure based on China's own needs to achieve high-quality development, which is conducive to the overall utilization of international and foreign resources, promote the quality improvement of the domestic supply system, and meet the needs of the people's consumption and upgrading.
This action and measure show that China will unswervingly pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win results, firmly support economic globalization, resolutely safeguard the principle of free trade and the multilateral trading system with the WTO as the core, continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the world, and let China's development better benefit the world.
Serbia announces highest level of readiness, President of Serbia and Russia to meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
The Nanhua news agency quoted the Serbian presidential office as saying that in view of the occupation by Kosovo special forces of the Gazivoda Hydropower Station, controlled by the Belgrade side in the north of Kosovo, Serbian President Vucic ordered the country's armed forces to enter the highest state of combat readiness.
On 29 September, the Serbian Minister of Defense, Vulin, declared that the Serbian army had entered a state of full combat readiness.
Wu Lin stressed that as long as the order issued by Vucic is still valid, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo, and the Serbian army will respond regardless of the direction in which the situation is going.
According to Russia's TASS news agency, on September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he had briefed the United States, Russia and Europe and other parties on the current situation, and will go to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
Asked if Serbia needed Russian military support like Syria, Vučić replied in the negative: "I don't want a major military conflict on our territory."
Vucic also said that the entry of the Serbian army into a full-scale combat readiness was only intended to form a deterrent to prevent the conflict from occurring, but it was also a clear warning that no violence in Kosovo would be tolerated.
The increase in the combat readiness of the SA military is related to two major actions on the side of Kosovo.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, Albanians are massing arrests of ethnic Serbs living in the area in northern Kosovo, and these arrested Serbs have not violated any law.
Vucic said that since March 26 this year, the head of the Serbian government office in Kosovo and Metohija, Makko Yulic, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo Albanian army, the Albanians have escalated the situation in the region and carried out inhumane arrests and evictions of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the ROSU Special Forces, armed police and snipers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, which recently announced their own establishment, occupied positions near the Lake Storage Lake of the Gazivoda Hydropower Station, entered the ecological and sports centers near the dyke in the northern part of the Kosovo region, and blocked all nearby roads, which were originally controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucic pointed out that this military adventure in Kosovo was made at the instigation of Western countries, and the Kosovo army's action did not inform the Serbian side in advance, in violation of Chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, and also in violation of UN Security Council resolution 1244 and the military technical agreement between Seko.
Vucic has spoken to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, criticizing Western hypocrisy over Kosovo.
The root cause of the current conflict is still the centuries-old feud between the Serbs and the Serbs in the Kosovo region.
With regard to the ownership of Kosovo, Serbs and Albanians have their own statements.
Serbia saw Kosovo as the birthplace of the nation and the cradle of culture, as Serbia established its strongest state here in the 12th century, and the Albanians only moved in large numbers after the Ottoman invasion and the defeat of the Serbian army in the north.
The Albanians insisted that the original tribe of the Illyrians, which lived in Kosovo in the 4-5th century BC, were the ancestors of the Albanians, and therefore Kosovo has been the territory of the Albanians since ancient times.
The subjective political division has led to intense conflict between different ethnic, religious and cultural communities, resulting in intense confrontation between Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, the Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, the proportion of Serbs rose relatively, in the view of the Serbs "only to take back their own land" approach, but by the Albanians as "Greater Serbism" plunder, the two-ethnic contradictions intensified.
Kosovo became the “powder keg” of the Balkans.
In 1999, armed clashes between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, formed by Serbia and Montenegro, and the outbreak of the Kosovo War.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Although there has been news that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, due to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints, an agreement that is subject to multiple forces such as the United States, Europe and Russia has not been able to sign.
Just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that it advocated the isolation of Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo and once again publicized the contradiction between the two communities.
Electricity communication is still interrupted, Indonesia's strong earthquake and tsunami relief is difficult
According to the figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency on the morning of the 30th, the strong earthquake and tsunami caused by the strong earthquake and tsunami in Donggaara County, Central Sulawesi Province, in the country on the 28th, have killed 420 people.
The head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, Wilem Rampangilei, said that the figure is only preliminary statistics of the city of Palu, a province of Central Sulawesi province about 80 kilometers from the epicenter, because of the lack of large-scale search and rescue machinery, many of the city's hotels, shopping malls, warehouses and other densely populated buildings damaged by the earthquake have not yet been searched and rescued.
On September 29, 2018, local time, a bridge damaged by the earthquake and tsunami collapsed in Balu, Indonesia.
Due to the severe damage to electricity and communication facilities, the epicenter of Donggala County and the neighboring Siji area are still unconnected "islands", and the number of victims cannot be counted.
According to media reports, Indonesian Vice President Kara said the death toll could reach thousands.
Electricity outages, communications disruptions, road blockings, damage to airports... the rescue efforts after the earthquake and tsunami were difficult.
Due to power outages, some hospitals and rescue settlements in the city of Palu need to rely on fuel for power generation.
The roads in and out of the city were blocked by landslides, and large transport vehicles, including tanker trucks, were unable to enter, making fuel supplies very tight.
Indonesian Social Minister Agus said that due to road damage, the Ministry has not yet arrived in the disaster area from the tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food and household goods bags transferred from the neighboring South Sulawesi and Corentalo provinces.
Disaster relief material transferred from the capital Jakarta is being transported to the disaster area by air transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to the tower and runway of the Palu airport in the earthquake, in order to ensure safety and rescue, all commercial flights have been suspended, and only military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel have taken off and landed.
Indonesia's Minister of Political, Legal and Security Affairs, who commanded the rescue in the earthquake zone, called for the restoration of power supply and commercial flight services at the airport as soon as possible to ensure the operation of rescue agencies such as hospitals, so that more rescue workers, volunteers and aid materials can arrive in the disaster area.

China News Agency, Beijing, October 1 (Reporter Yin Li) like washing, clear sky, color sky full of sky... Recently, Beijing continued to open the most beautiful blue sky mode, attracting thousands of Beijing people on the social platform fancy show, in the continuous brush screen in the sun happiness, said "blue sky and white clouds, 'drunk' skyline, this is the best business card in Beijing."
Since August, Beijing has ushered in the "bluest sky".

Why do people in Chicago love the blue sky?
Just because the people who lived in this city in the past suffered from the smog, so they were particularly eager for the blue sky, and in Beijing launched the "blue sky defense war", after the continuous improvement of air quality, the haze became less, the blue sky increased, the people looked at the eyes happy, the happiness obtained was also particularly heavy.

The spontaneous "bluest sky" theme photo contest on the social platform by the public is still ongoing.
Why is the sky in Beijing so blue?
According to the relevant person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, in August this year, the average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 micrograms per cubic meter, setting the best record in the same period in the history of nearly five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 in September is more frequent in single digits.
One of the major factors in the emergence of the "bluest sky" is that the meteorological conditions are generally favorable in recent times, and more importantly, Beijing has persistently carried out air pollution control, vigorously promoted the clean air action plan in the past five years, and the continuous release of environmental benefits has reduced the total amount of pollutants in the region, which has laid the foundation for the continuous improvement of air quality.
Beijing officially released and implemented the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 in 2013.
According to the plan, the official continued to guide the non-capital functional dredging, promote energy clean alternative and pollution reduction work, a total of 4,923 coal-fired boilers eliminated.
Beijing has thus become the first major city in mainland China to achieve full-network natural gasization.
Data show that between 2013 and 2017, the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased by 35.6%; the number of days the air quality reached the standard increased by 50 days; the number of first-class best days increased by 25 days; the number of heavy pollution days was reduced by 35 days, and the incidence of heavy pollution was significantly reduced.
At the same time, Beijing officials according to a new round of PM2.5 source analysis, in September this year released the "Beijing to win the blue sky defense war three-year action plan", for the current stage of governance and pollution characteristics, focusing on diesel trucks, dust, volatile organic compounds control and other key prevention and control areas, optimize the adjustment of transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land structure, strengthen regional joint prevention and control, focus on strengthening the city's fine management, comprehensively promote green development, and strive to make the "bluest sky" resident in Beijing.

In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission accepted 1612 complaints of "day trip" and 897 cases, a decrease of 79% and 44% year-on-year respectively, but the illegal "day trip" is still incessant, often rebound, and formed a black ticket, black guide, black society, black car, black shop, black net and other interest chains intertwined "six black" chaos.
Specifically, the street illegal soliciting personnel is "black ticket", the illegal website that publishes false travel information is "black net", the travel agency or the agency or individual who engages in illegal "day tour" or no travel agency business qualification is "black society", the "black club" hires a tour guide without a tour license or a guide who is illegal, that is, a "black guide", which uses a vehicle without tourist passenger transport qualification or a tourist passenger service that provides passenger transportation service for illegal "day tour".

Relevant departments use road traffic monitoring probes to increase the supervision of key "day tour" route tourism bus, with technical defense, physical defense and other scientific and technological intelligence means can be found in time to investigate and deal with the "black car".
Travel shopping "black shop" due to the small number of sitting operations, has also become a focus.
In order to strengthen the deterrence and crackdown on illegal "day tours", all functional departments will be severely and severely punished according to law when they verify illegal and illegal violations in special actions.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on the relevant legal issues of severely combating illegal "day trip", and discussed the means and measures combining administrative punishment and conviction.
The Municipal Tourism Commission said that in the future, it will encourage more regular travel agencies to carry out Beijing's "day tour" and increase the supply of regular "day tours" to further squeeze the living space of illegal "day trips", and the specific plan is still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has also continuously improved the electronic itinerary single information system of tour groups to ensure that each team is included in the supervision of the electronic itinerary platform.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economy symbol, what has Wuzhen experienced in these years?
As the permanent site of the World Internet Conference, how Wuzhen can undertake the summit dividend has attracted much attention.
Since the first World Internet Conference, in the past five years, the changes in Wuzhen have been obvious to all.
In 2014, there were only 12 enterprises related to the digital economy and the Internet in the whole town, and by the third quarter of this year, there were more than 500.
This is a microcosm of the development of the digital economy in Wuzhen.
The convening of the Internet Conference allows local enterprises to accept the enlightenment of the digital economy and the wave of digitalization from a distance, and the desire for enterprise transformation and upgrading is very strong, and traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased investment and research and development in terms of machine substitution and intelligent management.
Jiang Wei, secretary of the party committee of Wuzhen Town, said that Wuzhen will build a new economic empowerment center in the future.
The development of the digital economy cannot be separated from the support of infrastructure.
This year, Wuzhen launched the 5G pilot work on the basis of achieving full coverage of 4G communication network and free WiFi.
At the same time, Tongxiang City, where Wuzhen is located, has become the hot spot for the development of the Internet industry as the first county-level city to build a dedicated channel for international Internet data.
Since the first World Internet Conference, Tongxiang has introduced a total of 565 digital economy projects, with a total planned investment of 37.725 billion yuan, and the core manufacturing industry of the digital economy in the first three quarters of this year achieved a total output value of 8.73 billion yuan, an increase of 13% year-on-year.
"Before Wuzhen was a tourist symbol, and later there were more drama and cultural symbols. Because of the Internet Conference, it has now become a symbol of the Internet and the digital economy."
Tongxiang Municipal Party Secretary Sheng Yongjun believes that the dividends of the World Internet Conference have accumulated over time, so it is also necessary to build a platform to undertake the superposition of talents, projects, technologies and other factors.
Tongxiang people Shen Yi worked abroad for 20 years, because of the Internet conference, returned home to start a business.
On December 2 last year, he walked into the 4th Internet Light Expo with high-capacity anti-tamper digital technology solutions and was favored by many customers.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in Wuzhen not only because of the hometown complex, "in Wuzhen, it is easier to recruit people than I thought, our application is also very fast, Wuzhen smart parking project has our application."
A Wuzhen Avenue presents the spillover effect of the Internet Conference.
This road through the north and south of Tongxiang, not only strung up the tourist attractions, but also an industrial road.
With it as its basis, Wuzhen Avenue Kechuang Gathering Area came into being.

Active treatment, China's 29-week and above preterm survival rate of 98%, has reached the level of developed countries.
SHANOI, Sept. 30 (Xinhua) -- The National Children's Medical Center and Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital disclosed on the 30th that they introduced advanced methods in Canada in the leading "China NICU Inpatient Premature Premature Preterm Quality Improvement Project".
The results of the project show that after active treatment, the survival rate of premature infants in China at 29 weeks and above has reached 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in the non-complication survival rate of premature infants and premature babies in very small gestation age.
For nearly 20 years, the Chinese government has been concerned about the treatment of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71 ‰, which is significantly lower than the national average and has reached the advanced level of developed countries.
The "China NICU Hospital Premature Premature Preterm Premature Quality Improvement Project" has greatly improved the quality of premature baby through four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature babies, he is concerned about reducing the survival quality of premature babies, reducing the incidence of complications, improving neurodevelopmental prognosis, improving the overall outcome of children, which is of great significance to improving the overall survival quality of premature infants and the quality of the population, which is an important issue of concern to the paediatric community and the neonatal community at home and abroad.
"China NICU hospital preterm baby prognosis quality improvement project" through 4 years of unremitting efforts, including tens of thousands of preterm infants with a gestational age of 33 weeks and below, so that the domestic small gestational age and small birth weight premature birth mortality decreased by 1/3, while the incidence of serious complications of preterm infants significantly decreased, greatly improving the quality of premature baby.
Through the establishment of a national newborn quality improvement cooperation network and the introduction of the concept of collaborative quality improvement, the project has radiated 25 collaborative hospitals across China to establish a set of collaborative measures to improve the prognosis of premature infants and improve the level of newborn treatment, system and effective collaborative quality improvement methods.
Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital is working with the National Neonatology Force to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of newborn infections according to the accumulated experience of the project, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of newborn infections in China.
It is understood that in the "China Premature Preterm Pregnition Quality Improvement Project", the pediatric hospital introduced the EPIQ method into 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces across the country, working to solve the problem of preterm infection in the neonatal monitoring room in China.
After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, Canada's national premature uncomplication survival rate increased by about one-third, Canada has now ranked among the world's best preterm infants.
The EPIQ method is now available to all NICUs in Canada and has been used in six countries.
The results showed a 35% decline in preterm infections and a 20 percent drop in antibiotic use two years after the EPIQ intervention, according to the pediatric hospital.
In the future, the affiliated pediatric hospital of Fudan University will continue to promote and implement this method nationwide, focusing on comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications of premature babies and improving the quality of treatment of newborns nationwide.
At present, there are differences and inequities in the level of treatment in various regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important construction unit of the National Children's Medical Center, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role in radiation, and this study covers many western provinces such as Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu, and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of newborn treatment nationwide.
It is understood that the affiliated pediatric hospital of Fudan University is combining with the national neonatology department force to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of newborn infections according to the accumulated experience of the project, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of newborn infection in China.
According to reports, in 2019, the coordination center, located in the China Newborn Collaboration Network of Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital, will jointly carry out the next stage of national quality improvement in 63 hospitals across the country, with a view to promoting the development of the level of newborn treatment in China.
Wu Xianlei, director of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Planning Commission, said that Shanghai can become the center of Asia, not only reflected in the research, the construction of the entire service system, but also the quality of service and service results should have a place in Asia, so as to truly reflect China's medical level.
Xin Zhiping: Building the "Hero Monument" in his heart - written on the fifth Martyrs' Day.
On September 30, on the eve of the 69th birthday of the Republic, we ushered in the fifth Martyrs' Day, and Xi Jinping and other party and state leaders came to Tiananmen Square to attend the ceremony of presenting flower baskets to the people's heroes.
At this moment, wherever you are, please pay tribute to the hero.
Remembrance is a re-enactment, but also a wake-up call.
Open the heavy history, behind the name of each martyr, is a living life.
They also have fiery youth, sincere love, and family care.
However, because they believe that "the doctrine of our faith is the truth of the universe", they are willing to sacrifice everything they have for "absolved the next generation of suffering."
"I will cry out for China one day to survive."
Through time and space, the heroes set up spiritual signs to guide the direction of the way forward.
"Where to come from, where to go" "what kind of person", read Ying Li, it is not difficult to come up with the answer.
The most important thing is to build a "hero monument" in your heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary war, about 20 million martyrs have died bravely for national independence, people's liberation, and national prosperity.
For various reasons, many of the martyrs did not even leave their names.
Countless heroes water their ideals with blood, practice their faith with their lives, remember their British name, and inherit their spirit, that is, to protect the roots and soul of the nation.
This "Hero Monument" does not allow any defacement and destruction.
For some time, the undercurrents of historical nihilism and pan-entertainment have surged.
All kinds of distortions of history, derogatory behavior, challenging the conscience of justice, and discouraging value judgments have aroused public anger and vigilance in the whole society.
Heroes cannot be blasphemed, heroes cannot forget.
For the behavior of touching the bottom line, we must not let it go, we must dare to shine the sword and defend the dignity of the glory with the rule of law and justice.
On May 1 this year, the Law on the Protection of Heroes and Martyrs was officially implemented.
From the perspective of judicial practice, the judgment of some cases is very happy, not only effectively maintaining the glorious image of heroism according to law, but also releasing the positive energy of advocating heroes and reverence.
A nation that pursues cannot be without heroes, and an ideal nation cannot be without a pioneer.
Remembering the martyrs and calling for heroes has become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are one million commemorative facilities in the country, and more than 100 million people visit the Martyrs' Cemetery every year.
The human heart is the strongest foundation.
Let the hero, defend the hero, learn the hero, care for the hero into the wind, let the spirit of hero into the national bloodline, one by one "hero monument" will stand between heaven and earth, the depth of the heart.
BRUSSELS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - After Italy scorned the European Union’s demand that a massive budget deficit plan surprise markets, the EU took a non-confrontational stance against Italy on Friday, but the bloc might take a more aggressive stance if it sticks to its too bold goals.
Italy's eurosceptic government's goal is to run a budget deficit of 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) over the next three years, suggesting that debt reduction is still not required to face deficit reduction.
"We have no interest in the crisis between the Commission and Italy," said European Commission executive on economic matters, Moscovisi, on Friday. "He responded cautiously because the EU's recommendations and sanctions may have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will be able to persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy formally submits it to the European Commission in mid-October.
After the government announced its plans, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, while Italian bond yields hit a three-week high.
If the deficit target remains unchanged by the October deadline, the European Commission may veto Italy’s draft budget, something the commission has never done to any country.
European Commission Vice President Don Brovski later told a meeting in the Latvian capital Riga on Friday that Italy's current fiscal plan "seems to be in line with the Stability and Growth Pact," referring to the EU's fiscal rules.
But he did not say how that would trigger a reaction from the EU.
Bidders can submit their applications to participate in the open tender by October 26 this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture listed China as one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
The Russian Agricultural Supervision Agency announced in May that Russian grain exports to China exceeded 1 million tons for the first time in this agricultural year, a record.
The bureau predicts that China may be among the top 10 Russian grain importers.

Experts from the national filmless cotton on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities walked into the test field to listen to the presentation of the representative of the academician team of Yu Shuxun of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Xinzhong network Xinjiang Shaya September 30th (Geng Dandan Wang Xiaojun) is located in Shaya County, Xinjiang filmless cotton planting test base, filmless cotton growth is happy, compared with the next to the membrane cotton "no less", a cluster of snow-white cotton competing "open", hanging branches.
From September 27 to 28, the national filmless cotton on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
The reporter learned at the observation meeting that the filmless cotton technology system with "Chong Cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body has initially achieved the goal of filmless cultivation of cotton fields, reducing the pollution of the ecological environment and raw cotton of the residual film of cotton fields in Xinjiang, and making significant progress in the comprehensive technical research and demonstration of filmless cotton.
Academician Yu Shuxun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, famous cotton genetic breeder, and chief scientist of the cotton system of the national modern agricultural industry technology system, introduced the growth of filmless cotton to Zhou Guomo, party secretary of Zhejiang Agricultural and Forestry University.
"Our research and development of filmless cotton comprehensive technology can fully realize the cultivation of cotton without film, can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution, to achieve green cotton."
Academician Yu Shuxun of the Chinese Academy of Engineering introduced.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton-producing area in China. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the cotton planting area in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of the film to China in 1982, the film cover area of various types of crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million mu, and the annual use of the membrane is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, the coverage rate of cotton film reached 100%, and cotton laminating accounted for about 60% of the amount of film used in Xinjiang.
Membraneless cotton for measurement and production, cotton production can be achieved per mu of 320 kg to 350 kg.
With the increasing amount of land film investment in Xinjiang, the recovery rate of the residual film is low, the amount of residual film in the soil is gradually increased, and a series of problems such as the destruction of the soil structure caused by the residual membrane have seriously affected the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great impact on the quality of cotton fiber.
At present, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, Xinjiang's organic cotton picking area was about 14 million mu.
The crushing film in the cotton harvest process, which is dupled in the raw cotton, is difficult to remove during the processing of raw cotton, and cannot be completely removed during subsequent textile processing, which seriously affects the quality of textile products.
On September 28, the national filmless cotton on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
In order to focus on solving the pollution of cotton field membranes, simplifying cotton planting technology, and improving the efficiency of cotton fields, Yu Shuxun led his team to implement the "Chondom 619" filmless cotton technology planting in 8 years, adding wings to the green development of Xinjiang's agriculture.
Yu Shuxun introduced, through innovative breeding new ideas, cultivate the early, salt-resistant, low-temperature, abundant production of the new line of land cotton "Chongmin 619".
"'Contam 619' in the southern region of Xinjiang filmless cultivation conditions, to achieve membrane-free sowing machinery supporting, sowing depth improvement, no membrane under the conditions of the dripping pipe shallow burial, suitable sowing density screening, reasonable chemical regulation and a series of supporting measures."
At present, Aksu, Kurle, Aral and other places have established filmless cotton demonstration bases, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
The cultivation of cotton without film has achieved abundant production, cost savings, environmental protection, and improved comprehensive benefits.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist of the Third Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through the research and demonstration of filmless cotton cultivation technology in the past six years, the yield of filmless cotton seed cotton can fully achieve a yield of 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, and may even be higher.
"Membrane-free cotton cultivation technology has great prospects."
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, filmless cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is still a certain gap in economic benefits compared to membrane cultivation.
"Cotton purchase price support will be conducive to future promotion."
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and large-scale promotion and application of filmless cotton, make the filmless cotton industry bigger and stronger, and completely solve the problem of soil pollution caused by the membrane.

Wang Yi also stressed once again that China will surely walk out of a development path that is different from that of a traditional power.
This path with Chinese characteristics determines that China will not and cannot repeat the mistakes of national strength, and also determines that China will neither become the United States, will challenge the United States, and will not replace the United States.
In his speech entitled "Opportunity or Challenge, Partner or Opponent", Wang Yi said that the deep-seated crux of the current problems is that some American friends believe that China will also dominate the country and even challenge and replace the leadership of the United States in the world.

Wang Yi pointed out that China is taking a path of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had the gene for external expansion.
It is believed that all countries can live together in harmony and exchange and learn from each other.
Whether in the past, present or future, China will neither copy the foreign model nor ask other countries to copy China’s approach.

However, at present, Ningxia's flights to and from Hong Kong are inconvenient, so that the Hong Kong section of the high-speed rail is open, and Mr. Song found that the first bus can be reached at 7:30 a.m., and the transportation to the Golden Bauhinia Square in the city is just right.
He lamented with reporters: "High-speed rail is too convenient, fast and on time!"
The daily short-distance train of 70 short-distance trains between Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North and Futian and West Kowloon greatly facilitates the arrival of residents in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.
After Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, arrived in Hong Kong, he was preparing to go to the Hong Kong friends who were reuniting the mountain on the top of the Central Hall.
Mr. Liu said: "The National Day mainland and Hong Kong are on holiday, we intend to challenge ourselves to see if we can walk 50 kilometers of Hong Kong Island!"

Mrs. Yang, from Dongguan, came to Hong Kong to participate in the piano competition with her 10-year-old son on the high-speed rail, and she proudly told reporters that her son had been studying the piano for three years, and spent the National Day in this way, which made sense.

The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal will retain U.S. President Donald Trump’s ability to implement a 25 percent tariff threat on imported cars, while essentially exempting passenger cars, pickups and auto parts imported from Canada and Mexico from paying tariffs, according to a trade deal unveiled on Monday.
If Trump imposes so-called “Section 232” tariffs on cars for national security reasons, both Mexico and Canada will have a passenger car quota that is exempt from taxes on 2.6 million vehicles exported to the United States each year.
Under the subsidiary arrangement, pickups produced in both countries will be fully exempted from tariffs.
If Trump imposes auto tariffs, Mexico will get an annual $108 billion exemption from tax quotas for auto parts, and Canada will get a $32.4 billion quota.
Both quotas are well above the current level of production in both countries, providing room for growth for exports.
WASHINGTON/MEXICO, Sept 28 (Reuters) - After days of debate, Mexico said the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and Canada are making concrete efforts to resolve trade policy differences that would make the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expected to remain in the form of a tripartite agreement.
While details are lacking, the apparent progress is enough to prompt the Mexican and U.S. administrations to abruptly halt plans to publish the text of the two-party trade agreement, giving Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government had made new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and that he would continue to push all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said the time to submit the text of the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement to Mexico and U.S. legislation was delayed because Canada and the U.S. government were “very serious” about trying to reach an agreement.
“Within the next 48 hours, we will know whether we will reach a text of a tripartite agreement or whether we will have to publish the text of the two-party agreement,” Guajardo said.
Guajardo said his U.S. and Canadian officials “in particular asked” to delay the release of the text.
A spokesman for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement and the U.S.-Canada consultations.
Officials in the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of the Foreign Minister did not respond to requests for comment on counter-recommended comments.
According to foreign media reports, in a conservation center on the outskirts of Pretoria, South Africa's capital, two young lions play together, it is difficult to see any abnormality, but they are unique.
“This is the first chirop born in artificial insemination – the first pair in the world,” the University of Pretoria announced.
Scientists at the university are working on the reproductive system of the female female lion.
Ganswint, director of the Mammal Institute at the University of Pretoria, said the two cubs born on August 25 are quite healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive trials, his team finally achieved this breakthrough.
“We collected sperm from a healthy lion,” Ganswindt said in an interview with the media.
Next, the researchers waited for the lioness to have the right amount of hormone content to the right level, artificial insemination of it.
“Fortunately, the results were successful,” Ganswinter said.
Researchers "did several attempts, but unexpectedly, didn't take much effort," he said.
He said that the above-mentioned research breakthrough can be tested repeatedly, and scientists hope to use this technology to save the endangered big cats.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, lions have been extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of surviving wild lions has plummeted by 43% in the past 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
The African lion is listed as a vulnerable animal by this organization.
"If we don't do something for this animal, they're going to be extinct," Ganswinter said.
He said the new technology does not require lions to be raised, but only if sperm is injected into a pregnant lioness, just as it has been done in North America and Europe against captive elephants.
South Korea’s exports fell in September, the biggest in more than two years, but analysts blamed fewer working days on the decline and said global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite rising U.S.-China trade tensions.
Indeed, South Korea’s average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, preliminary data released earlier showed double-digit growth in exports in the first few weeks of the long holiday.
South Korea's exports fell year-on-year in September, the largest since July 2016, down more than the 5.7 percent decline in the forecast of 11 analysts polled by Reuters.
Preliminary values released on Monday showed exports of $50.6 billion in September, down from $51.2 billion in August.
Despite concerns that the growing U.S.-China trade dispute could hurt other export-dependent Chinese neighbors, South Korea's exports to China rose 7.8% in September, expanding for the 23rd month in a row.
South Korea's exports to the United States fell 11.8 percent as oil sales fell.
Overseas sales of South Korean memory chips and petroleum products increased by 28.3 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively, despite concerns that the so-called “supercycle” of chips may have peaked.
“However, the impact of the trade conflict will be inevitable, as South Korea’s exports are heavily dependent on the U.S. and Chinese markets.”
Imports fell 2.1 percent to $4.08 billion, nor did they grow as seen in Reuters surveys by 3.1 percent.
The initial trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that thanks to the United States and the European Union, the global manufacturing industry will remain prosperous, which is a favorable factor for South Korea's exports.
The statement pointed out that "the increase in export prices caused by the rise in oil prices will also be beneficial to exports in the second half of this year."
"However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with the increase in market volatility after the US interest rate hike, are the negative pressure on exports."
Exports increased to $2.6 billion on average in September and $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea's Mid-Autumn Festival this year falls on September 24-26, so September has only 19.5 working days, four days less than the same period last year.
South Korea's exports from January to September increased by 4.7% compared with the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers Index, South Korea’s manufacturing activity picked up in September, but was supported by domestic orders, which are likely to cloud the outlook for exports from China and Japan, as falling orders from China and Japan.
North Korean media criticizes U.S. for not easing sanctions on North Korea
North Korea's "Labor News" published a signed commentary article on September 30, criticizing the United States for seeking dialogue with the DPRK while not easing sanctions against North Korea, calling it a "contradictory" approach.
The article said that US Secretary of State Pompeo said on the 14th that "the key to realizing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is to implement sanctions against the DPRK", emphasizing that the United States' position on continuing to implement the UN sanctions resolution remains unchanged.
In the Singapore-North Korea-U.S. Joint Statement, the two sides pledged to build a new DPRK-U.S. relationship that is compatible with the desire of the two peoples to look forward to peace and prosperity.
On the one hand, the United States has stepped up its sanctions and pressure, and on the other hand, it is undoubtedly contradictory to demand dialogue.
If we want to build a new DPRK-US relationship, build a permanently consolidated peace system on the Korean Peninsula, and achieve the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, we should put the construction of trust in the first place, starting from what can be done, and resolve it one by one in stages.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions and suppression will not work against North Korea.
The article said that even the "North Devinsk" before the "Kazan" was praised by the US military.
National Interest magazine quoted the U.S. Navy as saying: "We will encounter strong potential adversaries. Just look at the North Devinsk submarine is enough."
The current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, Fogo, also praised the North Devinsk submarine.
"The submarine is impressive. Look at the development of the Russian Navy and how the resources are being used, and the main efforts in its research and development are to strengthen the submarine fleet first," he said.
But National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this field.
“I believe that Western countries still have asymmetrical advantages,” Fogo said.
Earlier, it was reported that the Russian Navy will be installed on the "Kazan" submarine in 2019.
"Kazan", "Novosibirsk", "Krasnoyarsk", "Alkhangelsk" multi-purpose submarine are "white wax tree-M" modified, displacement of 13,800 tons, diving depth of 520 meters, staffed 64 people, underwater speed of 31 knots, will carry peto, torpedo and "caliber" and "onyx" cruise missiles.

Ignore the American threat!
EU to reach crude oil purchase agreement with Iran
The U.S. government recently announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November, and even urged other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
But America’s allies don’t seem to listen.
According to the New York Times, on the 29th, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed in an interview that although the United States threatened to sanction any country doing business with Iran, Tehran was close to a deal with the European Union on the sale of crude oil.
The core purpose of the agreement is to try to create a new payment mechanism, that is, to replace dollar transactions in a barter or local currency.
The aim of the method is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from obstructing financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is working on the deal, some French and British officials are concerned that if the agreement is achieved, it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States, which opposes the US withdrawal from the nuclear agreement.
In an hour-long interview, Zarif’s words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement has the ability to "strip" the traditional allies of the United States, effectively breaking the United States' attempt to reduce Iran's income.
â€œThis ensures that we sell our oil and benefit,â€ Zarif said, adding that under the 2015 agreement, countries have the legal right to trade with Iran.
Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said: “No sovereign country or organization can accept others’ decisions about who they can trade with.”
However, she also predicted that before the U.S. government launched the next step in sanctions in November, it is possible that U.S. leaders will take a series of financial measures aimed at targeting banks, businessmen and countries that do business with Tehran.
In May, the U.S. government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that the agreement was flawed, saying that the agreement could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The U.S. has since threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other goods from doing business in the United States.
The threat caused some companies to withdraw from Tehran and the Iranian currency plummeted.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Total have already eliminated billions of dollars in investment in Iran.
British and French officials have said the U.S. government could "have the upper hand."
According to a recent report in Turkish media, the US sanctions do not seem to have had a great impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iranian Oil Minister Zangane said that no other country except South Korea stopped buying Iranian oil.
Zarif and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani both believe that the purpose of a series of U.S. actions is to “tempt” Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also dismissive of a series of verbal attacks by the United States, and when asked whether the United States would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, "It is a strategy of regime change, which is the real purpose of the United States."

The reporter learned from the National Health Commission that compared with decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in China has decreased, and the incidence of overweight and obesity has increased significantly.
Experts pointed out in this regard, maintain a healthy weight, the most important concept is to "cure the disease", vigorously promote scientific fitness, reasonable diet.
According to the "China Youth Health Education Core Information and Interpretation (2018 Edition)" recently released by the National Health and Health Commission, the key to maintaining a healthy weight is a reasonable diet and scientific exercise.
Being overweight, obese, and losing weight blindly are not good for health.
The health risks behind the "little fat pier" cannot be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, director of the Nutrition and Health Institute of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight obesity endangers the normal growth and development of adolescents, and has adverse effects on their psychology, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and even leads to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood lipids in children.
At the same time, overweight and obesity in adolescents are easy to continue into adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes in adolescents.
Ding Gangqiang said that from 2010 to 2012, the nutrition and health status of Chinese residents showed that the overweight rate of children and adolescents aged 6-17 in China was 9.6%, the obesity rate was 6.4%, and the two were 16%.
At the same time, overweight and obese children and adolescents show that boys are higher than girls and urban areas are higher than rural characteristics, and the rate of overweight obesity has increased significantly in recent decades.
How do teenagers cope with overweight obesity?
Zhang Li, deputy director of the Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of the State Administration of Sports, pointed out that the main reason for obesity among adolescents is excessive calorie intake and insufficient physical activity.
For this simple obesity, we should pay attention to scientific exercise plus reasonable diet control.
Zhang pointed out that the most important concept to maintain a healthy weight is to "cure the disease", which is a very important part of the school, parents and students to carry out a full range of popular science education, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity, improve the awareness of young people's prevention.
Adolescents should regularly undergo physical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight, and detect and scientifically determine whether overweight and obesity occur early, so as to take timely interventions.
For adolescents who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gangqiang suggested that in addition to actively scientifically arranging meals and exercise, adolescents are in a special physiological stage, and should avoid using hunger or semi-hungry therapy to control and lose weight, and should not blindly take weight loss drugs.
Sept 28 (Reuters) - Facebook (FB.O) said on Friday that hackers had stolen digital landing codes, giving them access to nearly 50 million user accounts, in the face of unprecedented faces, the worst security breach it ever had.
Facebook, which has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, said it had not yet determined whether the attackers misused any accounts or stolen personal information.
The company also did not find the location of the hackers, and it was not sure if the hackers targeted specific victims.
Initial analysis revealed that it was a large-scale attack.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg called the incident "really serious" in a media conference call.
A company spokesman said his account and the account of Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg were also affected.
Facebook shares fell 2.6 percent on Friday, dragging down Wall Street's main stock index.

“This is another sad piece of evidence that Congress needs to take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users,” Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement.
Federal Trade Commission Commissioner Rohit Chopra said on Twitter that I wanted to get answers to Reuters’ reports of the security breach.

In September, China's comprehensive PMI increased month-on-month, and the manufacturing PMI fell month-on-month.
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China on the 30th, in September, China's comprehensive PMI output index was 54.1%, higher than the previous month and the average annual value of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that the overall production and business activities of Chinese enterprises remained stable.
In the same month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which constituted the composite PMI output index, were 53.0% and 54.9% respectively, down one liter from the previous month.
Among them, China's manufacturing PMI was 50.8%, down 0.5 percentage points from the previous month.
Zhao Qinghe said that this month's manufacturing PMI mainly has five characteristics:
First, the manufacturing fundamentals are generally stable.
Among the 21 industries surveyed, the PMI of 14 industries is in the expansion range, of which the manufacturing PMI of medicine, special equipment, electrical machinery and equipment is located at a higher operating level of more than 53.5%, with a faster growth rate.
The second is the small fluctuations in supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0% and 52.0 percent, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, respectively, and supply and demand continued to maintain a state of prosperity, but the expansion slowed down slightly.

Nagoya, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhida Toyan said on Monday that the central bank was aware that long-term ultra-loose monetary policy could squeeze the profit margins of financial institutions and could destabilize the country’s banking system.
But he said that given the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needed to maintain its massive stimulus package while keeping a close eye on the pros and cons of its policies.
“The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected by continued monetary easing,” Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions are more active in taking risks to make up for the impact of narrowing profit margins caused by low interest rates over the years, the banking system is likely to be volatile in the event of a serious negative impact.
"Although these risks are not large at present, the central bank will pay close attention to the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take necessary measures," he said.
Minutes of the Bank of Japan meeting, released earlier on Monday, showed that at the September meeting, the Bank of Japan’s policy committee discussed the rising cost of long-term easing.
Minutes of the meeting showed that one member said that if the economy continues to expand, "the BOJ will have more flexibility in policy in the future."
According to the minutes, another member said that given the limitations of the policy period, the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan can maintain stimulus policies.
Kuroda said the Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks posed by easing, while also considering uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic prospects, as Sino-U.S. trade frictions and rising protectionism could affect global demand.
“The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is limited for the time being,” Kuroda said.
"But how the problem continues, the impact on the Japanese economy is likely to become larger," he added.
“There is a need for sustained and strong monetary easing, while considering both positive and negative effects in a balanced way,” said Kurada.
Despite the growing ills of the aggressive stimulus package, such as the long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, low inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the global trade war dispute, Kuroda ruled out the possibility of a recent rate hike.
June 1, 2018, the United States Cardiff, Tesla electric car on the corporate logo.
Under a settlement, U.S. Tesla and its chief executive, Musk, have agreed to pay a $20 million fine each to financial regulators, and Musk will step down as chairman of the company but remain CEO.
The settlement will bring Tesla’s turmoil to an end for two months.
The SEC’s disclosure on Saturday of the securities fraud charges settlement agreement will take investors to the fore.
Investors had been concerned that a protracted legal battle would only hit the still-lost electric car company further.
The SEC sued Musk for fraud on Thursday, saying its Aug. 7 tweet misled investors.
The tweet said he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 a share and had secured funding.
The SEC said the tweets were actually unfounded and that the market turmoil it caused hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the deal could bolster Tesla, which has been hit hard by Musk’s recent behavior.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common Asset Management, said the settlement should put Musk under more oversight while not taking the “devastating” step of driving him out of Tesla.
The asset manager owns shares of Tesla’s battery maker Panasonic.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors, and a board of directors to develop controls on Musk’s external communications.
"The matter was resolved quickly and in the best interests of our markets and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, on agreed terms," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday’s allegations caused Tesla’s market value to evaporate about $7 billion, and the company’s market cap was $45.2 billion on Friday, down from General Motors’ $47.5 billion.
The SEC withdrew its request to take Musk off the company’s top position in the settlement.
Many investors say the penalty would be catastrophic.
“I think it’s the best possible outcome for all involved,” said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a “neutral” rating and called the SEC’s penalty a “light penalty” for Musk.
"He's still CEO for Tesla."
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC’s allegations in the settlement, nor did they immediately respond to requests for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.

Indonesia's official Antara news agency quoted the number of people released by the head of the National Disaster Relief Agency, Wilem Rampangilei, at midnight on the 29th local time, and the death toll caused by the strong earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia's Central Sulawesi Province has risen to 420.
The official said that this is only the statistics of the city of Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, and does not include the Dongala County and nearby Sigi areas, where the epicenter is located, because communications in these two areas are still interrupted and no reports of the number of people killed have been received.
Because many roads in the city of Palu have been severely damaged, heavy machinery is difficult to access, and search and rescue efforts have encountered great difficulties.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private enterprise symposium, injecting firm confidence into the private economy towards a broader stage.
General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that "let entrepreneurs unload their ideological burden and move forward lightly" has aroused strong resonance among the majority of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the magnificent history of reform and opening up in the past 40 years, there are thousands of entrepreneurial and innovative stories, and the growth of the entrepreneurial group has continuously promoted the breaking of the waves of China's economy.
For some time, some people in society have made some negative and skeptical remarks about the private economy.
The so-called "private economic departure theory", "new public-private partnership theory" and other false claims have aroused the doubts and concerns of some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have an impact on some export enterprises; the rapid adjustment of the demand structure has brought about the pressure of transformation and upgrading; some policies are not coordinated with each other, the policy effect is superimposed in the same direction, or the working method is simple, resulting in some good policies have the opposite effect.
Various factors are intertwined, the private economy is experiencing difficulties, some private enterprises are facing difficulties in operation, and entrepreneurs have shown a lot of anxiety.
In this context, correcting the misunderstanding of understanding, unloading the ideological burden of entrepreneurs, so that enterprises are single-minded to seek development, and the government is single-minded to promote development, which is related to market confidence and development expectations, which has a particularly profound practical significance.
At this symposium, we once again emphasized the important assertion that "the three have not changed": "The status and role of the non-public economy in China's economic and social development have not changed!"
From further promoting decentralization, establishing a power list system to creating a rule of law environment to protect the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, creating a market environment of fair competition, and shaping the atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs in the whole society, in recent years, the Party Central Committee has attached great importance to entrepreneurs and the strength of institutional protection.
The symposium clearly put forward six policy measures to strongly support the development and growth of private enterprises, and launched a series of pragmatic actions dedicated to the "light forward" of private enterprises.
These have greatly encouraged the entrepreneurial community and given more expectations to all sectors of society.
The fog is opened, the policy has been determined, and the key is to implement it.
It is necessary to continuously create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve the difficulties in development, and help realize China's economic transformation and upgrading; let entrepreneurs feel fair in the market competition, feel safe in legal business, feel respect in social life, and stimulate innovation vitality and create potential.
China's economy has entered the process of high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to exert their ambitions, and also provides more space and stage for entrepreneurs to exert their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with the further deepening of reform and the removal of obstacles, the private economy will usher in better development prospects and development opportunities, and move to a broader stage.

The estuary port is the largest port in the Yunnan section of the China-Vietnam border, located in Hekou County, Red River State, Yunnan Province, across the river from the old street city of Vietnam, belonging to the national port.
With the deepening of the country's "Belt and Road" construction, as one of the most convenient channels for China to connect Southeast Asia, the flow of entry and exit from the estuary port has steadily increased.
At 7:30 a.m. on the same day, the sun had just emerged, and the limited area of the estuary port gathered early for the local people and Chinese and foreign tourists who came to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 7:45, the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the members of the National Gate Honor Guard at the estuary border checkpoint were in good spirits and escorted the national flag to the flag-raising platform at a healthy pace.
After the commander issued the flag-raising instructions, the flag-raising hand struggled to waving his arm to draw an arc, and the bright five-star red flag spread like an "eagle spread its wings", accompanied by the agitated and majestic melody of the national anthem.

During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, some positive messages were released around the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in relayed North Korea’s “irreversible” nuclear denuclearization and said U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea’s supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, could meet by the end of the year.
The U.S. State Department later said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to push for the implementation of the commitments made by U.S. and North Korean leaders to meet in Singapore.
Since the beginning of this year, the DPRK and the Roka have broken the ice to open the road of dialogue, the leaders of the DPRK and the ROK and the United States have held a meeting, the general trend of de-escalation on the Korean Peninsula has continued, and the principle of resolving the Korean Peninsula issue has been upheld.
First of all, the essence of the Korean Peninsula issue is a security issue has not changed, and the key to achieving peace on the Peninsula is to properly and balance the legitimate security concerns of all parties, rather than blindly exerting pressure on each other and emphasizing their own demands.
Second, in the dialogue on realizing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the parties concerned still have differences on the steps and ways to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the game thinking of "who comes first and who after" is still strong.
At the Security Council's open meeting on the Korean Peninsula held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, all parties issued different voices on the issue of sanctions against the DPRK, once again highlighting the two points on the Korean Peninsula issue.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has insisted that sanctions on North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula is completely denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, for his part, stressed the principle of "response by action", noting that "the weakening trend of sanctions should be the same as the steps taken by North Korea on the road of gradual denuclearisation."
There is no doubt that all relevant parties should continue to implement the DPRK-related resolutions in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but the pressure is not the purpose, and the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political solution are the requirements of the Security Council resolutions.
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in inter-Korean and US-US relations, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider the timely launch of reversible clauses, so as to encourage the DPRK and all relevant parties to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back on the past, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and every progress in the peace process require sufficient political courage from all parties.
At present, in the face of the international community's expectation of promoting the political settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue, all relevant parties should especially show political strength, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve difficult problems, continue to take steps to the contrary, advance the process of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and establish a peace mechanism on the Peninsula in parallel, and jointly create a permanent peace on the Peninsula.

Health centres and health posts provide influenza vaccination services during special National Day holidays
The Health Bureau has ordered 150,000 doses of the 2018-2019 quadrivalent influenza vaccine this year, giving priority to free vaccinations for high-risk people at this stage, and providing vaccination services from 9 a.m. to 1 noon in order to facilitate the vaccination of residents during the holidays, health centers and health stations under the Health Bureau, especially on the National Day holiday (October 1 and 2) from 9 a.m. to 1 noon.

Free vaccinations include the following Macao residents: persons aged 6 months to 18 years, persons aged 50 and above, pregnant women, all chronically ill persons, including obese persons (i.e. persons with a body mass index of BMI of 30 or above), as well as staff in institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools, all health workers, and Macao residents working in casinos.
At the same time, the Health Bureau believes that other personnel who have been vaccinated, including the public sector, will take the initiative to contact the relevant agencies to obtain the list and arrange for vaccination by the health center.
In order to facilitate the vaccination of vaccinators and reduce the waiting time for the province, the Health Bureau will send medical staff to the local secondary school, primary school, kindergarten and nursery during the period from October to December this year to carry out collective influenza vaccination for young children, primary and secondary school students, teachers and employees; in addition, the Health Bureau will also arrange for people to be vaccinated by the elderly and disabled institutions, public departments or other institutions with a large number of people.

The Health Bureau reminds residents that between September 2017 and August 2018, people who have been vaccinated against influenza from 2017 to 2018 will still need to be vaccinated for the new season of influenza vaccine from September 2018, because the influenza antigen component contained in the 2018-2019 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine has been updated, targeting the winter of 2018-2019 and the seasonal influenza in the summer of 2019.
The peak flu period in Macao is generally from January to March each year, and it is later than in temperate areas (such as northern China and Japan), and the Health Bureau calls on the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese people and chronically ill people who are more likely to have complications and those who are often in contact with high-risk people should be vaccinated as soon as possible.

The reporter learned from the Propaganda Department of the Qingbaijiang District Committee of Chengdu on the evening of September 29 that on the evening of September 29, a China-Europe train (Chengdu) full of car connectors, telescopes, liquid crystal displays and other goods was changed through the Shemia Nuvka Port in Poland, and finally arrived in Nuremberg, Germany.
This is the first time that the domestic China-Europe train has opened the Shemianufka port line in Poland, marking the successful opening of another European transport route after the China-Europe train followed Mara and Chop.
This China-Europe train was listed on September 14th from Chengdu Qingbaijiang City Station, exited through Alashankou, entered Europe through the Shemianovka Port in Poland, and finally arrived in Nuremberg, Germany, for a total of about 16 days.
For the first time, the China-Europe train departure process carried out the replacement operation of the train wide-track and standard rails here.
The opening of the port has effectively solved the problems caused by the current congestion at the Mara port, improved the transportation time of the train; and provided a new solution for the congestion problem of the Mara port, further improved the carrying capacity and transportation efficiency of the western hinterland of China to the European Mediterranean market, and laid a solid foundation for the opening up of the European market.
Indonesia's Sulawesi island, where a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, has now confirmed more than 400 deaths, many of them swept away by tsunami waves triggered by the quake.
Authorities expect a significant increase in the total number of deaths on Sunday as new data is reported in remote areas.
Dozens of people are reportedly still trapped under the rubble of a hotel and a shopping mall in Baru.
The large waves of up to six meters (20 feet) triggered by the earthquake hit the city of Baru.
So far only the death toll has been from Baru, and the death toll in Dongla, north of Baru, has been slow to report, and authorities are preparing for a worse situation.
Donguela has a population of 300,000, closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Indonesian Vice President Carla said the total number of deaths could rise to thousands.
When the twilight waves hit the coast on Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate the festival, many washed away by the Great Waves, and everything was destroyed wherever the waves went.
TOKYO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Confidence among Japan’s large manufacturing players hit their lowest level in more than a year in the September quarter, according to a quarterly report released by the Bank of Japan on Monday, as rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affected production, putting companies at the pressure.
The survey barely shows that escalating global trade frictions have hit the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-blown trade war hitting the business outlook could threaten corporate capital spending.
Active capital spending is a bright spot in the Japanese economy.
The survey calls into question the Bank of Japan’s view that a solid economic expansion will help drive inflation to an accelerated 2 percent target, despite signs that companies are gradually passing costs on to customers.
"In the face of concerns caused by the global trade war, manufacturing confidence tends to stagnate due to slowing exports and weak factory production," said Nan Wuzhi, chief researcher of the China Metallurgical Institute of Agriculture and Forestry.
"Considence is still high. And because corporate earnings are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to decline."
The short-term survey showed that the index of large-scale manufacturing boom judgment in September fell from positive 21 three months ago to positive 19, which was a deterioration for the third consecutive quarter.
The median estimate for the market is positive 22.
In September, the large non-manufacturing boom judgment index fell to positive 22 from positive 24 in the June survey, the first deterioration in eight quarters.
The Reuters poll was positive for 22.
The survey shows that the large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing boom judgment index in December is expected to remain stable.
Investors are not concerned about the decline in the short-term corporate sentiment judgment index, and the Nikkei .N225 rose to a 27-year high on Monday as the yen continues to depreciate to help improve the export earnings prospects of Japanese companies.
Capital expenditure is stable.
While business confidence has declined, the latest short-term outlook highlights the soundness of corporate capital spending plans, helped by renewed capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to cope with labor shortages caused by an aging population.
The central bank's short-term survey shows that large companies plan to increase capital spending by 13.4% in the current fiscal year ending in March 2019.
The previous short-term survey was 13.6%.
Nan said that all corporate capital expenditure plans to increase by 8.5% this fiscal year, close to the pace of the Japanese bubble economy.
“There is still room for further growth in capital spending, given that small businesses are raising their profit forecasts from now on, but that largely depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence,” he said.
The short-term survey shows the increased ability of companies to pass on costs, with a positive output price index of 7, a decade high, an encouraging sign that Japan has made progress in its efforts to combat deflation.
The index, which measures the employment of large enterprises, hit negative 23, the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening labor market.
Benefiting from strong corporate spending, the second quarter of the Japanese economy rebounded from its contraction in January-March.
But the escalation of the summer trade friction and the disruption of supply chains by natural disasters have clouded the economic outlook for Japan, which is dependent on exports.
In dollar terms, the growth rate of service imports and exports was 16.4%.
The press release of the website of the Ministry of Commerce quoted the person in charge of the Service and Trade Division as saying that the total import and export of emerging services exceeded 1 trillion yuan from January to August, and the growth rate was faster than the overall growth rate.
Among them, the total import and export of emerging services was 1,138.39 billion yuan, an increase of 20.9%, higher than the overall growth rate of service imports and exports of 10.4 percentage points, and the proportion of emerging services increased by nearly 3 percentage points.
In terms of service exports, from January to August, service exports continued the rapid growth momentum since this year, and the export growth rate was 5.7 percentage points higher than the growth rate of imports.
Among them, the top three areas of growth are telecommunications computer and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, insurance services, the growth rate of 61.1%, 38.8% and 26.5%, respectively.
The person in charge of the Service and Trade Division also pointed out that the proportion of emerging service imports in January-August has also gradually increased.
From January to August, the import of emerging services grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6% of service imports, an increase of 1.6 percentage points over the same period last year.
Among them, the growth rate of imports of financial services, intellectual property royalties, and telecommunications computers and information services exceeded 20%, respectively, 47.1%, 23.3% and 23.2%.

The 69th International Astronautical Congress opens in Germany
Bremen, Germany, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- The 69th International Astronautical Congress kicked off at the Bremen Convention and Exhibition Center in Germany on October 1, with more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and enterprises, experts, scholars and young students from all over the world attending.
In his opening speech, IAF President Jean-Yves Legar said that the global space industry is no longer attended by only a few countries and institutions, and this year's attendance has increased significantly compared with the previous session, indicating that more and more institutions and people are joining it.
He called on countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation to jointly promote the development of the space industry.
Zhang Kejun, Vice Minister of Industry and Information Technology and Director of the State Space Administration, introduced China's space program when attending the exchange event, and said that China will expand international cooperation in the field of space and contribute to the human space industry.
China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation and other relevant institutions and representatives of some private enterprises attended the meeting, showing the latest achievements of China's spaceflight, including various types of launch vehicles, satellites and aerospace technology application products.
The International Astronautical Congress, held annually since 1950, is the largest event in the world of aviation.

BEIJING, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The Canton Fair shows that China’s foreign trade situation remains complex and severe, with 80.6 percent of companies expected to export better or flat for the whole year of 2018, according to a press release issued by the China Foreign Trade Center on Sunday.
However, considering the rising cost of domestic raw materials, labor and other comprehensive factors, and the external environment with the impact of Sino-US trade frictions, exhibitors also believe that the export situation next year is not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, Deputy Secretary-General of the Canton Fair, Spokesperson and Deputy Director of China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions at the Canton Fair have declined slightly year-on-year.
The current buyer meeting of 189,812 people, from 215 countries and regions, down 1.11% year-on-year.
Exports amounted to 2,06.494 billion yuan (equivalent to 29.86 billion U.S. dollars), down 1% year-on-year.
From the market point of view, the turnover of Japan, ASEAN countries, the "BRIC countries" and South Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2%, 2.5% respectively, and the traditional markets of the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union fell by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively.
From the industry point of view, transport vehicles, machinery and equipment, construction and decoration materials, consumer electronics and information products, sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1%, and 7.6%, respectively, textile and clothing, household appliances fell by 13.0%, 6.7%.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer and wind vane of China's foreign trade, the situation of buyers attending the Canton Fair and export transaction data show that China's foreign trade development is still facing many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the in-depth promotion of the supply-side structural reform and the recent national and local policies and measures such as "six stability", the new momentum of China's foreign trade development is accelerating the accumulation of new progress, which are important foundations and strong conditions for the development of foreign trade.
"Integrated with all factors, it is expected that China's foreign trade imports and exports will maintain steady growth throughout the year, and the quality and efficiency will be further improved," Xu said.
China's General Administration of Customs announced that exports in U.S. dollars in September increased by 14.5% year-on-year, imports increased by 14.3% year-on-year, and the trade surplus in September was $31.69 billion, and the export growth and trade surplus in September were the highest since February this year.
Despite the escalating Sino-US trade frictions, China's export performance in September still greatly exceeded expectations, strong external demand, enterprises in the United States before the imposition of tariffs to grab exports superimposed RMB exchange rate depreciation, or the main supporting factors, to a certain extent, also shows the resilience of China's foreign trade, but the Sino-US trade war on confidence, the impact on the industrial chain can not be underestimated, analysts believe that China's foreign trade challenges may appear in the fourth quarter or next year.
U.S. fund managers suggested in September to increase their cash holdings, a Reuters survey said, continuing a cautious stance as the United States and China began their latest round of mutual import tariffs and the dispute showed no sign of easing.
However, according to the 12 fund managers who participated in the survey, the allocation of assets in North America increased to the highest since June 2017, while the positions in the UK, the euro area, especially emerging markets, fell.
The global share of stock allocation averaged 56.6%, and bonds accounted for 35.5%, basically in line with last month's survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash ratio rose to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
"Some economic data brings confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so it is best to be prepared to enter when the market falls back," said a fund manager at a large fund company.
But fund managers still preferred stocks in September, particularly U.S. stocks, even though U.S. stocks were considered to be high.
Today, the open landmark of Shanghai in China, the world's first large-scale national exhibition with import theme, China International Import Expo, officially kicked off in the expectation of all.
An exhibition is like a "window" that gives the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the Expo, people see the "open China" to a higher level; with the "window" of the Expo, the world and the "reform and opening up" China's mutual benefit and win-win.
"For a country, openness is like a cocoon into a butterfly, although it will experience a momentary pain, but it will be replaced by a new birth."
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of the road of opening up shows an important reason why China can do it.
Looking back on the 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which dares to enter the world market, has encountered whirlpools and wind and waves, but has always faced all risks and challenges with an open attitude, continuously releasing endogenous motivation and continuously improving competitiveness.
It can be said that China has effectively interpreted the value and significance of opening up with its own practical achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point and holding an import-themed expo, a major decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core to promote a new round of high-level opening up, is a major measure for China to take the initiative to open its market to the world, and is China's practical action to support economic globalization and trade liberalization, demonstrating the strong and clear willingness that "China's door of opening up will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider."
Exhibitors from all over the world are enthusiastic, and the booth "one is difficult to find" is the biggest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a wider range, a wider field and a deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have built a high wall of trade protectionism and returned to the old path of unilateralism, which has increased the international community's concerns about the prospects for free trade, and added a lot of uncertainty to the world economy that is warming up.
In the context of such an era, the event on the banks of the Huangpu River reflects China's defense of free trade, allowing the world to see China's self-confidence and China's commitment to opening up its markets and sharing the future.
Go far, far away, far away.
China's open mind and embrace the world not only effectively promote its own development, but also bring surging "China opportunities" to all countries and regions in the world.
In recent years, advocating and promoting the joint construction of the "Belt and Road", the launch of the establishment of the AIIB, the establishment of the Silk Road Fund... China has provided a series of international public goods, providing a real export market, development opportunities and jobs, so that enterprises from all countries can take the "fast train" and "pass" China's development.
The Expo is also a public product, a large platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in the Chinese market with their own high-quality products and services.
In addition to national enterprises, the real benefits are domestic consumers.
By building this "preferential" platform, it provides a multi-channel high-quality supply for consumption upgrading to meet the personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs of the people.
As China's open door is open and wider, the goods will flow smoothly, and the best use of it will make the most of it, and the pace towards a better life will be more solid.
From a more macro perspective, the significance of the Expo has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade, but focuses on the future, conveys the concept of openness, inclusiveness, inclusiveness, balance and win-win, and forms a consensus to jointly meet today's challenges.
The world is good, China can be good; China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to the Expo bringing the world a wonderful and complete; we are more determined to move towards a brighter level of "open China" and the bright future of the world to build a community of human destiny.
Foreign media: the United States and Canada reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement includes Canada’s opening of its dairy market to the United States and the temporary non-imposed tariffs on Canadian-made cars.
According to foreign media reports, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of September 30 that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and temporarily imposing no tariffs on Canadian-made cars.
On July 27, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary agreement in principle on updating the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement by the August 31 deadline set by the United States to extend the negotiation deadline to September 30.
Earlier, a spokesman for Canada's Foreign Minister Freeland said that Canada would only sign a favorable agreement, "focusing on the substance, not the timetable. We will continue to consult and hope to reach an agreement that is in Canada's national interest."
More than 90 percent of Brazilian women say presidential candidates do not consider women’s needs.
According to data released by Brazil's National Geographic Institute (IBGE), more than 90% of Brazilian women do not believe that the presidential candidates take women's needs into account.
At present, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million, and if the women of all Brazil are gathered together to form a country, the country's population will rank 13th in the world, and the number of people will be more than twice the population of Spain.
In Brazil, women account for 52% of the total voters and 48% of men. Although the proportion of women among voters is very high, only 10% of women in Brazil's Congress.
Among the 193 countries in the world, Brazilian women are only ranked 154th in political participation, higher than in Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women have still not succeeded in gaining their rights.
According to Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori, this phenomenon exists because of the combination of ancient patrilineal societies, racism, and capitalist values.
“Political should be made up of citizens who advocate civil rights, status, access to public goods, and make up a society of multiple social groups. But Brazilian politics belongs to a monopoly of one group, and the majority of the population is not represented.”
A previous study by the Brazilian Locomotiva Institute also found that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that the politicians produced by the election can represent their rights, 90% of Brazilian women do not agree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93% of women do not agree with the current government policy.
"We need to reverse the problem of underrepresentation of women in parliament, and Brazil's political system is still affected by inequality. So far, there is still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in Brazil's political sphere," said Natalia Morri.
Despite women’s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76 per cent of women believed that they could make a difference in democratic elections and 72 per cent were interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democracy is the best way to make women suffer less prejudice.

As growth in Europe, Asia, and emerging markets is mostly not encouraging, the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine of global economic growth.
September 23, 2018, New Jersey, United States, a container ship berthed in the port.
But because current U.S. growth has benefited from the time it comes from the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts, the country’s economy has also been closely watched.
“As the United States returns to full employment, a downturn in the economy is inevitable.”
The only question, he said, was when it would happen, and in his opinion, it might only be pushed back in advance.
While Barclays is optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook before the end of the year, the bank acknowledged that it would be more difficult to make forecasts for longer times.
“The current growth, incentivized by fiscal policy, will be unsustainable in the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost growth potential,” Barclays economists said in a research note.
“The risk of a hard landing in 2020 will rise in the absence of investment growth,” they said.
A series of business surveys will roughly show that major economies are in the economic cycle at the end of the third quarter.
The euro zone and U.S. manufacturing survey, which is scheduled to be released next Monday, will be watched, with a services survey to be released on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week’s data will certainly be on U.S. nonfarm payrolls data, which will provide clues about whether a tight job market is driving a big wage growth.
Its importance is not only important for the profitability of businesses and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because wage jumps or triggers an overall inflation increase that may unnerve the Federal Reserve (Fed) officials.
“Salary will be a big hit as it could rise sharply again from the previous month.

Affected by the typhoon "Tan Mei", the strong winds in the port pool continued, the maximum wind speed was even as high as 24 knots, the sailing signal was postponed for nearly 90 minutes from 1 p.m. on the 30th, the wind speed was still not reduced, and the match referee Annie Mudrant announced the cancellation of the first day of the game, and postponed the game to the afternoon of October 1.
"The strong wind blowing from the shore continues, and the sea conditions are too severe."
"In this case, no one knows when the gusts will be blowing the boat with the wind.
Close to the city's arena, in terms of the current wind conditions, canceling the game is the most sensible choice.
The crew, who were all ready, was still somewhat disappointed.
"The boat is ready to stop, we are in good shape."
Qingdao helmsman Max Richardson said: "But I know that the game is the right choice to reschedule, and I hope that today's wind energy is smaller, we can show off."
Known as the "Star of Hope" for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, New Zealand's "Star of Hope" Omika Wilkinson said: "Losing a day makes the competition more interesting.
Because today's game weight will increase, and there are only two days left to play.

Although the global financial market shock continued, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the investment income of the Exchange Fund in the third quarter of this year was greatly reduced by 97% year-on-year, but it was better than the performance of the previous quarter, because under the Sino-US trade war, overseas stocks rose and the foreign exchange losses narrowed significantly.
According to the latest data from the HKMA, the exchange fund recorded investment income of HK$1.6 billion in July-September 2018, which was significantly lower than HK$61.8 billion in the same period last year, but it was better than the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Chen Delin, president of the HKMA, said at the Legislative Council that at the beginning of the Sino-US trade war, the Hong Kong and emerging market stock indexes ran counter to the US stock index, until the end of September and the beginning of October, after the US stock market index bottomed out, market sentiment began to reverse, because investors gradually realized that the trade war was also detrimental to the United States itself.
"Change in market sentiment is a good thing, if the trade war only has a unilateral impact, it will not help to solve things."
But he also pointed out that "if the Sino-US trade war is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise."
In the third quarter of this year, the foreign exchange fund's stock investment loss in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK$4.7 billion from the previous quarter, and the overseas stock investment income increased by 172% to HK$12.8 billion; foreign exchange losses were HK$16.2 billion, bond income was HK$9.7 billion, a decrease of 24% and 31% respectively, mainly reflecting the general increase in the US dollar against major currencies in the quarter and the US interest rate rising above 3 cents in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Hong Kong has had a linked exchange rate system pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1983.
For the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that the economic and asset market uncertainty has increased and the downside risks have increased, but Hong Kong's financial system is stable, it is also well defended, and the earthquake resistance is abundant.
"Hong Kong's international investment position is abundant, the foreign net worth of 1.4 trillion US dollars is equivalent to four times of GDP, higher than Singapore's 2.5 times and Japan's 0.6 times, to cope with the economic downturn cycle or reversal is enough."
Recently, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate continues to fall and the dollar spread expanded, Chen Delin pointed out that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate rose more than 400 basis points on September 21, the market is generally believed to be mainly related to the rise in the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, and then the Hong Kong dollar against the dollar around 7.80-7.84 hovering, to the recent Hong Kong dollar interest rate continues to fall, and the dollar spread expansion, may attract the market to the Hong Kong dollar, buy the dollar interest rate activities increased, so that the Hong Kong dollar once again triggered the opportunity of the weak.
But he believes that with the beginning of the interest rate hike cycle of Hong Kong banks, the normalization of Hong Kong dollar interest rates is in progress, and the future situation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates below the US dollar interest rate will change.
"The Hong Kong dollar interest rate and the dollar interest rate will be more consistent, we must be more careful to manage risk, be prepared to deal with market fluctuations."
Due to the abundant funds of the Hong Kong dollar, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate fell further, and the three-month interest rate was down 0.9 per cent to 2.08179 per cent on Monday, and the spread with the US dollar widened from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the one-month interest-breaking rate was a new five-month low, and the spread with the US dollar was expanded from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate was close to 7.85 to the US dollar for most of the time.
During the period, due to factors such as the outflow of funds from some of the prospectus after the completion of the arbitrage activity and the large-scale prospectus, the weak party exchange guarantee was triggered again in May and August after the weak party exchange guarantee was first triggered in April.
The HKMA bought Hong Kong dollars and raised US dollars at the level of 7.85 in accordance with the linkage exchange rate system to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
The HKMA bought a total of about HK$52.1 billion in May and August under the weak party exchange guarantee mechanism.

The head of the center said that they are the only one of all the five-star sub-centers in Tianjin to receive B-level service certification.

HONG KONG, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Hong Kong property prices fell for two consecutive months after peaking, and Hong Kong Monetary Authority President Chen Delin said on Monday that fashion needs time to observe whether the property market has entered a downward cycle, and if confirmed, it can be considered to relax the tightening policy of counter-cyclical measures in due course.
Chen Delin also pointed out that if the property price correction, the first to be affected will be the peak of the property market at the peak of the people, but is expected to appear as the 1997 Asian financial crisis when the property price fell sharply, the public sharply cut the price of the opportunity to sell the property is much lower.
Chen Delin, who led a number of senior HKMA executives to attend the Legislative Council briefing, said that if it is confirmed that the property market has entered a downward cycle, measures can be relaxed in the appropriate time.
"But now only a few weeks of data, relaxation is still too early, still need more time to see whether the property market into the downward cycle."
Since 10 years in 2009, the HKMA has launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to significantly tighten the mortgages of various types of properties, including reducing the number of mortgages, and the need for mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests to enhance bank risk management and earthquake resistance.
With Hong Kong officially entering the rate hike cycle, the whole Hong Kong private residential property price index peaked for two consecutive months in August-September, and the monthly decline in September widened to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year still reached 10.2%.
According to the HKMA data, the financial situation of households that measure Hong Kong's ability to face financial risks is still healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of Hong Kong households without mortgages reached 66%, higher than the average of 60% in 2009-11; the average number of new mortgages and the contribution-to-income ratio of new mortgages were 47% and 34%, respectively, compared with 64% and 41% in 2009-11.
However, Chen Delin said that the high anti-seismic ability does not mean that the residents of the real estate will not be damaged by the economic downturn, because the valuation of the property will fall, and those who buy a building at the peak will bear the brunt.
While the HKMA has tightened bank lending to mortgage lenders, home buyers can also obtain high-credit mortgages through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Chen Delin said that at present, together with the mortgage loans provided to developers, the number of mortgages for borrowers can reach 85-90%, and if the property price falls by 10%, there will be negative assets (i.e. the market value of the property falls below the level of the total outstanding mortgage loans).
However, the vice president of the HKMA, Nguyen Guoheng, pointed out that the authorities estimate that the total amount of mortgages provided by developers is only 2-2.5% of the total mortgages of banks, and the proportion is still low.
At the peak of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of the proportion of buildings.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive quarters.

Systemic lupus is a chronic and difficult disease that affects multiple organs throughout the body, and has been considered an "incurable disease" in the past.
Because of its unknown pathogenesis, difficult diagnosis and treatment, the lack of effective treatment methods can not be cured.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the School of Life Sciences of Tsinghua University, and Li Zhanguo, director of the rheumatism immunology center of Peking University People's Hospital, found that human immunoglobulins have molecular variants that increase the susceptibility of systemic lupus, and this variation is involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of systemic lupus.
According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors of the article, Sun Xiaolin of Peking University People's Hospital, the team collected nearly 2,000 large samples of systemic erythematosus patients and conducted research, and found that patients with immunoglobulin mutation produced a wide range of disease-causing cells and a large number of autoantibodies, and the incidence and severity of inflammation such as nephritis, arthritis, pyritis, and vasitis increased significantly.
Liu Wanli's team found that this immune molecular mutation activates the immune signaling pathway and promotes the pathogenesis of B cells to secrete a variety of autoantibodies through various research methods such as immune cell tracking, animal testing, and sequencing.
The reporter learned that the two teams are strong and united, giving full play to their respective advantages, and realizing the close combination of basic research and clinical applications.
Liu Wanli's team is committed to the immunorecognition and immune activation research of B lymphocytes, and the team of Li Zhanguo has long been engaged in clinical studies of systemic lupus.
"This study is one of the results of many years of cooperation between the two teams, and it is also the first time that academia has recognized in a mechanism that immunoglobulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and targeted treatment in clinical practice."
This is not a short-term protection, but a duty in accordance with the law.
Lawyer carrying an axe to court session?
The news was really exciting at first glance, and it also exploded in the legal circle.
Fujian Quanzhou City Law then fined the lawyers involved 500 yuan, and recommended in writing that the Quanzhou City Bar Association investigate and deal with it.
According to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou Municipal Law Association issued a formal notice that the behavior of the two lawyers does not involve illegal activities and is not punished according to law.
From the perspective of multiple reports, the treatment of the Quanzhou Municipal Law Association is not short-term or confrontation, but has been recognized by Quanzhou Middle Court.
An event that could have caused tension within the legal community was eventually properly resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete truth reduction: the axe carried by the lawyer involved is the same style and model as the defendant's murder weapon, but it is not open-ended, and only provides auxiliary evidence in the cross-examination of evidence, and there is no subjective intention of intimidating actions or "endangering the safety of the court".
To determine whether the lawyer's behavior is illegal or not, four very important details need to pay attention to: First, the local court has held two sessions before, only showing the axe photo, from the defense point of view, it is necessary to show the axe original; second, the axe is to buy it one hour before the court, not the lawyer is unwilling to seek the consent of the judge, but objectively failed to contact the judge; third, the entire axe has not been overtired or improperly used; fourth, the lawyer in question was publicly admitted to the court.
In summary of these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyers involved have nothing to do with "bringing an axe to appear in court", but only for defense.
After clarifying the whole fact, the Quanzhou Municipal Law Association did not push the boat along the water, but resisted the pressure and made a decision not to punish.
This decision also stands the test of facts and laws.
As for bringing an axe as a control tool to the court without the permission of the court, it is indeed easy to cause unease and misunderstanding.
Due to security and prudence, the previous fines and judicial recommendations of the Quanzhou Middle Court are also understandable.
In order to safeguard the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from making difficult laws and regulations, the Supreme People's Court issued the Rules for Judicial Police Security Inspection of People's Courts in 2014, which established the principle that lawyers do not need to conduct personal safety checks when they appear in court.
Since the release of the rule, lawyers have led by example, and there have been few incidents that endanger the security of the court due to security loopholes.
In a very few cases such as Quanzhou, as long as the spirit of mutual respect and understanding is to communicate, misunderstanding is not difficult to eliminate.
As a self-regulatory organization for the lawyer industry, the Bar Association undertakes the dual mission of punishing illegality and ensuring legal law.
In the past, individual law association organizations were criticized for their emphasis on discipline and loss of protection.
The decision of the Quanzhou Law Society, both from the process and the results, is commendable, setting an example for more law associations to perform their duties correctly.
From October 1st, which tax benefits will affect our money bags?
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1 (Reporter Sang Tong) The new personal income tax law will come into effect on January 1, 2019, in order to allow the broad masses of the people to enjoy the tax reduction dividend as soon as possible, from October 1, will be the actual salary and salary income of taxpayers will be deducted according to the starting point of 5000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate table will be applied.
With the landing of the New Deal, what are the benefits that will affect the people's money bags?
Good one: the tax reduction of wages and salaries is obvious
Taxpayers who obtain wages and salaries after October 1 can deduct 5,000 yuan / month of basic deductions and apply the new tax rate schedule, and most taxpayers have different degrees of tax reduction, especially the tax reduction of low- and middle-income people is more obvious.
According to the tax reduction table of different income groups, after deducting the "three insurances and one gold", the monthly income of 8,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, after the tax reform of the tax payable are 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan, 9090 yuan, compared with the starting point of 3500 yuan, the corresponding tax reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.8%, 18.8%.
It is worth noting that due to the reasons of holidays, the wages that should have been paid in October by various units at the end of September in accordance with the law can apply the new basic reduction fee and tax rate table.
To this end, the withholding client software used by the tax department has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid during the statutory declaration period.
Benefit 2: The distance between the low tax rate and the grade is obviously enlarged
In addition to increasing the starting point, the new tax rate schedule will be applied from October 1.
The seven-trange tax rate of this wage and salary income is the same as before, and there is no change, but the tax rate distance has changed significantly, the three-grade low tax rate of 3%, 10% and 20% has been significantly expanded, and the tax rate distance of 25% has been reduced, while the three higher tax rates of 30%, 35% and 45% have remained unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law also adjusts the tax rate of the production and operation income, of which the lower limit of the highest-end 35% tax rate is increased from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan.
This means that individual business owners and sole proprietorships will all benefit from the tax reform.
"From the early stage of the Shanghai taxpayers personal tax reduction calculation, the majority of taxpayers will fully feel the dividends of individual tax reform, especially the low- and middle-income people tax reduction is obvious."
Lan Min, head of the personal income tax department of the Shanghai Municipal Taxation Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation, said.
Benefit 3: Tax service is more convenient to optimize
Since the promulgation of the new personal income tax law, the Shanghai tax department has carried out a series of comprehensive and extensive tax publicity actions.
On the one hand, "one-to-one, peer-to-peer" policy guidance for key tax sources and key enterprises.

On the other hand, for the general public taxpayers, carry out a "all-round, multi-dimensional, three-dimensional" tax policy push.

A trilateral trade deal between the United States and Mexico will open up new opportunities for 500 million people.
According to foreign media reports, the Canadian government website released a joint statement by Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer said that the United States, Canada and Mexico reached a trilateral trade agreement, which will be called "USMCA" (USMCA three-country agreement).
Earlier, Canada's CTV News TV quoted senior U.S. sources as saying that Canada and the United States had eased their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post quoted two sources with knowledge of the situation as saying that the agreement reached between the United States and Canada on September 30 will retain the North American Free Trade Agreement as a trilateral trade agreement, and the three heads of state will sign the new agreement within two months.
“Today, Canada, the United States, and Mexico agreed on a new trade deal, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will provide high-standard trade deals for our workers, farmers, and companies, and will lead to freer markets, fairer deals, and more sustainable economic growth. The agreement will strengthen the middle class, create high-paying jobs, and create new opportunities for about 500 million people,” the statement said.
The current North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
After taking office, Trump announced that he planned to review the agreement and sign the new agreement.
The three countries have started this negotiation process since 2017.
The early election of the governor of Okinawa, due to the illness of the former governor, Weng Changxiongzhi, announced the results in the early morning of the 1st local time, and Yucheng Danny, who opposed the plan to relocate the US military base in Japan, was successfully elected.
The election was held on September 30, and the final results showed that Yucheng received a total of 396.632 million votes, the largest number of votes in the history of the Okinawa Prefecture governor's election, and more than 80,000 votes than his main campaign opponent, Sashi Jin-chun.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a turnout of 63.24 percent, down 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 Okinawa Prefectural Governors election.
Yucheng told the media on the 1st that the election results show that the county people do not want to let the efforts of Governor Weng Chang's life in vain, he will inherit the legacy of Governor Weng, and continue to make efforts to the Japanese government and the US government on opposing the relocation plan of the US military base and the closure of the Futenma base.
The U.S. military base in Okinawa Prefecture, Yinowan City, has been criticized, and the Japanese and U.S. governments have agreed to relocate it to the border area of the city, but the Okinawan people are strongly opposed and hope to completely move the base out of Okinawa.
On the county people's strong opposition to the relocation plan and the withdrawal of the border ancient coastal land reclamation permission requirements, Yucheng said that he did not stand in the confrontation and division with the central government at the beginning, hoping that the two sides can fully exchange views, showing the intention of resolving through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also told the media on the morning of the 1st that he will earnestly accept this result and will make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden on the base.
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference on the 1st that the government's policy on relocating the US military base as soon as possible has not changed.
At the same time, he also expressed his intention to talk with Yucheng.
Yucheng will officially take office as governor of Okinawa Prefecture on the 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China’s demand for oilseeds has grown, Paul Thomas, a North Dakota farmer in the United States, has grown more and more soybeans in his field.
The transition peaked this year, with him planting 1,600 acres of soybeans on 5,000 acres, on an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch to the former staple food crop of the U.S. agricultural district in 2019: corn and wheat.
U.S. farmers have more soybeans than corn this year, the first time in 35 years.
The reason why it is planned to switch to other food crops is because U.S. farmers are facing difficulties selling soybeans in the context of US President Donald Trump's trade war against China.
China typically buys about 60 percent of U.S. soybeans, but because of the trade war, almost zero purchases of U.S. soybeans in recent months have pushed soybean prices to a 10-year low.
Thomas plans to grow more wheat next year, hoping to make more money by reducing his reliance on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Thomas said soybean prices "can give us a painful blow".
He said that without Chinese buying needs, the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per bushel, while the price necessary to cover the cost was $8.50.
U.S. farmers have set record levels in soybean planting this year, and harvests are also expected to hit a record high.
At such a time as the impact, they were hit by a trade war.
In response to Trump's tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, China imposed import tariffs on imported U.S. soybeans in July.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its first forecast for next year’s planting area, which is expected to include considerations on the impact of tariffs.
The forecast is expected to confirm private institutions' expectations of a reduction in soybean planting area.
According to a report seen by Reuters, Informa Economics predicted on October 19 that corn cultivation will increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019 and soybean cultivation will be reduced by 7% to 83 million acres.
Informa also expects a 4% increase in U.S. wheat planting.
Soybeans planted before the retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres higher than a decade ago.
Corn cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008 to 89.1 million acres, and this year’s wheat planting area is 47.8 million acres, close to the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Cultration Association, has a total planting area of 3,600 acres, and this year he will spend nearly half of his time growing soybeans, but plans to cut them in the future.
He said it was possible to increase corn cultivation by up to 20 percent on his farm in northern Illinois, the largest soybean-growing state in the United States.
Soybeans yield less than corn per acre, but also require less fertilizer, which makes soybeans generally less expensive to grow.
If farmers move to final corn, they may raise costs, but will benefit some businesses, including the fertilizer sellers of Andersons Inc.
Andersons chief executive Pat Bowe told Reuters he expected the conversion of corn would benefit fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the conversion of farmers to corn.
Sutilawa, director of the airport administration in Bangkok, Thailand, held a press conference on the 29th to apologize for the incident of a Chinese citizen being beaten at the airport, and said that Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists, and the relevant departments will strengthen management, improve service awareness and avoid similar incidents.
According to reports, on the 27th, the security guard at Donman Airport had a physical conflict with a Chinese man who was denied entry.
Sutilawa said that the security guard involved in serious violations of the law, the airport authority has suspended him, and the procedure to set up a commission of inquiry to investigate the matter, if the matter is true, will dismiss the security guard.
At present, the Thai Immigration Bureau has arranged for the man to return to China by plane.
Sutilawa apologized for the incident that damaged Thailand's image, said that the Thai side attaches great importance to this matter, is willing to do its best to reduce the impact of the incident on the tourists who were beaten, and will send an apology letter to the parties through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.

Xinhua International Review: Defend multilateralism, and China's unity of knowledge and action.
At a time when unilateralism is surging against the current, international rules and the multilateral order are under attack.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible major country, China, with the concept of the trend and the road of synergy and solid and powerful actions, has worked with the international community to jointly safeguard multilateralism and promote multilateralism to keep moving forward.
In the face of new challenges in the new situation, China has issued a loud voice on the development direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in his speech at the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to the goal of win-win cooperation, based on rules and order, with fairness and justice as the main thrust, and guided by effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the construction of a global development cooperation pattern with the United Nations as the core, North-South cooperation as the main channel and South-South cooperation as the supplement, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind.
China's thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As Espinosa, President of the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, said, under the current circumstances, “the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and safeguard the rules-based international system more than ever.”
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules, and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the balance of global economic and political forces, the rise of some emerging markets and developing countries has played a greater role in major international multilateral mechanisms, providing a new impetus for development for multilateralism that has encountered headwinds.
Standing in this dimension, China's promotion of the construction of the family rather than piecing together a small circle, adhere to the concept of multilateralism such as consultation and building, rather than the winner's all-eating, in line with the trend of the times, is an inevitable choice to deal with global challenges and solve the world's problems, representing the common demands of most countries in the world.
There are advanced ideas and more solid actions.
China's "Belt and Road" initiative has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China's initiative to jointly build international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the 16+1 Cooperation will promote international and regional cooperation, improve and complement the existing international system and order, bring innovative vitality to multilateral cooperation, and contribute to promoting the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.
As the defender of the international order and the practitioner of multilateralism, China's actions are becoming more and more powerful in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices on international hotspots, address climate change, participate in peacekeeping operations, vigorously reduce poverty and alleviate poverty, and help other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As UN Secretary-General António Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
As the world’s “trust deficit” intensifies, when the trend of populism and polarization rises, it is the moment when the world’s need for multilateral cooperation is most urgent.
At such a historical juncture, the international community needs to join hands to turn consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.

The Fifth "Disability Voice Month" Comes to Focus on Sex Education for Children with Disabilities
In recent years, the topic of sex education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenge for sex education for disabled adolescents is still very difficult.
Recently, a seminar on comprehensive sex education challenges and practical strategies for people with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to conduct sex education for children and young people with disabilities has become an important topic in this seminar.
The report on sexual knowledge, attitudes and behavior of children with disabilities and youth in China released at the meeting showed that the proportion of children with disabilities who are sexually harassed and sexually abused is higher than that of healthy children.
For children and adolescents with disabilities, social attention is also given to "sexual protection".
The aim of this seminar is to explore the promotion of comprehensive sex education for children and adolescents with disabilities in China from the perspective of family support, school education and institutional services, so that children with disabilities and adolescents can support them from the source so that they have the right to enjoy love in their own right, as others do.
Experts believe that the public's understanding of the disabled group in Chinese society has always remained at a level that is not deep enough.
Affected by factors such as traditional concepts, China's comprehensive education education for people with disabilities, especially children and adolescents with disabilities, is not deep enough.
However, in recent years, with the support of UNESCO and public welfare, the practice and realization path of sexual and reproductive health education for the full-cycle and comprehensive development of China's disabled people have developed with welcome development.
The report shows that children and young people with visual impairments, hearing impairments, intellectual and physical disabilities, although they have more difficulties than the average person in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships, have generally been developed to facilitate and enrich.
The "Seminar on Comprehensive Sex Education Challenges and Practice Strategies for Persons with Disabilities" is sponsored by the Shanghai Public Welfare Foundation, supported by the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the Beijing Representative Office of the International Disability Alliance (France) and the United Nations Population Fund Representative Office in China. In the context of the strategy of Healthy China, we will jointly explore the practice and realization path of sexual and reproductive health education for all the comprehensive development of people with disabilities, and promote the international policy of comprehensive education for children and young people in the field of special education and integration.Comprehensive sexuality education is discussed and a blueprint is developed to form a support network.
BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of China (PBOC) announced on Sunday that the central bank’s short position in foreign currency-to-local currency forward and futures contracts was zero for 12 consecutive months as of the end of August, and there were still no long positions in the month.
According to the previous data of the central bank, as of the end of August last year, the central bank held a total of US$6,044 million in short positions in foreign currency-to-local currency forward and futures contracts, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the short position valued in the SDR (Special Drawing Rights) was 4.276 billion SDR.
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange long-term short position has been zero.
The central bank first released this data at the end of March 2016; the data show that the central bank's long position in foreign currency for local currency forward contracts and futures contracts at the end of February 2016 was $2.438 billion, and the short position was $28.9 billion.
The September data released at the end of October of the same year increased the net short by a net increase of $16.401 billion to $45.301 billion for the first time.
The central bank has previously said that the long-term and futures short positions of foreign currency on the local currency mainly reflect the forward operation of the central bank with commercial banks to meet the needs of the hedging of foreign currency liabilities of enterprises, and will continue to provide long-term safe-haven products according to the principle of real needs, and the long-term operation of the central bank will have a small impact on the scale of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, Qiao classmates who read juniors in Zhengzhou went to Hebi.
A man on the train bought a seatless ticket, but took her seat: "Take a picture."
Two hours by car, the conductor advised him that it would still be ineffective for an hour.
In the end, a male passenger in the same car could not see and tug up the master.
From the public opinion point of view, although the final result is that most of the hegemons are condemned by the public, the administrative punishment of the public security department, and even included in the integrity blacklist, the public still feels that they do not "dissolve the hate": why not let the overlords be punished on the spot?
Why not stop its immoral or even illegal behavior on the spot, but punish it afterwards?
And for the unreasonable behavior of "overlord", how can a male passenger "see unevenly" and pull it up?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police, and short-distance trains generally do not have; even if there are police, the police also pay more attention to the possible rogue reaction of the overlords and do not take compulsory evacuation measures.
The repeated hegemonic events have made people realize that they must be forcibly removed or even punished on the spot to play a deterrent effect.
This requires that our train police should dare to take strong measures in time, and that trains without police should be deployed as soon as possible to prevent and combat illegal acts in a timely manner.
On October 1, the first day of the National Day holiday, the number of vehicles in the direction of Songpan in Mao County increased sharply through Sichuan Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County.
At about 13 o'clock, the Beichuan traffic police received a call for help, saying that his family had a traffic accident in Songpan, because of the limited local medical conditions, and currently urgently need to be sent to Mianyang for treatment.

Beichuan traffic police Yuli squadron leader Wei Wei introduced that the first aid vehicle needs to be bypassed from the Tangjiashan Yanhu ring lake road, and the road is steep and narrow, in order to prevent the vehicles that have entered the section of the road in parallel, the traffic police in advance of the road from starting, middle and tail three points to implement segmented control of the vehicle, and remind all passing drivers to let the road drive one side, for the emergency vehicle wrong.
Subsequently, the police of the drum squadron also temporarily stopped the vehicle from entering the control section and queued up to let the 120 emergency vehicles that were about to arrive.
At about 15 o'clock, a Sichuan U-licensed ambulance drove into the territory of Beichuan, and the Beichuan traffic police sent a police car to drive, escorting the emergency vehicle all the way retrograde into the control section.
It is understood that there are only one cars in the area around the lake road, and the police temporarily control these places in advance to ensure the smooth passage of 120 emergency vehicles.
When he arrived at the village of Shilibei in Luping Township, there was a section of the road that could not be wrong, so the traffic police contacted the village two committees in advance, borrowed the village road to detour, and banned social vehicles from entering.
"It took only 40 minutes from the Beichuan traffic police to receive 120 emergency vehicles to enter the normal road of 302 provincial roads."
According to the normal situation, the entire passage time takes 4 hours.
"This arrangement, successfully for the patient to get valuable treatment time."

British Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday called on her party to unite to support her Brexit plan, directly calling on critics to support it, saying they wanted a free trade deal that was at the heart of her Brexit plan.
On September 30, 2018, in Birmingham, England, British Prime Minister Theresa May went to the Conservative Party meeting.
At the start of the Conservative Party's exciting annual meeting, May's plan was again slammed by two former cabinet ministers, including former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who called May's plan "disordered".
But she has also received strong support from other Brexit-backed ministers who "plaud May as one of the most polite people", with international trade minister Fox and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt pointing their anger at the EU.
May’s already fragile leadership has come under further pressure this month as the EU rejects parts of the so-called Cheques program.
But May took the talks positively, saying she was prepared to consider the EU’s concerns.
"My message to my own party is that let's work together to find the best deal for Britain," May said.
Former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called May's plan "disordered" and blasted her for not having confidence in Brexit.
He and former Brexit Secretary David Davis are pushing for a Canadian-style free trade deal with the EU.
May said the proposal would allow Northern Ireland to impose different tariff rules, which would be a division between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.

This newspaper (intern reporter Li Qiyao) in recent years, there have been many cases of unqualified campus plastic runways.
To this end, the Ministry of Education issued a notice requiring that the new national standard be implemented at the surface sports venues of synthetic materials in primary and secondary schools delivered after November 1 this year.
The mandatory national standard "Synthetic Materials surface sports venue in primary and secondary schools" is led by the Ministry of Education, and 26 scientific research institutes and testing institutions participated in the drafting, after more than two years of revision, during which more than 100 expert meetings were organized, as well as nationwide field visits and sampling tests, and collected countless verification experiments on hundreds of enterprise products on the market.
The reporter found that the new national standard not only changed from "national recommended standards" to "national mandatory standards", but also added many contents, including thickness requirements, physical properties, aging resistance, inorganic filling content requirements, non-slip grain high-polymer content requirements, surface layer finished products harmful substances limit, non-solid and solid raw materials harmful substances limit.
In particular, it is worth mentioning that the new national standard has limited the harmful substances that may be produced in the construction of the campus plastic runway, from the original 7 items to 18 items, and stipulated the limit of volatile organic compounds on the completed runway in accordance with the home improvement standards.
For example, the release of harmful substances in the "currently watered and prefabricated surface layer finished products" clearly stipulates the release of harmful substances, requiring that the total volatile organic compounds should not be higher than 5 mg/m3, formaldehyde shall not be higher than 0.4 mg/m3, carbon disulfide shall not be higher than 7 mg/m3, benzene shall not be higher than 0.1 mg/m3, and the odor level shall not be higher than 3.

To activate rural consumption, it is necessary to rely on the normalized mechanism to purify the market, guide healthy consumption demand, and enhance the sense of farmers' consumption.
Data show that the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released, and the retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5% in the first half of this year, and the growth rate was 1.3 percentage points higher than that of cities and towns.
In a poor village in the western county to visit, the whole village only a convenience store, into the store, some goods seem to know, "golden dragon fish" marked as "golden dragon oil", "Wangzi" has become "wan milk", "cottage" goods a lot.
Over the years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed, some rural fake and inferior commodity brand name, similar name, similar packaging, false chaos, is invincible.
A consumer survey report released by a city in the west shows that rural businesses have a serious problem of over-the-counter goods, and 66% of users have bought fakes in township-line supermarkets, of which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant departments to rectify the rural market, year after year, why "Li ghost" is still fighting?
Unlike the urban market, the awareness of farmers' rights protection is relatively weak, coupled with the remote location of many rural areas, and is in a blind spot where the regulatory force is not enough, so that fake and inferior goods have a breeding ground.
A commodity multi-head tube, some departments manage the price, some manage production, some manage the market, functional crossover, annual anti-counterfeiting, centralized governance of a gust of wind, fakes dodge the limelight, and slowly come out, just finished the old and fake, the new fake came out.
The lack of a long-term supervision mechanism, the rural market is difficult to purify, the cost of illegality is low, the interests are large, resulting in some illegal traders stir up the "up the mountain to the countryside" of the brain, some rural areas become the "waste market".
From food and clothing to well-off, the majority of farmers are moving towards development-oriented consumption.
A few days ago, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Several Opinions on Improving the Mechanism for Promoting Consumption System and Further Stimulating the Consumption Potential of Residents", which proposed to promote the upgrading of rural residents' consumption, with the aim of allowing the majority of farmers to "consume", "willing to consume" and "dare to consume", so that rural consumption can really flourish.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen reform, eliminate the shortcomings of market supervision and multi-faceted management, adapt to local conditions, improve food safety and product quality supervision network, and continuously reduce the space for rural counterfeiting and selling fakes.
On the other hand, it is necessary to increase law enforcement efforts, open up the supervision of "capillaries", and never allow counterfeiting and shoddy to spread in rural areas.
Severe punishment of farmers is to protect farmers, no matter how hidden the counterfeiters, should not become a reason for the breeding of fake and inferior goods, the relevant departments should be clear responsibility, grass-roots supervision forces sink, which link is a problem, we must be held accountable, so that counterfeiters have nowhere to hide.
Strictly control the market access, implement strict qualification review for production operators, close the market circulation, let the products come to the right, go to the road clear, from the source, the root to find a way, so that the legal distributor can operate with peace of mind, so that farmers can buy with confidence.
To activate rural consumption, it is necessary to guide healthy consumption demand.
With the upgrading of consumption, many farmers not only pursue to eat enough, eat well, but also pursue high-quality life such as culture and health, and cannot equate the rural market with "low quality" and "cheap".
This requires promoting the extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, unblocking urban and rural two-way linkage sales channels, promoting the combination of offline industrial development platform and online e-commerce trading platform, and supporting the expansion of new consumption formats to the rural market; promoting qualified townships to organically combine trade logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc.; improve the rural modern circulation network system, optimize the integration of existing facilities and resources, and effectively reduce rural circulation costs.
To create a clear and assured market environment for the countryside, so that farmers' consumption will not worry, rural consumption can become more and more prosperous, so as to enhance the sense of gain and happiness of farmers' consumption.

At the same time, with the reduction of the total tariff level, especially the import tariffs on drugs and consumer goods, the tax rate of import duties on imported goods has been reduced accordingly.
In order to implement the decision-making and deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, China has implemented zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported drugs since May 1 this year, reduced the import tariffs on automobiles and parts and some consumer goods from July 1, and implemented the third step of the information technology agreement to expand the products.
The reporter learned from the State Council Tariff Policy Committee that since this year, after many consecutive independent adjustments, the total level of tariffs in China will be reduced from 9.8% last year to 7.5%, with an average reduction of 23%.
Properly reducing tariffs is conducive to promoting the balanced development of foreign trade and promoting a higher level of opening up, and it is also conducive to the overall utilization of international and domestic resources and promoting the structural reform of the domestic supply side.
The relevant person in charge of the committee said that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, and the active reduction of the overall level of tariffs is to implement the practical action of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Boao Forum for Asia, and it is also an important measure for China to further expand opening up and actively expand imports according to its own high-quality development needs.
On September 29, the public brand conference of the "Huanxiang People" agricultural products in Huanxian County, Gansu Province, was held in Nankai District of Tianjin.
Red Army millet, black beans, mountain children's pastoral song black goat, hardcover buckwheat tea, paper cut shadow, pure hand slippers ... one piece of exquisitely packaged agricultural products neatly placed on the booth, they have a common brand name called "turning villagers".
"To build a 'township' regional brand, effectively solve the development bottleneck of agricultural products in Huanxian County, 'more and more scattered, small and weak', is also a powerful carrier of poverty alleviation." On the 29th, Gansu Huan County hosted the "rural people" regional public brand conference of agricultural products held in Nankai District of Tianjin.
Huan County is located at the border of the three provinces of Shaan Ganning, as the "advanced county of national food production", "hometown of small grains in China", "hometown of Chinese shadow", with a long history and rich resources.
Lamb meat, yellow rice wine, buckwheaten noodles, swallow noodles soft and soft local snacks are the taste of tourists in other hometowns.
With the continuous improvement of China's urbanization level, the urban population has increased rapidly, and a large number of rural young people have left their hometowns to start urban life.
Yang Qiaojia, a research expert on Chinese agricultural brands, said: "Now the city life is fast and stressful, more and more people begin to miss the rural life as a child, but, 'can't go back to call your hometown, the most beautiful memory is the countryside', 'hometown' brand design is named after the people of the countryside and nostalgia in the outer wandering county."
The climate conditions in Huanxian are special, the sunshine time is long, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the planting conditions of small grains are unique.
More than 20 kinds of small grains are rich in China, and the output ranks first in Gansu and the quality is in the forefront of the country.
Wang Xiaoli is a girl in Tianjin to go to school in the county, this time as a volunteer to participate in the promotion meeting, she said: "hometown people the most relatives, the taste of the hometown is the most beautiful, 'township' brand hooked up our too much nostalgia, memories, not forget it is the food there, hope that the 'township' brand more and more far away, the bigger the do."
Dr. Tan Bin, a researcher at the Scientific Research Institute of the National Food and Material Reserve Bureau, said that through the detection of more than 900 sets of index data, the detection data of buckwheat, buckwheat, black beans and other agricultural products in Huan County is prominent, and the content of many physiologically active substances of miscellaneous grains is higher than the standard data, and the "township people" have the inherent advantages of seizing the domestic high-end miscellaneous grain market.
Chai Chun, secretary of the Huan County Party Committee, said that through the release of the "Ren Township" brand, it can further improve the level of high-quality agricultural products quality, standardization and large-scale innovation and development in Huanxian County, which is conducive to shaping the overall image of Huanxian agricultural products and rapidly improving visibility, competitiveness and added value.
Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) rose 0.2% in July from the previous month, a higher than expected increase, raising expectations that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If the rate is raised, it will be the fifth time the central bank has raised its rate in a little more than a year.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters had forecast growth of 0.1 percent.
Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 of the 20 industries had achieved growth.
The data is notable because the central bank earlier this month predicted that temporary factors could drag down third-quarter GDP data.
Bank of Canada Governor Poloz on Thursday promised the central bank will continue to raise interest rates gradually and will keep a close eye on economic data.
The Bank of Canada’s next decision to announce interest rates will be on October 24.
As a result of the Canadian economy’s strengthening and unemployment is nearing a record low, the Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017.
Stephen Brown, senior Canadian economist at Capital Economics, said that the economy's third-quarter GDP growth rate is expected to reach about 2% year-on-year.
"This will be higher than the Bank of Canada's expectation of 1.5%, so it will be another reason to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month," he said in a report.
The overnight index swaps showed that the market's forecast for the Bank of Canada's October rate hike rate rose to 78.27% from 76.46%.
The first joint inspection of the Han River into the sea in the DPRK in 65 years
The South Korean Ministry of National Defense confirmed on the 5th that the ROK and the DPRK launched a joint inspection of the Han River and the Linjin River into the sea mouth waters on the same day.
The initiative is in preparation for ensuring the freedom of navigation of civilian vessels on both sides.
According to a briefing provided to the media by the South Korean Ministry of National Defense on the same day, this is the first joint inspection of the Han River into the sea since the signing of the Korean War Armistice Agreement in 1953.
The ROK signed a military agreement in September this year, and agreed to jointly visit the Han River into the sea and other waters from November to ensure the protection of the waters in the future, development and tourism.
In October, the ROK and the DPRK planned a joint waters visit at a general-level meeting.
On November 5, the joint inspection of inter-Korean waters was officially launched.
The joint delegation consists of 20 people, including the inter-Korean military and experts.
According to the South Korean Ministry of National Defense, during this visit, personnel on both sides did not carry weapons and banned the use of words and deeds that stimulated each other.
"Because there is no military demarcation line near the mouth of the sea, the area was once a surprisingly high-incidence area, but through joint inspection, it will become a new peaceful area in the future."
The waters of the joint inspection between the two Koreas are about 70 kilometers long and have a total area of about 280 square kilometers.
According to the South Korean Ministry of National Defense, the South Korean side will send six research ships to detect the depth of the seawater and provide basic information for the safe navigation of the waters; after the completion of the investigation, the navigation map will be provided for the traffic of civilian ships.
The two Koreas held a summit meeting in Pyongyang in October 2007 to reach an agreement on the joint use of the Han River and the Linjin River into the sea, but the follow-up negotiations were stranded due to tensions on the peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed by the Ronder and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in September, in the future, the ships of the two sides need to inform each other in advance before sailing in common waters.

At the same time, the Embassy assisted the family in issuing notices in Mongolia, and widely mobilized Chinese overseas Chinese and Chinese-funded enterprises to actively participate in the search for people, providing effective clues, and providing relevant assistance to a number of blue sky rescue team members who went to Mongolia to assist in rescue.
Under the strong impetus of the embassy, the Mongolian side sent a rescue team for the first time and promised to exempt the search and rescue costs.
The General Directorate of Police and the General Directorate of Emergency Situations directed the police and emergency services of the province of Kusugur to make full efforts to search and rescue.
Because Lake Kusugur is located in the northern border with Russia in northern Mongolia, is remote, sparsely populated, traffic and communication are extremely inconvenient, and at present Mongolia has entered a severe winter, the temperature is as low as minus 20 degrees, the local police and emergency departments have overcome great difficulties, mobilized almost all the police forces, and mobilized local herdsmen, through riding, walking, visiting herders, etc., to carry out carpet search and rescue around the two lost contact positions.
At the same time, in response to the special situation of pastoral areas, Monfang has been publishing notices through the radio cycle for many days.
The relevant staff of the domestic blue sky rescue team have also come to Mongolia to actively participate in the rescue with the Mongolian side.
The safety of the two missing people has always touched our hearts.
So far, the two have lost contact for more than 10 days, the embassy has received some clues, but has not found the two, the current search and rescue operations are still in the process of intense progress.
The Embassy will always continue to pay attention to this matter in accordance with the principle of "people-oriented", promote the Mongolian side to continue to search and rescue, and provide maximum assistance to the families of the parties.
The Embassy calls on compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia, if they are informed of the relevant clues, please contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia at the first time.
