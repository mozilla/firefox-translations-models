Is there a way to punish him?
In case something like this happens again.
Or how long before the restaurant is ready? Can you ask me?
Zheji's annual academic year students sing the leading role, and the results of the study open up the brain.
A series of academic work with brain holes was recognized last night at the opening of the 2016 annual academic conference at Zhejiang University.
The main researchers of these results are students, who cover a wide range of fields such as the environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life sciences and humanities education. Starting with a curious idea, students have created many high-end inventions of applied value, some of which have been awarded international awards at the national level.
Biosensors: Your home examiner
The Ph.D. of the College of Biomedicine Engineering showed a biosensor of a smartphone end, only half its size.
"You just need to breathe a little, so this device can initially detect the state of your health from the gas composition that you call out. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Zhang Deing said that the sensor was connected to a smartphone and that the health report would appear on the cell phone when the gas came out.
Smart bracelets capable of detecting health status on the market are generally detected by physical parameters such as temperature, pulse, etc.
This biosensor, in turn, uses the new material, graphite, which targets chemical elements, with a sharp “sniffing” that allows a deeper and more accurate representation of health.
Smart Surgery Lights: Doctor's High Eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights were used in operating rooms.
This invention won a silver prize at the 44th International Innovation Fair in Geneva, Switzerland, this year.
The Masters of the Faculty of Optical Sciences and Engineering, Julien and Shin Joon Fei, have opened up new thinking about the deficiencies of traditional operating lights and have invented smart LED surgery without film.
“Many early detections of diseases, cisions, are not in place and are related to the lights used by doctors in operating rooms. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Shin said that, for example, at early cancer tests, cancer cells would spread if doctors did not see all tumour tissues in time.
This smart operating light, which has four lamps, increases the difference between different tissues in light by regulating the spectrum.
During the operation, doctors can at all times adjust the size, brightness, spectrometry, colour homogeneity and no impact, depending on the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This smart operating light has been tested in hospitals affiliated with the Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Children ' s Hospital attached to the Zhejiang University Medical School.
Last October, this invention received the First Prize for the National Challenge.
Washing hands with air: saving water and cool.
While ordinary people wash their hands with water, with more soap and more handwashing, Li Kaihang and others invent a “air wash”.
We can compress the air with our weight, as long as we're on the platform.
"It's like a pump.
Compressed air forms a fluid at the tap, combined with water.
So we can wash our hands! It's not like we're going anywhere.
Visible reactions and bacterial residual experiments have shown that hand-washing through this method has the same effect as common hand-washing methods.
This device, driven only by our own gravity, can guarantee a clean-up and save 90 per cent of the water, and the entire process is completely energyless and energy-efficient.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, the invention emerged from many of the world ' s top schools with the sole gold prize.
Please arrange for me to get back, thx.
Please cancel the order and return the cash, no points, no more #PRS_ORG#!
Bones and pickles aren't for kids.
If so, hurry up, order.
Not yet, thank you.
He asked me to tell you where he was.
I'm not waiting. Cancel the order.
I bought it, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can you change it?

Yes, please.
A certificate that makes sense.
This is one of the skills I think are important in addition to my driver's license!
Universalize: First aid is an emergency response in the event of an emergency, that is, before an ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is still some time since the ambulance arrived after the accident, and it is that time that matters most.
This is when we need first aid.
If I really had a heart attack, a brain bleed, a breath stop, then the window to our lives was four minutes, four minutes gold!
That's why people around know how important it is!
It is a terrible feeling to be helpless when someone falls next to us, and we can save him through professional knowledge, rather than just standing there and doing nothing.
“In China, our official data show that 3 million people die each year by accident, the most dangerous of which is cardiac arrest.
It's an average of 15 percent that can be saved across the United States.
Seventy-eight percent of casino hotels in Las Vegas can be rescued, and Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1 percent.”
This is what Luk, the founder of the first reaction, said.
If a man's heart stops, his breath is gone, his heart beats are gone, and you strangle him without any effect.
There must be artificial respiration and an external pressure on the chest to save people.
I find that very few of us now have this awareness to study first aid, but when things happen, it is too late to do so, so I appeal to everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in a timely manner in the face of an emergency.
Maybe we can save one life!
The first aid certificate can be registered at your local Red Cross training centre. I signed up at the Red Cross training centre in Joohai.
PS: The last one is a picture of what you're going to do before you're 25 years old. It was a few months ago, but it was done!
Then I'm going to take another test, and I'm going to take a dive certificate, which I saw in Little Red's book, and I think I'm going to need a first aid certificate before I can do it.

Because it worked when I entered the code.
First of all, I personally consider the Four Seas to be a piece of shit in all its dimensions.
But you have to say that this film is not a bright spot, but it's not a good match for music.
There's a lot of pieces of crap, one that makes you sleep in a movie theater, and one that makes you look at it, and one that makes you angry. The Four Seas are like monkeys on the top of the Elephant, and it ignites your anger in countless ways.
The Korean cold is truly a gift for insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it's as if it's the creation of a novel, and it's unnameable, and it's so full of holes that it's like a windsuit on a pony.
And when you're done with it, you wonder if there's a metaphor for the director, but when you think about it, it's a piece of shit.
Let's just say a few things I hardly understand.
The male master's residence should be on a small island in the south, depending on his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the scene arranged for one of the neighbors to take her to the northeast in a minivan.
An old man in a van from south to northeast to watch the snow?
He and his father were very relieved.
Then the old man is gone.
How did her brother get a license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why did the island's motorists block a mountain road so easily?
The truck carrying steel bars in the middle of the road then stopped at the side of the road and could not find the truck driver.
It's too obvious.
Why would a small gang of gangsters who cannot draft letters and are suspected of violating the law become an auxiliary?
Why didn't the police call the police in front of the loan shark?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but who doesn't know how to open the door with a card at a hotel and then forced himself to find the hotel owner and sleep outside the door?
This inexplicable plot is all over the film, and it pains me when I recall it because it is so disproportionate.
Apart from the plot, what is worse is the main thrust of the film, or the fact that it has no theme at all, is an obnoxious suture.
At the beginning of the film you think he wants to make a comedy film, and in more than 20 minutes you think it might be an inspirational film, and half the time you see it, you don't know what you're looking at, and then you wonder why you're going to the cinema to see shit.
And for most people, it's quite familiar with all kinds of movies, like if you want to film a motorcycle player, you're going to have a comedy and you're going to tell the audience how a talented rookie is going to make it.
If you want to make a love movie, you're gonna be honest about the problems between young people and waitresses who like to ride motorcycles.
If you want to reflect reality, then the least you can do is not have something against the normal world.
If Yoon's new motorbike had just been burned and then he could sing, he wouldn't be able to open some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't see.
As to the fact that she's not retarded in some way, she acts like a five-year-old, I don't know if that's why she's acting or what the director wants.
And one thing I don't understand, why is Han Chiu so eager to add crashes to his own film as a racer?
Is this film in the Spring Festival?

Check the production and processing equipment for the well concrete module.
Zheng Jie-hyun is a producer of domestic concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, inspection of well block mechanics, mechanical specializing in well wall wall module modules, from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
Through many years of practice and development, it is now available to produce hydraulic, mobile, fully automated well-screened equipment and ancillary devices.
Inspection of production and processing equipment for the well concrete module
Check the characteristics and advantages of the well concrete module production equipment in Zhengzhou.
(c) To examine new construction materials for the construction of municipal structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, gas, etc., which are widely used in well-built brick machines.
Examples include: drainage, water storage facilities, various inspection wells, water outlets, ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of the concrete module for the construction of inspection wells lies in the condensed structure of the upper and lower sections of the module, which combine to form chains.
The walls of the well wall are much more resistant to shearing than the form of building of a smooth friction structure.
The module is a medium-empty structure, which combines vertical holes that are connected, horizontal holes that are consistent and, when the core is injected, forms an existing network of concrete, providing secondary reinforcement and waterproofness.
The modules are vertically and vertically equipped with a trough, with horizontal and vertical cramps that increase the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, inspection wells, drainage wells, which are constructed using concrete inspection well modules, are not susceptible to collapse, sinking, leaking, etc., and the wall wall module is mechanically stable, operating in a simple manner and of a size standard.
The concrete inspection of the well modular brick device is equipped with data input, the output device is a touch-through liquid crystal shows the entire process of monitoring the machine, achieving the desired human dialogue, automatic analysis of the beam, density operation, security logical control and failure diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall wall module uses single-cylinder hydraulic pressure, transport, double-cylinder hydraulic pressure and transport.
An independent hydraulic integration station avoids the effect of the host vibration on the hydraulic system, thereby ensuring the reliability of the operation of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection of the well module brick equipment equipment module was accompanied by a demodelling of the container, the storage box door was closed and the automatically delivered tray was all independently completed by the hydraulic system, thereby reducing mechanical wear and maintenance.
Concrete inspection well modular brick equipment uses imported computers, electrical appliances, sealed hydraulics, and quasi-secured equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical resonance platform of the well wall wall module uses steel as a whole, and the surface line cuts the mosaics without welding points, making the filling boxes free to swing and fully reducing mechanical wear and tear.
To reduce the load of the moulds, fill them with two encrypted amplitudes, using integrated, fully synchronized, pulsing and emulation to ensure that the oscillation effect is achieved.
Mechanical irritation mechanisms for the well wall wall module, computer auto-control amplitudes, which adjust the amplitude on the basis of the raw material value ratio, are without wear and tear, thus extending the useful life and reducing costs.
The dual function of mechanical control and manual control of the wall wall module.

Chongqing Secondary School piloting modern apprenticeships.
Yesterday, journalists were informed by the Municipal Education Council that, as of this year, our city will pilot a “modern apprenticeship” model in 60 secondary schools, and that students under the pilot training system will also have apprenticeship status, and that the enrolment will be pre-recorded as unit employees.
The Municipal Education Council requires that the admission and employment procedures for secondary schools be regulated, that the dual status of students and employees of enterprises in secondary schools for apprenticeships be clarified, and that, in accordance with the principle of two-way choice, tripartite agreements be concluded between apprentices, schools and enterprises. In the case of apprentices who have reached the age of 16 and who have not reached the age of 18, a tripartite agreement must be concluded between apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the specific positions, contents, rights and interests of the parties and of apprentices in training.
Pilot schools are encouraged to use modern apprenticeship forms and joint enterprise pre-service and transfer training.
The pilot schools need to reform the talent development model.
Schools design training programmes jointly to develop professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation programmes.
The pilot is based on the development of a culture system for a pilot cycle in which the duration of a student ' s internship in an enterprise is determined on the basis of a professional training programme, which normally lasts six months.
In the practice of enterprises, a business grouping management model should be implemented, whereby a teacher, depending on his or her specialization, can bring two to five students to form study groups to ensure that students are skilled in the skills required for each of the rotating training positions.
Under the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, three groups of 60 municipal mid-level modern apprenticeships were identified, each with about 50 people, bringing together some 3,000 students (apprenticeships).
In accordance with the principle of piloting and gradual implementation from point to point, long-term mechanisms have been explored for joint enrolment, joint training and integration in schools, effective upgrading of students ' job skills and improvement of student employment and quality of employment.

The Chinese Children's Centre will organize a series of events to get children to pass "Six One" - Xinhua Network
On 20 May in Beijing, a reporter from Xinhua News Agency (Hwang Xiaoxie Zhou Sanshan) learned from the China Children's Centre that around the “sixty-one” Children's Day from 28 May to 1 June, the China Children's Centre plans to organize a series of events, such as the children's creative experience, the children's festival of visual arts, and the children's book festivities, which will allow children to spend “sixty-one” in the charm of cutting-edge technology.
The activities of the China Children's Centre this year during the “sixty-one” Children's Day are known to include the “Face of Love” Children's Future Learning Carnival, the first Children's Festival of Visual Arts, the “Book and Xanax” Festival, and the “Family Love to Read” drawing series.
Li Zhongming, Deputy Director of the Chinese Children's Centre, presented at the 2016 “sixty-one” Children's Day Media Intense at the 20th Children's Day Conference, saying that the “Friendly family Zhao” Children's Future Learning Carnival was the focus of this year's Chinese Children's Centre's “sixty-one” celebration.
The aim is to integrate social innovation with individual family creativity, to experience innovative educational activities through the participation of children and families, to make innovative practices the cultural gene of the general family, and to “do it” the new learning and way of life of families.
According to the information received, the “Face of Love” children's future learning carnivals include several dozen cutting-edge technological experiences such as the soybean creators experience, the ox children's explorer's anniversary and the “Exploring the family to love children through the sixty-first” event, the VR national experience programme, and the “Creating Band” interactive workshop.

South African doctor: Omikron is highly contagious, but mostly light.
According to many doctors and medical experts in South Africa, the disease of the new coronary virus, Omikon, is the proportion of the disease Delta variants are even lighter, although they spread faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of Omikian variants in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors from Hauden Province, South Africa, reported that the symptoms of new crown patients they were currently treating were mild, such as physical pain and flu-like symptoms such as cough.
Dr. Unben Pillay, Director General of the organization, said that he visited dozens of patients every day, but no patients were required to be hospitalized.
According to Pillay: “They can control disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation. It's not like it's a bad idea.
He stated that this included elderly patients and those with health problems, who would have been more likely to be seriously affected by coronary virus infection.
In contrast, he said, in the first wave of the Delta outbreak, the new crown patient he treated “respiration difficulties and low levels of blood oxygen.
Many will be hospitalized in a few days."
Similar experiences have been shared by other doctors in the two weeks following the first report of the Omikron strain in Southern Africa.
While it would take several weeks to collect sufficient data, doctors ' observations and early evidence provided some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30 per cent of new crown patients who have been hospitalized in recent weeks are severely ill, which is half the rate of the previous outbreak; the average length of hospitalization has been reduced from 8 to 2.8 days; and only 3 per cent of new crown patients who have recently died, compared with 20 per cent of early outbreak cases in South Africa.
The Director of the African Institute of Health, Willem Hanekom, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports: “At present, almost all indications indicate that this is a milder disease. It's not like it's a bad idea.
And he said, "It's still early. We need later data.
Usually, hospitalizations and deaths take place late, and we have only two weeks to enter the epidemic. It's not like it's a bad idea.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
While Delta remains the world ' s leading new crown strain, the Omikron case is emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the centre of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases detected in the first week of December in the province of Holden increased by 400 per cent, with tests showing that over 90 per cent of the Omikron variants were found.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes are out!

Educational Times Review: What is the basis for saving abducted children?
If there is a well-known public service advertisement, such as “no killing without buying or selling”, in the absence of a favourable environment for the demand for “abduction”, such crimes will not be repeated in the absence of “abduction”, where crowd control, popular anti-trafficking will render trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly.
In recent days, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security has launched an emergency information platform on the disappearance of children, which has been developed.
It is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the dissemination of information on children ' s disappearance and to recover abducted children in a timely manner.
This app is known as the "reunification" and is extremely warm.
The new technology is not only called “artistic”, full of affection, but also well-utilized, practical and effective.
The primary objective of law enforcement is to recover the abducted child and to protect his or her physical integrity and liberty.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, ranging from individual punishments, social prevention and legal education, can be cited as many “words”.
However, priority should be given to the physical safety of victims before trafficking cases could be solved.
Prioritization, under the urgent “savour-seeking” purpose, could be postponed and carefully discussed on controversial topics such as “whether or not child trafficking should always be punishable by death”; however, the rescue of abducted children should not be allowed.
According to the investigative experience of such cases, traffickers are used to stay away from the place where the crime was committed as soon as they were able to do so.
One more minute of delay in tracing children may be one step further away from their parents, and the difficulty of detection increases by one point.
In this context, it is indeed a pragmatic exercise to come up with effective methods, such as the “reunification” platform, that directly contribute to the detection of cases and the recovery of children.
After all, “trafficking” is a big task that needs to be done by operating the entire legal system.
The fight against crime, the protection of children's and parents' rights and interests, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary and the thoroughness of the administration of justice, does not require “child-care” care.
Moreover, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, could be done better.
In a common case, for example, three people were resting at a train station and their parents slept and woke up and found their children missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but, as a parent of a young child, should have at least a considerable sense of protection.
The rotation of the rest of the parents or the placement of the child under sound protection are the minimum means of preventing child abduction.
The purchase of abducted children should also be noted and punished on the other side of the police fight against trafficking.
Individual wrongful acts are often only part of a long chain.
According to our Penal Code, the legal starting point for the offence of trafficking in children is five years; in particularly serious cases, the death penalty may be imposed and property confiscated.
The crime of abduction and trafficking of children is clearly a more serious offence in the light of the trend towards “light penalization” of high sentences and maximum sentences.
But there are still many cases of trafficking each year.
As can be seen, some people are backward and less aware of the law in terms of parenting.
Legal education for this segment of the population should be pursued simultaneously.
Effective control of the crime of trafficking cannot be achieved through strict official law enforcement alone.
If the “market” is widespread, traffickers are motivated, new methods of trafficking are constantly being developed, and a “lawful” situation with law enforcement officials is created, and kidnappings are bound to become ineffective.
Thus, overcoming backwardness and spreading legal literacy also help to combat the crime of trafficking and the purchase of children.
Yang Ho-dong gave a lecture on the spirit of the 19th Plenum of the Party and the Provincial Council at Marseille Hill.
Drawing strength from the party's biennia of struggle.
On the morning of 10 December, in accordance with a unified provincial council arrangement, the Hunan daily newspaper (all-media journalist Gunpawe) gave an interactive presentation to Yang Hodong, Minister of Public Information of the Provincial Council, in the context of the creation of a video book on the Hill of Mars, in order to follow up on the spirit of the 19th plenary session of the Party, to follow up on the important instructions given by the General Secretary of Xi Jinping to Hunan and to follow up on the spirit of the twelfth provincial party congress.
Yang Hodong, in his vision and in his original mission, his own self-revolution and the theory of the Great Youth Party, his party leaders and his party, shared his own awareness and personal experience, and elaborated in a comprehensive and systematic manner the core imperatives and practical requirements of the spirit of the plenary.
He pointed out that the spirit of the plenary and the important instructions given by the General Secretary of Xi to Hunan, the spirit of the Provincial Council, were to be combined, to be integrated, to be integrated, to be strengthened in the defence of the “two-building” and “two-maintenance” thinking, political self-consciousness, and self-consciousness to act, were to be firmly guided by the General Secretary of Xi.
During the interactive session, representatives of grass-roots cadres, business representatives and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive meaning of the “two-buildings”, how cultural enterprises were guided, how young people of the new age could draw their strength from the biennia of the party, and how Yang Ho-dong was able to respond with the usual language and lively examples. He was eager to send a message to Al-Shabaab, drawing on the biennia of the party's struggle, drawing on the strength of progress, uniting closely around the party's centre, staying steadfastly behind, writing responsibilities and responsibilities with his youth.
Beijing Higher Education Graduates in 2022 are expected to reach 268,000 - Xinhua Network
On 11 December, a journalist in Beijing (journalist Yana), Xinhua, learned from a recent video conference on employment entrepreneurship among Beijing graduates, held jointly by the Beijing City Education Council and the Beijing City Human Resources and Social Security Board, that 268,000 students were expected to graduate in Beijing in 2022, an increase of 16,000 over last year.
The relevant head of the Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Institute indicated that employment of Beijing graduates would be deployed in areas such as strengthening the matching of supply and demand, strengthening policy support, widening access to employment, ensuring access to difficult jobs, supporting innovative entrepreneurship and improving service effectiveness.
The journalists learned that the Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Board will set up a platform of practice to increase job availability, proactively reach out to 40 university graduates at their workplace experience bases, visit employers and consolidate information on demand and jobs; focus on “six groups”, i.e. expanding the recruitment of enterprises, expanding the recruitment of State-owned enterprises, expanding the recruitment of grass-roots projects, expanding the recruitment of conscripts, retaining a larger number of employment trainees, expanding entrepreneurship for employment; and implementing a “life-long approach” dynamic management, recommending not less than five jobs for each graduate and ensuring that 100 per cent of those in difficult families who wish to work are assisted.
Actually, I don't know if it was the shop or the rider.
There's no papers on the bag.
I can't.
I hope you understand.
Because it's 30 minutes faster than it shows.
No, thanks.
Yes, we have a new rider.
He's been waiting a long time.
The restaurant always said it was in the process.
I waited hours.
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories, namely, Virgin Olive Oil and Olive Oil, and five levels.
The first extraction of olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the fat derived from the removal of foreign matter through mechanical cold extraction, filtering and so forth, directly from fresh olive fruit.
Depending on the acidity, there are three levels:
Extra Virgin: The highest quality olive oil and pure natural products.
It's delicious, and it's fragrance, and acidity does not exceed 1%.
Fine Virgin: The acidity is slightly higher, but not more than 2% and tastes pure and aromatic.
Ordinary primary olive oil (Ordinary Virgin): Tastes and flavors are good and acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oils are olive oils derived from the refining of primary olive oils of more than 3.3 per cent acidity, or become “secondary oils”.
The refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Ordinary olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil mixed with a percentage of primary olive oil to reconcile taste and colour with acidity of less than 1.5% and transparent light yellow.
Refined olive impurity or olive fruit oil: olive oil extracted from the oil sludge and refined through dissolution.
You should have found that acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olive fruit is like grapes made of wine, and olive fruit from different production areas, different varieties of olive fruit produces different standards of olive oil.
The best place for olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for olive oil growth, solar radiation, air moisture and precipitation.
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast, it is only sporadically grown in living areas.
Main area of production (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc. have similar climates to those of Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc., which are well south latitudes.
Oil olive harvesting month:
In March-June of each year, it is time for olive trees to bloom, and in July-October the fruit begins to grow and mature, moving from green to red, purple and finally black.
The period from November to February is the fruit harvest season (the freshness of olive oil is important).
Nutritional component of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in single unsaturated fatty acids, i.e., oilic acids and sub-oilic acids, subsalphate, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to have been found so far to be the most suitable for human nutrition.
Democracy summit is over. Byden says the fire of freedom never goes out.
The online “Democracy Summit” convened by US President Biden and attended by 110 governments worldwide, as well as civil society and private sector leaders, ended on Friday, December 10.
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom was burning in the hearts of everyone in the world and that authoritarian regimes could never put it out.
He also indicated that the second Global “Democracy Summit” is planned for next year.
Representatives of the Government of Taiwan, Councillor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activists currently in exile in the United Kingdom also addressed the Summit the following day.
And Biden said, "We know how hard the work before us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because as I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
A totalitarian regime can never extinguish the fire of freedom, burning in the hearts of people around the world and around the world. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Biden also stated that the defence of democracy required the joint efforts of society as a whole.
“As leaders of the Government, it is our responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the pillars of democracy, to promote reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to the forces of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest.” It's not like it's a bad idea.
The second day of the “Democracy Summit” was devoted to the defence of human rights, the consolidation of democracy and opposition power, and the fight against digital powerism and affirmation of democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks on the same day, Secretary-General Guterres also stated that the cause of democracy was facing global challenges, particularly those posed by emerging digital technologies.
He said, “It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, combating corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Hong Kong ' s democracy and human rights activists, Rook Chung, addressed the Summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding participants of their ongoing concern about the human rights situation of Chinese minorities, such as Hong Kong and Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: “The world has long accepted the rise of China without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. It's not like it's a bad idea.
He also called on the free world to unite against the threats of the Communist Party.
He said, “Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Xi, and perhaps some of you do not want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps some of you are unaware of the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. It's not like we're going anywhere.
In a round-table discussion on “Combating digital dictatorship, affirming democratic values”, Taiwan's Councillor Tang Feng issued a State statement via video highlighting Taiwan as the front line in the fight against dictatorship and power.
He also shared experiences on how to combat the new epidemic through transparency of information and building mutual trust.
He said: “As Taiwan's democracy flourishes, we remain firmly on the front lines of global confrontation against authoritarianism and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, global democracy showed signs of regression when powerful Governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests.
In Taiwan, however, we do not have to seal the city to control the epidemic, and we do not have to go down to defeat false information. It's not like it's a bad idea.
As the agenda for the second day of the “Democracy Summit” proceeded, the United States Treasury Department announced that 15 individuals, 10 entities from several countries, including China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, had been legally sanctioned for serious human rights violations and that investment restrictions had been imposed on a Chinese company that had been found to be using surveillance techniques to assist in human rights violations.
It's already taken and uploaded to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying delivery.
#Number#
Anyway, I won't.
No more.
I will complain.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
I waited so long for you.
No, I didn't get it.
Tell him to send it back to our company.
I don't want to wait.
One meal for an hour and a half.

I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel?
Hello. The sip chicken from the restaurant is raw.
I wanted to try tennis, but I was afraid I wouldn't make it, so I wanted to find a similar price.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices tend to be proportional to the level of friendship, and if they cannot be distinguished, then the normal situation is more friendly than cheap beats, which are actually industrial waste.
They're low-intensity, the ball hits the beat, they're very vibrating, they're hard, they're hard to handle.
The logic and subtext of their existence is -- you can't learn tennis, you know you can't buy it, you can't buy it, you can't play it twice, so it's cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you're getting better, and then I'll buy the expensive ones, and I'll make twice.
It's recommended to pay a similar price, buy a better second-hand bat, choose prince, or Dunlop. These two brands are bad enough, so they can't sell. 500 or 600 is good.
It's nice to starters, but after the start-up stage, most people, especially girls, can't get past the start-up stage.
Orders have been delayed several times
Would you mind following up?
Postponement
Thank you.
So, actually, I already have the credit?
Do I need to reorder next? Did you ignore that one?
Hello, I ordered food for this restaurant, but there's a lot of lack of food for delivery, and the saliva chickens are raw.

Hello, how long will it take to order?
I'm closed.
Your biker number is #PHONEUMBER#, called #NAME#
Please give me a reasonable answer.
Yes, but your rider's got a problem. Please handle it.
Can you check if it's still on the way? If you can, it's best to deliver it.
OK, if you don't have it, return the order.
In fact, there is much to be said about girls who are obese.
The dress of a chubby girl cannot be too short or too long, almost in length on her knees, just enough to cover her thighs.
If the dress is too short, the fat on the leg will be revealed.
It's too long to give people the feeling of being short and fat.
If you're wearing a three-part split, it's natural that you're getting taller. It's a different color for tops, skirts, and stockings, and it looks like you're getting longer.
In fact, many dark-coloured clothes are the hallmarks of obese girls (which the author knows very well), and dark-coloured colours are a good way of covering up your obese body.
Put on some dark-coloured clothes, especially black skirts, and you'll feel a little thinner.
If your calf is fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too much attention.
The more popular the better, the less colorful.
In order to avoid the feeling of obesity when people look at your legs and feet.
It is important that girls who are slightly chubby are given the know-how to wear clothes.
A chubby girl should never wear a tight skirt, and it would be uncomfortable to have a short shirt or a short dress. If her legs are thick, she should wear a black stocking or a net stocking, and she should choose a nice soft bouquet, with a dirty shirt, to cover up the situation of a fat girl.
Of course, chubby girls are good at wearing short skirts.
If a fat girl wears a short skirt, she should choose a shirt that corresponds to the colour of the short skirt, which will increase the height of your fat body.
Short skirts with high heels make your legs look much longer. It's the best match of summer.
If you're fat, but with thin legs, you're recommended for fancy short skirts.
Not only can you cover your belly, but you can show your merits.
The " A " short skirt would be thinner and more suitable for a fat girl, and the shirt would have to be more tight and the sense of hierarchy would have to be thinner.
A simple one-white T-shirt with short skirts can be tried by a fat MM.
Fat girls can also wear fashion.
If you have the right rules to dress together, it'll be a big focus for fat girls.
After a change in the combination of clothes, you have to exercise your life to get rid of the label of a chubby girl.

Xinghua All-China + Beijing Youth Hockey League to fuel the winter zeal - Xinhua Network

The girl as a target raised money for her sister:
A girl in Hangzhou Martial Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words “human target, $10 one arrow”.
Yesterday morning, a photo of the Hangzhou girl "Gang Dynasty" raising money for her sister "bite her" broke the circle of friends.
It shows that a girl from Wulin Square, Hangzhou, standing in front of a board slightly higher than a man's, with the words “human target, ten dollars, one arrow” written on it, can fire with bows and arrows after payment by the indicative roadman.
This has triggered a lot of debate.
Last night, the head of propaganda at the Lower City Division of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the news reporter Shinjing that the police had confirmed that the girl had made such excesses for her sister, but that such excesses were not worth promoting, and that she had left the local police station yesterday after being warned.
The girl's street archer collection was warned.
On the Internet, a long-haired girl stood in front of a large plank with a black ink on the board with the words “human target, ten dollars, one arrow”, with her bank account and micro-letter, payment treasure account, etc.
The image has been controversial since it went online.
Some netizens think that this is a “booby-eyed begging” and many sympathize with it.
“We discovered when patrolling the square around 10 a.m., 23 a.m., when the crowd was already full. It's not like it's a bad idea.
In an interview with the local media, the civilian police at Tian Shui police station near the site of the incident stated that two girls, all around 20 years old, were dressed up to look good.
Among them, the girl who was a “human target” had been crying and begging for a little bit of the game; the other girl, who was drinking on the side, said that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in dire need of surgery.
“We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for the treatment of her sister's leukemia. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Last night, the head of propaganda of the lower city bureau of the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau told the news reporter that the girl was Ji Jia Li, who raised funds for her sister.
However, this was done because treatment still required more than 300,000 dollars and it was unexpected that a good way of raising funds would be forthcoming.
He stated that during the entire process, two girls were targeted and one was responsible for shooting but was not involved, and that no arrows were found during the entire process, except that they were surrounded and photographed on Twitter.
The arrows and arrows used by the police are not subject to control.
The officer-in-charge stated that “not to promote this kind of eyeball collection”.
She left the police station after being warned by the police.
Dispersion effect: good lightness: ease of appearance material: satisfactory macros always have a high value for money.
The new machine is very good.
It's stable. Four vents are cool.
It's a good game for the Big Shadow Dragon.
The price of the Monopoly Knight Dragon is not expensive.
Personally, the Magnificent Shadow Dragon is really good, the game effect: the game works well, playing most of the games, I eat all the chickens with a stable frame rate, very smooth, and even less so, CSgo can play most of the threea games.
Thermal effect: The heat is good, the fan is strong, the work is quiet, the game is full of fans.
Appearance: It's pretty cool. Game book pulls.
It's really good to buy notebooks, mainly for design, which is much cheaper than you think, and it's better-looking than you think. Red on the ass is a very good-looking color of wine, but not so cheesy, it's much higher than expected, well worth buying, and it suits girls.
It took two years to get into touch with the Hong Ki Night Knight, and it's a high-priced, too high a quality!
I've recommended all my friends to buy this product!
So far, three machines in this series have been purchased!
It's beautiful. It's very well configured.
He bought it for his nephew, who wanted to wait for the 418s, so he bought it in advance, so it's a pity he didn't catch up with the big ones.
But it's expensive, and logistics is fast.
It's a brand-new original. It's a very expensive playbook. It's got a great design.
Shows the effect: I bought a kid to do a 3D rendering, the software was installed, the kid said it was okay to use, the computer to do a 3D design.
For the son, he said it was good.
Computers are fine, especially when they're nice. Just ask questions.
Not bad. The quality of the game is real.
What's hotter in 2021?
No doubt the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympicians get prizes?
There was a "Look! The project manager's "Olympics Project" article, which speaks of many projects in which project managers are absolutely one-size-fits-all, and no one can do it: lifting bricks, travelling on business, spending the night is the day-to-day job of the project manager, especially when it comes to fighting fires, taking the fall, making apologies.
An article that appeared to be a joke, however, also revealed the daily bitterness of the project managers, behind which the current project management effort was reflected.
For their part, those working on project management have increasingly opted for actions to get themselves out of their work.
An increasing number of project management practitioners are learning to upgrade their project management capacity, based on the number of PMPs (internationally certified project management professional qualifications) registered each year.
According to China ' s Twenty-Year Development Report on Project Management (1999-2019), as of September 2019, there were nearly 600,000 cumulative PMP examinations nationwide, around 420,000 certified through PMP, and about 300,000 valid holders, or 31.2 per cent of the total number of PMP licences worldwide.
The growing number of PMP holders over the last 10 years indicates that a growing number of project managers are aware that it is no longer desirable to do things by simply replicating their old “old experience” and that a rapidly changing work environment allows us to learn a way forward by standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
However, did the PMP test ensure unimpeded project management?
Many project management beginners have indicated that, while learning related courses, such as PMP/IPMP, provides systematic access to relevant knowledge points such as the 10 areas and the five process groups of project management, the actual project management exercise is still cloudy.
(c) Lack of systematic project management process system support, inaccessibility, poor project estimates, poor control sensitivity and delays in projects;
As a result, more than a dozen projects focusing on product innovation and R & D management have helped a large number of good firms to develop a large number of key R & D talent, such as product managers and project managers, and have received the prestigious China-China Enterprise Research & Development Management Training Model Base and so on.
The R & D Project Manager ' s online course is a kind of online fragmentation learning approach that combines many of the operational cases, tools and methodologies of R & D enterprises to help you develop the necessary knowledge and standard actions of the project manager to move forward in the management of your project.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to contribute to the process of developing project managers with lower costs and fewer inputs to bring about efficient operational results.
This course is not just an expert team from China, China (formerly the R & D management team), but an in-depth professional presentation of its content in the context of international advanced project management methodology and the real business landscape of many well-known enterprises.
It also provides scientifically useful management tools and methods, with a rich template to help participants translate the content of their studies into specific work after the course.

On the eve of the Twilight Twelve, promoting rational consumption to consumers - Economic Watch - Professional Financial News.
This year, the National Network of Carnivals paid $1.7 trillion in business transactions, which is higher than in previous years.
Consumers are once again benefiting from a large variety of red-packed, hard-to-hearing live tapes, a consumption boom that, on the one hand, exaggerates the growing strength of national consumption and, on the other hand, has to calm down and reflect on the impact of consumerism on society and on contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of the “two dozen” Quest Consumer Finance Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “the Quest”) launched a rational consumption initiative to alert users, especially young people, to good consumption awareness and habits and to reject blind and excessive consumption.
According to the report of the People ' s Bank on the analysis of the consumer financial literacy survey published this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
In general, our population is performing well at the level of financial consumption, but there is considerable variation in financial behaviour and skills, and there is a need to further upgrade basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy levels of older persons and adolescents are relatively low, and “one year and one year” will remain the focus of sustained attention in financial education; Nelson's Report on the Status of Young People's Debts in China and the China Youth Consumption Report 2019-2020, published by China's Economic and Social Council, show that the younger generation has great consumption potential, credit consumption is an important way of upgrading consumption, 86.6 per cent of young people are using credit products, nearly half of them have no debt accumulation, and while the younger generation as a whole has a rational consumption trend that is quite different from the external label of “exhausture”, some young people do have overconsumption, followed wind consumption behaviour and therefore have excessive financial pressures and debt risks, which have even led to an increase in social problems.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, the Quakers have been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with quality and thoughtful services, advocating for good and correct consumer perceptions and responding positively to regulatory calls for practical action to raise consumer awareness of rational consumption, especially among young people.
Over the past several years, the Quakers have been carrying out comprehensive and diversified financial literacy campaigns for young people, including university students, and have helped them to accumulate their wealth through a variety of ways of insulating the consumption needs of young people through a competition for innovative practices in cooperation with the country ' s leading institutions.
On the occasion of the arrival of the twelfth, the letter reminded all friends of consumers to develop a reasonable sense of consumption and a proper view of money, to resist blind and overconsumption and to circumvent consumption-lending misperceptions so as not to affect personal letters and future economic life.
Consumption must be planned well in advance and repaid on time in a quantitative manner.
If overdue, late records will be recorded in individual credit reports, which may have a negative impact on economic life, such as future purchases of cars, houses, etc.
At the same time, access to financial goods and services should be accompanied by the choice of formal institutions and channels, and care should be taken to verify that the relevant institutions are qualified to operate.
In the future, it will, as always, build on its mature, reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated financial products to provide consumers with more responsive and diversified services, continuously help raise the level of financial literacy and help consumers to develop rational consumption, moderate lending, and become lifelong consumer financial partners.
I'm not going.
I'm pressing the delivery order.
This is an hour when no one calls me. It's an online fraud.
You think I ordered the first takeout?
That's what you said after the investigation! I checked the address a few times before I made the order.
Okay, thanks. How many days was that?
Viet Nam People ' s Network - Gulf Cooperation Council to address common challenges
The stopovers of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this was the first time that Crown Prince Mohammed had visited Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
During this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations while maintaining close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab States have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf States signed an agreement between the United States and Kuwait to mediate towards “unity and stability”.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its borders with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors by both countries in Qatar.
The Arab States of the Gulf resolve their differences in order to restore their relations with Qatar out of the need to unite in the interests of all countries and for regional stability in order to meet common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the parties agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
A 725-kilometre-long corridor linking the two countries will facilitate the movement of citizens of both countries and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman and 13 memorandums of understanding for cooperation worth $30 billion have been signed between enterprises in both countries.
The Saudi Crown Prince’s visit to the Gulf States coincided with the negotiations between Iran and the world’s major powers on the Iranian nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was condemned by the Arab Gulf countries as failing to resolve the issue of Iran’s missiles.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term “competition” and Iran’s nuclear program as a “threat” to regional security.
The Gulf States consider it flawed not to address the issue of Iranian missiles and not to act to curb Iran ' s activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia had entered into direct negotiations with Iran against the background of the failure of the major Powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf States in their nuclear negotiations.
The objective is to contain the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing economic growth in the GCC countries.
The forthcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of GCC States since the end of the dispute between some member States and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic gains that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully in meeting common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

Okay.
It's called New Mountain.
This car our team brought you is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship, Murcielago's replacement LP 700-4!
For nearly $2 million, a year's road tax of 10 thousand, 4x4. Why LP 700?
How fast can you imagine with 700 horses?
Nor is it known that the data says that 0-100 km/h acceleration takes 2.9 seconds, and that it's probably only about 30 km/h that I'm getting to 100 km/h.
The low body of the car, the pompous scissors door, the huge vents of gas all around it, and the endless 6.5 v12 engine of glass give a perfect interpretation of Lamborghini.
You don't have to tell me much about the car. Just google.
Too much attention, everyone's watching everywhere. It's uncomfortable! It's actually kind of cool.
1 km of oil is around R.M. 1
Get in and get out of the car, practice, or it'll be a little awkward.
The engine is too loud to be deaf. But it's still good.
It's too big to park in a normal parking space, and I'm afraid I'll knock when the next car opens!
It's a little lonely because there's no rival on the road.
Don't get me wrong. This video's not for sale. Sorry!
Friends who want to film your car, welcome to us!

Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that all of our carmates know Chiron is one of the world's most expensive runners, and Porsche 911 is worth millions!

Look at the results, it makes sense!
Resonance between the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times - Xinhua Network
The university spirit is a set of concepts and values that have long built up in the development of a university and that are the soul of the university.
From time immemorial, university spirit has been crucial for political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological development, social development and, indeed, the advancement of a people.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, the university has assumed a unique mission distinct from that of other social organizations. For our university, it has emerged from a time of national distress, and its spirit has been greatly influenced by traditional culture and the changing times, advocating the values of “Mindezian, Ziquis” and the patriotism of “enhanced states”.
At present, the trend towards informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly evident, with global competition in education, science and technology, and talent, with higher education as an important “supply side” facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges for structural change.
In particular, the launch of the General Programme for the Integrated Advancement of the World's Top Universities and First Class Studies, while demonstrating our confidence and determination to move from a major to a powerful State of higher education, places a higher demand for university development.
How can we, in a relatively short period of time, try to join the popular ranks of the world by accelerating the construction of several world-class universities and a group of world-class disciplines, based on a certain gap?
In addition to being committed to self-confidence, road confidence, and self-confidence, higher education institutions should fully exploit three advantages: first, to achieve a significant improvement in academic standards and the quality of their work through the continuous introduction of outstanding academic talent from abroad, learning from the best of the world ' s universities; second, to build on the wisdom of the Chinese civilization, which has accumulated over 5,000 years, and to promote the development of an excellent traditional culture as a means of cohesiveness, branding and image-raising; and third, to build on the institutional advantage, the institutional superiority of socialist countries, the strengthening of goals, the pooling of consensus, the optimal allocation of resources and the provision of sustainable and solid guarantees for schools to speed up to the advanced levels of the world.
It is particularly important to recognize that the construction of a world-class university cannot take place on a one-year basis, and that the advantages of each school must be accompanied by an identity and identity.
The special features of schools are both common to China and reflect their unique targeting, tradition and resource endowments.
In the case of the University of Zhejiang, we have focused on three areas: first, highlighting the development of innovative entrepreneurship, creating an integrated human environment for the integration of science and learning, and creating a chain-wide ecosystem of entrepreneurship education; second, highlighting the cross-cutting nature of the discipline, promoting the optimization of the discipline system, creating a cross-disciplinary institutional environment and actively fostering cross-cutting and emerging disciplines and emblematic cross-cutting outcomes; and third, highlighting the special features of the school system and social services, developing in-depth international communication and cooperation to accelerate the development of a pan-Zheonian system of cooperation in research and development.
In this process, it is particularly important to remain committed to the spirit of the University and to resonate with the spirit of the times.
For the University of Zhejiang, the newest expression of Zhejiang’s spirit is based on the common values of Zheine, Shudeh, Visible, Visible, and Heine River.
This is an important guarantee for the schools to maintain the proper course of schooling and to build up a high cultural and spiritual strength, which is rich and far-reaching.
Among them, the “Henna River” emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, as reflected in the spirit of “the talent of the world for me”, which draws on the high-quality ideas of the world's famous schools for the education of human beings; The “Culture of truth” emphasizes the spirit of truth and goodness, which means that universities, while pursuing truth, should be more guided by virtue of virtue's pottery and personality; The “people before the beginning” embodies a spirit of change and innovation that embraces the newness of knowledge, scientific innovation and development as well as reform and renewal; The “Student of the Tree State” emphasizes the spirit of patriotism, which states that universities should always be humiliated with the destiny of their nation.
This set of spiritual ideas and values is the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
"Hear the deaf, and see the visible."
China ' s higher education institutions are further building on China ' s unique socialist career, taking deep stock of the era and historical mission of higher education, and accelerating their construction into world-class universities.
At the same time, the commitment to humanism and independence has allowed the spirit of the university to interact with the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation, thus providing an inexhaustible impetus for the prosperity of the nation and the revitalization of the nation and the realization of the common ideals of humanity.
We ordered a set, and two things went wrong.

President of the Islamic Republic of Iran: If sanctions are lifted against Iran, an agreement can be reached in the Iran nuclear negotiations - Xinhua Network
On December 11, in Tehran, Xinhua’s Teheran (journalist Wang Wenzheng) Iranian President Lisi said in Tehran that if the US lifts sanctions against Iran, negotiations on a comprehensive agreement on Iran’s nuclear issue would lead to a “good agreement.”
According to information posted on the Iranian President ' s website, Leahy, at a meeting with Iranian ambassadors in neighbouring countries on the same day, said that Iran had demonstrated its good faith in negotiations by submitting proposals to other interested parties to the Iran Nuclear Agreement.
If the U.S. is determined, “the path to agreement will open”.

Guangxi university students have up to five years to start a business - Xinhua Network
Xinhua Nanning, a journalist and journalist, recently learned from the Guangxi Autonomous Region Education Department that, in the future, the Guangxi Higher Education Institutes will introduce a flexible school system that will ease the school term for university students, extend the duration of school leave for start-ups by two to five years on the basis of the old school system, and consider the duration of the break as a practical education period.
In order to promote the development of entrepreneurial innovation among university students, Guangxi Education, Human Society and others have worked together to build entrepreneurial platforms, build more university-level practical training bases, university science and technology parks, university-level business parks, business incubators, etc., and provide external guarantees for university-level entrepreneurship.
By 2020, higher education institutions are required to have more than 3,000 square metres of undergraduate education and 2,000 square metres of higher education.
The Government encourages higher education institutions to establish credit points for innovative entrepreneurship, giving priority to supporting the transition of students who perform well in innovative entrepreneurship practices.
Teachers in higher education are required at least two months every two years to work in industry enterprises, thereby increasing their awareness and capacity for innovative entrepreneurship education.
The Department of Education of the Autonomous Region has requested the Guangxi higher education institutions to develop innovative entrepreneurship training programmes for university students, with a view to involving each university student in an innovative entrepreneurship training programme during his or her stay in school.
Higher education institutions actively organize student participation in various types of innovative entrepreneurship competitions at all levels and provide financial support.
NEWS GOV-MO: Doctor Honoris Causa (Doctor of Honour) for seven distinguished persons in Australia
Today, the University of Macao (11) holds the " Honorary Degrees and Higher Degrees Award in 2021 " , which offers the Australian Doctor of Honour degrees to Liu Saiyi, Chen Kaixien, Nakamura, Li Lancheng, Lee Yoon-Lang, Julien and Jiang Dynasty in recognition of their outstanding achievements and significant contributions to the development of society and education.
At the ceremony, the Chief Executive and Commissioner of Austro-Australasia and Director of the Socio-Cultural Department, Ouyang Yoo, was accompanied by the President of the Australian School Board, Lin Jin City, and the Rector of Australia, Song Yonghua, gave a doctorate degree in honor.
Professor Liu was awarded a doctorate in honorary education, Professor Chen Kai-shin was awarded a doctorate in honorary science, Professor Yukio Nakamura was awarded a doctorate in honorary science, Professor Li Lanhian was awarded a doctorate in honorary science, Professor Lee was awarded a doctorate in honorary business management, Professor Julien was awarded a doctorate in honorary science and Ms. Jiang Hao-Hyun was awarded a doctorate in honorary science.
It began with a warm congratulations and high esteem to the seven eminent persons who had received an honorary doctorate, who had made remarkable achievements in different fields and had made outstanding contributions to the development of the country and to the progress of the world. At the same time, it conveyed its most sincere wishes to the graduates and parents, as well as a heartfelt tribute to the dedicated and academic team of university staff.
In reading Liu ' s message, Professor Sun Yan Fung, Professor of the Australian Adult Literature School, said that he was a world-renowned economist who was known for his outstanding academic achievements and forward-looking educational ideas.
In addition to his achievements in the areas of economic development, economic growth and the East Asian economy, he was a visionary educational leader.
In short, he has made outstanding achievements in many areas.
In his speech, Sun Ye Fung said that Professor Nakamura was a pioneer in sustainable energy technologies.
He was one of the three winners of the 2014 Nobel Prize for Physics because of his invention of the Blue Lighted Diode (LED).
Professor Nakamura ' s invention not only radically changed the lighting industry, but also contributed significantly to the well-being of humankind by generating white luminous diodes that are now widely used in daily life and industrial production.
In his speech, Sun Ye Fung said that, as a pioneer of China ' s artificial liver enterprise, Professor Li had created a unique and effective artificial liver system to treat heavy hepatitis hepatitis failure, which had made a major breakthrough and significantly reduced the mortality rate.

A new concept emerged from the encryption community as the NFT fire went out.
In 2021, a block-chain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in South-East Asia, where some residents who had lost jobs as a result of the epidemic began to earn a steady income.
Axie Infinity is a game of pets formed at the bottom of block chain technology, which brings together a variety of games, including NFT, and is currently the highest traded NFT project, and has so far exceeded $3 billion.
Tokenterminal data show that Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, pressing the King's Glory.
On 6 August this year, Axie Infinity officially stated that its daily users were over 1 million.
The fire of Axie Infinity has passed a new “palytoearn” model to more people. By helping with block chains and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role, but can participate in the management of game ecology, in addition to having fun and economic gain from the game.
This ownership is not granted by the game producer, but by block chain technology.
To see a news story about the price of a friend’s stock, my greatest impression is the choice of an enterprise on the track, i.e., the choice of an industry that is the target of an investment, first of all, to choose an industry that has the potential to grow, at least 100 billion market sizes; secondly, to choose a sector that will grow better in the future, to consider an industry that will grow optimally in the next three to five years; and lastly, to choose an industry that has policy support.
The breadth of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether it is flat or rugged refers to the pattern of competition in the industry.
To the right track!
The first thing in the new year is to sum up 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is "do the things right," which is to do the right thing.
And the strategy is to do the right thing, to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find direction, the tactic is to land, and there is room for strategic thinking, above most tactical thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking) can be considered whether to continue deepening in the current area or extending in the horizontal area (strategic thinking); for example, to increase the retention rate of customers (tactical thinking), to increase the retention rate of core and high-value customers (strategic thinking); and to increase participation in activities (tactical thinking), to consider how to set up the right activities KPI to achieve the right goals, such as increasing the participation of target customers, activation of high-value silencers, and improvement; and to increase the DAU (tactical thinking), to consider whether current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin witnessed several milestones in 2021.
On 7 September, El Salvador, a small Central American country, made Bitcoin a legal currency, the first to become a national or regional legal currency.
On 12 October, for the first time in eight years, the United States SEC authorized ProShares to launch Bitconet ETF and to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF landing in the United States capital market and the re-encrypted currency investment exposure.
Bitcoin is not the leading actor in terms of block chain technology development.
On 14 November 2021, Bitcoin carried out an upgrade of the soft fork called “Taproot”, which increased the anonymity of the Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the structure of the blocks themselves.

American Asian groups complained about discrimination in the admission of students to three Ivy League schools in Yale and others - Xinhua Network
On May 23, Xinhua’s Washington news agency (journalist Seo Ken Mei) more than 130 Asian groups in the United States filed a complaint with the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting against discrimination against Asian students in admission to three Ivy League schools – Yale, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Education Coalition, which led the appeals, held a press conference in Washington the same day.
At the launch, the chairman of the group, Zhao Woo-kun, said that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to United States-name schools had multiplied, but that the proportion of Asians in the three United States-name schools remained almost at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these institutions “continuously and systematically discriminate against students of Asian descent during the so-called “comprehensive” admission process”.
According to Zhao, studies by scholars such as Saunders in 2014 showed that Asians had the lowest intake rate among all ethnic groups compared to the number of applicants in these three institutions.
Data from the United States Department of Education also show that in all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth Colleges have the lowest intake of Asian students, and Yale and Brown Universities have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Jo told Xinhua journalists that they expected an investigation by the United States Department of Education and the Department of Justice following the submission of the complaint and that, after finding out the facts, measures would be taken to prevent these institutions from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their enrolment.
They also looked forward to the initiative of higher education institutions to focus on the issue and change the policy of admission of Asians.
Currently, the three institutions of higher education against which complaints have been lodged have not yet responded.
The Asian Education Union was founded in 2015 when it complained about discrimination in admission to Harvard University, but the United States Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American community, the complaints were filed by Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani American educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the housing agency of a factory located in the town of Yao Tintung, Zhejiang, and after several live visits, he decided to purchase it.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu, following consultations with the family of the homeowner, Lin, on the details of the purchase of the plant, made a deposit of $200,000 through bank transfers on the same day.
“If the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the deposit is paid to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit is returned to the seller twice, and the parties agree to enter into a contract for the sale of the plant within one week.”
However, the subsequent failure of the parties to agree on the main contract terms, such as the scope of the sale of the plant and the manner of payment, led to delays in the conclusion of the contract for the sale of the house.
In view of the failure of the parties to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, Lin returned a deposit of $200,000 to Mr. Luk a few days later.
Mr. Rudd was frustrated by the fact that the seller had not sold the house in sight, that the deposit had been paid and that the house was ready for sale, and that the seller had signed the contract.
For this reason, Mr. Lu has brought a case against Lin to the Yu Yao Municipal People ' s Court.
After hearing, the Court held that the failure of the parties to conclude a formal contract could not be attributed solely to the defendant, who should reasonably be presumed not to be in a position to negotiate, so that in the present case the penalty should not apply and the defendant would not be liable for breach of the obligation to double the penalty.
After the first instance judgement, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the sentence.
In the course of the transaction, we must exercise the necessary due diligence.
When entering into a contract, the buyer is required to exercise the necessary due diligence obligation, for example by verifying information about the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, and by specifying in the contract the specific time and place of delivery in order to prevent disputes between the parties in the performance of the contract.
"Democracy Summit" At the end of Friday, the spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Saturday, 11 December, in which he said that the United States had organized the " Leaders ' Democratic Summit " , which was " an ideological strategizing, weaponizing, anti-democratic under the guise of democracy, inciting divisive confrontation and diverting domestic tensions " .
According to the Chinese Government, " for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values, pursued `democratic transformation ' , imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions and instigated `colour revolution ' with disastrous consequences.
" Democracy " has long been the United States intervention in other countries ' weapons of mass destruction.
The summit was a move by Biden to fulfil his campaign commitments.
The two-day meeting was conducted by video, and leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited, including Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States with their own democratic problems, claiming that the United States was not entitled to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt at the international level and within the United States, such as criticism of some of the leaders who were invited to the summit, including leaders of authoritarian tendencies, such as those of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some doubt that the Biden government’s real intention was not to organize the summit for democratic but geopolitical purposes.
The new German Chancellor Scholtz also participated in the Video Democracy Summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry ' s statement on Saturday states that " today ' s American democracy is becoming increasingly ferocious, with monetary politics, identity politics, rival political parties, political polarization, social tearing, ethnic contradictions, and the division between rich and poor " , and that democracy in the United States is a " rich game " based on capital.
In his statement, President Biden said, " It is our responsibility, as leaders of our Government, to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the foundations of democracy, to promote reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to the forces of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power naked before the public good. " "
He stressed that democracy is not a matter of course: " We must constantly update it among every generation, which, in my view, is the defining challenge of our time. "
Biden added that global democracy and human rights " require champions to defend democracy in the face of persistent and worrying challenges " .
The United States, for its part, is committed to a year-long operation to strengthen democracy around the world and to provide support to independent media following this summit.
The United States hoped that countries would make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the entity democracy summit planned for late 2022.
Biden said, " Let us all implement our commitments and report next year on our progress " .
Okay, I'm afraid he sent the wrong address.

It's rare to have a seat at the store, but the food is of no quality, as usual.
Tastes good, meat good.
I'll take care of it.
[Meals ] Food: A little disappointed this time.
Three chickens: a little more with a little less chicken.
The main thing is that it tastes a little different, and the bottom is not salty enough, so it highlights sweetness.
What's red whiskey?
Everyone's hobby is different, there's people who like food, there's people who like wine, there's people who like wine, and red whiskey is one of the best-selling scotch in every country, and red whiskey has won the International Wine Championship.
Each bottle of red whiskey tastes uniquely, but if you don't know how to taste it, it's a waste of its aroma.
What about red whiskey?
I'll give you a brief introduction.
Red whiskey:
Johnny's red whiskey is made up of about 35 kinds of scotch, with strong fragrance and traditional scotch, with sweet and fumes.
The entrance is fresh and tastes like vanilla and strong smoked wheat.
The wine may be used either directly on ice or in combination with the favorite drink.
Red whiskey enters the country and, in order to adapt to the taste of the nation, bubble drinks such as red whiskey + Coke or Spice or New Queen become a permanent fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to their medium and sour taste, can provide people with a sense of visual pleasure by adding them to the drinks, which can change their taste.
Red whiskey with slices of lemon and sugar is the most authentic and traditional.
The real red stench is a little sour, and sugar can be added to it, while lemons bring fresh flavors of wine. Of course, sweet acid can be adapted to personal taste.
All three are the best tastes of red whiskey, and you can try it as a reference. It is hoped that the introduction will help you.
Educational thought: how the university exam makes the "hegemonic" "scumbags" one of their own - Xinhua Network
Three students at the Lanzhou University of Transport wrote to the head of the school, reflecting confusion about the university examination and proposing to make it more difficult to change the subject of the examination so that it truly reflected the student ' s actual level of demand.
Indeed, university exams have long been a “hot topic”.
At university campuses, students come from four seas of the Great Lakes, with varying levels of competence, combined with varying levels of study, which vary greatly.
It is inevitable that groups with such diverse characteristics will have different perceptions.
Of course, if the subject of the examination is single and has a high repetition rate, the subject matter is too simple and necessarily creates another distinct feeling.
Students with no merit may pass the test by concentrating on surprises and, if alternative approaches are considered, may have a multiplier effect.
As a result, “scumbags” can pass without input, or even with high marks; “hegemonics” don’t miss classes, work, notes are good, and examinations are not much higher than “unusual status quo”.
In this way, it appears that the problems in the university examinations are not entirely attributable to the students who have been brought up in Lanzhou, and it is believed that the situation is not exclusive to Lanzhou.
In this sense, the three students who have written directly are to be commended.
In fact, it is clear to all those who have gone to university that it is not uncommon for them to be prepared for the examinations, to try to “slip” the subjects from their teachers, and to get “focused counselling” before they can pass, even if they have a small copy of the examinations, and if they do so, it is not surprising.
In the view of the author, as a guide to the assessment of the quality of teaching, the assessment of the qualifications of a university examination depends more on the teacher ' s overall understanding of teaching and learning and on the scientific propositions on that basis.
At the undergraduate level, specializations began to be broken down, and many specialized courses focused on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that the basic knowledge point of a subject is the subject of a university examination.
Undergraduate knowledge, on the other hand, is essentially the theoretical basis of the discipline and basic common sense, and in terms of the knowledge point, there is little room for change and it is largely fixed.
As the teacher said, "Twenty years ago, the basics of mathematics in the university were still in school, and it's still important. It's not like it's a bad idea.
However, the knowledge points remain largely unchanged and do not represent a single and repetitive examination.
In many universities, examinations are usually composed of question groups, which are composed of senior teaching staff, and examination examinations are attended by all the teachers responsible for the section, thus overcoming to some extent the duplication of questions.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of subjects that are relevant to the teaching and learning realities, which are difficult to distribute in a normal manner depending on the student ' s overall learning situation, and to provide an integrated picture of the teaching situation and a comprehensive analysis of the extent of the student ' s learning, so that the subject can be easily and dynamically determined, highlighting both the basic knowledge and the competency examination, while at the same time developing innovative design of the subject.
The examination is a command bar for university education, and what kind of examination would allow students to have the corresponding preparation programme, which in the long run will affect the effectiveness of university education.
In response to the student recommendation letter, the Lanzhou University School has given high priority to the implementation of a school-wide rehabilitation programme.
The teaching units are required to organize self-censorship of teachers in the conduct of seminars and course completion examinations, to develop the test papers and related systems, and to strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination papers and the examination chain, to refine the evaluation of achievements and to strengthen the overall examination of the course components.
The institutional solution to the problem of single types of subjects and overlapping of subjects is the subject of university examinations, which, of course, need to be accompanied by a system, but kung fu is a day-to-day process that requires teachers to have a thorough knowledge of the teaching, not only of the content of the teaching, but also of the learning of the students, and of the learning of the teaching and learning of the subjects.

The photo was fixed today and Lang sent it to me, and I saw two of them that weren't good, and they helped me fix it.

Sabah has 3,200 newborns with no paper.
According to the Sabah National Registry (Apis 11), since early October, it has not been possible to issue paper for the birth of a newborn child, owing to the drying up of specially manufactured false paper stocks, and the cumulative number of persons affected to date is 3,200.
However, the Director of the Department, Kelloaminous, assured that all babies who had applied for paper were recorded in the system and that it would be reissued when it arrived next week.
In a press conference, he explained the 10-month-long coverage of the production of paper by an Internet-based medium, the Sabah newspaper.
He said that the problem had arisen two months earlier and that the more the matter was faced with the same problem as the salad.
“One of the reasons for this is the delay in arriving in our country due to the effects of the epidemic on Chinese producers of special anti-false paper. It's not like it's a bad idea.
He explained that Sabah used false paper different from other areas and therefore could not borrow stocks belonging to other states.
Kéru Aminous revealed that the latest batch of fraudulent paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6 and was handed over to the printing company on 8 September for partial printing.
“The Bureau will send personnel to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and return to Sabah for the final phase immediately, with an estimated additional two working days (20 December) to be handed over to the applicant. It's not like it's a bad idea.
“We will inform the applicant to go to the local bureaus to collect the paper. It's not like we're going anywhere.
He added that Sabah had so far issued 24,801 newspaper papers this year.
From 7:00 to now.
Is that almost there?
I mean food.
I'm waiting opposite #PRS_ORG#
Okay, thanks. The restaurant said it was ready.
People's Daily Journal commentator: “14-5” achieves a good start — learning to follow the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference — Xinhua Network
Xinhua News, Beijing, 11 December
“The `four-five' good start was achieved, and the Central Economic Work Conference, held from 8 to 10 December, highlighted the achievements of our economic and social development over the past year.
The Secretary-General, Xi Jinping, delivered an important statement at the meeting, providing a thorough overview of the economic work of 2021, an in-depth analysis of the current economic situation, and a major deployment of the economic work of 2022, which set out the way forward and provided fundamental follow-up to the economic work of next year in anticipation of the 20 major victories of the party.
We celebrate the centenary of the establishment of the Communist Party of China, officially proclaiming the full construction of a small and prosperous society, achieving the first centenary of the struggle, opening the way for the full construction of a modern socialist State and embarking on a new march towards the second century of struggle.
We convened the 19th mid-sixth plenary session of the Party to take stock of the Party ' s major achievements and historical experience in its centennial struggle and to adopt the third historical resolution in the history of the Centennial Party, the CCP ' s resolution on the Party ' s 100-year achievements and historical experience, a political declaration by the Chinese Communist Party of the new era to remember its first mission and to uphold and develop Chinese-style socialism, and to guide history ' s actions in establishing the future and achieving the great renaissance of the Chinese nation.
Over the past year, the global pandemic of the 100-year-old and new coronary pneumonia epidemic has become more complex and challenging in the external environment, and the tasks of preventing and controlling the new coronary pneumonia epidemic in the country are enormous.
The party centre, with Comrade Xi at its core, is committed to bringing together the two major national and international agendas, maintaining the overall thrust of the drive for change, managing the 100-year change and the century epidemic, coordinating disease prevention and control and economic and social development, accelerating the construction of a new development paradigm, strengthening macroeconomic policy cross-cyclical regulation, investing in sustainable and healthy economic development, investing in reform and innovation and working hard to meet the challenges of reform and development.
One important aspect of the “14-5” start-up was the new steps towards a new development landscape and new results for high-quality development.
The country's economic development and epidemic prevention and control remain globally advanced, with strong, high potential and dynamic features of development; the acceleration of national strategic scientific and technological power, the emergence of major innovations, the sustained rise in technological and innovation capabilities and the emergence of new breakthroughs in key core technological barriers; the upgrading of industrial chain resilience, the increase in external trade, the continued optimization of structures and the growth of new dynamic energy represented by the new business model of new industries; the deepening of reforms, the opening up of new barriers to supply- and demand-side mobility, the creation of new competitive advantages with high levels of external openness; strong and effective job security, the sustained growth of income and economic growth, and the continuation of food in excess of 1.3 trillion pounds throughout the year; and the growth of eco-civilization, the growth of carbon peaks and integrated efforts, the steady pace of the green low-carbon transformation, and new results in ecological environmental protection.
These achievements are the result of the strong leadership of the central party, centred on Comrade Xi, and the scientific guidance of the Chinese socialist ideology of the new era of Xi Jinping, as a result of the concerted and painstaking efforts of all the country ' s people.
It has proved once again that the Party has established the core of the centre of the Party and the center of the entire Party, and has established the guiding position of the socialist philosophy of China's specialty in the new era of Xi, which is decisive for the development of the New Age Party and the national cause and for the advancement of the great revival of the Chinese nation.
With General Secretary Xi as the centerpiece of the Party’s centre, the centerpiece of the Party, the scientific guidance of the Chinese socialist ideology of Xi’s new era, and the unity and tenacity of all the country’s people, we will be able to overcome all the difficult obstacles and create a new era of glory in the new march to build a modern socialist state.
The convening of the 20-year-old party next year is a major event in the political life of the party and the country.
To promote the spirit of the Great Party of Construction, to maintain the general tone of the steady and steady pursuit of progress, to complete, accurate and comprehensive implementation of the new concept of development, to accelerate the construction of a new development paradigm, to deepen and deepen all-round reforms and openings, to maintain innovation-driven development, to promote high-quality development, to maintain a supply-side structural reform, to integrate epidemic control and economic and social development, to integrate development and security, and to continue to work on “six-sand-six-sand” and “six-sand” jobs, to continuously improve people's lives, to focus on macroeconomic stability, to keep the economy functioning in a rational manner, and to maintain social stability, we will be able to maintain a calm and healthy economic environment, a social environment for the country's people's peace and a healthy political environment, and to meet the Party's 20th victory with excellence.
Let us unite more closely around the center of the party, with Comrade Xi at its core, to strengthen “four consciousness” and “four self-confidence” and “two defence” and to continue to improve political judgement, political awareness and political implementation in order to put the central decision-making of the party in place and move the new era of China’s socialism.

Chairman of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee: Convinced of China ' s ability to host the Olympic Games in special times - Xinhua Network
The President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic, has recently stated that the Bosnian side looks forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and is convinced that China will be able to host them during special periods.
The former Ambassador of China to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Zippin, met with the Chairman of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesić, at the Sarajevo Olympic Centre.
At the meeting, Kvesić positively assessed the relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and indicated that he had visited China on the occasion of the Beijing Summer Conference in 2008 and had been very impressed by the excellent organization of China ' s work, convinced of China ' s ability to organize the Olympic Games during special periods; that he very much looked forward to the Beijing Winter Games and that the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee was actively organizing their participation; and that he hoped that this would be an opportunity for more extensive exchanges and cooperation with China in the field of sport.
Tikiping states that the two countries have a special “Olympic bond”.
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics will be held here successfully, and in two months' time, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also be inaugurated, presenting the world with a brief, secure and wonderful event.
Looking forward to further exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the preparation of winter sports events, as well as in the training of athletes, the Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is ready to continue its role as a bridge, taking advantage of the Beijing Olympic Games as an opportunity to further deepen the exchange of humanities between the two countries, so that the two peoples can “go to the future together” and wish the best of success in Beijing.
Prior to the meeting, the BiH Olympic Committee held an award ceremony for “The Best Athletes of the Tenth Year”, and Ziping presented the award as a special guest for the best young athletes of BiH.
A video of the Beijing Olympic Games was broadcast on-site.
I'm disappointed.

48-hour nucleic acid negative, “buffer zone”
On 11 December, Xinhua News Agency Beijing issued a circular on strengthening the control of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic in border cities, issued by the State Council's Joint Control Mechanism, which requires those who have recently left the land border crossings (except those linked to Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a negative certificate of nucleic acid detection within 48 hours, and at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival at the land border.
According to the circular, the time frame for the above-mentioned request is from the date of the determination of the port boundaries of the provinces and municipalities and their announcement until 15 March 2022.
In addition, the circular states that the city in a position to do so may study the establishment of an outbreak-control buffer zone within the jurisdiction.
The head of the Department of Disease Prevention and Control of the National Board of Health and Health described cross-border border trade as the main economic pillar of the country and the frequent movement of people on both sides.
The implementation of the policy of zonal differentiation management, from an exfil to a two-way line of protection, is expected to result in a roll-out of the gap and a reduction in the risk of epidemic spillovers, with maximum impact in terms of minimal social impact and minimal social cost.
In recent times, there have been a number of home-grown outbreaks, all of which have been imported through ports of entry.
According to the above-mentioned circular, this has revealed delays in early warning of local outbreak surveillance, non-implementation of closed-ring management of personnel in high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid detection flows, non-existence of cold-chain items, irregular management of centralized isolated sites and inadequate scientific precision in emergency response to outbreaks.
The circular requests that efforts be made in nine areas, including the improvement of the control mechanisms for urban outbreaks at ports, the development of an early warning system for disease surveillance and the implementation of border control measures, to speed up the completion of the weaknesses in urban control at ports of entry, to ensure that the controls are carried out in an uninterrupted and scientific manner, and to ensure that the lines of defence are woven and secured.
The circular stressed the need for border cities to synchronize research and deployment of disease control and human security efforts, to publish and operate a hotline for human security, to regularly screen for problems related to the supply, prices, etc. of basic goods, and to address and respond in a timely manner to the salient issues raised by the population.
According to the circular, the port cities referred to therein include open land, waterways, the counties (cities, districts, flags), the municipalities (prefectures, cantons, unions) and the municipalities directly under their control, with the specific scope determined and promptly announced by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under their control).

The pipeline videoed 20 years of blood-related killings by the U.S. Army.
(Video source: pipeline)
On 11 December, a micro-documentary on the pipeline platform, called " The Killing Machine " , attracted widespread attention.
The film describes the war in Afghanistan waged by the United States in the name of “anti-terrorism”, the forcible export of American democracy through war, the perpetration of crimes against humanity over 20 years of war-torn, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killings.
The indiscriminate use of drones to bomb civilian sites, such as hospitals, schools, distorts humanity and creates homicide teams.
For 20 years, United States forces have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The “black jail” used by United States forces to inflict torture and physical humiliation on “suspects”.
A crime against humanity has provoked hatred among more Afghans.
As the video puts it, the American-style “counter-terrorism” war is “terror”.
War does not give the Afghan people hope for peace, democracy and prosperity, but for a devastated country and countless destructions.
Let's get this video out of the bloodthirsty killing of the United States in the name of “counter-terrorism” and the hypocrisy of American democracy!
See, inadvertently, the following article on why a customer needs to be canned by a logistics company in the tax zone, both from a commercial point of view and from the point of view of the shelf life, even though the canning is a deep-processed, non-insured logistics company, and this text may explain why the customer wants to do so.
I went to a lot of milk powder plants, and I came into contact with lots of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the bags are identical to the raw materials of the milk powder, and there is no difference.
Then you will surely ask: why is the bag-loading warranty period of one year and the hearing warranty period of two years or more?
Or why is the price difference between listening and bags so much?
In fact, many consumers start from this point forward, or mothers think it's much better because of different raw materials.
It's like raw materials. It's just what everyone thinks is good.
There are also consumers who react with this mentality and say that the taste or taste of hearing is different!
Now I'll tell you why you're so expensive.
Why is the difference in their raw materials so large?
Because most of the price-fixing by the manufacturers takes into account the difficulty for consumers to accept if the bag price is too high, which means that the profits generated by the factory are very low, or no profits, and how does it survive?
So they've got a big rise in listening pricing to secure their profit space.
As a result, most of the plant owners pushed the hearing rather than the bag.
And how does it come to you that many producers spend tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year on advertising?
You'll see.
So, as society develops, the costs of marketing, such as promotions at the mall, displays at the mall, gifts for products, advertising, etc., are increasing.
As a result, new products are constantly being added to the plant, and their prices are constantly rising, in fact as market costs increase.
The main objective is to obtain higher profits, but their raw materials do not cost more than $3 or $4.
There is also a part of the brand that, in order to promote its own products, is linked to doctors in hospitals, who assist in the promotion of the product, drawing profits ranging from $30 to $80 per hearing.
China ' s laws absolutely do not allow this method of operation, which in fact harms consumers.
It is recommended that a bag of milk powder should be bought and loaded into a canned house, which would save costs, while increasing the conservation and sealability of milk powder would have no impact on children.
It is also important not to think that the hearing period is longer than the bag, if the hearing period is the same as the bag's duration after it is opened, but simply to say that the bag is not easily preserved and susceptible to tidal deterioration.

Don't scare people at the start-up line.
When you go to the books market, you can often feel the flames of successful books.
Today’s successful books promote “best principles” – assuming or implying that you can “do it” and then telling you what you need to do.
It's like saying that the “how” is the most important and fundamental link.
For that reason, these books share a common feature – either to do the best of it, or simply to do nothing; or 100, or zero; or you go to Tartarus, or you stay where you are.
This “best principle” allows anyone to recognize “right”, but 99% of them are scared to the start of the line.
Because this theory preaches a path of “resolve, re-establish and make a big 180-degree shift”, which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who follow the rules, follow the old rules, refuse to change, you have to shout in his ear, "You have to change," which is certainly self-deception, and the playing of a cow.
The vast majority of people are afraid to take the word “transformation” in the face of the word “transformation”; or have taken the “transformation” resolve with the urge of the moment and courageously took the first step, but it is often not long, and it is difficult to sustain the failure of a few more moments.
The voice of Mr. Marcili's famous "From tomorrow onwards" is the classic in which this “universal humanity” is most divinely manifested.
The greatest problem with the “best principles” is that the threshold is too high, which often transcends the limits of the capacity of ordinary people and leaves the vast majority of people “showing”.
Perhaps the “good principle” is a way of putting more ordinary people on a path of relative success.
At the heart of the “second-best principle” lies the “low-threshold” – it encourages a “small-win” theory that, if it fails to do 100, only one can do it: because one is never greater than zero; and if it does not reach Tarzan, just the little dunes in front of your house, because it is always better than where they are.
Anyway, if you do something, it's better than not.
Because the threshold has been significantly lowered, there is a greater likelihood that ordinary people will be able to insist, and the probability of success will increase as long as everything is maintained.
The road to success is just a little longer, following the “second best principle”.
In short, the “best principle” – although ostensibly a sign of success for all – is ultimately what inspires, in fact, a few; and the “second best principle” effectively motivates and benefits as many as possible.

Qinghai Lake's bare-wall resource reserves increased by 0.71 million tons this year.
On 11 December, Xinhua News Agency ' s news reporter Sing (journalist Xiao Fei Zhang Hongxiang) learned from the Agricultural Rural Department of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the bare-wall resource reserves in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared to the previous year, to 108.5 million tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 per cent compared with the early years of protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake's nudity, a rare species unique to Qinghai Lake, plays a vital role in maintaining the security and biodiversity of the Qinghai Lake Basin's ecological chain.
In the 1960s and 1970s, as a result of factors such as massive man-made killings and the increasing degradation of the environment in the brows-breeding waters, the number of bare-walled lakes in the Qinghai Sea fell sharply, with a resource potential of 2592 tons in 2002.
Naked walls of the Qinghai Lake were listed as endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species in 2004.
Since 2003, the province of Qinghai has imposed a seal on lake-breeding fish, prohibiting all units, groups and individuals from fishing for nudity in the main rivers and tributaries of the Qinghai and the sale of nudity walls and their products.
At the same time, the natural resources of Qinghai Lake have been growing year after year through increased protection efforts, such as artificial migration and clean-up of the main rivers of Qinghai Lake and the design of scientifically sound “fish passages”.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agricultural and Rural Department of Qinghai Province, stated that, to date, a cumulative increase of nearly 180 million tails had been implemented, contributing more than 23 per cent to the restoration of the resources of Qinghai Lake.
The Qinghai Sanjiang region is an important ecological barrier and water-cultivation area for our country and Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and an eco-functional area to control the spread of desertification eastward.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiang region and the waters of Qinghai Lake, to protect aquatic wildlife and to preserve the biodiversity of the Qinghu Plateau, Qinghai has, since this year, issued a catch ban on priority waters of Yangtze, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, creating a comprehensive catch ban management system.

Only one bag for me at the restaurant.
Would you like to ask, is the delivery in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
You want to know if it's a leak or if we got it, thanks.
It's been an hour, not yet.
It's too long to read an article about a holiday.
Give unknown male science.
Most girls suddenly go through the first official holiday one day during their 13-15 years of age and are closed at around 50.
After that, a regular monthly visit takes place in good health.
But it's not the rule to predict with precision, about a week or so of official travel, which needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes bad luck turns over (sudden days in advance).
The length, amount of blood and degree of pain vary from three days to one week for some; the number of people who are bleeding is low and some are bleeding; the number of people who are not responding, the number of people who are in pain in the ambulance and who are transported away, the pain will change over time and the pain will not have meant a lifetime of pain.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, and the bleeding occurs 24 hours from the beginning to the end, and all that can be done is to suck blood from a sanitary towel or a tampon to prevent it from reaching the clothes chair.
The pains are mainly due to the excrement of prostates, and it is useless to eat balonen as soon as the physiology has begun before the pain.
Prior to the physiology period, diarrhea is prone to diarrhea due to excessive uterus and prostate releases.
If it's about the cycle, for no reason, it'll be menstrual in two days.
Sanitary towels should be replaced once in two or three hours, otherwise they can easily breed bacteria, removing sleeping time, and, worst of all, six times a day, seven days a month, i.e. 42 pieces, which, if added to the pre-prepared, may be 50, not one piece per month.
Here, change the tampons, you don't have to change them often.
Menstruation hormones may be more agitated, and ovulation periods can be unstable because of hormonal changes in the body, which is bad luck, and the body causes itself to trip.
However, official data on crime rates show that women still have a high capacity to control emotions and do not use emotional problems as an excuse.
It's not just blood. It's got detached membranes.
After menstruation, the membrane is the thinest and later thickest, it can be understood that the uterus is the house, that the house is built every month (the membrane is thicker), that the guests are not here, and that the new house is to be built next month (the menstruation is to be removed).
Menstruation is inconvenient, bleeding 24 hours a day, every month, for decades, and abdominal pain. Who wants it?
But a man is born because his mother came to the menstruation, which is to prepare for your first visit to the world for 10 months, and thanks to his mother's regular healthy menstruation.
Much of what was done to women in the past had been suppressed, and society had told women that it was dirty and shameful, but times had changed.
If someone feels sick about menstruation, and thinks that the woman's body is preparing for life, should not say it in public. Girls should stand up, don't think about it. Men who have never experienced it, who have never experienced it in their lives, who don't know much about it. How can they want to have their children?
Finally, girls try the tampon. It really works.
It's winter to holiday. It's a disappointment to be mistaken.
I'll order another meal for the kids.
I hope the shop is busy checking the products.
Did you lose power?
The choice of the right tub would serve a good function of pediatric care, and today the editor-in-chief of the United States will answer the question, hoping to help his friends.
With increased awareness of health care, the tub has become increasingly popular with consumers, and a wide range of products have emerged in the market, ranging from a hundred to thousands of dollars in the tub, giving consumers much choice.
On the surface of the relevant data, there is a risk of safety due to the fact that, compared to traditional household electricity, domestic electricity sales in the health sector, such as a bath tub, burst, but there are no specialized industry standards in the tub.
"It's too dangerous to bubble your feet in electric water!"
Mr. Lee told the reporter that he had recently bought a bath tub for his father ' s birthday, but that he felt numb when he fell asleep.
Mr. Lee initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the bath tub, but did not expect to turn off the vibration function and the father felt numb on his feet.
Mr. Lee tried with a pen and the pen turned on, and Mr. Lee was surprised to find electricity in the tub.
He then contacted the merchants, who had a good attitude, and Mr. Lee was still unhappy, despite the withdrawal of the tub.
He found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation of the peak temperature set, the population to which it applies, the material to be safe.
In general, however, there are no electrical problems in the showers, but this does not preclude the fact that a few products are not strictly closed when they leave the plant.
So when you buy it, you choose a separate tub.
Water and electricity are separated and there is no security risk.
At the same time, you can take any electrocution you want.
The opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Fair - nodes - Hunan Daily News Network - Whisper Online
This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Fair and the Shining Red Tea Fair were held at the Hunan International Exhibition Centre to showcase the tea industry, innovation in tea technology, promotion of tea culture and speed up the pursuit of the hundreds of billion tea industry goals.
The opening ceremony was attended by the Vice-President of the Board of Directors of the China-China General Institute for Supply and Marketing Cooperation and the Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People ' s Congress.
At the opening ceremony, Professor Liu Zhanghua, a member of the Chinese Engineering College, re-advertised the source of lake red, and the rise of red tea gave new impetus to the `Four Colored Tea'.
In recent years, the Provincial Council and the Provincial Government have given strong support to the development of the tea industry, which has led to the construction of hundreds of billions of kimchi tea, and the development of the “three-single-four-water tea”.
The tea industry in the province has become more innovative, with the main teas, such as green tea, black tea and red tea, and the promotion of the integration of tea brigades in the main tea-producing areas, leading to increased harvests among tea farmers.
Windwater turns and red tea works.
Experts from the tea industry in the province stated that after green tea for red tea and black tea, the tea farmer earns income for four seasons a year and the value of tea garden production rises straight up.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded licences for the fourth batch of companies authorized to use the “Hunan Red Tea” trademark, to repopulate the “Huang Red Source”.
In the red tea shop, Fujian tea merchants look at one of the high-mountain teas called Ice Springs and place orders immediately.
The Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Association, Wang, was pleased to say that the current epidemic, among other factors, had more or less affected the tea market, but that, from the scene of the tea fair, bright spots appeared.
The new red tea is red and injected into the culture of tea. It is popular, it is traded and the tea industry embraces a new spring.
Can we cancel this food if it's not hot?
I don't want it. He couldn't get it up because he couldn't stop down there.
It means studying questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Schooling in form is a philosophical fundamental principle designed to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the name “Standing to school” is taken from The Emancipation of the Words of the Words of the Words of the Words of the Ones of the Ones, the Ones of the Words of the Ones of the Words of the Ones” and is translated by the Japanese from Metaphysic.
The branch of form education consists of ontology, theology of nature and its extension.
The introspection is “to study which terminology represents the real entity of existence and which terminology represents only one concept”.
Natureism in form means denying the existence of God.
It is based on the notion that all phenomena can be interpreted on natural grounds, by philosophers who support science and evolution.
And the naturalism of the method refers to a method of studying God without saying anything.
Psychiatry is the philosophical branch of research awareness and the essence of their relationship to the body (especially the brain).
The dualism and monism are the two most important ideas for the discussion of the relationship between the mind and the body.
Knowledge theory is a philosophical branch that explores the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline for systematic reflection and research on the moral life of human beings; in this context, ethics is defined as all codes of conduct accepted by a group of people or a culture.
It is divided into metaethics (the abstract study of ethical theory or the essence of criticism), normative ethics (judgment of different moral values, and moral advice on correct or wrong behaviour).
It examines what types of ethical conduct people should follow, applied ethics (academics that apply ethical theory to actual life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (collecting information on how people live, summing up from observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics is not based on the supposed theory, but rather on an investigation of the real choice made by the actual moral entity (moral agent) and observed, which leads to all the moral elements of this choice, which examines the ethics held by the social community.
Ethical history includes Greek Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
Part I: Humanist ethics, represented by Walla and Monta and others.
Part II: Ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part III: Political Ethics, represented by Makiavelli et al., Modern Ethics (17-18th century, British Empirical Ethics, Representative: Humu et al., 17-18th century, Euro-Land Rational Ethics, Representative: Spinoza et al., 18-18th century, French Enlightenment Ethics, Representative: Voltaire et al., 18-19th century, German Academy Ethics, Representative: Kandeh and Hegel et al., 18-19th century, British Cone Ethics, Representative: Binsai and Si Kiwik, 19th century, Progressive Ethics, Representative: Shipsei et al., late 19th century, New Cond Ethics, Representative: Lee Keel et al., Post-19th century, New Hegelist Ethics, Representative: Thomas Hill Green et al., Transitional Ethics (non-Riscular Ethics, Representative: Kerkekole, Xuehu and Nee).

Logic usually consists of three parts: summary reasoning, retroactive reasoning and reasoning, which can be divided into formal and non-formal logic.
Aesthetics is a subject of research on the nature of beauty and its meaning.

Ding Zi: To friends.
Here, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my friends for the humanitarian assistance they have given us for more than 30 years after the loss of our loved ones, especially since I made a personal appeal to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Today, the vast majority of the deceased have their parents left behind, and the orphans have grown up and become employed.
It is your admiration that has helped us in these difficult times.
The new epidemic is currently unfolding globally, and most donors have retired every year.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to suspend the humanitarian contributions to the group of mothers of Tiananmen, who are in need of a perfect ending.
I will always remember your love, and I am confident that your will will be remembered for history.
For all these reasons, I can only express my will in this way and ask my friends to understand!
Please accept my sincere congratulations.
TOO: Allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance carried out by the All-American Self-Scientific Federation (IFCS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the course of humanitarian assistance, ACSF and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, with often cross-cutting project implementers.
(The Apple Daily: Tiananmen Mother's site is run by the pottery. ZGjzm
Often the relief was not delivered successfully.
In 1994, Mr. Ting suggested that a special unit be set up by Mother Tiananmen to coordinate and manage the receipt and distribution of humanitarian assistance.
In 1998, a six-orphan education fund was established and 11 years later, and in 2009, following the graduation of all six-orphans from university, a six-orphan special hardship fund was set up and has been implemented since.
These projects are funded mainly from campus and social donations in the year 64, from individual generous contributions and supported by the Brother University Foundation for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Correctional Research Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the six or four refugees finally received a partial contribution from Hong Kong for the year on behalf of the six or four.
During this period, China Human Rights is also implementing its humanitarian projects independently.
We understand that Mr. Ding's call for the suspension of the 64 per cent donation is a consideration for donors, and we are indeed some retired elderly people whose income is not as good as it was before retirement.
We will respect the decision of the protagonists to terminate the project within two years and resume it as soon as necessary.
We would like to express our gratitude and respect to those who for many years have stood by their generosity and risk of delivering humanitarian aid.

Thank you, Rabbit.
Thanks to Dandan's approval, your satisfaction will give us power to keep moving forward, and we will continue to refuel!
This studio is amazing.
It is impeccable from reception, makeup, clothing, lights, photography and beyond.
Cosmetics are so delicate that they fit your style, and make-up is a big brand.
Not to mention Mr. Tanaka, photography is quite a profession.
The entire studio is very artistic, and there are two little cats to play with.
We work in Beijing, and a better studio in Beijing needs to line up six months early, and our colleagues have done it in Beijing, and they're watching the next film and feel like they're just so.
I looked for this studio, a place with spirit and attitude.
Our facial expressions are poorly managed, and it's a short version of most people, and the photographer, Ryo, will capture and record the natural moments.
Make-up, photographer, late design, a fine team.
It's a big deal for us and everyone around us.
My best friend has been recommended for the past, and she's just watching the film.
It was to be hoped that such studios would not be buried, and that more people would find ta and film it in their own style rather than the same.
Thank you very much for the five-star review of the Eagle and the Respectful Ling, both very thoughtful and creative new people.
The sweet assistant, the lively photographer teacher, everyone on the team was super-nice, a wonderful shot, a hard-to-forget experience, and it worked better than that. I imagined a lot better. Thank you for your hard work.
Thanks to Xiao Woo, it's a fate to know you.
How do I pay?
We've already delivered the food.
No riders.
Now the restaurant clerk calls me.
A programming white that wants to share personal experiences.
If it was intended to enter the industry, it would be possible to find a place to train, but if there were no ideas to do so, it would be better to learn on its own. After all, training is expensive and takes six months to learn.
Training is indeed a very good option, however, if it is intended to enter the industry, especially for those who are self-sufficient and weak.
You can also choose self-study if you have greater self-control, but it's more exhausting.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
It depends first and foremost on the strength of the staff of this institution, which, if it is not strong enough, will be of little use to this institution, although the capacity of some of the new ones is not particularly strong.
The second is to look into this training institution before choosing, and it is better to look into the students who come out of this institution, after all, who know exactly what the institution is like and how the curriculum is good or bad.
Hello, I don't know how to answer that question, because you don't have some information about your own situation, and there's a big connection between learning this thing and the personal situation.
For example, a profession, age, language that you want to learn, even in any city, is related to the profession you study or want to pursue.
If you are a student and you have not graduated, or if you have graduated from computer science, it is the least efficient and cost-effective to have enough time for self-study, and many of the below-line training institutions are now very good, but the cost of learning is high, the amount of time spent is relatively high, and basic training is three to six months.
But if that's what I'm saying, self-learning is easy, and now much of the learning resources on the Internet are free, or there's a lot of training resources going to station b. If you don't find the resources, you can contact me through the profile, get free resources, or get detailed advice.
There are also more classic books that can be combined with a combination of video studies.
If you are not a computer professional, but are able to pay for a certain amount of money and time, it is recommended that you study at a training institution, so that you do not have to go to a training institution, so that you do not have to go to a training institution, so that you are very detailed in your teacher's presentation, and there are questions that are answered specifically, and so that you can help with learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal quotas and submit them to the company after learning, so that the subsequent job interviews can save much.

China Shatsu exhibitors joined forces to organize the first Saudi biennial exhibition of contemporary art - Xinhua Network
On December 12 in Riyadh, Xinhua’s first biennial exhibition of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia – a biannual exhibition of contemporary art in Diriya – was officially opened to the public at the JAX art district in Diriya, north-west of Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and elsewhere.
This bi-annual exhibition was planned jointly by the Saudi Diène Biannual Exhibition Foundation and the UCCA Yullens Centre for Contemporary Arts of China, with the UCCA Yullens Centre for Contemporary Arts of China, Director-General of the Arts, Yullens Takita.
According to the team, the theme of this bi-annual exhibition is “Standing through the river with stones.” This is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of socio-economic transition, and reflects the current state of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
This bi-annual exhibition, which covers almost 12,000 square metres, spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: Touching Stones across the River, Passage as Experiments, Marginal Thinking, Walking to the Public, Beautiful New World, and The Spirit of Art.
Of these, 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40 per cent of the total number of exhibits, including drawings, fittings and performing arts; the works of 12 Chinese artists were also of great interest, and some artists used recycled materials in innovative ways to create them, such as Suh-icing, in The Unfinished Flow of the Story Series (2014), recasting a classic mountain water painting with waste.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Diaryer Biannual Fair Foundation expressed the hope that the current Biannual Fair would establish an international dialogue that would give the global audience an opportunity to learn about the country ' s flourishing cultural industries and creative communities and enhance interaction.
“The objective of the bi-annual exhibition is twofold, as it involves Saudi contemporary art in global dialogue and integrates Saudi audiences into the contemporary artistic world. It's not like it's a bad idea.
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the bi-annual curtain week, and that artists, promoters and creative industry opinion leaders will discuss the themes of intercultural exchange and contemporary artistic development.

Yunnan: Integrated regulation of rural public service job management - Xinhua Network
In an effort to sustain employment support for people living in poverty and consolidate the gains of the expanded anti-poverty campaign, Xinhua News Agency (Reporter Lin Bixer) on 12 December, Yunnan Province recently launched a policy to promote rural renewal and management of rural public service jobs, which will contribute to overall rural revitalization.
According to the Director-General of the Yunnan Department of Human Rights, 448.3 million rural public service jobs are currently being developed in Yunnan for the employment of disadvantaged rural groups, such as the poverty-free labour force, which play an important role in helping the population to grow employment, consolidate the gains of the poverty-eradication campaign and effectively enhance the capacity of rural public services.
The new regulations, issued jointly by the Yunnan People ' s Institute, the Rural Renewal and Finance Sectors, regulate, inter alia, the scope, management of funds, job development, job management, etc. of recruitment for rural public service positions at the grass-roots level.
In terms of job development, the new regulations are clear and are based on the principles of “on-demand, on-post, on-duty, on dynamic management, on volume control” “who develops, who uses, who is responsible” and “one person on one job, on voluntary public, on one hand”.
The recruitment process must be conducted in accordance with such steps as announcement, filing, clearance, publicity, hiring, pre-service training and placement.
In addition, the new regulations specify the specific responsibilities of the rural public service development units, the criteria for subsidies for rural public service jobs and the forms of subsidies, and require the rural public service development units to purchase business insurance for accidents for persons placed in rural public service jobs; the authorities are required to monitor regularly the granting of rural public service job subsidies.
Wrong address.
Hello.
Can we cancel the order?
I'll reorder.
Has it been cancelled?
Second, while the right-wing has a good age in history, it is not long, so it is short because it gives a little light and a little water and sweats, and when it gets better, it gets better and worse.
In fact, however, the right has played an active role in social progress.
The positive significance of the right should not be denied, in terms of ending the culture of truth, developing the economy to improve science and technology and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights guarantees.
Thirdly, as far as I'm concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about his statement and respect the man, Li Weidong, who is serious because he is serious, he is serious about China and he takes its social problems seriously.
But I object to his anti-communist theory, which I believe is counter-required revolution, which inevitably leads to social unrest, loss of livelihood, political groups in the mud, and foreign countries taking advantage.
4. To change or improve China ' s attitude of patience and accountability to the people, political speculation is an attempt to take a chill in the fire. That is not the right, it is an asshole.
Talk left.
Left, actually, is an age and political abandonment.
If right is positive for society and the Communist Party listens to right speech and analyzes their ideas when it needs, then it doesn't work on the left, because it's what the Communist Party throws away!
I've recently seen some friends fighting back and forth, but I don't think so.
Don't even try to reason with the traitors and the left. It's all a stick.
And don't try to prove that we're right, let alone try to get the traitors and the left to admit it.
So We told our friends, "When the traitors call you 50 cents, and when the left scolds your right dog, it proves that our middle path is right."
Many young people also have ideals, but when they grow old, they forget them or pursue them, but they become paranoid.
And the ideals are moving away, and even dragon-killing teenagers will end up dragons.
On the other hand, I think it's generally about restraint and freedom, and China should be left-handed as a whole from the genes of historical culture.
Freedom for the right in the country, efficiency and development, greater regulation for the left, equity and security.
Now society in general wants to focus more on equity, while China and the United States compete with the right to the left, which is expected to last for many years.
I can't read it, it's over.
Don't say anything. It's the way flowers are meant to be.
In the last two years, the embargo and siege imposed by the United States on China's chip have not only left China in an unprecedented situation, but have also caused huge losses to “American” enterprises.
The direct consequence of the US Emperor’s pressure on the Chinese chip industry and its demand that its own and ally-related enterprises simultaneously block our chip industry has been that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers have been affected, leading to lower research and development inputs and reduced capacity in chip-producing companies, and thus to a global shortage of chip supply chains.
Today, the “hardfall” has reached a wide range of industries around the world, such as car stoppages, increased prices for mobile phones, and almost all industries using chips have suffered.
In order to take ownership of the chip, a growing number of countries have embarked on the path of “de-aestheticization”.
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control and to hold back the development of China’s semiconductor industry, the United States recently conducted frequent operations and hosted a “chip summit.” It also invited the 64 giants to form a semiconductor coalition and to invest in supporting the indigenous American technology giants, such as Intel, who spent $20 billion to build two crystal mills in Arizona, and to open up their operations to the public.
When most people think that this move by Intel will have a certain impact on the build-up of electricity, it is likely that it will take away the “job” of the build-up.
The reason for this is that Intel, as an old-fashioned tech giant of the United States empire, has been working in semiconductor areas for decades, with a huge pool of talent and technology, and must be able to rise quickly in the short term to defeat the build-up of electricity.
However, with regard to Intel's decision, Zhang Zhang, the founder of the electricity stock, ignored it.
At the Maestro 2021 think tank forum, held last April, Zhang Zheng Zhong spoke in a surprising manner, and in response to Intel's attempt to invest in the construction of the Crystal Circle factory, Zhang Zhang Zhang Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng was quite ironic: Intel built the chip-generation factory.
Zhang’s contempt for Intel’s entry into the round is due to Zhang’s continued deep-seated feelings about electricity accumulation and Intel more than 30 years ago.
Intel was the jewel of the American Empire's manufacturing industry in the 1960s and 1970s. He was the world's top master in semiconductors.
By the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chips had been held by a few powerful people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip was designed, manufactured and sealed by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this pattern overburdens some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face huge production-line construction costs.
As a result of market demand, after the 1980s, the chip industry began to cooperate in a division of labour, and in 1984 Zhang was told that there were companies specializing in the design of the chip, believing that since it was specifically designed, it would be possible to set up a plant dedicated to the manufacture of the round.
Soon after, Zhang's idea of loyalty became a reality, with the build-up of electricity.
The power builder targeted the main camp operation at a single link of “crystal processing” and, instead of design, provided alternative services for the manufacture of the round.
It was just created, and it was small in front of Intel, the giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang was able to invest in Intel, but when Intel heard that the electricity build was only for the production of the chip industry, it became clear that there was a certain degree of self-esteem, lack of respect for it and a decisive refusal to invest in it.
Zhang Jianxi also concluded that Intel was underestimating the services of the round process.
It was not expected that the giants of the round manufacturing services would not be able to see them back then, but would now begin to do so.
So Zhang Zhongxian finds it ironic that Intel is entering Jingbong.
Today, the market value of the power build exceeds that of Intel.
Intel is also naturally afraid to be self-proclaimed in the face of the strong power of electricity build-up.
Today, the power builder has been sprinting towards the 3 nm chip, while Intel still stands at 14 nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
Wait.
By 19:06, it's been two hours.
I'm here to see some weird hot search today.
What's normal?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: February, when the two dragons rose, the good friends raised prices, the event of the cargo salad, the proliferation of the hysteria formed the peak, and then the [index drop] (slipper curves) eventually disintegrateed, with a re-emergence of the crouples if secondary hysteria occurs.
They seem to be exactly the same as what the Network has shown.
What's unusual?
Six hot searches were randomly selected for the same incident, showing the appearance of "Low Peaks", "Snack Tooth" and "Cyclops".
It is a human heat-up, a rapid rush to heat-search; a periodic heat-up, which ensures that the topic is on the hot list; and a collective evacuation, which is a “functionality” that completes the search and receives a new mission to the new battlefield.
Figure 9 shows that the heat peak of one event coincides with the valley of another event, in which time and seconds, it must be a single wave of water forces on mission to launch a new offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen in dozens of popular searches, which attracts attention, which is in charge of science, which leads to war, which shifts visions, which influences perceptions, which miscalculates, which incites emotion, which decisions are blackmailed, and which black-born accounts are divided into batches and sub-points, taking into account almost all the elements of proliferation.
Dissemination is a science, leaving aside all the subjective elements of position and emotion, from objective data alone, black public relations will be invisible.
And when they pass, they leave traces, so we dig them out together.

First reported cases of infection of the Omique strain - Xinhua Network - among others
Xinhua News, 12 December, Beijing. In Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi, new coronary variants of the Omik strain have recently been reported for the first time.
Mauritius reported for the first time two cases of Omikon virus infection on 10 October.
According to the Maoist Minister of Health, Kelesh Jagutpar, an infected person arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on 27 November; another infected person, a resident of Mauritius, tested positive for nucleic acid on 30 November following contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa.
Following hospital isolation, the results of both patients ' nucleic acid tests were turned negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on 10 October that the country had diagnosed three cases of Omikon virus infection for the first time.
All three were students who had travelled abroad earlier this month and had not been admitted for treatment because they were mild.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omik strain, the Government has been increasing its controls.
From 6 December to 10 January next year, passengers over the age of 12 arriving by air are required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health also announced on 10 days that it would begin to immunize children between 5 and 11 years of age in the country.
The Minister of Health of Malawi, Kubize Chipunda, on 9 September, stated that for the first time, three cases of Omikon virus infection had been detected.
The health sector in the country sequenced 12 new positive samples collected from 9 November to 2 December and found 3 cases of infection.

It was first introduced by friends because of trust, so they chose to look at my initial budget of 70,000 for a basic renovation.
Come to the store and start a series of tricks.
The first time I came to the store was to show them my home chart, they didn't go to the field to measure the house, they could offer me my 135 million house, and they probably showed me their materials and they didn't know what brand they were.
Their second trick is that you'll drag you into the store and pay the deposit.
When I hesitated to pay the deposit, they invited their so-called managers to tell you how much you could give if you paid the deposit today.
This is a big pit, and I'm a living case of being deceived, with more than 10,000 downsides in my head.
The offer he gave me was a lot of questions, not including the utilities, not any doors and cabinets, bathrooms, and these are the cost of the basics.
Apart from these, they also charge higher fees for services than other companies.
I lost my trust in the company and got me to sign the contract when I didn't say anything.
When I went to them to return the money, they showed experience and had a small team to deal with you.
It's a question of the clients who will bite to death in any case.
There is a lot of details about the responsibilities, and I don't want to cry at all, but I don't want them to be chosen, because the house that my friends have been working on for them is of poor quality and you will be paid for it later.
"Papa, they are the decorative faucets of the original lie, and now they are made of beauty, as if they were closed and replaced by other."
So let's not pick this up on Dad's renovation company.
In the future, you will have to look at these consultations more than 100 times when you choose, because the renovation is not a small sum.
If you want to ask a business question, log in or register first.
All forms of business evaluation are strictly forbidden.
The Public Point Design Channel provides you with an address of 360 integrated homes, telephone calls, business hours, and up-to-date business information.
If you're not in 30 minutes, cancel the order!
Is there no other way? Like, a different address?
All right, then don't cancel this conversation. If I don't get my money back in 5 or 10 days, I'll take it.
I asked if 15 minutes would be enough.

There's about 14 days of double meteor showers in the sky.
As a result of the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, on December 12, Xinhua Tianjin (journalist Zhou Yunxian) expert, a neutron meteor shower of one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere is expected to take place on December 14th.
Astronomer Angu, Beijing City, shot the Gemini meteor shower in Qinghai on 13 December 2018.
Most of the parent bodies of meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent bodies of double meteor showers are the same as Asteroid 3200, an Apollo-type asteroid.
Geministroid rain is also the second known meteor shower not to be "breathed" by comets.
The director of the Astronomy Society of Tianjin City and an expert in astronomy, Shu Li Peng, explained that, as in the case of a large film of the age of the year, double-situation meteor showers generally appeared at the end of the year and that the “show period” could last from 4 to 17 December.
The meteor shower, known for its high and steady flow, is known as the three northern hemisphere meteor showers, along with the mesmerized meteor showers and the Anglican meteor showers.
A striking feature of the biennial meteor shower is that it is slow, colourful and numerous and suitable for both visual and astronomical photography by beginners.
Astronomical fan of Tianjin City, Yang Zheng, shot the Gemini meteor shower in Tianjin State on 13 December 2020.
Astronomical forecasts indicate that this year's double-combustion meteor showers will be extremely high at around 1500 hours on December 14, when ZHR (the number of meteors per hour when radiation points are directly above the top of the head under ideal observation) is 150.
A recommended index map of the biennial meteor shower.
“Last year, the `defunct' double meteor showers were impressive, but this year's internecine meteor showers will be disrupted by moonlight, with a slight discount.
On November 11, 14th, the lunar moon, the bright moon will disrupt observations, and the moon will fall in the middle of the night, at which point the radiation point of the neutron meteor shower will rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the hours behind the middle of the night. It's not like it's a bad idea.
How can more meteors be observed as far as possible?
“No urban observation is recommended, but it is possible to select a high-altitude, light-horizon, and north-east-oriented horizon in the suburbs or villages, and then patiently wait until the moon falls.
It should be noted that the flow of neutron meteor showers in all directions is large, and observations do not always focus on the radiation spots of the neutron meteor showers.
Friends who like photography want to film the glamorous "shows of meteor showers" better choose a wide angle, a large radial lens, using high ISO and the largest radium.
Three tripods, backup batteries and fast-line lines are also essential for stability and continuity. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Shu Lipen warned.
How does laser television and traditional television differ in market positioning?
In my understanding, traditional television, as the subject is, should refer to LCD television, while the difference between laser television and LCD television in market positioning is, inter alia, the following:
First, laser television is more focused on the big screen market.
Compared to the full market positioning of LCD TV, it is clear that laser television is more focused on the big screen market or that laser television itself is the product of large screens.
Currently, mainstream LCD television is more than 55 to 65 inches, while laser television is typically more than 75 inches, with the largest size exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting users ' needs for large screen colours.
In recent years, the share of laser television in global output and sales has been increasing, accounting for over 60 per cent of total television sales of 80 inches and above.
In 2020, the laser television market will grow by more than 140 per cent and will continue to grow at a high rate, according to China’s projections.
This success in the big screen market is largely due to the excellent performance of laser television in eye protection.
Based on the principles of image of laser television, the light from laser light sources does not go straight into the eyeball, and the imaging process is closer to the imaging of objects under natural conditions and less irritating to the eye than the back light from LCD.
Cessy Laboratory and Beijing Concordat Hospital ophthalmologist at the China Institute for the Standardization of Electronic Technology have produced 144 sets of test data through a rigorous comparison experiment with laser television and LCD television under the same conditions as the population.
The data confirm that laser television does have a strong eye-protective character and even some improvement in a given context.
At a time when the importance of visual health is growing, laser television not only attracts a growing number of users by virtue of eye-protective advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the colour market.
Second, laser television focuses more on high-end markets.
Contrary to the constant downward trend in LCD television prices, the price of laser television, which is currently sold for more than 10,000 dollars, has risen as sizes and light sources have risen.
Why would you sell laser TV so expensive?
There must be a point.
With the continued development of light sources and technology, laser television has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD television and projection.
With the use of ultra-short focus projection techniques, the projection distance for laser television is much shorter than that for the traditional projector, allowing for a 100-inch screen experience within a short distance, the space required and the small size of the host and the size of the space occupied.
In terms of brightness, large brands of laser television can reach more than 2,000 fluents.
This, together with lower heat, reduced equipment losses and longer life expectancy for television.
In addition to this, many high-end laser television sets carry many front-line technologies, such as real 4K super-high-level graphics, artificial intelligence systems, bioscreens and so forth, which can bring even more dramatic audio-visual experiences to users.
It is not a fake demand, but a product of a breakdown of demand, a theory of the quality and input output. Laser television is not a video player's dish. It is not enough to balance screens with viewing environments. It is possible to try, everything is good or bad, and it is sufficient to weigh its own judgement after it has passed.
In short, the ultra-wide angle close-focus projector, Laser Television, had to use expensive hyper-wide lenses and mirrors to get close to the curtain, which did not fit the best optical design.
In order to shield some of the environmental light, the fennel curtains using microstructures are expensive, and the price of 80 inches is basically 65 inches of liquid crystals.
And one more thing, I particularly hate projectors who sell the light of the screen when it's good for their eyes. Come on, the light that you can see in your eyes is a direct light, you can't see it on the ceiling, you can't see it, you can't see it, you can't see it, you can't see it.
Moreover, the projection screen would never have been a reflection.
It's hard to ignore the hot spots of the high-yield curtain, and it's hard to see a large amount of light from one angle to the eye.
There's not a branch yet.
If you add a date to the letter, you send me an optional schedule.
Before we went, we saw pictures of the shop, more of the outdoor wedding dress, which was beautiful and involved a lot of filming styles.
After that day, I had a brief exchange of ideas with my sister, and I was very patient in trying out two of my tangled styles, and finally I was able to finalize my makeup, and the photographer was able to put up some props, which would guide the movement and refine the details.
But maybe it's not the style I want, but it's a nice little bit.
After that, the photographer will help pick the photos, share the later style, and feel very careful.
It'll take about half a month to fix it.
For the second time, there was a real-style dinner event – most of the clothes were able to choose one shot.
Finally, a black dress was chosen to experience different styles.
It takes about two hours to film, make-up + shoot, and the photographer in charge is the younger brother after 95.
Photo-visual aesthetics' preferred quality store.
Let's see Queenie too.
When you go to the store, fill out your name phone and choose your dress, you can choose your wedding dress, you'll be patient in three or four outfits, you've been wearing makeup for a long time, you've got a service attitude, you'll be taught in the back, you'll have a big face, you'll have a half month, three or four days, and you'll feel like it's not different from the original.
The environment is all right.
There are many options.
There's almost three make-up positions. There's a studio inside.
It's very warm and very careful.
The stylist is patient.
The photographers will teach you very carefully.
Unsatisfactory, photographers also offer to supplement.
"Empirical" may have gone too far, with three eyelids on it.
The eyebrows have also been shaved, which is a little awkward for not drawing a eyebrow.
Photos have been given for 10 days, but the P-chart is not very satisfactory, and it's still clear that those are covered with eyes.
Because I didn't know exactly what style I wanted, I tried two sets, and I picked out the black dress, and my sister said it was more Hepburn retrospect.
The hairdresser and the hairdresser's little sister are so patient that they're helping me get it.
I started taking pictures after my hair was done.
After the shoot, he chose four of his favorite masters.
It's been three days since I didn't answer... and I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee program because your system can't identify my credit card!
The strangest thing is that I used the same credit card every time I paid.
I pay freight every time now.
You'll be excused. I'll charge you my monthly fee after your investigation, okay?

From the standpoint of conditionality: According to the Regulation of Insurance Brokering Agencies (Revised 2015), three keywords must be met for becoming an insurance brokerage company: shareholders, sponsors with no record of major violations in the last three years, a minimum of 50 million yuan yuan, and the agreement of the China Insurance Supervisory Board.
These three are harsh, and in sum, they are strong, approved by the National Authority of the Silver Insurance Board (which supervises insurance companies and banks throughout the country), with good behaviour on the part of shareholders, and, as insurance agents, with little umbrella insurance, the insured do not have to question the formality of the small umbrella insurance, which, after all, is not an insurance company.
At this point, it's good and trustworthy.
In terms of insurance products: Small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket in which many companies sell their star-on-the-star risk insurance, such as the most recent top-up and super-mary-five. The claimants and insurers live with Thai life. Small umbrella insurance is a third-party intermediary without questioning its specter.
In terms of the contribution model: Internet platform products, because of the lower operating costs of the network and the cost of the employee ' s salaries, are more widely priced and paid in a flexible manner to support monthly payments, reduce the contributor ' s contribution pressure and maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's still very good.
Consider it.
This is particularly important in the light of the professionalism of the operator, since insurance is a highly specialized industry in which many Internet users can be insured themselves, and there are many errors in this area, where non-insured workers tend to add their own subjective awareness, feel healthy or conform to insurance, and are vulnerable to a number of potential claims risks.
I myself was a very responsible teller of insurance phone sales in the “Intelligence Microsecurity” (like a small umbrella, an Internet insurance broker platform).
The insurance of the Internet is real and reliable, and it is not human, and Internet channels have no professional practitioners and many sales are misleading.
For example, a $1 insurance policy of $6 million, the purchase of a mobile phone, and the free receipt of 60,000, are marketing strategies that do not go wrong, but do not go so far as to tell the insured that the first month, the next month, is a normal charge, ranging from a few dozen to 200, and that it is not clear what many customers buy for a year or two.
I thought I could spend a dollar and the insurance company would pay $6 million.
The free delivery of a cell phone is done by the end of a policy such as 666,88888, a special policy, and if the winning text message is sent, it will not be exchanged or warned.
(This is another pit for an insured person) The 60 000 sickness insurance premium is short-term, if this alone is not the case, if there is no other commercial risk, if there is a serious illness, if there is no problem, if there is no problem, if there is no problem, if there is no problem, if there is no problem, then life begins to run naked.
At present, the State is also taking a heavy toll on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So in sum, the platform is free of problems, the products are free of problems and the professionalism and professional integrity of the operators are problematic.
It is suggested that the subject matter of the proposal be considered together with the fact that many of the offline insurance brokers produce a wider range of products, have more opportunities and products of choice for their customers, and that some products have a better value than Internet products.
I myself helped 59 Internet customers, insured under-line products and saved 2000-3,000 yuan per person per year.
If you have any questions, you are welcome to communicate with me.
I: Minya insurance broker, who has had three years of training in business management, has served nearly a thousand business users, has cooperated with over 100 insurance companies, and before taking insurance, I will tailor the insurance products to the client ' s needs, have insurance coverage, have insurance coverage for three clients, have the best possible results for the client, have insurance coverage, have insurance policies prepared for the client, have insurance policies in place, and have insurance policies in place to keep the client safe.
Growing up with every customer.
I hope my answer will help the subject!
According to the definition of the Superintendency of Insurance, Internet insurance is the insurance activity whereby the insured person is able to perform all insurance processes independently by clicking on the insurance link.
During this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign, and all steps can be performed by the policyholder on its own.
Although Internet insurance coverage is not too “ceremonial” and may not even have printed paper contracts, it does not in any way affect the validity and legal validity of electronic contracts.
This pattern is somewhat similar to “telemarket” run-through operations, but there is also a fatal problem with the purchase of insurance, which is that — follow-up services may fail to keep pace.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract for decades, and when we buy it, should we consider whether the “intermediary” that we choose is an “insurance broker” who can be with us for a long time and who will provide services to us many years later?
How do I get in touch with the caterer?
It's almost 3:00.
Is that for me?
I said knock and deliver.
But the rider left it at the door, and the man left.
It's wrong.
Your riders have already taken one of my take-outs, but they're still telling us to wait.
The rider received my delivery at 1925, but still refused to leave.
I'll get it. Do you want another takeout?
What do we do?
Where's your rider?
Still waiting?
I'm sending the bill.
Okay, if you don't cancel, I'll call the police.
But my food will have problems with hygiene.

Just get back to the code.
No problem. Don't have to arrange a new delivery. I've bought another one.
Thanks for your help.
I have been opposed to any form of stigmatization and verbal abuse, much less to such physical attacks.
In a civilized society, we can be all-inclusive, but we want to put an end to that evil.
It is this uncivilist style to resist first without looking at political parties and factions.
I've been unresponsive since you started sending Facebook and friends' requests, and then putting on a tactful post, and when you try to put my home and father's name on social media.
You not only kept me on the frequency of six meals a day, but also on Facebook with your so-called friends, who continued to talk about my subtle, humiliating remarks, appearances, body sizes, well-bred beds, strawberries, or any other kind of message.
I didn't know that I had received a statement from a number of friends about your Facebook friend's account with a picture of you and sexual harassment.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can't keep quiet anymore.
When I called the police, you didn't take it down, but you got more aggressive.
I don't care what your political background is, whatever your status is, and in our society, both sexes need respect.
Yes, you can continue with the tone, the invisibility, the humiliation, the insults, and you can continue to say that you only care and care for me, and you can continue to believe that this is not harassment, that you can continue to deny that it is not you or that you continue to make all offensive statements.
Yeah, I can't, I can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you. I don't need you to comment.
I don't even think there's a girl who wants to be so humiliated to become famous.
My friends asked me, how are you?
I said yes and you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being so bullied.
In the workplace, in society, in politics or in business, only those who do not even have basic qualities would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is within our hearts.
I stopped some messages for comment.
I don't think anyone can pretend to be you.
All I can say is that you are a civil enemy.
I'll laugh.
Viet Nam People ' s Network - Prime Minister of the Government of Viet Nam, Van Ming, attended the Third National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum of Viet Nam
Two major meetings were held during the third National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum in Viet Nam, focusing on the two main themes of digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development in the context of and after the new coronary pneumonia outbreak.
The Minister of Communications and Media, Nguyen Meng Hsiung, stated that in 2021, despite the continued spread of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, the number of digital technology enterprises and operating revenues in Viet Nam continued to grow at almost 10 per cent.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products cultivated in Viet Nam focused on the major challenges faced by Viet Nam, many of which had moved out of the country and Viet Nam ' s digital technology ranking had risen.
Minister Nguyen Meng Hung called on the digital technology enterprises to assume responsibility for the development of national digital transformation platforms, whose task was to assume a national role.
At the Forum, the leaders of various sectors and State institutions are sharing groundbreaking ideas and solutions for the mobilization and pooling of social resources for the development of Vietnamese technology enterprises by enterprises, organizations and individuals involved in researching, developing, applying and transferring digital technologies, and working together to advance the country ' s digital transformation and economic recovery from the Zhu Hui epidemic.
In his address to the Forum, Prime Minister van Ming Jing stressed that digital transformation is the path to the world and the objective need for development.
The digital transformation has become a global problem, with digital transformation serving the entire population and thus involving all.
People and businesses are at the heart of the digital transformation, the main subjects, the goals and the driving forces.
Therefore, all policies need to be for people and businesses.
Prime Minister van Mingzheng stressed that the digital transition needed to reflect the national spirit, be dominated by internal forces, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, and that external forces were important and a breakthrough.
At the same time, he believed that digital transformation needed to drive deep and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, economic recovery and development, respond to subsequent changes, overcome natural resource depletion and contribute to the green transition and the development of green energy.
Digital transformation requires participation in the development of databases for the preservation and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, national culture and human condition, and the promotion of digital transformation in areas such as banking, taxation, land management and the development of databases and logistics.
The greatest objective of the digital transition is to make people happier and the country more prosperous.
Prime Minister Fan called for greater leadership and guidance from all levels of government, agencies and enterprises in the development of digital technologies, increased awareness of the digital transition, continued development and improvement of institutions for digital transformation, strengthened national governance and the promotion of digital technology enterprise development in a spirit of respect, communication, listening, active and proactive spirit.

The Yangtze Dry Stream achieves full coverage of the Aquatic Green Service Area - Xinhua Network
On December 11th, Xinhua (Reporter Wang Xian) Chongqing City, the Green Service Area on Water was inaugurated and operational as scheduled on the 10th day, the 2nd Water Service Area on the Upper Gang following the 8th day when the Green Service Area on Water was inaugurated in Kauzhou, Sichuan Province.
As a result, the Aquatic Green Integrated Service Area has covered the Yangtze Upper, Middle and Lower River.
The Minister of Transport and Transport, Deputy Director-General of the Jiangjia Authority, Qiu Kianhua, said that prior to that, the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu had established 10 water-green integrated service areas in the middle and lower part of the Yangtze River, which had been recognized by a large number of crew members and had played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze shipping.
The full coverage of the aquatic green service area is another milestone in the construction of the Yangtze green shipping industry, which has significantly improved its capacity to receive pollutants and shipping services.
It was described as an important facility to provide a full range of production and living services to a large number of ships and crews, and to help a large number of crews to address the issue of “punishment”.
The construction of two watery green integrated service areas in the Upper Yangtze, which combines living, production and political services, with the theme of greening the environment, and with ship maintenance and ship emergency services, will make it possible for ships to “one-stop, multiple services” in Hong Kong to work more efficiently and easily for the crew of the Yangtze.
The U.S. Triangular carrier assembled the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam and rarely visited Guam 2022-01-17 indo-CCP media: the latest news on relations between China and the United States: the latest satellite imagery shows that three American carriers are gathering around China; the U.S. media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal visited Guam, sending important signals to US allies and opponents in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to China's think tank, the South China Sea Strategic Posture Awareness Platform, on 9 January, a satellite discovered the carrier of the American Army Carl Vincent near the Balabak Strait.
The Balabak Strait links the South Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic feature of the Western Pacific First Island chain.
The platform foresees the deployment of Carl Vincent to the South China Sea.
This was the first deployment of the carrier Karl Vincent on board the F-35C fighter jet and the CV-22 Fishhawk.
In addition to the Carl Vincent in the Pacific, the American carrier, which is now in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, is the carrier of the Abraham Lincoln, which left the United States on 3 January.
For the first time, the Lincoln also carried a squadron of F-35C, which was the 314th fighter aircraft of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the United States Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the carrier of the United States Ronald Reagan, which is docked in Yoshuga, Japan.
The carrier battle group also included the Shangplan missile cruiser and the Stokdar missile destroyer.
On January 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Posture Awareness Platform released the latest satellite images showing three American carriers gathering around China.
On January 17, 2022, the United States warship carrier CMV-22B flight route.
Also reported by CNN on 17 January, one of the most powerful weapons in the United States Navy's arsenal visited Guam rare last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine, the Nevada (USNevada), carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads entered the United States Naval Base on Guam on Saturday (15 January).
The three American carriers assembled around China with the most powerful weapons to visit Guam rarely, according to analysis, as a signal to allies and enemies in the growing tension in the India-Pacific region.
This was the first visit of a United States ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The U.S. and three carriers gathered around China with the most powerful weapons to visit Guam and China has built a large number of military facilities in the South Sand Islands in recent years.
The figure is China's Young-soon Island in the South Sa Islands.
In its statement, the United States Navy stated that the visit to Guam of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada had enhanced cooperation between the United States and its regional allies, demonstrating the capabilities, flexibility, operational readiness of the United States and its continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as “Boomer submarine”.
The movement of 14 “thundering submarines” in the United States naval fleet is usually strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made “mined submarines” “the most important survival weapon of the three nuclear communities”, a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles located on the United States soil, as well as bombers with nuclear warheads, such as B-2 and B-52.
Talk to friends about the recent fall of Meta by 26 per cent, the evaporation of the market value of $25.1 billion, and Zuckerberg's response to "unprecedented competition," for what reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company whose income comes mainly from advertising, which today earns money and has its own flow channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and so on, whatever functional location, is Meta's traffic channel.
Moreover, Meta is the largest Advertising Alliance, with many App ads outside of Meta, and through Meta's advertising platform, it is becoming a reality.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment in apple privacy policy, Meta had difficulty gaining access to user data, which affected the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, and it is clear that the user is giving App access to its own information, and most normal reactions are certainly not.
Next thing you know, if Google stabs again, it'll have a bigger impact on Meta's income.
Second, the former Chinese factor in Meta ' s income growth has also weakened (the weight of this factor is not certain, but it does exist).
Everyone normally knows Meta has no business in China, but this is not an accurate understanding.
Every year at least 10 per cent of Meta's income comes from China, mainly from companies that conduct maritime operations in China.
Meta's office is about a few hundred people in Hong Kong, and there are several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies are trying to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an unwieldy advertising channel, and most of the burning money goes to Meta.
Interestingly, the byte TT is one of Meta's main competitors, but the first two years, Meta made a lot of money from the byte.
Every agent in the country is helping bytes to go to Meta, where they advertise, and Meta Central China is doing very well.
I haven't been special lately, but certainly not better than before.
The stage of large-scale burning of money abroad by Chinese companies has passed.
Thirdly, the expansion of new flow channels has not been smooth.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets look not only at middle income, but more importantly at future expectations.
Apparently, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg told the "Message."
It is true that the meta-cosm should be one of the directions of the future, but it has a longer implementation cycle, and this story should not support the market value of Meta in these two or three years.
So for the next two years, it's supposed to be a tough time for Meta.
Instead of looking at Facebook, which is now very popular, with an income of between $100 billion and $200 billion a year, Facebook is in fact a very dangerous place, with no good safe moat compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
While some of his social software is now high daily and mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp and so on, Facebook has little confidence in the rapid development of tiktok, and subversion is a blinking exercise.
And the idea of a mercantile universe, with no prospect of success at all in a short time, makes Facebook very dangerous, and that's why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for the root cause of the new track, but I think his track was wrong, and it's not a way back.

Successful conclusion of joint exercises of the two forces of China, Viet Nam and Viet Nam, “Peace Rescue-2021” on guard duty — Xinhua Network
On the morning of December 12, Xinhua's 12th (Zhou Na Ten Huaijin), the Chinese team, which participated in the joint exercise of the two Chinese Viet Nam troops “Peace Rescue-2021”, returned safely to Guangxi, China, marking the successful completion of this seven-day training mission.
The joint presentation, which focused on the important issue of humanitarian medical assistance, and focused on the task of protecting and assisting the dead and wounded, resulted in the completion of courses on joint security command, on-site rescue and mass casualty disposal, in accordance with operational standards, which effectively enhanced the security capabilities of the two forces.
The results of the exercise were confirmed by the two forces.
At the end of the exercise, the Director of the Steering Committee of the Viet Nam Exercise, the Deputy Director of Logistics and Chief of Staff of the Viet Nam People ' s Army, Nguyen Hsiung, said that, as a result of the exercise, Vietnamese military doctors had learned from Chinese military doctors about the organization of the exercise and professional activities, as well as about Chinese medical and security equipment.
The results of the exercise demonstrated the expertise of the military medical forces of both countries in medical assistance, disease prevention and control.
The Director of the Chinese Steering and Coordination Group and Deputy Director of the Health Department of the Central Military Commission ' s Logistics and Security Department, Chen Chun-ming, stated that the exercise was an important milestone in the development of innovative practices based on the successful organization of joint medical consultations in 2018.
During the exercise, the People ' s Liberation Army of China donated medical protective masks, medical protective clothing and rapid nucleic acid detection instruments to the Viet Nam People ' s Army.
