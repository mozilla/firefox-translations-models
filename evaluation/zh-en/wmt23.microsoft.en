THE DESCRIPTION C AND C++ COMPILERS ARE INTEGRATED. They all process the input file in one or more of the four steps: preprocessing, Hii (compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking).
The postname of the source file identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the postname controls the default setting:
GCC considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a C file, and sets the C connection.
G++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a C++ file and sets the connection in C++.
The postscript name of the source file indicates the language type and the subsequent operation:
.c C source program; Preprocessing, compilation, assembly
. C C++ source program; Preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.cc C++ source code; Preprocessing, compilation, assembly
. CXX C++ source code; Preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.m Objective-C source program; Preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.i preprocessed c file; Compilation, compilation
.ii preprocessed C++ files; Compilation, compilation
.s assembly language source program; compilation
assembly language source programs; Pre-processing, compilation
.h preprocessor file; Files with other postnames that don't normally appear on the command line are passed to the linker (Linker) and typically include:
.0 Object file
.a Archive file
Unless the -cec, -s, or -e options are used (or a compilation error prevents the full process), the connection is always the last step.
During the connection phase, all .e files, -1 library files, and unrecognized file names corresponding to the source program (including the specified .o H label files and .a library files) are passed to the connector options in the order in the command line
The options must be given discretely : de ' completely different from '-d -r '.
Most '-=E: and '-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -wname and -wno- name).
Here are just a few examples of formats that are not the default options.
Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations placed in the following sections.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Explicitly indicate that the language of the input file is language (not the default choice from the filename).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next '-x' option .language is available
Turn off any explicit language descriptions, so the file is processed according to the file name post-file RE AS E ' -x' option).
If you are only working on a subset of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembly, joining), you can use the '-x' option (or Ah-after the filename) to tell the geo where to start and the '~-c', '-s', or '-E' options to tell the geo where to end. Note that some combinations of options (e.g., '-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble the source file, ETER. By default, GCC replaces the source file name with '.o' and '.ec' to mark the file name. You can use the -o option to choose a different name. GCC ignores the -ec option behind any unrecognized input of Wenber -S F whatever.
The target file.
After compilation, it stops, and does not assemble the parts.
Work is done using pipelines instead of temporary files between different stages of the compilation process, because the assemblers of those systems cannot read data from the pipes, and the GNU assemblers do not have this problem, and the assemblers are able to accept C "dialects": support for ANSI-compliant C programs.
This disables some of the feature keywords in the GNU CC that are incompatible with ANSI CC, as well as features such as unix and vax, which indicate that the ANSI trigraph is rarely used, as well as the ban on all standard libraries in the hosted environment, and the main function returns an int value, typical for almost all programs except the kernel. There is no standard library in the corresponding stand-alone environment (f£reestanding environment), and the application entry is not necessarily main, the most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For details, please refer to the latest information on the GCC website)
For function declarations without arguments, e.g. 'int foo(); ', in C style --- i.e. does not specify the number or type of parameters. (C++ only).
Normally, such a function foo in C++ means that the argument is empty.
The list of sections is removed from here to try to support some aspects of the traditional C compiler.
See the NU c manual for details, we've removed the details, so that when the content is outdated, people won't heri.
Except for one thing: for C++ programs (not C), the '-traditional' option brings an added effect that allows this to be assigned.
It has the same effect as the '-Ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of traditional cc preprocessors.
In particular, the preprocessor is mentioned above, but does not include the other effects of the '-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of the '$' character in identifiers (C++ only).
You can specify the '"-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly prohibit the use of the '$' character.
(GNU C++ allows the '$' character by default on some target systems, but not for all systems.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows an implicit conversion of an ant type to an enumeration type (MEF c++).
Normally GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not vice versa.
-fexternal-—templates generate smaller code for template declarations (C++ only) by generating a copy of each template function where they are defined.
To use this option successfully, you must mark '#pragma implementatio' (definition) or '#Pragma interface' (declaration) in all files that use the template.
When a program is compiled with '-fexternal-templates', the template instantiation is all external. You have to make the required instance appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved with a typedef, which references every instance that is needed.
Correspondingly, if the default option '-fno-exteznal-templates' is used at compile time, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.
All member functions (except constructor functions and mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class.
This does not mean that every call to a member function will pass through the inner virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; In this case, the .
-fcond-mismatch allows the type of the second and third arguments of the conditional expression to not match.
The value of this expression is Void.-fthis-—is-variable allows you to assign a value to this (only for C++).
Merging the user-defined free storage management mechanism into C++ makes the assignable 'this' seem out of place.
Therefore, by default, the assignment of this inside the class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backwards compatibility, you can make this work with the '-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, just like unsigned char.
Each machine has its own default char type. It could be either unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, when relying on the symbolic nature of the data, a portable program should always use either signed char or unsigned chaz.
But many programs have been written with simple char, and this is a signed number (or an unsigned number, depending on the target machine).
This option, and its antonym option, make that program work on the corresponding defaults.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If the 'signed' or 'unsigned' modifier is not explicitly declared, these options are used to define either a signed bitfield or an unsigned bitfield.
By default, bitfields are signed, because they inherit from the basic integer type, such as int, which is signed, however, if the '-traditional' option is specified, the bitfield is always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in writable data segments, and does not treat them as special.
This is to be compatible with some older programs, where changing string constants is a very bad idea, and the '-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive Summary
The impact of COVID on the drug market
The impact could be similar to the economic crisis of 2008
The global coronavirus pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has overwhelmed health care providers and brought them to the brink of collapse, and the restrictions imposed by governments have caused serious disruption in the global economy.
For the drug market, the impact of the pandemic is unclear and difficult to predict, but it has the potential to be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as the restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and basic chemicals.
Traffickers are unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions and may have to find new routes and methods.
Patterns of drug use and delivery are likely to change, and the government's ability to respond may be hampered.
The transformation brought about by the coronavirus is unprecedented, but there are lessons to be learned from previous crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to look for cheaper synthetic substances and shifted their usage patterns to injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments have cut drug-related budgets.
Interventions and treatment services such as drug use prevention and related risky behaviours could be hit hard if governments respond in the same way to the current recession.
In addition, interdiction operations and international cooperation may be given less priority, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Drug trafficking is expected to be most directly affected by the smuggling of large quantities of drugs by commercial flights in a number of countries.
There are messengers who carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in carry-on backpacks or hidden in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. With restrictions on air passenger traffic in place almost everywhere, the use of commercial air travel for the supply of drugs could be completely disrupted.
Despite disruptions to the international postal supply chain, trafficking using the dark web and mailing is likely to increase.
In the long run, the recession and related lockdowns could disrupt the drug market.
As a result of rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poor and vulnerable groups will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug addiction disorders and turn to illicit drug-related activities, whether in production or transportation.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of the situation to provide services to vulnerable populations and recruit new members to bolster their ranks.
As the government's ability to respond decreases, these shifts can quickly take root and become a new reality for many communities.
Expansion and complexity
Market growth
The population growth pattern partly explains the reason for the market expansion
Drug abuse has been increasing around the world, both in terms of overall figures and the proportion of drug users in the world's population.
In 2009, there were an estimated 210 million drug users, or 4.8 per cent of the global population aged 15-64 years, compared to an estimated 269 million in 2018, or 5.3 per cent of this population.
Over the past two decades, drug abuse in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.
This partly reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, with 7% in developed countries versus 28% in developing countries, but also a faster increase in young populations in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.
Between 2000 and 2018, the population of this age group in developing countries increased by 16 per cent, while that of developed countries decreased by 10 per cent.
1 Urbanization is a driver of the current and future drug market
Drug abuse is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas, both in developed and developing countries.
The overall increase in drug abuse is partly due to the massive rural-urban migration of people from rural to urban areas, with more than half of the world's population now living in urban areas, up from 34 per cent in 1960.
Urbanization could be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more prominent.
Increases in wealth are associated with increased drug abuse, but the poorest people bear the greatest burden of disease worldwide, and drug abuse is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are even more strongly linked to the wealthier parts of the world.
Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug abuse is higher among the affluent segments of society.
However, the higher rates of transition to drug abuse are among people of lower socioeconomic status.
Data from a few countries show a link between harmful patterns of drug use and pathologies and low income.
These patterns appear to be less common in the more affluent social classes.
The economic constraints caused by the global coronavirus crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been linked to an increase in drug abuse in the past, and the pandemic has forced tens of millions of people around the world to lose their jobs.
The coronavirus pandemic could lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illicit crop cultivation, either because of reduced control by state authorities, or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities in the face of an economic crisis.
Covid-related restrictions have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, which may have led to an increase in trafficking by sea, with a low risk of interception at sea and more than smuggling by air or land.
Recently, there have been reports of cocaine shipments being shipped directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Increased complexity
The emergence of substances not under international control is stable, but the number of potentially harmful new types of opioids is increasing, and the drug market is becoming increasingly complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as marijuana, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs, many of which are not under international control, have been added. The non-medical use of pharmaceuticals is also increasing rapidly.
There are about 500 new active substances in the domestic markets of Member States each year.
Most of them are currently stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and small amounts of opioids.
While the overall number of NPS has stabilized, the proportion has changed.
Opioids accounted for only 2 per cent of the total number of NPS types identified in 2014, but by 2018 this figure had risen to 9 per cent.
Many of the new psychoactive opioids are analogues of fentanyl, and their efficacy and harm have been demonstrated, causing overdose deaths in North America and to a lesser extent in other regions.
In North America, fentanyl is used either as a doping agent for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, or as a counterfeit pharmaceutical opioid.
There is some evidence that injection of new psychoactive substances is also happening in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes were contaminated with new psychoactive substances that produce stimulant effects》
2 The use of NPS is likely to become increasingly entrenched in vulnerable populations
A single class of NPS almost never forms a large market.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two countries reported on the use of novel psychoactive substances in prisons, with most identifying synthetic cannabinoids as a major challenge.
The control of precursor chemicals has forced drug producers to innovate, and many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors in the synthesis of drugs such as amphetamines, methamphetamines and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and drug producers have been looking for alternatives not only to less regulated substances, but also to chemicals specifically designed to circumvent control, so-called "specially crafted precursors".
Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus are likely to further squeeze drug producers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: in March 2020, a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia was reported to have contributed to higher methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.
The market is changing rapidly
Synthetic drugs replace opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opiate market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The number of opiates seized by the authorities of the Russian Federation has decreased by about 80 per cent, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use has decreased significantly.
But the doping market seems to be booming.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including mephedrone and a-pyrrolididone, are now ubiquitous on the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities have reported a sharp increase in the number of clandestine laboratories for the manufacture of various illicit drugs recently seized, more than doubling in two years, to 152 in 2018.
The methamphetamine market in Afghanistan and Iraq is growing
As early as 2012, investigations of personnel in hospitals, prisons and other institutions revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystalline methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern in addition to fenatalin and tramadol.
These findings were further confirmed by a 2015 study, with drug users saying marijuana was more difficult to obtain than "fenmetaline" or methamphetamine.
Recently, the Iraqi authorities have discovered a number of methamphetamine processing sites, and the Board has expressed concern about the large importation of pseudoephedrine preparations, which are used as precursors.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacturing appears to have started in 2014.
Since then, methamphetamine seizures have been steadily rising.
However, seizures in the first half of 2019 amounted to 1^657 kg – a significant increase compared to the previous year.
Large seizures of methamphetamine, believed to have originated in Afghanistan, in other countries are also indicative of a rapid increase in production in the country.
Policy changes and trends
Most jurisdictions where non-medical use of cannabis has been legalized have seen an increase in cannabis use
11 jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although similar trends have been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized cannabis for non-medical use.
Colorado and Washington, the first two states in the U.S. to pass legislation, have seen an increase in non-medical marijuana use by adults, particularly in the past month and on a daily or nearly daily basis, which has surpassed the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that cannabis use in Uruguay has increased since 2011, almost doubling in the last month.
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is regular and frequent cannabis use.
Canada's short-term data also shows that the expansion of the legal market in 2018 and 2019 was accompanied by an increase in usage.
However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still relied on illegal sources to obtain certain products.
Is the reason behind the collapse of global marijuana herb seizures due to the legalization of cannabis?
In 2018, global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years, due to a decline in seizures in North America, which has fallen by 84% over the past 10 years.
In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled over the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market have played a key role in the decline.
The regulation of NPS appears to have a deterrent effect, and the regulatory effect of NPS in China is still difficult to assess.
Some countries with different regulatory regimes for NPS have shown different prevalence rates of NPS use.
In other countries, the adoption of domestic legislation has led to a reduction in the use of NPS.
Vulnerable populations are exposed to the licit and illicit drug markets, and pharmaceutical opioids for pain management and palliative care are mainly available in high-income countries, with painkillers unevenly distributed across regions.
In 2018, more than 90% of all pharmaceutical opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
These countries account for about 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that low- and middle-income countries account for 88% of the global population, but consume less than 10% of medicinal opioids.
Barriers to access to pharmaceutical opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices.
Poorer people are at greater risk of developing drug use disorders, with about 35.6 million people living with them in 2018.
Poverty, limited education and social marginalization can increase the risk of drug use and exacerbate its consequences. This is confirmed by studies in high-income countries, where an individual's unfavourable socioeconomic trajectory is associated not only with their status at a given point in time, but also with the risk of drug use disorders.
Drug abuse also reinforces socio-economic disadvantage and further increases the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thereby contributing to the vicious cycle of disadvantage. These results may also be associated with insulting attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, sexually diverse groups, persons displaced by armed conflict or disasters, and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug use or have problems accessing treatment services.
Based on the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) indicators, which estimate the number of healthy life years lost due to disability and premature death, the wider social impact of harmful drug use has increased over the past 10 years.
Between 2007 and 2018, the number of global disability-adjusted life years attributed to drug use increased by 17%.
The increase in disability-adjusted life (DALYs) associated with liver cancer, which is common among people who inject drugs, was particularly high – 40%.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex, and it is difficult to determine all causal relationships between psychoactive substance use and violence.
Limited data on a global scale suggest that intoxication may be a significant factor in homicide.
But alcohol appears to play a greater role than drugs in violence.
While drug use can lead to crime, in some cases, this link can be attributed in part to multiple mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risks, family circumstances, and peer influences.
The link between drug trafficking and violence is manifold.
Large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, may be carried out without violence if stable criminal structures are in place.
In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depends not so much on the amount of trafficking as on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power among organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.
The latest trends
Drug-based marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids are the most harmful
An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most used drug in the world.
This compares with 58 million opioid users in 2018.
However, the harms associated with opioids have been overlooked because of fewer users.
Of the estimated 167,000 deaths associated with drug use in 2017, 66 per cent were caused by these substances, and 50 per cent of the 21 million years of life lost believed to be due to disability or premature death due to drug use.
The non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis
In West, Central and North Africa, it is tramadol that exacerbates the opioid crisis; In North America, it's fentanyl. The two regions have little in common in terms of economy, demographics, or general patterns of drug use, but both struggle to combat the opioid crisis, fueled by easily available and low-cost substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the U.S. involved fentanyl.
Canada reported similar results, albeit in lower numbers.
Fentanyl causes overdose deaths in part because of the unpredictable efficacy of fentanyl on the illicit drug market.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the market for tramadol for non-medical uses has grown significantly.
In this region, more and more patients are being treated for tramadol use conditions.
In 2017, the amount of tramadol intercepted globally increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.
But in 2018, global seizures fell to 32 tons after India passed a new law regulating tramadol.
The crisis in both places was driven by the simplicity of manufacture and low production costs, as well as the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.
The crisis in both places is exacerbated by the availability of these substances in both the drug market and the illicit market, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.
Doping use is on the rise
The stimulant sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are on the rise in their main markets.
About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018 because of its popularity in North America and Western Europe.
About 27 million people used amphetamines in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most used amphetamine-type stimulant in South-East Asia and North America.
According to most of the indicators available, the use of methamphetamine has been expanding in both regions over the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other, so that the use of one drug goes up and the use of the other goes down, sometimes increasing and decreasing to meet the needs of the same market.
COVID has increased the risk for people who inject drugs
It is estimated that about 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018 and about 10% of global HIV infections are caused by injecting drug use.
More than 1 million people living with HIV and 5.5 million people with hepatitis C are living with injecting drug users.
In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug use, half of whom died from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and the majority of injecting drug users have hepatitis C untreated.
5 The shortage of opioids caused by COVID restrictions may lead users to replace more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injections or inject more frequently, more harmful ways of use may occur.

EU summit debates refugee policy, EU official: the reception process is bottlenecked step by step-Chinanews.com
The EU summit is squabbling over refugee policy, EU officials: there are bottlenecks at every step of the reception process
According to a report by Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit on the same day, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration, so as to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants.
The EU's move is reportedly a response to Europe's growing concerns about illegal immigration, which is now at the heart of the bloc's low number of people who can eventually be deported.
According to the summit documents, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize significant EU funds" to strengthen external borders with infrastructure and surveillance, among other means.
However, the EU has been at loggerheads with member states over issues such as the payment of fence fees.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly stated that EU funds will not cover the associated costs.
But diplomats in some member states say that if the EU could share the share of cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along its external borders, it would free up national budgets to speed up the process.
According to the European website Euractiv, EU officials admit that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, limited reception capacity and overwhelmed immigration authorities in member states cannot prevent refugees from submitting "myriad" asylum applications in EU countries, and the EU's refugee reception system is in a near-"permanent crisis".
The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, nearly half the year before.
At the same time, the European Union recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
Against this backdrop, the summit also agreed on a "principle" whereby EU countries can repatriate illegal immigrants based on a court decision in another member state.
In addition, the report said that the EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of a secure state", which will open the way for the EU to develop a common list.

The United States escalated the "chip war" and hit the global semiconductor industry hard-Chinanews.com
Recently, the U.S. "chip war" against China has escalated - first, the Netherlands and Japan, under pressure from the United States, agreed to start the export control of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; Later, foreign media reported that the U.S. government is considering cutting off all ties between U.S. suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting U.S. suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; The Biden administration is also preparing to issue an executive order restricting U.S. investment in sensitive Chinese tech sectors...... Soon after the beginning of 2023, the United States has been making vicious moves to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the United States has never stopped attacking the development of China's "core", while accurately suppressing the semiconductor production and supply chain to China, while building a "de-Chinese" semiconductor industry chain alliance, in an attempt to completely "get rid of" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is to enlist South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or to establish a chip "quadripartite alliance" with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, China, or to establish a "small circle" of the semiconductor industry chain through mechanisms such as the "Quadrilateral Mechanism" and the "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" of the United States, Japan, India and Australia, the United States has introduced politicization, camping, and weaponization into the semiconductor industry in an attempt to build a closed production and supply chain cycle led by the United States, so as to make up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing and maintain its dominant position in the global chip industry.
However, the "core tactics" of the United States against China with great fanfare are also "injuring 1,000 enemies and injuring 800 self-inflicted losses."
Recently, Lam Research, a well-known chip manufacturing equipment supplier in the United States, announced that it will lay off 1,300 full-time employees due to the latest round of export bans on chip manufacturing equipment to China, and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
Global lithography giant ASML Holdings of the Netherlands recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to higher semiconductor prices.
According to US media analysis, after the US government brutally suppressed China's chip and semiconductor industries, many American companies suffered from it, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, chip manufacturers themselves, etc.
The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and has long formed a close-knit global semiconductor industry chain.
According to professional estimates, based on the specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross the borders of various countries more than 70 times, and the whole process reaches 100 days.
Although the U.S. semiconductor industry has a strong foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capacity, especially advanced process technology, and relies heavily on East Asia.
Even if the United States tries its best to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to the regionalized development of the "small circle" led by the United States, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries are difficult to change.
The United States has vigorously "reshaped" and "de-Chinaized" the semiconductor industry chain, hitting the global semiconductor industry hard.
Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry is inseparable from the joint participation of all countries around the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively introducing the Innovation and Competition Act, the American COMPETES Act of 2022, and the CHIPS and Science Act, using technological hegemony to consolidate its technological leadership. "Envy and power" to allies, induce Intel, TSMC, Samsung and other chip manufacturing companies to set up factories in the United States, and strive to ensure the global leadership of the United States in the field of chips.
In the short term, the United States has indeed created trouble for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, and reaped practical benefits.
However, in the long run, the hysterical suppression of the United States has forced China's chip industry to continue to break through, losing the huge Chinese market, which will eventually greatly weaken the innovation willingness and innovation ability of American technology companies and damage the development of the global chip industry.

The first batch of personal pension wealth management products can be held for only 360 days at the shortest-Chinanews.com
The first batch of personal pension wealth management products were put on sale
7 products to choose from The shortest can be held for 360 days
Personal pension wealth management products are finally online.
On February 10, China Wealth Management Network released the list of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products, and 7 personal pension wealth management products of ICBC Wealth Management, ABC Wealth Management and China Post Wealth Management were officially put on sale.
So far, the "shelf" of the personal pension account has finally collected four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension financial management, personal pension insurance, and personal pension public funds.
According to reports, the first batch of personal pension wealth management products, all of which are public offering net worth open products, including 5 new products, 2 existing products, except for 1 product for mixed products, the remaining 6 products are fixed income products.
The reporter of Beijing Youth Daily saw that 4 of the 5 new products came from ICBC Wealth Management, all of which were fixed income products, with the shortest holding periods of 365 days, 540 days, 720 days and 1080 days respectively, and the corresponding performance benchmarks (annualized) were 3.70% - 4.20%, 4.10% - 4.60%, 4.40% - 4.90%, 5.25% - 5.75%.
The remaining new product is "Post Bank Wealth Tim Yi Hongjin Shortest Holding 1095 Days No. 1", which is also a fixed income product, which began to be raised on February 10 and ended on February 19, with a risk level of level 2.
Among the two existing products, one is the ABC Wealth Management "ABC Concentric and Smart" 360-day scientific and technological innovation RMB wealth management product, which is hybrid in nature and has a risk level of 3.
Another surviving product is "Post Bank Wealth Tim Yi Hongjin Shortest Holding 365 Days No. 1", a fixed income type, which began to be raised on December 30 last year, and officially operated on January 4 this year, with a cumulative net value of 1.0011 on February 8.
According to the "Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Personal Pensions", the financial products that can be invested in personal pension fund accounts include bank wealth management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, public funds, etc.
The first batch of personal pension wealth management products were put on sale, marking that individual pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the "Interim Measures for the Management of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies".
The "Measures" stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, personal pension public fund products and other personal pension products through personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation issued notices clarifying that the personal pension system was launched in 36 pilot cities and regions such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Xiong'an New Area, Hebei, and Jincheng City, Shanxi.
By the end of 2022, there were 19.54 million participants in personal pensions, 6.13 million contributors, and a total payment amount of 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, the banks participating in the pilot only put on the shelves three types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products and personal pension public funds.
Nowadays, after the personal pension wealth management products are also gathered, how should investors choose?
Experts from the R&D Department of Wealth Management Products of the Bank of Communications said that compared with other personal pension products, the pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products in the pilot stage have three characteristics.
First, it is robust, with a more sound risk management mechanism, a more robust investment strategy and philosophy, and the implementation of independent custody by a third party that is not the parent bank.
The second is long-term, the term of the pilot stage pension financial products are 5 years and above, the next step to issue personal pension financial products, the shortest holding period is 1 year in principle, and it is encouraged to hold more than 3 years.
The third is inclusiveness, the product purchase threshold is low, the starting point is generally 1 yuan, some as low as 0.01 yuan, and the product custody fee, management fee and other rates are more favorable.
Professionals point out that investors should choose according to the characteristics of the product and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have the characteristics of long term, high interest rate and high security, which is suitable for people with weak risk tolerance; Personal pension insurance products focus on protection, which is more suitable for people who cannot bear investment risks and can accept stable income; The personal pension wealth management products and public fund products do not guarantee the principal and income, and have certain investment risks, but the expected returns are high, which are suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and high risk-bearing ability.

The fitness industry should get rid of the crisis of trust-Chinanews.com
Another large gym "thunderstorm"?
Recently, the issue of protecting the rights of members of Zhongjian Fitness, a well-known fitness institution, has attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally, and subsequently, rumors of the collapse of the institution caused panic among members, leading to the intervention of the public security and human resources and social security departments.
In the end, the relevant person in charge of the organization responded and promised to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the turmoil was calmed down.
Some stores of individual fitness institutions have business problems and are temporarily closed, consumers can be calm and wait for the problem to be solved, why is the first reaction of many members is "something is wrong"?
Behind the turmoil of fitness club members' rights protection is a deep-seated problem of trust crisis in the industry.
Traditional gyms in China generally adopt the prepaid model, and "making money that users don't come from" is the underlying logic of their development.
Obtaining cash flow through pre-sale membership cards and constantly opening new stores seems to be able to go back and forth, but in fact, it is impossible to form a stable profit model.
Negative information about the gym running away and other industries is frequently transmitted, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.
Judging from the market prospects, the gym can of course be regarded as a good business with "money".
Although the fitness track has ups and downs, it has always attracted the attention of capital.
A number of data show that the popularity of cultural and sports consumption and other fields continues to rise, and the market continues to recover.
Specific to the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards, the concept of healthy life is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the development of the fitness industry is promising.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, some institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery of consumption, and have just come out of the crisis, and have sounded the clarion call to expand their territory, and invested the financing funds in the construction of new stores.
It is undeniable that in recent years, affected by the epidemic, many institutions have withdrawn, the industry has been reshuffled, and powerful enterprises have selectively increased their acquisitions and re-layout at this time, which is not a new opportunity.
However, if the development of the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous circle and embark on a stable and far-reaching road, the industry must change the traditional model and change the business strategy.
Only by steadily and steadily re-establishing consumers' trust and sense of security can we truly win the market and win the future.
Compared with building new stores to seize the market, what the fitness industry needs more at present is to concentrate on optimizing services and stabilizing users with high-quality development.
First of all, it is necessary to rely on the service to retain users.
Gym belongs to the service industry, its essence is to adhere to the "user-oriented", to closely focus on the needs of users, the focus of business on service quality upgrading.
Second, digital transformation is needed to improve user experience.
For example, the current popular Internet gym model realizes user pay-per-time and venue selection.
At the same time, physical data and exercise data can be effectively utilized, which can also meet social needs and realize a complete service closed-loop from online to offline.
Without personal training sales and a huge annual card, users' worries about "running away" in fitness institutions are reduced, and their sense of trust is improved.
In addition, it is necessary to actively explore diversified business formats.
Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from a single service to scene consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become a new entrance to consumption, and peripheral products such as sports supplies and fitness equipment required for fitness may become a new profit point, providing consumers with richer choices.

Yangtze Evening News (Reporter Ma Zuobo) Yangtze Evening News/Purple Cow News reporter found in an interview on the 10th that the "insurance agreement" that has not been seen for more than ten years has returned to the Nanjing property market, and a real estate project located in Jiangbei New District claims that "price difference compensation", and the discount of other houses before delivery is greater than the previous discount, and the developer is willing to change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
There are many conditions for a "insurance agreement".
Mr. Sun, the housekeeper of the property in Jiangbei New District, is called Poly Yangzi Cuiyuntai, and told reporters that he found a "statement" when he visited the property last weekend.
The picture he sent to reporters shows that the developer of the real estate promised that all those who purchased the house during the period from February 1 to February 28 will be delivered from the date of signing the sales contract between the two parties to the delivery of the corresponding house, and if the preferential discount of other houses in the project is greater than the discount enjoyed by the previous purchase (limited to other unsold commercial houses that belong to the same type, the same building, the same unit, and the same property type with the commercial house), the developer can change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
Mr. Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this is actually a "price insurance agreement", the purpose is to let buyers rest assured that they do not have to worry about the price reduction promotion of the development company, "now I am afraid that the price will be reduced after buying it, and there is no time to go to the sales office to make trouble, and it is really heartwarming if it is not troubled."
There are also many buyers who believe that although the "insurance agreement" is giving buyers a "reassurance", the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a house in Jiangbei, said that the insured house must first be the same type, and it must be in the same building and the same unit.
Some buyers also believe that due to information asymmetry, it is not excluded to give additional concessions when selling, and it is not easy for buyers to "protect their rights".
It remains to be seen whether buyers will be retained
The reporter inquired on the Nanjing online real estate and learned that the real estate in November last year led the sales of a total of 252 units in two buildings, with an area of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, etc., and the average price of the full decoration was 39,843 yuan / square meters.
However, more than two months have passed, and the online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in the real estate is 157 units, accounting for 62.3%, of which there are 128 units in Building 8, and the number of unsold units has reached 113 units, and 44 units of the 124 units in Building 7 have not been sold, and the total number of units traded in the project is only 33 units, accounting for only 13%.
According to market sources, the "insurance agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, in order to attract the attention of buyers, Hengtang Xiyuan, a real estate on Huangshan Road in Hexi, launched the "Insurance Plan", which was "the company solemnly promises that if the preferential range of the project is expanded within one year, the resulting difference will be returned to the old owner according to the difference".
Since then, in April 2011, there were also 9 real estate projects in Nanjing that took out some of the properties and promised to "pay the difference".
"The property market is picking up, and at this time, it needs a 'heart booster'.
Mr. Shen, a senior trader in Nanjing's real estate industry, said that the "insurance agreement" is also one of the marketing methods of real estate companies.
He believes that developers now need more confidence than buyers, and the introduction of the "insurance agreement" is actually to encourage them.
As for whether buyers can be retained, he said that it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, and it remains to be seen for now.
A number of data recession, Taiwan's economy did not perform well at the beginning of the year-Chinanews.com
Taipei, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- The export trade volume has been "five blacks", the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) has tightened for seven consecutive months, and the consumer price index (CPI) has seen the "three-digit prefix" again...... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.
According to the analysis of experts, Taiwan's economy did not perform well at the beginning of the year, and the pressure on growth was not small.
According to the announcement of the financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities, Taiwan's exports in January this year were 31.51 billion US dollars, down 21.2% year-on-year, and negative growth for the fifth consecutive month.
The export value of the 11 major export categories all declined compared with the same period last year.
Plastic rubber and its products, optical equipment fell the deepest, down 37.6% and 35.7% year-on-year respectively.
Exports of electronic components fell by 20.1% year-on-year, the largest decline in 11 years.
Among them, integrated circuits decreased by 18.3% year-on-year, the largest decline in 14 years.
Cai Meina, director of the statistics department of the department, said that this shows that the weak demand effect of the consumer electronics industry is spreading, and the electronics industry has entered a correction period.
Statistics show that Taiwan's imports and exports both fell in January, with an excess of only 2.34 billion US dollars, the lowest level in the past three years.
The financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities believes that the global terminal demand is decreasing, the industrial adjustment of inventories inhibits the willingness of manufacturers to purchase materials, and the export decline is difficult to improve in the short term, and Taiwan's export recession in the first quarter of this year may be higher than expected.
According to the release of Taiwan's Chung Hwa Economic Research Institute, Taiwan's manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) was 40.4% seasonally adjusted in January this year, down 3.3 percentage points from December last year, and contracted for seven consecutive months.
In the economic monitoring index system, the PMI is 50% as the line of prosperity and decline, and the index is greater than 50%, which represents economic expansion, and vice versa.
Among the five components of Taiwan's PMI in January, new orders, production and manpower employment tightened, supplier delivery times declined, and inventories tightened.
The six major industries all returned PMI contraction, and the order of each industry in order of contraction rate was power and machinery and equipment industry (35.1%), electronics and optical industry (35.2%), chemical and biotechnology and medical industry (39.2%), basic raw materials industry (42.4%), transportation industry (42.6%) and food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the "Comptroller's Office" of the Taiwan authorities announced that the annual growth rate of Taiwan's CPI was 3.04% in January this year, breaking through 3% again since July last year.
Among them, the price of vegetables soared by 28.25%, hitting a 17-month high.
Cao Zhihong, a special member of Taiwan's "Comptroller's Office," said frankly that the increase in vegetable prices has indeed exceeded expectations, and excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year, and inflationary pressure still exists and is still at a high point.
Looking forward to Taiwan's economy this year, experts expressed pessimism based on media reports on the island such as "United Daily News" and "Yahoo Finance".
Wu Daren, a professor at the Department of Economics of Taiwan's "Central University," analyzed that an export recession may cause cash flow problems among export manufacturing manufacturers and an increase in the risk of debt default.
At the same time, the reduction in orders has led manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and the household economy, which in turn has hit consumption power.
Chiu Da-sheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the United States has not been solved this year, demand continues to shrink, and it is estimated that Taiwan's export recession will continue to the first half of the year.
As Taiwan's economy is supported by exports, the annual economic growth performance will not be as good as last year due to the sluggish exports.
"An important engine of global recovery" - Chinanews.com
"In response to the impact of the pandemic, China's economy has shown strong resilience.
Recent market expectations indicate that the international community is generally optimistic about China's future development.
Julio Ríos, a well-known expert on China in Spain and honorary adviser to the China Policy Observer, said in an interview with this reporter a few days ago that China's epidemic prevention and control has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further released.
Rios said that in the face of various unexpected factors, China has responded calmly with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, which fully demonstrates its economic resilience and management level.
While China is unswervingly expanding its opening up to the outside world, the endogenous driving force of economic development has been continuously strengthened, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises have developed in a coordinated manner.
Every year, the National People's Congress and the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China are held, and the representatives and members discuss the country's development plan and discuss hot issues of people's livelihood, so as to build consensus, cohesion and wisdom to add strength to China's development.
"Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term rapid development and has now entered a stage of high-quality development.
The international community expects China's wisdom and solutions, and hopes that China's development will bring new opportunities to the world.
At present, China is making every effort to promote scientific and technological innovation and inject new impetus into economic and social development, "capital investment, talent training, and policy incentives, which will make China continue to be full of vitality in the new five-year plan," Rios said.
In Rios's view, reform of the economic system is a difficult task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has brought into play the advantages of the market economy and the superiority of the socialist system, and has taken proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Focusing on the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, we will increase financial support for the real economy, support the development of private enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing industries, adhere to innovative development, promote employment, improve the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meet the people's multi-level and diversified consumption needs...... China's complete, accurate and comprehensive implementation of the new development concept, focusing on promoting high-quality development and building a new development paradigm will bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative.
"It is the common goal of the international community to stabilize and recover the economy after the epidemic.
The continuous release of China's economic development potential will bring more benefits to countries around the world and become an important engine for global recovery.
Rios said that he expects the Belt and Road cooperation to continue to play an important role in improving the infrastructure level of various countries and strengthening connectivity in various fields, and continue to release greater momentum.

With the emergence of "new variables" in China's e-commerce industry, how to achieve "content is king" with goods?
- Chinanews.com
Chinanews.com, Feb. 11 Topic: "New variables" have emerged in China's e-commerce industry, how to achieve "content is king" with goods?
Zhongxin financial reporter Xia Bin
"We were late to e-commerce, but we realized from the very beginning that content was important if we wanted to stand out from the thousands of stores.
Fangfang, a "post-90s" girl from Guangdong, now runs a nourishing ingredient store on Douyin e-commerce, making an offline store with a history of more than 30 years "blossom" online.
imitates the tone of old Hong Kong films, accompanied by classic Cantonese songs, and opens the @芳芳一人食 Douyin account, and the exquisite video is refreshing.
At the recent Douyin e-commerce "Looking for Companions, High-quality Content Sharing Session", Fangfang spoke as a representative of high-quality creators and introduced her daily creation experience and experience.
She said at the scene: "The well-polished video has gained the attention of many netizens, and many people are interested in my ingredients and want to cook food together, and the sales channel has opened up all of a sudden."
”
Fangfang relied on the soup video to make more people fall in love with the "taste of Lao Guang", and sold up to 300,000 nourishing ingredients in a live broadcast, saving her family's old store that was on the verge of closure.
With the continuous development of short video and live broadcast e-commerce, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early days of the development of live streaming, live broadcast rooms often used low prices to attract users, and the price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at that time.
In recent years, there have been phenomenal big Vs such as Liu Genghong and Dongfang Selection, as well as many unknown talents and merchants in the vertical segmentation field, who have improved long-term business efficiency by continuously creating high-quality content that conforms to the tonality of their own brands.
Gao Yaxuan, head of Douyin e-commerce star author operations, said that in the past year, 6.27 million creators have monetized their content through Douyin e-commerce, and their content creation has increased by 252%, and the total turnover has more than doubled.
"Behind these figures, we can feel a thriving and vigorous ecology of authors.
Gao Yaxuan said.
The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform of Beijing Normal University previously released the "E-commerce Industry Content Ecological Health Index (ECHI) Report", which analyzes the importance of high-quality content, a "new variable" in the current e-commerce industry, from the data dimension, and uses the index to evaluate the content ecology of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China.
According to the e-commerce industry content ecological health index ranking of the above report, Douyin e-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD.com are among the top five.
According to the report, the content ecology of the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept, which is to integrate e-commerce with content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce, good PGC (professional production content) and UGC (user-generated content) are high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce, the higher the value of the content platform, the richer the consumption and promotion scenarios, the higher the possibility of e-commerce implantation, and the stronger the commercial value. The proportion of e-commerce content production and content consumption that is gradually integrated and distributed in the public and private spheres will also be higher.
At the scene, Yu Guoming, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication of Beijing Normal University and chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Professional Committee, analyzed and interpreted the report.
He said that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from "consumption accessibility" to "consumption quality", and high-quality, professional and differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the foundation and starting point for the new stage of e-commerce development, and PGC content such as knowledge payment, professional knowledge, and KOL (key opinion leader) has begun to become the standard configuration in e-commerce live broadcasts.
Looking forward to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming put forward two suggestions.
First, from the perspective of content structure improvement, promote the overall improvement of the ecological health and quality of e-commerce content, create positive content creation and management standards, and achieve the index and dynamic balance of the content ecological health system of the e-commerce industry.
The other is from the perspective of external ecology, to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment.
"In the future, the e-commerce industry also needs more data and artificial intelligence support to form a prediction of the stability of future development; In addition, it provides merchants with a more standardized and healthy growth space, realizes the value synergy of enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and creates a healthy content ecology.

Xinhua News Agency commentator
"Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project, which requires overall planning, systematic planning, and overall advancement, and correctly handles a series of major relationships such as top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and tactics, integrity and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and opening up.
At the opening ceremony of the seminar for new members and alternate members of the Central Committee and major leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels to study and implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws of modernization and systematically expounded a series of major relationships that need to be handled well in practice, providing a scientific methodology for us to vigorously promote Chinese-style modernization.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization involves various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization, and is related to the governance of the party, the country, the army, internal affairs, foreign affairs, and national defense.
To carry out top-level design, it is necessary to have a deep insight into the general trend of world development, accurately grasp the common aspirations of the people, deeply explore the laws of economic and social development, and make the formulated planning and policy system reflect the nature of the times, grasp the law, and be creative, so as to achieve the combination of far and near, the upper and lower levels, and the coordination of content.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory undertaking, and there are still many unknown areas, which need to be boldly explored in practice and promote the development of the cause through reform and innovation.

Chinese The Biden administration blacklisted six Chinese entities suspected of being involved in the spy balloon program on Friday (February 10).
The Commerce Department said the five Chinese companies and one research institute helped modernize China's military, particularly aerospace programs, including airships and aircraft.
Blacklisted companies have a hard time accessing U.S. technology exports.
The list, known as the "Entity List," is a list of companies that cannot purchase technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they have a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The blacklisted companies are: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., China Electronics Technology Group 48th Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Eagle Gate Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd., and Shanxi Eagle Gate Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
The move comes after the White House said it was considering broader steps to "expose and address" China's broader surveillance activities that threaten U.S. national security.
The balloon incident sparked further tensions between China and the United States, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken canceled his trip to China.
When the United States shot down the balloon on 4 February, the Chinese Government lodged solemn representations with the US Embassy in China, criticizing the United States for seriously undermining and undermining the efforts and processes of stabilizing Sino-US relations.
Based on available evidence of the wreckage and information from the Chinese military's procurement platform, the U.S. government concluded that the balloon's manufacturer was "directly related to the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and a supplier approved by the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press conference on Friday that China has repeatedly explained the situation and clarified its position on the accident of a Chinese unmanned civilian airship straying into US airspace due to force majeure.
According to the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she added that the relevant resolution of the US Congress is pure political manipulation and hype.
China strongly deplores and resolutely opposes this.
Matthew Axelrod, assistant secretary for export enforcement at the U.S. Department of Commerce, said: "Today's action demonstrates our joint efforts to identify and deter China's use of spy balloons that violate U.S. and more than 40 countries' airspace.
”
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. said he was not aware of the sanctions and declined to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States and has not yet commented on this information.

Chinese Days after the earthquake struck parts of Turkey and Syria, hopes of finding survivors are dwindling, but the rescue of a family of five on Saturday is a source of great relief.
According to the Associated Press, the family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days in the hardest-hit town of Nurdayi in Gaziantep province.
Search and rescue crews pulled the mother and daughter out of a pile of rubble before finding the father, but he insisted that his son and another daughter be rescued first.
When they were all rescued, the crowd burst into cheers.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaraş, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also successfully rescued in harsh cold weather conditions.
"What day is it?
The teenager, who had been trapped under the rubble for 129 hours, asked the rescuers who rescued him after being brought back to the surface.

Miraculous rescue successes have given a glimmer of hope for an already hopeless search and rescue effort, but at the same time, the number of victims is rising.
So far, according to official statistics, Monday's earthquake has killed more than 20,000 people in Turkey, and the death toll in neighboring Syria is estimated at more than 3,500.
Although experts say people can survive for more than a week after being trapped in the rubble, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly slim.
Rescuers are still using thermal imaging cameras to find signs of life beneath the rubble.
At the same time, the focus of relief efforts has shifted to helping survivors who are in dire need.
UN official: The region's "once-in-a-century" disaster
Martin Griffiths, the UN Under-Secretary-General for humanitarian affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said at a news conference in Turkey that the earthquake was "the worst disaster in a century" in the region.
He also praised Turkey's response in the aftermath of the disaster as "extraordinary."
He also told Reuters that he hoped aid would be delivered to areas controlled by the Syrian government and the opposition, but said it was "unclear."
The United Nations has pledged an additional $25 million in donations to people affected by the earthquake in Syria.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced $25 million for relief in Turkey and Syria.

Google's AI chatbot "answered the wrong question" and the parent company's stock price evaporated by hundreds of billions of dollars
(Comprehensive 11th)
Google's new AI chatbot Bard made a bad comeback and "answered the wrong question" in a promotional video, causing Google's parent company Alphabet shares to plunge 8.9% on Wednesday to fall below the US$100 mark, wiping US$110 billion (RM476.5 billion) from its market value to close at US$94.57 as of Friday.
The market is worried that Alphabet is inferior to rival Microsoft.
According to Reuters, Google posted a promotional video for Bard, an AI chatbot, on social media, in which Bard was asked, "What new discoveries can I tell my 9-year-old about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)?"
In his reply, Bard mentioned that the telescope had taken the first pictures of extrasolar planets.
However, according to NASA, the first photograph of an extrasolar planet was taken by the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory in 2004.
Reuters even reported with the headline "Alphabet's stock price plummets after Bard answers incorrectly".
On the other hand, Google noted that Bard's response "highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process" and will combine external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard's response "meets a high standard based on quality, safety, and truthful information."
Singapore's tourism industry is recovering strongly Inbound visitors are up 19 times compared to 2021
The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) recently announced that it expects 12 million to 14 million international visitors to Singapore in 2023, bringing about S$18 billion to S$21 billion in tourism revenue. Visitor arrivals and tourism revenues will return to about 67% to 75% of pre-pandemic levels in 2019; There is a strong chance of a full recovery in tourism in 2024.
Singapore's tourism market has gradually restarted and recovered in 2022.
According to the latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourism Board, visitor arrivals in 2022 increased 19 times from 330,600 in 2021 to 6.3 million, surpassing the MGTO's earlier estimate of 4 million to 6 million, and tourists have recovered to 33% of pre-pandemic levels.
From January to September 2022, Singapore's tourism revenue totalled S$8.96 billion, and it is expected that tourism revenue for the whole year of 2022 will reach S$13.8 billion to S$14.3 billion, an increase of 6 to 7 times from S$1.89 billion in 2021, and has recovered to about 50% to 52% of the pre-pandemic level in 2019.
The Singapore government has taken a number of measures to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry.
In April 2022, the government announced the allocation of nearly S$500 million to stimulate the recovery of the tourism industry.
MGTO has announced that it plans to allocate S$110 million from this budget over the next two years to launch more business and leisure activities to attract visitors back.
In an effort to make wellness one of Singapore's tourism highlights, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) released a call for intent on 23 November 2022 to develop a wellness attraction on Singapore's southern coast.
In recent years, more and more tourists have put their health at the top of their minds, said Ong Lingli, Executive Director of Sports and Wellness Tourism at the Singapore Tourism Board.
The development of a health and wellness attraction in Marina South, with Gardens by the Bay and Marina Barrage, is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism and economy, allowing tourists to spend and stay in Singapore for longer.
Singapore Tourism Board Director Tan Kian Loong said that health and wellness will become an important part of Singapore's tourism products in the next few years.
The pandemic has heightened public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
To this end, MGTO has been promoting health and wellness programmes to the local public and international visitors for the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) organised its inaugural Health & Wellness Festival, offering more than 130 wellness activities and experiences for the public.
Singapore will continue to offer new travel experiences to tourists.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, Avatar World at Gardens by the Bay, Sentosa Central Beach Market, ArtScience Museum's new "Explore New Frontiers" gallery, and the new amphitheatre at Night Safari, MGTO will support the development and renewal of projects such as the Bird Park at Mandai Wildlife World to make Singapore an attractive destination for international travel.
According to the plan, Singapore will set industry standards for the sustainable development of the MICE tourism industry in 2023, and focus on improving waste management and carbon emissions to further optimize the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry.
According to the data, as of 18 December 2022, Changi Airport has seen a strong recovery in passenger traffic, with 150,000 passengers per day and about 1 million passengers per week, equivalent to about 75% of the pre-pandemic level, and the number of employees in the aviation industry has also recovered to about 90% of the pre-pandemic level.
Data shows that from January to October 2022, Singapore has received 23.6 million passengers, equivalent to 42% of the pre-pandemic level, and 170,000 flights have taken off and landed, which is 53% of the pre-pandemic level.
The rapid recovery of the tourism industry has also led to the recovery of the accommodation, transportation, catering and shopping sectors.
The Singapore government and tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
Assistant Director of International Affairs at the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said that a survey by a Chinese travel platform showed that Singapore's safety index ranked among the top three in the world, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is so popular with Chinese tourists.
Before the pandemic, about 3.6 million people from China visited Singapore every year.
With the relaxation of China's border policies, the number of Chinese tourists is expected to recover to 30% to 60% of 2019 levels this year.
Ke Shudan pointed out that in the future, MGTO will pay close attention to the further signals released by China's outbound travel policy to respond to the changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) will actively prepare to welcome Chinese tourists in response to the emerging trend of Chinese outbound travel.
Looking ahead to 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that the tourism industry will recover faster than expected as long as there is no significant recession in the global economy that affects public income and no new large-scale deadly outbreaks.

North Korea held a military parade on the evening of the 8th to mark the 75th anniversary of Army Day, and Kim Ju-ae, the daughter of leader Kim Jong-un, not only attended, but also stood on the rostrum with her father.
North Korean official media released the video on the 9th, Kim Zhuai snuggled up to her father, looked at each other warmly several times, whispered, she gently held her father's cheeks with both hands, and even touched her father's chest, and the father-daughter interaction was broadcast to the whole country.
However, First Lady Li Xuezhu could only step aside.
According to South Korea's "North Korea News" and other reports, in the official photo of Kim Jong-un and Lee Sul-ju and his wife attending the dinner with their daughter Kim Ju-ae on the 7th, Kim Ju-ae not only rarely sat in the middle C position of her parents, but also took the rostrum with Kim Jong-un at the 75th anniversary parade of Army Day the next night.
North Korea's official media "North Korean Central Television" later released a video of the military parade, exposing more pictures of the deep love between father and daughter.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times on the rostrum, the smiles on their faces never faded, and they whispered to each other in their ears.
Other state media footage also showed Kim Ju-ae and Kim Jong-un constantly touching his father's face with his hands when he was sitting on an indoor sofa chair; As she walked hand in hand with her father, she touched Kim Jong-un's chest with her hand.
And the first lady Li Xuezhu can only walk behind or sit on the side the whole time, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
South Korean media pointed out that Kim Ju-ae has been exposed more and more in the past three months since the test launch of the Hwasong-17 missile on November 18 last year, and it has appeared on a formal occasion for the fifth time.
North Korean state media used extremely high honorific titles such as the dearest son and the noble son when referring to Kim Ju-ae, and also broadcast clips of Kim Ju-ae repeatedly shouting in favor of the Baektu bloodline while overlooking the parade from the stands.
The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a signal that Kim Jong-un is putting his middle-school daughter in the position of successor", but there are also opinions that such a judgment is still premature, and there are still various possibilities in the case of Kim Jong-un having a son under his knees.
Chongyang Q&A - How to view the U.S. non-farm payrolls data in January exceeded expectations and future trends - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website
Q: How do you view Chongyang Investment's January non-farm payrolls data exceeding expectations and future trends?
A: On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor released non-farm payrolls data for January 2023, adding 517,000 non-farm payrolls, significantly higher than market expectations of 189,000, and the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years. Hourly earnings grew by 4.4% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month, slowing slightly.
In terms of the total amount, there are many one-time and technical factors in this data, such as the number of faculty and staff returning to work on strike, the revision of the survey statistics, and the update of the seasonally adjusted factor, which may be revised in the future (referring to the new non-farm payrolls in January 2022 revised down from 504,000 to 364,000), and the non-farm payrolls may not be as strong as the data reflects.
From a structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but the proportion is relatively low; New jobs in high-contact services such as leisure and hospitality, education and health care have rebounded sharply, and data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service sector.
Combined with the similarly larger-than-expected pickup in services PMI, job openings and labor gap data, and the strength of consumer credit data, we conclude that the U.S. services sector has seen a quick recovery after extreme weather and holidays.
In our view, the tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market is unlikely to improve without a recession.
At present, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the U.S. labor market, and the labor force participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor force participation rate of 25-54 year olds is close to the pre-epidemic high.
In addition, the strength of consumer demand due to the strength of excess savings and consumer credit in the United States will further delay the impact of tightening on the labor market.
The continued tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market will be the background color of the U.S. economy in 2023.
Coupled with the fact that we are now nearing the end of interest rate hikes and inflation expectations are constantly repeating, we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Before the release of this data, the U.S. stock and bond markets were overly optimistic about the Fed's interest rate hike path.
As inflation data continues to improve, the Fed has shortened the pace of interest rate hikes while maintaining a fragile balance of market inflation expectations, but the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish statement, not only expecting an early stop to raising interest rates, but also expecting two rate cuts by the end of the year.
With the tight supply and demand in the labor market and the uncertain impact of tightening policy, we believe that the Fed's guidance on raising interest rates at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the adjustment of extreme market expectations and crowded trading may have some damage to the market.
With the M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of the leading indicators of various CPI sub-items, the US CPI data has turned to a rapid decline stage since October, and the stubbornness of wage growth will only form a support for the future inflation data, and the current market expectations are difficult to falsify, and the market may enter a new round of game after the release of the next inflation data.
Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan, passed away due to a sudden heart disease, and led the transformation of China's first garment stock - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website
On February 11, the WeChat public account of Shanshan Holdings Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holdings") released an obituary that Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan Enterprise and chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings, died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65 due to ineffective treatment of sudden heart disease.
In the 80s of the last century, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of the state-owned cotton mill, and with the transfer, in 1989, Zheng Yonggang became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment General Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Co., Ltd.
In December 2022, at the 20th Annual Meeting of Chinese Business Leaders and the 22nd Annual Meeting of Future Stars of Chinese Enterprises, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 90s of the last century, the market share of Shanshan brand was as high as 37%.
In 1996, Shanshan Co., Ltd. (600884. SH) was listed, becoming the first listed company in China's garment industry.
Just when the clothing business was in full swing, Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized that "once the market is opened, Chinese brands will naturally form an echelon brand market, and Shanshan suits want to always dominate and become the national service of Chinese people for a long time."
In 1999, Shanshan began to study enterprise transformation, Zheng Yonggang recalled, "We came to Shanghai to seek what to do in the transformation, and we specially found many experts and scholars, and held some Zhuge Liang meetings and retreat seminars continuously.
In the end, we set two broad strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is that there is a future for great health.
At that time, the Carbon Research Institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute was doing the national 863 project, and the scientific research funds were insufficient, so Shanshan and the Carbon Research Institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "mesophase carbon microspheres", engage in the research and development, production and sales of anode materials, and realize the commercial promotion of anode materials in China.
In 2001, Shanshan Co., Ltd. realized the large-scale production of mesophase carbon microspheres, began to localize substitution, and replaced Japan as the main supplier of mesophase carbon microspheres in China.
This is the first manufacturer of lithium-ion battery anode materials in China, realizing the localization of lithium-ion battery anode materials.
With the rapid popularization of the application of lithium batteries, Shanshan's lithium battery business began to develop gradually, in 2007, the lithium battery material business was written into the main business of Shanshan shares, and the proportion of clothing business revenue decreased year by year, until 2013, Shanshan's lithium battery materials business income exceeded the clothing business.
In February 2021, Shanshan Co., Ltd. successfully acquired LG Chem's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established a polarizer company, Shanjin Optoelectronics, which has a relatively high technical content in this field, and Shanshan's main competitors are the world's top 500, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, and Nitto Denko.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his experience in post-investment management, "China's private enterprises acquire some international high-tech enterprises, the probability of success is relatively low, why do those acquisitions fail?
Because everyone will think about it, I spent so much money, I have to send someone to take care of it, this is a behavior that is usually done", However, Zheng Yonggang is different, the day of the successful acquisition of Shanshan, Zheng Yonggang went to Shanjin Optoelectronics to announce in public, Shanshan, as the major shareholder of Shanjin, decided to implement one enterprise and two systems, except for Zheng Yonggang as the chairman, Shanshan enterprises are not sent to Shanjin, and the way of authorized operation is adopted, and the original distribution system, corporate culture, and various management models remain unchanged.
According to the 2022 anode data released by ICC Xinchun Information, Shanshan's anode shipments in 2022 will exceed 200,000 tons, a year-on-year increase of 100%, and the market share will reach 16%, and the shipment of artificial graphite anode materials will continue to rank first.
In terms of polarizer business, Yano Research statistics show that the company's Shanjin Optoelectronics' global market share will reach 29% in 2022 and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, ranking first in the world.
In the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan's revenue was 15.841 billion yuan, net profit was 2.313 billion yuan, and on February 10, Shanshan's share price was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Shanshan Co., Ltd. said on the interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's effective graphitization capacity was about 100,000 tons, and the graphitization capacity of the Meishan project was still climbing.
Wind shows that Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshan shares.
Tianyancha shows that Zheng Yonggang holds 40.1% of the total equity of Shanshan Holdings Co., Ltd.
The general manager of Shanshan Co., Ltd. is Li Zhihua, born in 1968, and has successively served as the chairman of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Shanshan New Material Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and the deputy general manager of Ningbo Shanshan Co., Ltd.
Shanshan Co., Ltd. said on the investor interactive platform on February 10 that the company's senior management personnel have no family relationship with the actual controller of the company.
"Fund E Account" is coming: the China Securities Regulatory Commission authorized the development of all funds under the investor's name to achieve aggregation and inquiry - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website
Economic Observer Network reporter Chen Shan The complex purchase channels of funds make it difficult to collect account information?
Always forgetting the "little coffers"?
These problems of the people are about to be resolved.
On February 10, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced that the "Fund E Account" APP was launched on various mobile app stores and launched a public trial operation.
According to reports, the "Fund E Account" provides individual investors with a "one-stop" query service for public fund account and share information, aiming to solve the pain points of industry services such as the majority of small and medium-sized investors forgetting their accounts and cumbersome inquiries.
According to Wind data, by the end of 2022, there were 156 public fund managers in China, with a fund scale of about 26 trillion yuan; There are 167 public fund share registration agencies and 411 public fund sales agencies.
The account system of each share registration agency is independent of each other, and there is a lack of unified inquiry channels in the industry.
Some industry insiders said that at the end of 2021, there were more than 720 million fund investors in China, that is, half of the people in the country invested in fund products.
Previously, investors needed to inquire about the purchase status through different sales agencies, but through the "Fund E Account", you can check the purchase status of all sales channels, and the holding of the fund is clear at a glance.
What is the "Fund E Account" APP?
According to the relevant documents, the "Fund E Account" APP is a mobile application developed and constructed by ChinaClear with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), which can provide investors with one-stop inquiry of the over-the-counter shares of public fund products in the whole market.
Investors can easily and quickly grasp the holding of the OTC shares of various fund managers under the public fund products purchased through various sales channels in the whole market through the "Fund E Account", so as to comprehensively improve the query efficiency.
Specifically, the information that investors can inquire through the "Fund E Account" includes: fund account information opened with public fund managers in the whole market, trading account information opened with public fund sales agencies, and over-the-counter share holdings of products such as collective asset management plans that include publicly offered securities investment funds and the number of investors established and managed by securities companies is not limited to 200.
Liu Yiqian, head of the business of Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation and Research Center, told the reporter of the Economic Observer that investors can obtain all their over-the-counter public fund holdings through the "Fund E Account" App in one stop, helping them to recover "forgotten assets", and more importantly, realizing the full account information collection of comprehensive fund investment for customers, helping customers to grasp their own investment situation in a more timely, accurate and complete manner, so as to better optimize their own fund portfolio allocation and better plan their own financial arrangements.
How do I sign up?
The reporter noted that at present, the "Fund E Account" APP has been listed on Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, vivo and other mobile phone app stores, but the APP is still in the public trial operation stage, registration needs to fill in the invitation code, investors can contact the fund manager of the fund they hold to obtain.
The customer service staff of a medium and large public fund in Shanghai provided a 6-digit invitation code to a reporter from the Economic Observer, and told the reporter, "During the trial operation stage of the APP, ChinaClear provides a certain number of invitation codes to each fund manager, and investors call to obtain it, and we will provide it."
After the trial operation is over, the invitation code will not be required when opening user registration.
”
The reporter registered the account and completed the query according to the relevant documents of the "Fund E Account" download and use instructions published on the official website of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the whole process took only a few minutes, mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real-name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund inquiry.
After passing the real-name authentication step, click the "Assets" fund binding button, and all the fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms are presented in the binding option list (can be bound to accounts), and after completing the binding, you can intuitively see the total assets of the invested fund and start using the query function.

The United States, Japan, and the Philippines have reached a defense consensus with the Chinese Communists
ASIA – Philippine President Bongbong Marcos Jr. visits Japan for talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on February 9.
The leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement after the meeting, saying that they would carry out substantive defense exchanges and oppose the CCP's hegemonic policy by signing a trilateral defense agreement with the United States.
According to the Japanese media, Fumio Kishida hopes to use this meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish a policy against the crisis in the Taiwan Strait.
Marcos Jr. visited China in early January and secured a $20 billion deal.
But since then, China-Philippines relations have not only not improved, but have declined.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States to open more bases to the U.S. military to ensure security in the South China Sea.
The new base is located 300 kilometers from Taiwan and is the closest to China.
In the event of a crisis in Taiwan, the US military may launch an operation at bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that now Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and even the Philippines are forming an axis with the United States to build an "arc of confrontation against the CCP" in the western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyan conveyed Song Tao's words during his visit: The Green Camp is welcome to visit the mainland under the consensus of '92
During his current visit, Xia Liyan, vice chairman of Taiwan's Chinese Kuomintang, met with Song Tao, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, and Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
In an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency last night, Zhao Chunshan, a senior adviser to the National Politics Foundation, an official organ of the Kuomintang, spoke positively of what Song Tao said to Xia Liyan that as long as he agrees with the "92 Consensus" and opposing Taiwan independence, China welcomes people from the green camp to visit the mainland.
The Kuomintang commented that it was a new thing.
Xia Liyan met with Song Tao earlier, and the news on the day did not mention this statement.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has clarified on several days that it refuses to accept the "consensus of '92."
According to the Central News Agency today, Xia Liyan, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, led a delegation to visit the mainland, and during his stay in Beijing, he met with Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Tao, newly appointed director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, and Yin Li, secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee.
Xia Liyan met with Song Tao and talked about the "92 consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence as the political foundation of the KMT, while Zhao Chunshan, senior adviser to the KMT's National Affairs Foundation, said at the meeting that the KMT's "92 consensus" is the original "92 consensus."
According to Zhao Chunshan's analysis, this is different from the previous meetings.
In the recent video conference with mainland academic circles, as well as in this forum, we have not heard Taiwan-related scholars talk about military reunification and the "anti-separatist law," but instead they have resumed exchanges and dialogues.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the two sides of the strait are in danger of fighting fiercely, and Chinese mainland hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the other side is still willing to do a good job in dealing with the Taiwanese, and the deputies do not want cross-strait relations to deteriorate.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also personally instructed Song Tao to say, "You must implement the demands they (Taiwan's farmers and fishermen) have put forward." If it cannot be resolved in an all-round way, it will also be handled on a case-by-case basis.
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang people's visit to the mainland mentioned in person whether Chinese military planes and warships disturbed Taiwan on a daily basis, the agricultural and fishery problems in a few counties and cities in Taiwan, or whether the Central News Agency reporters asked such questions in interviews.
The French trade unions once again mobilized a large march against the government's retirement reform programme
On Saturday (11 February), French trade unions once again launched a national mobilization against the government's draft pension reform, calling on people to take to the streets to express their views.
This is the fourth day of action in this social wave of opposition to the draft reform of the government's pension system.
How many people respond to the rally call could affect the next course of action for trade union groups.
This is the fourth time in this month that France's eight major trade union groups have come together to launch a national mobilization, and it is also the first time that the protest has scheduled a rally on a Saturday.
Given that for most French people, Saturday is a public holiday, and they do not have to choose between a protest or a wage-grabbing strike, trade union groups hope that today's rally will attract more people.
Neither the public transport system, the subway nor the public railway company's unions have called for employees to strike today, and the bus system should be functioning normally, with citizens able to travel to meeting places and people allowed to take normal holidays in areas where schools have begun their winter break.
Trade union groups hope more than a million people will attend the rally today, while the police expect that the national number of participants could be between 600,000 and 800,000, and that the Paris metropolitan area could gather between 90,000 and 120,000.
Since the start of the protests against the government's pension reform plan, the number of people actually taking to the streets to participate in the march has gradually decreased, although opinion polls show that a majority of French people do not support the move to postpone the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64.
The first strike demonstrations on January 31 brought together between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people across the country.
The crowd on Tuesday (7 February) has shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million across the country.
This pension reform package is currently under discussion in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, especially the opposition groups led by the radical left, have submitted numerous amendments, so that the process has been slow.
The controversy between the government and the opposition has become increasingly fierce and acute.
A lawmaker from the radical left-wing party Indomitation in France recently sent a picture of himself stepping on a balloon with the face of the Minister of Labor printed on it on social media, prompting protests from the ruling party.
The President of the National Assembly eventually announced that the member was banned from parliamentary activities for 15 days as a penalty for such acts.
Although this reform package has sparked the largest social upheaval in France in more than 20 years, the government has so far made no major concessions on the draft, although it has made slight adjustments.
The unions are ready to take action again next Thursday, the 16th, and on March 7, when the draft reform is sent to the Senate for discussion, they also plan to organize demonstrations.
China encourages higher fertility rates and high quality standards for sperm donation in colleges and universities
China's Yunnan Provincial Human Sperm Bank issued a publicity on the 9th, soliciting sperm donations from college graduates or students, and successful donations of 8 to 12 times can receive a subsidy of 4,500 yuan.
According to Taiwan media reports today, the information rushed to the hot search on Weibo on the same day, and triggered many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing to follow up the initiative.
According to a Liberty Times report, China encourages college students to donate sperm.
In addition to academic qualifications, it also requires a height of more than 170 cm, good facial features, no obvious hair loss, and myopia cannot be higher than 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Yunnan Provincial Human Sperm Bank pointed out that sperm donors can get a full set of andrology examinations worth 1,000 yuan, "especially semen and chromosome tests, which most people have never done, which is of great significance to understanding their fertility status."
The conditions for sperm donors include those who are more than 165 cm tall, have a college degree or above, or are currently studying, and have no genetic diseases and infectious diseases such as color blindness and color weakness, hepatitis B.
The report quoted China Tianmu News as saying that the Shaanxi Provincial Human Sperm Bank printed a poster of "Paid Sperm Donation, Infinite Glory", calling on young people to respond to sperm donation, and encouraging netizens to forward relevant messages to "let love be passed on".
The price code in Shaanxi Province is higher than that in Yunnan, and those who pass can receive RMB 300 in cash each time, and those who complete a certain number of sperm donors can receive a subsidy of RMB 5,000.
At present, the highest known price code is Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of 5,150 yuan.
The last communist chancellor of East Germany is now dead
The successor of the East German Communist Party reported in a statement that "Hans Modrow left us last night at the age of 95.
As a result, our party has lost an important leader.
”
On November 13, 1989, four days after the opening of the Berlin Wall, which separated East Berlin from West Berlin for 28 years, Modrow had said he would help turn East Germany into a democracy.
At that time, communist leaders were forced to step down due to protesters across East Germany demanding democracy and freedom.
Mikhail Gorbachev, after coming to power in the Soviet Union, demanded that change also take place in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe.
In March 1990, Modrow proclaimed the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results led to him no longer being prime minister.
Despite Modrow's reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political changes and reunification that took place in October 1990.
He was also criticized for trying to reinvent rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modro was convicted of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but was not imprisoned.
The allegations have been said to be politically motivated.
Modrow continued to serve in the German Parliament from 1990 to 1994 and as a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modro saw himself as a reformer and wanted to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want the old GDR to return, but said that the GDR's achievements should be recognized.
Modro was born in 1928 in what was then the German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica, Poland) and trained as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a platoon leader in the youth fire brigade and, towards the end of the conflict, became part of the Volkssturm, a Nazi militia that conscripted men between the ages of 16 and 60 to fight in the final war struggles.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by Soviet troops and brought to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war, where he took anti-fascist courses and became a staunch Communist.
In 1949, the year the GDR was founded, he returned home and found a job as a mechanic and continued his studies in social sciences and economics, earning a doctorate.
Modrow was a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement, which was joined by almost all young people in East Germany and rose to the chairmanship of the Dresden Regional Party through the ruling Social Unity Party (SED) between 1973 and 1989.
He also served in the parliament of East Germany for more than 30 years.
In 1990 Modro became the de facto leader of the GDR, holding the highest state post.
Iran Celebrates Revolution Anniversary Hackers in support of the protest hacked the president's televised address
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ibrahim Raisi's televised speech.
The president's live televised speech was interrupted on the Internet for about a minute, and a group of anti-Iranian government hackers with the name "Edalat Ali" appeared on the screen.
A voice was also seen shouting "Death to the Islamic Republic".
As reported today by Reuters, hackers interrupted state television coverage as Iran commemorates the anniversary of the revolution.
Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, and Raisi's hard-line government faces the boldest challenge from young protesters who have demanded their ouster, but Raisi still calls for "deceived youth" to repent so they can be pardoned by Iran's top leader.
Nationwide protests swept through the nationwide protests that still reign in Iran after 22-year-old Amini Mahsa Amini died in September in the custody of the country's morality police.
Iranian security forces have carried out a deadly crackdown on the protests, one of the most powerful challenges the Islamic Republic has faced since the 1979 revolution overthrew the 2,500-year-old monarchy.
As part of an amnesty to commemorate the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities on Friday released imprisoned dissident Fahad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha, who were on hunger strike.
Earlier Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty that included a number of prisoners arrested during the recent anti-government protests.
As of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors, according to the human rights group HRANA.
Another 70 government security personnel were killed, the report said.
As many as 19,763 protesters are believed to have been arrested.
For weeks, Iran's leaders and state media have called for a vote at Saturday's rally to show their opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On Friday night, on the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, state media displayed fireworks as part of a government-sponsored celebration, with people chanting "Allahu Akbar!"
(God is the greatest!) ）”。
However, many people could also be heard shouting "Death to the dictator!"
and "Death of the Islamic Republic" in a video posted on social media.
On Saturday, government television broadcast live footage of official rallies in states across the country.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebrations, domestic anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers and other military equipment were demonstrated.
President Raisi's speeches were often punctuated by the slogan "Die to America" – the signature slogan at state rallies.
The crowd also chanted "Death to Israel".
Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months, Reuters said.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on national security charges.
They later put her under house arrest, but in January she was back in prison.
Adelkhah has denied the allegations.
And a week before Messami's release, supporters warned that he was at risk of dying as a result of his hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting the mandatory wearing of a headscarf.
In response to Adelkhah's release on Friday, the French Foreign Ministry called for her freedom to be restored, "including allowing her to return to France if she so wishes."

The balloon incident is more polishing the eyes of the United States?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal today, the United States is ready to further tighten technology exports to China after the balloon incident.
Current and former security officials said the balloon incident highlighted the national security threat posed by China and would rally more political support for strengthening U.S. technology protection.
The U.S. said the balloon carried antennas and sensors used for intelligence gathering and communications.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official who now works for the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.
"This is undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire and supporting the views of hardliners on China."
"We will also consider broader actions to expose and respond to China's larger surveillance activities that pose a threat to our national security and our allies and partners," White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday.
U.S. officials said they had informed more than 30 governments about the balloon incident and that international coordination was critical to countering the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the Biden administration's actions, the U.S. House of Representatives' newly created Select Committee on Strategic Competition with the Chinese Communist Party could also pressure the U.S. to take tougher measures to slow down China's development.
She said members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which in turn could force the White House to take a tougher line.
According to the Wall Street Journal, many advocates of stricter export controls are also pushing for wider controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The U.S. government is also working on an outbound investment review program to examine U.S. investments abroad for potential national security threats from China.
Analysts say the White House may face calls for a sooner rollout of the plan.
The Turkish-Syrian earthquake relief efforts have been carried out day and night
Since the devastating earthquake struck Turkey and neighbouring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working day and night in the rubble of thousands of destroyed buildings to rescue survivors buried under the rubble.
In icy temperatures, they often call for silence as they struggle to hear any life from the dilapidated concrete pile.
Two more women were rescued after surviving the rubble of the earthquake for days, Reuters reported today.
However, the death toll from the earthquake climbed to 24,150.
The death toll in Turkey is 20,665 and in Syria more than 3,500.
Monday's 7.8-magnitude earthquake, which continues with several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, is the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami and approaching the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
A similarly strong earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
Rescuers rescued two women from the rubble of a collapsed building in Turkey after they were trapped for 122 hours after the deadliest earthquake in 20 years struck the region, Turkish authorities said Saturday.
Another injured 55-year-old man was identified as Masallah Cicek, who was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In icy temperatures, rescuers often call for silence as they struggle to hear any sounds of life from the dilapidated concrete pile.
In Turkey's Samandag district, rescuers crouched under concrete slabs and whispered "Inshallah" – "God willing" – and cautiously reached into the rubble to rescue a 10-day-old newborn.
His eyes widened, and the baby, Yagiz Ulas, was wrapped in a warm blanket and carried to the field hospital.
Video images show that first responders also took his mother, who was dizzy and pale on a stretcher, but conscious.
Turkey's Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that 67 people had been rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, and that a total of 31,000 rescuers had been mobilized in the affected areas.
About 80,000 people are being treated in hospitals, while 1.05 million people who have been displaced by the earthquake are crammed into makeshift shelters, he said.
With many people starving food in cold winter conditions, there are growing questions about the two leaders' response to the disaster.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad traveled with his wife, Asma, to a hospital in Aleppo for the first time since the earthquake, according to Syrian state media.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said its stocks in rebel-held northwestern Syria were running out as the state of war complicated relief efforts.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Turkey's Adıyaman province, where he admitted that the government's response did not go as fast as expected.
Opponents seized on the issue to attack Erdogan, who will run for re-election in a vote to be held on May 14, but could be postponed by disaster.
According to Reuters, anger over delays in providing aid and launching rescue efforts could affect the election.
Even before the earthquake, voting was seen as the most serious challenge in Erdoğan's two decades in power.
Erdogan called for solidarity and condemned what he called a "negative campaign for political gain."
Kemal Kilidarroglu, the leader of Turkey's main opposition party, criticized the government's reaction.
"The earthquake was big, but what was worse than it was the lack of coordination, the lack of planning and the incompetence," the criticism said.

What exactly is the downed "object" over Alaska?
Confusing and speculating
The U.S. military again used the U.S. F-22, the most advanced stealth jet fighter in the United States, on Friday (Feb. 10) afternoon to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska, USA.
The site of the downing was ten miles off the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time that the US military has shot down an airborne object in less than a week.
On Saturday, a spy balloon from China drifted through U.S. airspace for days before being blown down off the coast of South Carolina.
The second downed object entered U.S. airspace for the first time Thursday night, was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska, flying at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), about the size of a small car and much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was previously shot down, the Pentagon said.
The Pentagon also believes that there is currently no indication that the object is maneuverable.
John Kirby, the White House National Security Council's coordinator for strategic communications, said Friday that while it was unclear what the high-flying object would look like, it "posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian aircraft."
Bryant said the object, unlike the spy balloon found in the United States, had no "payload" on it.
"We call it an 'object' and we're the best we can describe it at the moment," Bryant said.
President Biden listened to the Pentagon's advice before ordering the object to be shot down, and he made the decision "very carefully," Bryant added.
The official description of this object in the United States can be roughly summarized as follows: the size of a small car, no joystick, no suspension device, and a flight altitude of about 10,000 meters.
But this information does not yet answer basic questions about what exactly this object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it performs.
At present, many analyses and speculations on the Internet believe that this may be another Chinese balloon.
It may have come from China, as did the spy balloon that invaded U.S. airspace and the Chinese balloon that fluttered over Latin America, and they performed some kind of mission in different locations.
There are also people who associate this "object" in Alaska with a "unidentified flying object" (UFO).
The Newsweek report quoted former U.S. Rep. Peter Meijer as tweeting on Friday that he said, "I wish this 'UFO' was also a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO."
"The irony of conflating an alien spacecraft with a weather balloon is surprising, but it's not worth triggering an interstellar conflict," Major said.
Major made the tweet shortly after Bryant confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek said Major was not alone in suspecting the object was a UFO.
Rep. Tim Burchett, Republican of Tennessee, criticized the administration's cover-up last month by demanding that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) release a report on "UFOs."
Amazon's customer service attitude is hard for me to believe
I guess very few people see this, but I'll say a little bit about it.
This dress was a zip-up hoodie when we bought it, and it was a short-sleeved one that I ended up with.
After receiving the clothes, I immediately got in touch with Amazon customer service, and it was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock, and I asked for a replacement, and the customer service said to solve it, and then immediately saw that the product name changed to short sleeves, and the link I bought was taken off the shelves.
Then the customer service informs you that you will either keep the goods and compensate a certain amount, or return the goods.
That's how Amazon handles it?
It's really unbelievable, it's not my problem that the clothes are wrong, as a consumer I asked for the goods I deserved, and I didn't make any exaggerated requests, but Amazon changed its name and said that it was out of stock.
This is my first long review and hopefully this is not my last.
Incomprehensible sleeves
It is said that it is cowhide, and it is indeed hard, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks in the local area, and it is not clear whether it is leather, and the sleeves of this dress are really incomprehensible, usually the sleeves of the jacket are longer than the hem, but usually 1-2 cm, this dress is 5 cm long, and the arms naturally droop should be in the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of this dress cover the fingers.
It's easy to buy clothes, and it's easy to return them.
But I really don't know when I want to return the money?
The workmanship of the clothes is good, because the version is small, I have to return it, but after returning the goods, more than a week has passed so far, and I have not received a refund?
And to ask the buyer to contact the not very good integrity of the whole peak express, this is the worst purchase since buying Amazon items!
But the store is still good, and actively cooperate with the express delivery to refund in time, but the real work of this full-peak express is quite infuriating, and it takes about half a month to refund, this kind of partner is to drag Amazon's hind legs, poor work efficiency, no sense of service!
More suitable for young people
99 seckills.
The workmanship, color, and feel of the wool pants are good, and the soft/thin thickness is moderate, and there is no kerosene smell.
It's a pity that the fit is skinny, which is more suitable for young people.
3XL, flat waist circumference 2'5, stretch maximum size 4', 1.79/80kg is a little tight at the waist.
It seems that there is no elastic band around the waist, and it is quite difficult to loosen the waistline.
In addition, it is uncomfortable to wear it closely.
Very good The colors are not very bright
It went up by more than two hundred just after I bought it, what is the situation.
The first time Amazon used the cooperation of the daily rotten express, the first delivery was not at home, and then took the initiative to make an appointment with the courier twice for the delivery time, the courier did not send, and then returned it directly to me, this damn courier has no integrity at all, it is strongly recommended not to use the daily rotten express again.
This time, I also returned a T-shirt, and the price increased by more than 100 yuan when I took it again.
Amazon's own products should not appear in such products
When the product is on sale, the price is not low, and it is also a very good product to read the reviews.
When I actually received the product, I was dumbfounded, the surface of the product was worn in a large area, and there were wear and tear in many other places, either defective or old, and the picture will be shown later.
I applied for a return, and the person from the manufacturer saw the picture and said that it was caused by transportation, isn't this nonsense?
How can the inside of the product be worn?
There are only two possibilities, either the defective old product or I deliberately damaged the item and returned it.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the goods, but in terms of my credit history on Amazon shopping, I think such goods should not appear in Amazon's self-operated products, customers choose Amazon self-operated is trust, customer win, we win, the customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory, I hope everyone works together to improve, thank you.
I've been using the product for less than a year and I've had two E2s and I don't know what to do with it?
I bought the product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the two groups on the right side of the receiver often appear red E2, it should be a problem with the transmitter module, which is not consistent with the launch module on the Amazon website that can last for 7 years, and I can't find the after-sales service on the Amazon website, and now I don't know how to be good?
It's okay
The first purchase is bad.
It doesn't feel like new.
The label on the box was torn off, and the label on the fuselage was also broken.
And it's always a white screen.
It's good after changing.
The exchange is very fast, a little blurry at night, the angle of view is not very wide, but the average household is enough.
The disadvantage is that I don't have a card, I bought it myself, and I bought a mobile phone on Amazon before.
There will be a sticker on the package to prevent the package from being opened, not this time, there is a sticker-like seal when you buy a mobile phone, which can be attached to the warranty card, but this time there is none.
I don't know if it's cheaper, it's not there, I'm confused.
Wait for the supplier's reply
The packaging does not have any logo, call the supplier directly, and answer that there is no logo is genuine, if you suspect that you can use leftovers to mail to Johnson & Johnson for inspection, and leave the license plate number and phone number, and promise to send a text message to notify me to enter my information into the Johnson & Johnson official website warranty card, and I have not received a text message until now?
I received the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon's self-operated products are still very reassuring.
The master who changed the oil said that the oil was clear and bright, and it was indeed a good oil.
Because it's the second time I bought it.
So it's still very reassuring.
The express delivery is fast, there is no fuss about the packaging, and with this oil, the engine sound is significantly reduced.
The cost performance is good, and it is difficult to find synthetic engine oil below 200.
Support star crown, support Valline, effective protection of the car.
Amazon Japan has seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service problems (caterpillars of 8c are shipped as caterpillars of 8cm) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)
Admits mistakes, but has been prevaricating, always emphasizing that the goods are a third party and cannot be bound by a third party.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
I originally purchased the page size option of 7c, 8, 9c, at that time I thought this was a trap, called Nichia Chinese customer service, clearly told that 8 is 8c, but when the product returned to China, I found that it was only 8cm, I think this is completely a deliberately set trap to pit Chinese (according to Amazon's after-sales service), and now there is no such option on the page.
Chinese customer service: I'm sorry for the loss, we give you two ways to go:
1. You return the goods, and the buyer bears all the shipping costs.
2. If you don't return the goods, we compensate you 1000 yen.
(I do the math, the shoes are more than 4,000 yen, which is counted as 200RMB, and I choose 1, I don't have shoes, and the loss is 200 yuan.)
Option 2, I have shoes, and finally compensated me with 2000 yen, and finally lost 150rmb customer service: we have recorded it, we will deal with it seriously, and the next day I replied to an email, saying that I do not accept the mediation of Chinese customer service, and that's it.
I proposed:When the purchase page is 7c,8,9c such a confusing option,Chinese customer service helped me say that the Japanese common code will not bring c,Similar to 140,But why do you go to other caterpillar pages to see?
There are US codes and Japanese codes.
Besides, why do you put 8cm in the middle of 7c and 9c, obviously the smallest size, what does it mean you put there.
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know that you have to ship back to China, so we will not pay for your freight.
I don't understand this logic again, I am Japanese, I also need Chinese customer service, China living in Japan does not need Chinese customer service, to Japanese tourists, there is no effort to make international calls, then the question is, who needs to call Amazon overseas purchase Chinese phone, nothing more than a day like me.
Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service convenient for these people in our overseas shopping?
Not very satisfied with this purchase
This is the second time to buy Pampers diapers from Amazon, once bought a box when the baby was 2 months old, chose diapers imported from Europe, the first purchase experience is still relatively satisfied, the baby uses a diaper all night, it can indeed meet 12 hours without changing diapers.
But this time I bought L diapers, there are 2 packs in a box and packed separately, after opening, I feel that the paper is looser, which is obviously different from imported Pampers, after using it for the baby, it is okay, there is no urine leakage and no rash and other signs.
But when it came to the second pack of diapers, a rash immediately appeared on the baby's inner thighs after using it, and it has not faded so far.
I suspect that the quality of the 2 packs in 1 box is not the same.
I don't think I will continue to buy in the future!
Want to value the shipping protection of your package
This is the worst packaging and shipping I have seen in the long history of online shopping, with no protection at all, cushioning foam, wrapping cushioning materials, etc., nothing.
Just a crushed box.
And the soft plastic box inside is packaged, and the card box is pressed open and deformed.
I hope it is genuine, the quality is guaranteed, and I won't dare to buy anything in the Amazon in the future.
I'd rather be half more expensive in the country and have a point of security.
And the problem of product packaging, I read the comments in 2016, and now 19 years later, it is still the same.
It shows that Amazon does not pay attention to service feedback at all, and it is too far from JD.com and Tmall in China.
It's good-looking, but it's a little bit of a pity
The color of the whole cup is what I like, orange-red, although my family is a male treasure, but I still think orange and yellow are very eye-catching.
It's a little smaller than I thought, but it was meant to be taken out of the house, so it's acceptable.
I took it home and tried it last night, and after the cap was pushed open, the distance between the straw and the lid was too close, because the position of the straw was forward and vertical, so my son always had to hold the bulge on the lid to drink water, and I felt if this place could be improved.
It seems that it makes sense for other brands of straw cups to tilt the straw, and children's things really care about safety and comfort.
Lightweight and large capacity
I like that it's lightweight, with a large opening, and it's a bit redundant for me that two separate divider bags are a bit redundant, and I don't know what to pack.
After buying it, I found that there was another brand on the overseas purchase of Meiya that was very similar, which was less than 200 yuan.
Fakes, fakes are particularly powerful
Amazon sells fakes, and I'm also convinced.
The customer service said that it can't be returned because it was used, and I didn't use it to know that it was a fake.
Because of trust, so sad, after all, it is a product to wipe your face, really go to the physical store to buy it, recognize it is more expensive.
Because it's a seckill, I didn't read the comments, I have submitted it to the e-commerce platform of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, let's defend our rights together.
Broken?
Fake?
In short, tragedy.
The pores selected when using the second piece are fine, but as soon as I open it, there is a strange smell, I think it is normal, because I haven't used this, and then when I put it on my face, I can't stand it, it is very rushing, I can't describe it, I immediately coughed out, my eyes hurt very much, I shed tears, and I immediately took it off to wash my face.
I don't believe in evil and opened another piece of the same style, which doesn't have such a heavy taste, and is now being applied.
Recall a bit like the smell of inferior perms in a hair salon.
It's really unimaginable that Amazon's own skincare products will have to be avoided from now on?
Profiteers
At that time, when I bought it, the event page was said to be full of 99 yuan to give away the "three-body complete set", I received the goods without this gift, called the customer service phone and said that I wanted to show them the screenshots of the activities at that time, the question is who buys things and saves the screenshots of the web page, you have done your own activities, you also need customers to help you provide ah, buyers should pay attention to the next time, save the evidence.
Feel it after use
The first time I bought something on Amazon, there are a few points to feel respectively, let's talk about the feeling of using up the product, the first is indeed painless, and there is no stimulating taste of things, overall it is very good, wait for about 8 minutes to wipe it off, but there will be a small amount of sweat residue on it, you can't see it if you don't look closely, so it's good overall, as for the use of it once after that, you have to continue to observe, and you will know if you continue to use it.
Anyway, I think this stuff is really good.
Second, the order was placed on the 27th, and the goods were received on the 12th, a total of 15 days, that is, half a month, and Amazon's delivery man service attitude was also very good.
Third, don't believe Amazon's Black Friday, place an order on Friday, wait for 2 days and get close to 12 yuan cheaper, that is, I bought more than 170 (plus shipping or something), and there is a feeling of raising the price when engaging in activities.
What price fluctuations the customer service says, I have been paying attention to the price for more than 10 days, and the fluctuation is not large.
The price is affordable, Nissan is available, there are Chinese labels, with granules, absolutely repurchase!
The paste is particles, the refreshing feeling is just right, the teeth are smooth after use, and it is much stronger than a second-hand Dongdong, where it is said to be imported things, but many things do not have Chinese labels, I don't know where to wholesale.
In the future, as long as Amazon has it, it will never go to the second-hand east again.
Give me a suggestion, why can't you post orders on Amazon's app sometimes, I hope to improve some apps, and it will get better and better!
Over the years, the excellence has become worse and worse, and there is no service quality at all!
Garbage excellence does not take into account customer needs When placing an order, special delivery time is 19:00-22:00.
Because there are elderly people at home who are inconvenient to stay in bed after surgery, it is convenient to receive mail only at night.
As a result, it was delivered directly to the door at 12 noon, and I didn't call in advance.
If the delivery time is what time your courier wants to deliver, why bother to make a time for customers to choose?
If your own logistics can't guarantee service, then don't do e-commerce at all!
Let an old man with 3 wounds on his body get out of bed and open the door to receive the courier and pay for change!
Obviously there is a contact number on the order!
From the beginning to the end, no one came to call to give an explanation!
The so-called complaint customer service of Excellence.com is a group of outsiders pretending to be there, perfunctory your complaint and then giving you a so-called reply.
There will be no change or compensation!
I also encountered such a problem before, and I put up with the problem of the wrong delivery time, but this time I can't bear it, it's too much!
After the pre-sale of the new book arrived, the front and back cover were reversed, so the obvious quality problem was to close the eyes and send the book to the customer?
Leave a bad review and no one will contact you.
Over the years, the excellence has become worse and worse, and there is no service quality at all!
No more dime spent on excellence.
The quality of the picture is simply unacceptable
As a title like "Ancient Atlas", the book is unacceptable in the selection, layout, and printing of the pictures, and some of the pictures even have mosaics, which are so blurry that they are unrecognizable.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small-format illustration, it should be worthy of the medieval documents left by the ancestors in the catalog!
(Moreover, many images can be obtained from relevant industry resources in clear original documents), what is the difference between using such images to piece together a book and not using no images?
！ I regret this academic spirit.
The text is not evaluated, and the Fang family has their own distinction.
2 stars overall.
I read this book when I was a sophomore in high school, and I was just bored to watch and play.,I feel like I shouldn't be addicted to such a book.,After all, the online article of the starting point was still not very attractive to me in the past.。
And then... and fell into the pit.
According to this plot, the whole book is relatively light-hearted and pleasant, and when Ye Xiu was still in the online game in the first part, even if it was intrigue between guilds, it was not heavy at all because it was often bloody.
As for the part of the competition, I wrote a little bit of sadness about the change of times and the alternation of the old and the new (maybe I was sentimental).
Reading the whole book took me a lot of study time in my sophomore year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.
The full-time description of the characters and emotional lines is very amazing, and some characters are only occasionally bringed, which will also leave a deep impact on people, such as the more focused characters Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, Su Mucheng, all have a large number of fans, and the characters who are not in the writing center, such as Jiang Botao, Chu Yunxiu, etc., are also very liked, and in a cool article of e-sports, people can't find a very annoying character, which is a full-time success in character description.
And on the emotional line, full-time does not have the problem of 30 million harem beauties who are either beautiful or rotten as criticized by general online articles, and the feelings of all people in the whole text have one thing in common is that they like the game of glory, and most of them want to win in a dignified manner.
There are small measurements, but there are no big conspiracy, and everyone looks so simple and cute.
That's probably why there aren't any nasty characters full-time.
The full-time IP is huge, and it is also due to this.
Putting aside the cultural phenomenon of online writing, full-time is a good book.
How much he will really provide people with some blood, a little touched.
In April this year, full-time will be anime.
In fact, I've wanted to buy this set of books for a long time.,Because the wallet is not thick enough, I didn't make a hard move.,And then when I wanted to buy it, I found that tb is simply a rampant fake.,In fact, there was another version of the full-time recently.,I like the cover picture myself.,But I'm still going to buy the old version first.,So I looked at it on Amazon.,I bought a set at once.。
Next, let's briefly talk about the situation of the goods.
●There is no plastic cover of the fourth book, but the book is new.
●The seventeenth plastic envelope is in but was opened, and the texture of the book is very strange, and there is no other hardness.
● The 23rd book is the same as the 17th book, but it is harder than the 17th book, but it is very old.
●The publishers of individual books are different, and it seems that the 23rd and 17th are the same publisher, which is different from the others.
● Overall quite satisfied, 24 books are a large box, very satisfied.
Lonely lion cub
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner", but it turned out that there were still a lot of words!
I read it three times before I finished reading this book to the children, a little lion who can shoot and a little lion who loves fruit juice gummies.
When I saw the plot of the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable, and modern urbanites were a little unacceptable to such an arrangement as being eaten by animals.
Seeing that in the end, this little lion cub, who has succeeded in human society, has lost himself, and he is no longer a complete lion, nor is he a complete person.
In the end, there is only the back of the little lion, and I don't know where he has gone.
Maybe many years later, the image of this little lion will still remain in the impression of the grown up child, and it may be remembered inadvertently one day, which may touch or inspire her.
A portfolio that is very cost-effective
1. I didn't know TASCHEN before, but I recently bought a lot of their books, because they are too strong, whether it is the topic or the production itself.
This work has been published in 3 versions, and the largest version is the same as the complete works of Michelangelo, which is close to 50 centimeters long and 34 centimeters wide; The medium version is about 36 centimeters long and 23 centimeters wide; This edition is the smallest and comes with a two-volume book box.
Personally, I think it's acceptable, first, the price is cheap, and the more than 700 pages are divided into two copies, which is also better to read as a paperback; Second, unlike the complete works of Michelangelo, the paintings occupy the main body, and Leonardo da Vinci's black-and-white manuscript accounts for the majority, and for non-art readers with limited budgets, this edition is the most cost-effective as an appreciation of paintings and manuscripts.
2. The explanation of the painting part is great, there is composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I don't know if it is a printing or book size problem, some of the shadows are too deep in the county, and I can't see the details clearly, which is a bit of a pity.
3. Compared with Michelangelo's manuscript, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscript is much richer.
The former is already a genius, and the latter is not enough to describe as a genius because of his breadth and achievements.
If you used to only look at the paintings and only experience half of the Da Vinci, after reading the manuscript, you will be completely speechless.
Garbage, whoever buys it regrets!
Never give a bad review, this is really rubbish, it's a waste of money to buy Shenma, give a reason!
1. The time is not accurate, and suddenly it becomes January 1st, and the time is zero.
2. Inferior belts, none of which are silicone, bring allergic blistering to the wrist.
3. Often unable to connect to the phone.
4. The battery life is only five days.
5. The sleep detection is not displayed, and the time is 0.
6. Not waterproof.
7. Miscellaneous.
Logistics is too slow
It shows that it arrived on October 16th, and the result was received on the 21st, a bad review!
The courier is too poor, and buying things on Amazon is already slow, I didn't expect it to be so slow!
Overall satisfaction
I was worried about the packaging of the camera at the beginning, but this time it's okay, there is an inflatable bag inside, the camera is the same as the three codes, and it can also be registered on the official website, the shutter times are 0, and the rest can only wait for time to check.
The delivery speed is quite fast, here to complain about the courier brother, the valuables are placed in the concierge, go fast, I can't open the box in front of him for inspection, I am really speechless about this.
The merchant did it for the sake of the customer before shipping :)
The merchant is more responsible, and specifically calls to ask about the screen size of the camera used, which is really for the sake of the customer.
The shipping speed is also fast.
The diamond film is also quite suitable and effective.
The battery is not fully charged
The machine is really good, I want to ask how the first charge is not enough, the charging indicator has been red
At present, there is no official Amazon feedback channel, so I can only give feedback in the product evaluation
1. On March 29, the book was purchased with 31 yuan through the pre-order channel, and it was displayed that it would be pushed to the device on March 31, and the book could not be previewed on Amazon's official website at this time (because it had not yet been released);
2. The book pushed to the device on March 31 has blank content, only stay tuned, and the price of the electronic version of the book on Amazon has been reduced to 18 yuan;
3. In the past two days, I have repeatedly tried to delete the downloaded blank book on the device and synchronize it again, but I can't get the electronic version of "The Nature of Business" that contains the actual content, but I can preview the book on Amazon's official website.
I have a few thoughts at the moment
1. The issue of price is not actually the most important thing, the key is how to replace the blank books on the kindle with books with actual content, instead of downloading them forever and "stay tuned"
2. The pre-ordered book should not be bought again in the future, after all, in case of a skip ticket, it seems very complicated to download a book with empty content;
3. I hope that Amazon will give a normal channel for feedback on such problems, and when you have any questions about the download or use of e-books, you can have a place to give feedback (tickets, online customer service are OK, you can refer to how the Microsoft official store does it)
Not a very recommended read
I read it a long time ago, and I happened to see it and write some thoughts from memory.
This book is not so much a collection of short stories as a collection of fragments of life about love.
The tone of this book is extremely bland, it is as plain as boiled water, the pursuit of simplicity in words and sentences is extreme, and the plot is like the street on a summer afternoon, quiet and plain.
Each short story is a silhouette of a short period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no ending.
In the end, it was collected together and titled "What Are We Talking About When We Talk About Love".
I think that this collection of novels, and its title, is like a kind of performance art, what the author wants to express is that love is not only the joys and sorrows on the stage, the sea is dry and rotten in urban legends, nor is it just the glue like paint of you and me, love is not only the above and should not be represented by the above, love is also a dull life like water, boring day after day, but also helplessness in life, escape from reality, and confusion about the future.
As you read this book, you may be reminded of the quarrelsome couples around you, the boring marriages of people you know, and the unsatisfactory relationships.
That's why I don't recommend reading it, because from an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of this book are boring, and unless your life is rough or sweet as living in a candy castle, you will have to read it with the feeling of strangeness and boredom.
In terms of ideological depth, the everyday plot does not make people shine or expand one's thinking and vision (unlike Marquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera"), and the short episodes do not explore any questions, such as what kind of mistakes led to the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much sense to read it or not.
The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and genre than through the storyline, which is also the reason for the poor reading experience of this book.
It is suitable for rough reading, not for close reading.
The logic of the book is good, but the content is not full enough.
Explains a lot of what sales theories are and why, but is weak in how to do it, pointing out directions but not giving specific practices.
Plus, the book feels like a patchwork.
Examples include both domestic and foreign; There are both well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and little-known people.
I don't know if it's a story made up for example, but it would be more convincing if I cited some cases that the author has experienced.
Changing in terms of customer or customer address.
It's still a customer in the title, but it's a customer in the text.
There are also typos, missing punctuation, and misnumbering issues in eBooks.
In conclusion, this book is a good theoretical primer, but it is not so suitable for people who are already working in sales and want to improve their sales.
A quick introduction to Internet finance
This book is very shallow, it can be said that it is just an introductory course, which can help you quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but to understand it deeply, you still have to follow the map and dig deep by yourself.
And the book was written earlier, and the content of Alipay's WeChat subsidy war to cultivate user habits has not been mentioned, and today's third-party payment share is only afraid that the proportion is not so small as stated in the book.
Nowadays, many people go out to eat with a mobile phone, and merchants have abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank turnover.
But I am very grateful to the author for writing this primer, it can be seen that the author has at least many years of experience in financial observation and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so he can write such an easy-to-understand content.
It's easy to write tall and empty, but it's hard to write in plain language.
I appreciate you and want you to know!
The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether they are valued and appreciated enough at work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, after people's basic survival needs are satisfied, the most urgent thing is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for Chinese people, most of them are "love you in their hearts", even if they have love, gratitude and appreciation, they will not say it silently in their hearts.
In this book, the author elaborates on five words of appreciation: words of affirmation, careful moments, acts of service, gifts of satisfaction, and physical contact.
I think it's not that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use these five languages from your heart to appreciate and thank the people around you, whether it's family, friends or colleagues.
In fact, the closer people are, the more they need appreciation and gratitude, so that our lives will become better.
Learning to appreciate, companies can also retain talents to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.
Thanks to the translators for bringing us wonderful ideas and the world abroad.
Due to the cultural background of China and the West, there will be more or less differences between languages, and if you have the opportunity to see the author's original version, I believe you will gain more.
Thank you again to the authors, translators and editors for their hard work!
If it is suspected of being a counterfeit or shoddy product, please Amazon strictly review it
The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, and it is not even as good as the roadside stall products, there is no gram weight, there is no bar code, and the ten-bag packaging is also loose, which is not the characteristic of qualified products at all; is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, has applied for a return; It's all about quality; It is recommended that merchants keep their eyes open and refuse inferior goods; Supplement: I bought Xinxiangyin, supermarket 23 yuan / 10 volumes, and added a few comparative photos to further verify the counterfeit and shoddy product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid economic losses and further unhappy mood!
Once again, Amazon is expected to be meticulous and strict about the source of goods.
So-so product, and there is a gap with expectations
Merit:
1. Big brand, cheap price.
ADVANTAGE 2: THE MOTOR AND BLADE ARE GUARANTEED BY PANASONIC AND ARE OK TO USE, BUT THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN THEM AND MY EXPECTATIONS.
Shortcoming:
1. There is no indicator light for charging, this is the most basic your power indication is saved, and it is estimated that customers who buy 300 yuan products will also be charity in the eyes of Panasonic PANASONIC, without respect.
2. There is a strong odor When charging, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong smell of plastic burning.
The office tried it for 1 day, and the whole house was filled with this plastic smell.
Compared with the Philips PHILIPS at the same price that I used before, although there is an extra cutter head, the quality of Panasonic's product is really sorry for consumers.
Small packages
When I received the express delivery, I saw that it said that the e-commerce version was written on it, and I knew that it fell into the pit again, and it was smaller than the supermarket bought, it should be M, and the picture packaging on the product introduction is different, the so-called new version.
Three stars blame yourself for being sloppy and not seeing the product specifications clearly.,I don't have an opinion on you selling the M code e-commerce version.,What does it mean that you don't have the right version?
The e-commerce routine is deep, and I still go to the supermarket to buy it when I have time.
Just sauce purple.
I don't like the taste
Children don't like the taste of toothpaste, every time they say spicy, maybe it would be more appropriate to describe it with other words, and there is only this word in the child's thesaurus for the time being.
I bought it when I was doing an event, and it was very cheap, so I was embarrassed to give a bad review, four stars, but I won't buy it again.
Genuine yo well packed
The packaging is complete, with an inflatable bag inside, and there are no online reviews only the appearance of a bare product.
There is also a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle, as described in the picture, and the express delivery is also very fast, and it came the next day after the shooting.
It's genuine, but it's out of stock, and I don't know when it will be on the shelves again.
A terrible shopping experience
Black Friday when the order, the result of waiting for a long time did not receive, after a query, the package has already been signed, asked the colleagues around them are said that there is no help to sign, quickly contact the courier company, but said that the sender can initiate an inquiry, contacted Amazon customer service, and waited for more than ten days, and finally figured out that the express was mistakenly voted to others, and several turnovers finally got back the express, the outer packaging has been removed, the goods are still complete, and I don't know if it has been used, in short, it is very bad
Wrong picture
I thought I could receive headphones like Figure 1, but I didn't expect to receive headphones like Figure 2.
Although the names are all the same, I still hope that everyone can pay careful attention, and I also ask the person in charge of Amazon to change the correct picture in time, thank you very much.
The operating system is so-so
It took a while,Overall, the picture is OK.,I don't feel any difference.,It's just that this system makes people look tangled.,The boot time is obviously a little slow.,There's no way to set it up well.,And then the software doesn't need to be commented.,The response speed is more general.,Compared with colleagues, it's not an order of magnitude.。
Look at the comments that it is very user-friendly design,I didn't find where humanized.,Remote control, which is commonly used up and down, left and right,The position of the return key design is really not flattering。
So, let's just use it as a TV, plus a TV box or something.
The price reduction is too much
The price reduction is too powerful, more than 100 into 99 now!
I have accumulated a lot of unrated orders on Amazon, so I used the copied passage as the evaluation content.
If I use this paragraph to evaluate, it means that this product has at least 85 points or more.
For poor products, I will never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews, so that other consumers will use them as a reference when buying, and merchants will improve the quality of the goods.
Low price and good line, this is enough if you don't have a fever!
Such a cheap line,But it should have reached the HDMI certification standard,Personally compare these bullshit things in the domestic Akihabara (the price is twice as expensive),The line body is thick,It's also relatively soft,7There is no noise in the transmission,In the future, the low-price line will be recognized as Basei!
Stuff is ok, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other sites
After placing an order, I found that I made a mistake, but the order could not be canceled, and the online customer service on the webpage kept showing the wrong link, and I could not be contacted.
After the arrival of the goods, the delivery man called me, I said I don't want it, I want to cancel the order did not cancel successfully, the delivery man took it back, said to sign for me first, let me apply for a return.
When applying for a return, I was informed that the food cannot be returned once signed, and there is no way to call Amazon customer service, which is the same thing, and the signature cannot be returned.
I have bought items that cannot be returned on the policy in Jingdong and Suning before, including milk, diapers, etc., and they have been returned by contacting customer service, and Jingdong's diapers smell too big after opening, and they will still be refunded by contacting customer service, and it will not work when it comes to your Amazon.
Rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with it?
Tell me that either I will take it myself, or let the delivery person buy it himself, it is not easy for other people's delivery people, why should I let people pay for something that they didn't buy?
Okay, I'm not going back, I'll take it myself, but I have to give you a 1 for your service
I advise everyone not to spend money in vain
First of all, I am full of expectations to buy, I think the Dole brand should not be bad to go anywhere, after receiving it, I look at the packaging and think it is OK, the size is not bad, but there is a box that is basically soft, the appearance is not visible, to feel, eat to the mouth completely tasteless, tasteless, bite to the flesh is dark yellow is the kind of bad, good and bad ginseng sold, can eat less than a third, advise everyone not to buy, not cheap, the quality is too poor!
Eat a trench to grow a wisdom, and never buy fruit in e-commerce in the future!
Where is the product anti-counterfeiting mark
The bottom corner of the bottle is sunken severely, it should have experienced a strong impact to cause, from the outer packaging bag, the degree of devastation feels worrying, after all, the packaging of food is too simple, and it belongs to the international purchase, and there is no obvious anti-counterfeiting logo, the bottle is very easy to open, the key is that a layer of honey in the lid comes out directly from the inside, there is almost no adhesion in the opening, foreign products are like this?
Born in China, I don't understand it.
It should be genuine, right?
There is also a prompt when the photo is taken, and it is said that the twentieth arrives, this is the 14th received, the first time I bought it overseas here, just to write down my doubts, maybe this is normal?
Pick-up service needs to be improved
I bought a total of 5 pick-up coupons, and when I picked them up, I made an appointment to pick up 3 copies for the first time, but only 2 copies were sent. The second appointment, just in time for the rest day, the website and WeChat did not prompt the need to make an appointment on a working day, which caused unnecessary panic, and it is recommended to improve it in the future.
Nice shopping
Thing is popular!
I still believe in Amazon's self-operated things, now it is very convenient to buy overseas, and the logistics time to buy back from abroad is a few days longer than that in China, I have to say that Amazon's overseas customs clearance ability to buy in China is still very strong, and it is much faster than going forward, so now many things are bought overseas.
I hope that the quality and price of domestic goods can be better, many things are made in China, but it is cheaper to go out and buy it back than in China, and I hope to improve.
litter
Seeing such a package, let me ask you: don't you think it's garbage on the side of the road?
Is it responsible for a plastic fragile package that is sent from the so-called Germany in a plastic bag?
I see that this kind of packaging is like garbage, buy this product, the packaging is very simple, there is no measure to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag packaging, after hand, the package is completely deformed, and the items inside are also damaged.
If I just came across one like this, I admitted it, bought a few like this, and found Amazon customer service, and the customer service said that it could be refunded, but the freight was paid in advance, and then the freight was returned to me in the form of a gift card.
Let me ask, I pay the shipping in cash, and you give me a gift card, which is to buy your gift card myself, and I have to mail the product to the German warehouse, this is not to buy a product to suffer ah!
And I have been telling the customer service, whose responsibility is it for such a problem, but the customer service does not say that it is their responsibility, and even half of the responsibility is not daring to take it, what is the guarantee for such after-sales service? In a word: admit it! But I guess Amazon won't give me a chance to announce this evaluation, and delete it directly!
Very good quality 5 stars, poor logistics
1. The quality is very good, the spike is spike, the price is moderate, and the value for money is great.
2. Strong, sufficient materials, firm solder joints, proper surface treatment, and good color.
3. Logistics is hard to hurt, the order placed on the 3rd, and the 11th arrived.
4. If Amazon doesn't indicate that the estimated arrival time is February 7th, I may be satisfied.
5, but marked the expected arrival time, it is equivalent to giving the user a promise, when the promise can not be fulfilled, the user is very uncomfortable.
6. If you don't have the certainty of giving a promise, don't make a promise.
7. Actually, I care a lot about the promises made by merchants.
8, so, I gave it a low score.
The gold thread will fade
The effect is still there, but whether the feeling is obvious depends on the individual or the psychological effect.
One thing that is not very good is that the golden thread, which was originally designed to look good, but in fact, this gold thread will fade, put it on the car, if you take it a few times, there will be some gold dust on the hand and on the car.
Hopefully the product can be improved.
This kind of square is not decorative, so don't make gold threads, and it is troublesome to fall off and dirty the car.
Things are in good condition, the speed is OK, and there are 2 packages and different packages
The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but it is 2 pieces divided into 2 packages, the packaging is not the same, obviously a shockproof too much, thick cardboard pasted, sealed with a layer of plastic, the outer packaging is also easy to dismantle, a domestic express box like, put a few buffer airbags even if it is a thing, it feels a bit perfunctory.
The Arlan mattress is really good
The 34CM mattress is not generally thick, so you can sleep on the mattress directly without a bed.
The quality is very good, both the front and the back, it is quite soft, it is very comfortable to sleep on, and I quickly fell asleep when I lay on it.
After receiving the mattress, there were two stains due to the violent transportation of the express, and the customer service of Yalan was very responsible and solved the problem with efficient contact.
It's not a self-operated product, Amazon is shameless
The page is clearly marked as self-operated, in fact, it is distributed by the supplier, and the supplier is responsible for after-sales, and the supplier is contacted by himself if there is a problem.
I want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier and cannot be cancelled; If you want to return or exchange the goods, you have successfully applied for a return or exchange on Amazon, sorry, no one pays attention to you, and you need to contact the supplier to return the goods.
This Nima which door is self-operated goods.
The product is not distributed by Amazon, and Amazon does not bear the after-sales service, and the customer service actually said "I will help you contact the supplier", and claimed that it is self-operated, which is too shameless, naked and shameless, and naked fraud on consumers!
Depressed experience
The filter cartridge purchased online in another store before, the filtration effect is good, and after 28 days, it will be used for another day or two without scale.
Because the quality of the things that have been purchased on Amazon can be, this time I want to buy it here, the first time I bought the filter cartridge on Amazon, it doesn't feel very good, not only did it start to have scale early, but the filter cartridge has been used until the 28th day, there will be a small black toner in the suspension, I really don't know whether to continue to use it, or just throw it away, very depressed~
Not as good as it could be
Compared with the plug-in board I have used in the past, the exterior workmanship is average, and the interior is not disassembled to see, but I hope that as the store describes, from the point of view of ease of use, each independent unit is powered on or not lacks a display
The packaging is damaged, wait for time to check the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is seriously damaged, the inner packaging box seems to be new, but the manual does not seem to be new, it was only renovated in September, and the stock is stockpiling, I hope it will not be bad by then, please Amazon explain why several customers mentioned that the packaging is damaged, but you can handle it safely, thank you!
Overall good, a little bit of a problem
The first time I bought a water filter bottle, I read a few evaluation articles, I felt that LAICA was more cost-effective and chose this, I received the goods according to the instructions and installed the filter element, tried it, and felt good overall, but when pouring water, it seems that the raw water will be mixed with the treated water from the spout (the original water tank is not very tightly sealed).
When using it, be sure to wait until all the water is filtered before pouring it out!
The picture is incomplete
The picture does not capture the details of the side, and the details of the side are not consistent with the style of the subject, which is very different, which is one of them; This bead is made in Thailand, and the origin is not indicated, which is the second thing; The texture is not indicated, which is the third; When I bought it in the UK, it was clear that each item had its own box, and there was only a simple plastic bag here, and there was no product logo on the beads, so I could tell if it was real or fake.
Be cautious when buying, especially when buying things from Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service sucks
The order placed two days ago, received it today and found that it dropped by 40 yuan, and it took a lot of time to find customer service, and the customer service said that there was no way to make up the difference, and you can rebuy and return it.
This kind of customer experience and service is 10,000 times worse than that of a certain treasure and a certain Dong.
It's okay, as a newbie, it's worth starting
The quality is passable, and the best King Kong is not compared, I have seen the price of the mall before, not to mention hundreds of dollars, I am the first time to play King Kong, OK.
Stuff good
Things are really good, send my girlfriend, but at noon I was not in Canada Express when a little unpleasant, the logistics company directly put the mail in the treasure and did not send a verification text message to me, causing me to run twice.
But the baby is really good.
It's worth buying
The little monkey is cute, the Amazon discount is really big, Zhou Shengsheng's official website directly delivers, the order was placed the night before yesterday, and I received it this afternoon, it's really fast.
Postal couriers are also very responsible.
Support!
A customer's confession
1 After receiving such defective products, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then you contact the customer service staff in the middle, and they will tell you that the problem will be handled by a specialist, and he will inform you of the result.
You can never take the initiative to contact this commissioner, you don't know her work number, and you don't have a direct contact number, that is, you can't contact her, only she can contact you.
3 The tragedy is that after waiting for nearly 3 days, this commissioner contacted me, and my mobile phone left for a while, and I did not receive a call from this commissioner.
I waited for 2 hours and didn't wait for the commissioner's call, during which I took the initiative to contact Amazon customer service and emailed the customer service to ask her to call me back.
4. Nearly 3 days have passed, and I still don't know what Amazon will do if I receive this defective coffee machine!
5. There is no problem with Amazon's products in the United States, and it is good to buy overseas as a way of shopping, but it is far worse than the service of Meiya.
6 For me I can only continue to wait ...
The bottom is uneven
Because it is very good to look at what is said in the reviews, all of them are looking forward to this pot, and I like it when I get it, it is very lightweight, but I found a problem when I boiled the pot, the bottom of the pot is not flat, the middle is protruding, the surrounding area is concave, and the oil has run to the periphery.
I don't know if I was unlucky, I just got a pot with an uneven foundation, but fortunately, Amazon provided a one-month return service and returned it decisively.
I brushed the pot clean and returned, and worked in vain for a long time.
Good product design requires a matching manufacturing process to achieve it
It's a product with a very clean design.
For the shape of the cube, the designer treated the top into a slight arc.
It was supposed to be a very smooth line.
Unfortunately, the final result was not achieved.
Because there are two parts on the top, the front is the control panel, and the back is the top cover of the water tank.
The curvature of the top cover and the curvature of the control panel are inconsistent, and there is a height difference of about 2mm after the combination.
Although it looks like a small gap.
But it can be said that the whole sense of design is destroyed.
I feel a little sorry for that product designer.
It seems that Midea's product managers are not capable of creating products of this level.
(Of course, I can't ask too much for the feedback of the after-sales lady, but when I heard the after-sales service say that all the individuals of this product are like this, not only the one I bought is problematic, her disapproving and truthful emotions make me understand that I can't ask too much for beauty) 2019-7-7The pump failed to produce less water, and it has been repaired for the second time, and it broke down two weeks after the first repair.
It's a good deal after the deal, and the Amazon fake deal is sad
The baby was purchased one week after birth, and the heat preservation was super strong.
There is no trace of heat on the outside of the pot, which can effectively protect the temperature from dissipating even if it is not afraid of burning people.
After a night, the air-conditioned room was able to maintain a high temperature.
Amazon said that the anniversary event 320 big discounts, and later found that everyone has 249,289,299, and there is a sense of being deceived in an instant, but going to the supermarket to compare it is still much more cost-effective than various miscellaneous brands at the same price, and you can carry it with the car when you go out in the future.
Vitamix Vitamax 6300
I have been waiting for a long time, and I saw that Meiya 6300 was discounted, and Central Asia overseas purchases were at the same price, so I hurriedly started.
The order was placed on September 2nd, and the expected arrival was on the 21st, but it arrived on the 12th, almost 10 days in advance, and the speed was really fast!
The box is not big, and the original packaging of the Vitamix is directly used, and Amazon is not afraid of breaking it across the ocean!
The machine looks very new, the accessories are complete, but the cup shakes so much on the base, I am afraid that the cup will fly out directly when I turn it on!
I asked a friend who has 5200, and he described it as if it wasn't as loose as mine.
The accompanying recipes are all in English, it's very tiring to read, and I can't find the Chinese version on the Internet, which is a trouble!
After receiving the goods, I quickly bought a transformer, it is estimated that it will arrive in 3 days, and then I will toss it well!
Too small, no umbrella cover, average material.
Not tuba at all!
The second Totes, 1. This one does not have an umbrella cover 2. The umbrella handle is made of general material 3.
On the contrary, the one I bought in Meiya before can be used by three people without pressure.
It doesn't feel good
First of all, the box is not very strong, with a press on the deformation, followed by the back design of the flat to prevent the ABS scratch on the surface of the box and does not work, and then the box is a piece of cloth wrapped, the rod is highlighted.. And so on, all kinds of dissatisfaction, and finally the zipper is a little unsmooth.
PS: The wheels do feel pretty good
It's OK
Pros: This backpack is more delicate and looks durable.
Disadvantages: the QR code on the card can't be scanned (what the hell), the 15.6-inch notebook can't be put (a little longer will not work), this backpack zipper can be locked, but it does not prepare a lock for the buyer, which can not be described as service-oriented.
The whole is OK, I don't know if it's leather
The overall feeling is OK, I don't know if it's leather, so I can't blindly evaluate it.
It can hold A4 format documents, and it is estimated that it will not fit 80 pages thick, but box-like objects (that cannot be deformed) that are too thick and too hard to hold.
The bag is very soft, and the inner bag separation is also more user-friendly, which is still quite good.
It's just that there's a small trachoma at the bottom of this one I got, I don't know if it's my bad character or?
I was too lazy to toss back and forth to exchange goods, so I endured it.
It's worth four stars overall.
ForRoyal has taken the world by storm camera straps and DSLR straps
This strap is designed to be scientific, hanging on the shoulder, practical, and the chest is fixed and protected with soft material, unlike other fast gunners who use screws to fix the bottom wound camera, and it is also very convenient to remove the camera.
Garbage after-sales
I bought the piano a month and a half ago, missing a part, after notifying Amazon gave me an after-sales call, after many communications, the parts have not been received yet, please ask what kind of efficiency is this!
It is estimated that there is more trouble to repair after the problem, and the friends who are looking forward to the good after-sales service will take a detour, too much trouble!
There are small flaws, and the tone is good
The headstock is defective, a corner is missing, it feels like a defective product, and there are no freebies, but the price is already good, and the tone of the piano is good.
It's okay, the first noodle list
I used it for a long time, except that the bass couldn't come out, and it was generally good.
It's just that the workmanship is not as perfect as imagined.
The first time I bought it, there was a problem with the thing, all the lights were flashing and it didn't work.
asked for a replacement, but it turned out that the goods arrived in Shanghai for three days, and they were not delivered.
I don't answer the phone call to the delivery person.
The courier company said they only had that contact information.
Amazon can't find a place to complain.
Didn't ask for it, in case of late delivery, inexplicably delayed delivery as I requested - such a text message came over.
Later, I will talk about the transfer problem.
Anyway, the extremely poor shopping experience began to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics system and control system.
I don't think I can get it today.
The label is too sticky and not waterproof
Although the Bluetooth connection is convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not laminated; And the label stickiness is very poor, it is not good for cable labels at all, it is very easy to fall off, and friends who buy it for sorting out cables need to pay attention to it.
The pen is OK, but the package is too simple, just a paper box, there is no protection, and the box containing the pen is glued with a large piece of transparent glue, and the peeled glue is on the box.
Six hundred yuan things treated like this, very disappointed a shopping.
But the pen is fine.
I hope to improve the packaging in the future!
If the quality is not good, if you talk about writing, it is not as good as 925-25
First praise the daily express, airmail, super fast, service attitude is also very good!
I've been using 925-25, it's great, I just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is not said, the style is also very beautiful, the reason why I give four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for fast writing, the length of the pen cap to adjust the lead core is a little shaky, personal opinion: 925-25 is more comfortable than 85.
As a result, he became a die-hard fan of Amazon
I bought it at a super good price, but the child didn't like to click on the pen.
I have opened the package, tried to apply for a return, and actually picked it up for free.
It's awesome.
Returns are not recommended, but this service is the only one in China.
Hope not to be abused.
In the future, the books were all transferred to the position and bought here.
Headphones are biased, and there are noises
These headphones are real rubbish, I don't know if it's my ears that are wrong or if this headset is really not as good as it used to be.
I bought a blue one two years ago, the sound quality is not bad, there is no noise and the bass is good, I have used it for more than two years and plan to buy another one (urbeats), after all, it feels good.
I saw a purple one again, which was very good-looking, but I bought this today and opened it to feel wrong, and the sound was loud and the sound was small.
At first, I thought it was because of the sound effect of the song and didn't think much about it, but then after listening to it for a long time, I found that this problem is very serious, not only the bias, but the bass effect is not as good as the one I used to sound good, and there is a little noise, is it only the purple one I bought that has this phenomenon? Or is it true that the headphone manufacturing process is not working now?
Quite a bad review, very disappointed.
Be sure to return it during the day tomorrow.
PS Good looks
This AV amplifier has complex settings, rough workmanship and high heat generation.
The sound will be re-evaluated after a while!
On August 14th, I just bought the German version of DN1080.
1. The front panel and knobs are plastic.
2. The audio input socket and speaker output terminal on the rear panel are so bad, just find a 1000-2000 CD power amplifier all-in-one machine is much better than this.
3. The top cover is relatively thin, and my transformer is still concave, so I have to unpack it and restore it by hand, and the combination of the top cover and the front panel is loose.
4. The center of gravity of the whole machine is biased towards the transformer end, which is very awkward when moving.
It feels like a SONY entry-level machine, just that workmanship, made in Malaysia.
I feel that Sony is much better than Pony to be OEM in China.
5. The machine is hot, and the top cover of the two channels used to watch a movie for about 2 hours has to be 40-50 °C when touched by hand, I don't know if the transformer is too large and the heat is large.
Now more switching power supplies are used, and this stupid transformer is estimated to have 4KG.
Sony should have used a silent fan with active cooling inside the machine, and after unboxing, only the large aluminum plate heat sink on the tube was seen.

It hasn't been taken apart
The battery is in use.
Would love to dissect it and see what exactly is in its belly.
Thinking about it later, if I was disappointed after dismantling it, it would be too unjust to spend so much money; In case you are very satisfied after dismantling, it will be difficult to install it again, and it will be unpleasant to use.
Forget it, even if Sony uses good batteries.
As for the detailed description of the battery, the average person will feel weak when they look at it.
Fortunately, I have worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time, and in addition to not knowing the circuit, I can be regarded as half a battery engineer, and I can withstand it.
be overjoyed
Before I bought it, I really didn't know the bottom until I opened it and looked at the package!
Finally, when I touched the earphone cable, I felt very flexible, the quality was so good, I couldn't wait to plug it into the phone and open QQ music.
I was stunned that the sound quality was surround 3D!
I asked in the physical communication store, about 30, but it is by no means a Pinsheng brand, it is a miscellaneous brand, so although this Pinsheng is 27 yuan, it is definitely worth having!
The worst online shopping experience
After placing an order on September 28, the system showed that it had been shipped, but it was still not received until October 12.
Check the status of the Amazon order, the seller did not provide the tracking number, and the order could not be found.
So I sent an email to the seller to ask if I could provide the courier number, but there was no reply for two days.
In desperation, I called Amazon customer service, and the customer service told the seller's mobile phone number, and I called the store again, and after calling a few times, the phone was connected, and I was told that the courier was lost, and I could immediately send me another one.
Although I was very angry, because the computer was in urgent need, I didn't say much to the seller, just send it to me immediately.
As a result, I called the next day and asked, was it shipped?
The seller said not yet, and it can only be sent in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon to ask, and the seller said that it would be sent and the goods would be delivered after five or six o'clock in the afternoon, but when I called at seven o'clock in the evening, no one answered the phone.
On the morning of the third day, I called again and asked if the goods had been sent.
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said that it was not sent, and told me that if I was in a hurry, I would order it from another company, and if I could wait, it would be sent in the afternoon.
There is no way, it will take a long time to place an order from another company.
I can only ask the seller to hurry up and deliver the goods.
Finally, after countless phone calls, I received my computer on October 16th.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because I bought it for someone else, so I'll comment on it later.
I just bought it for half a year and didn't use it a few times, and now it's not in good contact, so I ask if I can repair it?
Because I have a desktop, I haven't used it a few times since I bought it.
Just take it with you a few times in your business trip fashion bag.
Recently, I found that when the power is turned on, it is not charged, and you need to hold the connection between the charger and the cable a few times with your hand left and right to charge it.
I suspect that the interface is in poor contact, I don't know if I can fix it now?
Amazon is highly recommended to deactivate EMS!
Five stars for goods, one star for logistics, and three stars on average.
I don't understand why Amazon wants to send EMS, the industry is recognized as unreliable, well, computers are also valuables!
The order after buying showed that it was expected to be delivered on the 20th, so the family waited at home for three days!
Why four or five days from Xiamen to Fuzhou!
On the morning of the 22nd, I finally arrived in Fuzhou, ready to receive the goods happily, and as a result, in the evening, without receiving any phone calls or text messages, I checked the logistics, and it was signed at noon, and I also signed for it!
I was instantly shocked!
Who am I? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
I wonder if I'm in life!
In the end, I went to the collection point to move the computer back.
The specific reason is simply because the courier brother reversed the two tracking numbers, but fortunately, the piece was not lost.
I strongly recommend that Amazon don't use EMS anymore, and if Amazon uses EMS to send express delivery in the future, I will definitely not buy it again.
The goods are not bad
First of all, I just bought it for a few days and found that the price was reduced.,Bad review,It's not bad.,Cost-effective,CPU and graphics card are enough to deal with mainstream online games and a considerable part of large stand-alone,The heat dissipation is very good,But the screen is a little leaky (a common problem of IPS screen),The sound quality is not very good,The hard disk is not good (it is recommended to spend some money to add a solid state),Yesterday I took it to the after-sales service to test the hardware,There is no problem, Comes with win8.1 is not very easy to use,It is recommended to upgrade to 10,The seller ships quickly,The inquiries are answered very quickly,The invoice arrived the next day after receiving the computer,Good,It's a pity that there are no gifts。
(By the way, if you buy a keyboard film, you must not go to a store called E Cool Digital Center to buy it, the delivery is slow and the quality is poor, the product is not returned or replaced if there is a problem, and the boss is still full of swearing, especially exposed)
Things are good, platform bureaucrats are still there
The quality of the hard drive is very good, the cost performance is absolutely high, it is cheaper than buying in Hong Kong, and it is definitely recommended to buy if you are not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate the logistics.
But I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still the same, and a few years ago I swore that there was no improvement when I would never use it, you can never find out the actual logistics situation, the information will always be delivered in a few weeks, and you can never complain, it's so bureaucratic!
It has been a few days since the goods were received, and the logistics information is still 10 days later, and you will receive the goods!
Logistics is not worry-free
When it was sent like this, not only the packaging was flattened, but the electrical packaging was also opened, and I don't know if there was any adjustment.
FYI
I haven't tried it yet, I have always trusted Philips and hope that the battery life will be longer than other brands.
I checked it on the Internet, it may be a common problem of water ingress, and there is no warranty.
Depressed!
Now wrap it in plastic wrap and continue to use it, I don't know how long it will last?
Buy someone else to take it apart
More than 300 machines cost more than 100 taxes, which is indeed relatively high, and now more than 600 are much more balanced.
When I received it, the state of the sealing tape looked very wrong, as if it had been disassembled, and I quickly took a photo, and sure enough, it was torn open, and the cardboard inside was damaged after opening, and I was worried that someone else would return it, and I didn't have to try it for my husband before the anniversary, but the machine had no electricity at all, but fortunately, there was no slag in the knife head, so how to retreat if you didn't go far away!
It is unknown whether it will be good or whether there will be any problems in the short term, as mentioned in the previous evaluation, what is sent out when it is out of stock is really unreliable!
The sense of experience is on the upper side
It's almost top-of-the-line electric, and there are many ways to clean your teeth, but few people will change to a different mode every day.
There is no problem with it for half a year, brushing it every day, almost more than 1 week.
Brush head accessories are just as cheap to buy on Amazon.
The App is a bit difficult to use, in addition to changing the color of those, other seemingly compatible problems are the reason for the overseas version?
Those who want to learn Dafa.
Good value for money
Have used it 3-4 times.
1. The packaging is in good condition.
2. It is very simple to use and easy to clean.
3. You can completely DIY haircuts, saving money.
All in all, a very successful purchase.
There are fakes
Last time I bought two packs, it was actually two different versions, the words in the lower left corner of the package were green, but there was a pack that was not, it was a white word, and the cat had diarrhea after eating it.
Whether Amazon's source is fake, or if it was dropped by an employee when it was shipped, I can't be sure.
I'll buy it again, and if it's still fake, I'm going to hold you accountable.
It's a horizontal bar!
Isn't it a lie that the Amazon image is slashed on it, and it turns out that it is a horizontal bar?
The effect is ok
Cats love to eat, that's the point.
It does work.
Tight, narrow, hoop the foot, grind the instep.
Not recommended.
1.UN is the most comfortable series of clarks, but unfortunately this one is too poor.
Addendum: Today, compared with the previous UN series insoles (shoes are thrown away for use), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, which is fake and soft.
2. My instep is not high, and the part of the instep is about 3 cm forward at the highest point of the instep.
3. Bought three pairs of clarks overseas, only one pair fits.
I was so scared that I deleted all the music in my favorites.
If you try Rockport, you can only go to the ECCO store.
Shoddy, poor quality control
First of all, it is worth affirming that Prime's overseas purchase of Ups is very powerful, and the order under the 31st was received on the 6th.
The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the leather feels good.
The shoe size is a little bigger, 25 feet long and 10.5 wide 7.5W, the upper foot is a little loose, but I usually like to wear a little looser, and a pair of insoles is just right.
Secondly, the quality control of this shoe really does not dare to compliment, one sole rubber is damaged, the other upper has various scratches and a needle eye, the rubber strip at the junction between the upper and the sole is misplaced, and it is clearly shoddy!
A little regretful!
I bought it for 280 yuan to do the activity, and it is quite cost-effective to buy ASICS at this price, of course, there is a lower price depending on the reviews.
Now let's talk about the shoes, the advantages: the shoes are very light, very comfortable to run, and they fit the feet well, and they will not fall loose.
The appearance is very high, but the disadvantages are also obvious: I usually wear 40 shoes, and the 40.5 one I bought this time is about 1 thumb away from the front end of the shoes, but this does not affect anything.
These shoes are very "narrow", and although there is still a distance in front, they feel tight.
Another point is that the shoes may not be very breathable, and it feels hot to wear them now.
Presser instep
First of all, the shoes are very well made and worth the price.
My feet are very standard, running shoes UK7.5, EU41.5, leather shoes UK6.5, Amazon's Aibu has also bought a few pairs, and there has never been a misfit, but this pair I refer to the comments, buy a larger UK7, after the foot is one yard larger The length is obviously longer, but because the insole is too thick, it still presses the instep of the foot, and the hiking shoes are very hard, resulting in a very uncomfortable foot.
If you don't have particularly thin feet, it's not recommended to buy this.
If you must buy it, you can also solve it by changing the insole, but the original insole looks very advanced, and it is a pity not to use it.
Perfect for a great purchase!
Very satisfied, very like, Amazon overseas purchases are genuine, there is no doubt about it, the quality is also very good, good quality and low price, buy at ease, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service attitude is very kind and kind, deal with the problem patiently and efficiently, perfectly solve the worries, supporting the express delivery is very convenient and secure, the delivery master is very considerate of the customer, every time will remind the timely pick-up from the express cabinet, thank Amazon for providing customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
In short, our whole family loves shopping on Amazon overseas!
Absolutely bad review!
I am really speechless about this agency and Amazon.
In the future, you should be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon.
Although it has been said for a long time, I still have to complain.
I bought it in winter for a second kill, less than 200, and it was useless to put it at home for a few months.
When I wanted to use it in the spring, I found that I couldn't connect with the bracelet, and the instructions of the two devices expressed support for each other, and then I found out that it should be a problem with the heart rate belt, because I found other devices and still couldn't connect.
I called Amazon and asked me to contact the agency, and the agency asked me to send the equipment to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After nearly half a month, the things were sent back as they were, and even the express box was the one I used when I sent it!
There are no responses, receipts, and test reports!
Tell me if it's good or bad!
I called and asked, and said that sending it back like this means that the equipment is okay and is good.
But why can't I connect, the agency replied: then it's not their business.
I'm unlucky, I'm too lazy to be tossed by you for a 200-dollar thing.
Serious mismatch.
It's not the right thing.
The headband is made of good material.
Much better than Nike.
Breathability is also very good.
It's just the hat in front.
Very fine.
Are you here to tease?!
No sunlight at all.
The reason for not returning is that it functions well as a headband.
Wearing it upwards doesn't cover the sun.
But it's different from other headband styles.
Keep it for now.
The quality of the goods is good, Amazon lacks the spirit of contract, and the delivery man is good.
I request delivery on Saturday and Sunday!
Amazon's regulations do not allow Saturday and Sunday deliveries.
It hurt me, and I drove 200 kilometers from other places to pick up the goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery guy was positive and welcoming.
Give a thumbs up!
Goods, simply tried it, not bad.
But I haven't bought similar goods before, so I can't compare prices!
Size Logistics
The workmanship is OK, but the logistics are too slow, the previous shoes were DHL, this time Apex is really... I have bought a lot of UA in China, and the price is not low, and I feel that it is higher than NIKE ADIDAS?
Actually, it's all the same, so it's all the same, so it's a good one.
Size: I am 176CM tall, 68KG, my shoulders are wide and the clothes are generally 180, I bought M, the hem is slightly longer, and the others are just right, I see that there is a recommended S size, is the figure so slender? Or do you prefer a tight fit? I think it's better to have a looser hoodie.
The size is just right
Bust 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, consulted customer service before buying and was told that I should buy xxl, and then read the reviews and decisively started L, after receiving the goods, I found that the size was just right, and I was almost pitted.
The price of Double 11 is much more expensive than Black Friday.
The quality of the clothes is excellent.
The problem of the most affordable goods is troublesome!
The order placed on the 18th, the goods were received on the 25th, and the speed of Guangzhou to Beijing snails!
I bought the most affordable product, and the description told me that there were scratches, but after receiving the goods, I found that 4 screws and nuts were missing!
The child was reluctant to return the goods, thinking that it was not a big problem, but the small parts of the accessories, the child's grandfather ran to several nearby hardware stores and did not buy them!
In the end, grandpa glued it!
It seems that I will not be able to buy the most affordable goods in the future!
The processing quality of toys is not good
Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, and the bolts are very laborious, which shows that the processing quality is not good, and I don't know how long I can play, because it is something promised to the child, and it will not be returned.
Other comments say that the installation is not difficult, is it only the one I bought that has a problem?
Very average
Am I unlucky?
The packaging is too old to work; The workmanship is very average; There is only one type of music, and it is only 8 seconds long, and then it repeats itself; The action is to shake your head and walk forward, without any change.
Not worth the price.
If you use it urgently, you won't return it.
The quality of the toys is good, spit on the packaging
Yesterday I received the express delivery, Amazon bought it, marked it as EMS delivery, and finally it was sent by Tmall's express, how many turns has this been? Amazon and Tmall have a good relationship?
Let's talk about the packaging, it is wrapped in a few layers of plastic wrap, there is not even a packaging plastic bubble wrap inside, open it and see, all the parts are placed in the empty box, fortunately, the quality of the toy is good, there are no broken parts, it is much smaller than imagined, because it is not with a battery, and it often derails when pushing, and it feels that the gap on both sides of the track is too large, and the design is unreasonable.
Good quality and fun
It's fun, the components are very precise, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is about the same as Lego, and the price is very good when doing activities.
The process of assembling is very interesting, I will fight, and my 5-year-old son will come to play, which is very good.
He laughed a lot~ I will probably continue to buy this brand of toys in the future.
The machine is new, and the overseas shopping is good
I have seen it at Christmas, and the one I bought before was 150 yuan more expensive, but the delivery is a little slower.
The machine is still good, all are quite new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then if you connect the Poké Ball, you will send a dream.
It's not bad to play, it's more portable than PS4.
I've already bought Zelda, wait for the game, try again.
Producing rotten goods, selling rotten goods, and as a result, I bought six watches to give to my children, and one of the fast numbers was not fully displayed, and the time of the six pieces was inconsistent, ranging from more than ten hours.
I contacted the manufacturer and asked if there was a check time for the watch in storage? They replied "Yes", since there is, then why is there so much time difference, it must be that the watch has no accuracy, simply put, it is a parallel product, not what I said is ugly, look, the obvious quality problem (the digital display is not complete) are taken out to sell, is it junk goods.
I contacted the seller, and the seller said a lot of reasons, and complained that he shouldn't have bought their things in the first place, such products, such sellers, such after-sales service, who would dare to buy things on Amazon in the future.
In short, I recommend not to buy anything from this seller, it is also garbage when you buy it.
Amazon fulfillment issues
After receiving the goods, the inspection found that:
1. The table packaging is seriously worn.
2. There are serious wrinkles in the table instructions.
3. The watch does not go, and the desk lamp is not charged, and the time cannot be adjusted.
4. Contact Amazon customer service separately, and you can only mail to the United States at your own expense, and the postage will be paid later.
The reason for 5 and 2 points is that the customer service is not bad.
It can only be said that it is okay
The time is not very accurate, about a second faster every day, and it has only been used for a few months, and it has been almost two minutes.
I've used a Citizen before, and I feel like it's not going to be a few seconds away in a year or two.
The perpetual calendar function is pretty good, the timing function is a bit chicken, basically not used, and occasionally it will be touched by mistake to enter the timing mode.
Solar-powered sports watch
Advantages: Solar charging does not have to worry about changing the battery, has a world time, a variety of alarms and hourly reminders.
Disadvantages: The mirror surface is easy to scratch and enter dust.
Cost-effective: The general price in China is between 220-300, and more than 180 are purchased overseas (it takes about 1 week).
Very happy with the watch
It must be genuine, go to the counter to inspect the goods, the appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the materials are sufficient, and it is an imported mechanical movement, so there is a certain weight, it is not comparable to those three or four hundred so-called mechanical watches, this is genuine.
The timing of the watch is very accurate, the error is completely within the acceptable range, the package of the watch has a jewelry appraisal certificate, the 12 words of the dial are real diamonds, this is very suitable for wearing yourself, and it is also very face-saving to send out as a gift.
The Bentley table is really good.
Worst shopping ever
On the evening of September 23rd, my wife's mobile phone fell, and on a whim, I immediately came to Amazon to order an 8p, which was in stock but not self-operated and did not increase the price (secretly happy in my heart), because the delivery was relatively slow because it was not self-operated, the system showed that the latest receipt was expected to be on September 27.
My wife didn't have a mobile phone and died of discomfort.,The next morning at 6 o'clock in the morning, I was told to think of a way.,Later, I went to Jingdong to see that 256G was in stock and could be delivered on the same day.,I had to order another one immediately.。
After buying a new one, I thought about canceling the Amazon order immediately.
Since the order is placed in the middle of the night, it is impossible to receive the express in the early morning, call the customer service at 7 o'clock to cancel the order, and the customer service reply has been canceled, please wait for the SMS notification.
Well, I waited patiently, and at noon on the phone to see, the order is still in the state of undelivered, so I immediately contacted customer service to ask for a quick cancellation of the order, and the customer service replied that the operation has been OK.
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw that the order was still there, and I had no choice but to contact customer service again to clearly inform that it had been the third call, please cancel the order and inform the seller that it must not be shipped!
The customer service contacted the seller on the spot at my request and told me that the seller was not familiar with the system and would wait until he was familiar with the system before canceling the order.
But don't worry if you tell me that the seller already knows about it and will never ship the goods.
When I looked at the order on Monday, it had already been shipped, and I was speechless.
Since I can't contact the seller directly, I can only call customer service again.
The following processing is simply speechless, basically I say one step, and the customer service will continue to operate.
The order is still in the state of rejection so far, and it is ready to be delivered again!
Won't Amazon follow suit?
The seller's company also collected the money anyway, and it doesn't matter if you don't follow up.
To sum up, there will definitely be no advance payment for large items in the future, which is too troublesome.
It looks wonderful
I've been fancy to this camera for a long time.,But because in addition to the price,,There are some other reasons.,So I didn't buy it.,This time because of free shipping.,The price is OK so I bought it.。
After I bought it, there was nothing wrong with the others, but when the software was connected, I couldn't connect it, my home is a TP router, and after checking the Internet, I found that many people have this problem, and it took more than two hours to get it, all kinds of changes to the router settings, and finally I used 360WIFI as a medium to get it, during which I called Xiaomi customer service, and they didn't have any solution to this problem, so I directly asked me to contact Amazon for after-sales.
Another point worth noting is that I saw a user's comment on the Internet that the minimum memory card supported by this camera is 8G, and the smaller the storage capacity cannot be recognized, I hope you will pay attention to this.
It feels okay to use.,The picture is acceptable.,But the sound quality is very poor.,The machine has a certain degree of heating.,If it's turned on all the time,,It feels like this level of heating is a bit unacceptable.。
To sum up, this product still has many shortcomings, I hope you should be cautious when buying.
The reason why I give 3 stars is because this was bought with the first love of my life, and I have been dating for almost 3 years, so I left me last year, and it has been until now.
The reason why I give 3 stars is because this was bought with the first love of my life, and now I don't know how much I use it, maybe throw it away!
After dating for almost 3 years, she left me last year, and now when I think of her, I want to leave this world with heartache, the first woman in my life, which has brought me a lifetime of shadow and heartache, and I have not been able to come out of it so far.
When I bought this mobile phone, I thought about the two feelings at the time, I could still share the joys and sorrows together, but now I can't look back, life may be like this, some people don't want to meet it in their lives, and some things don't want to know in their lives, but what can be done?
How many times when I saw Samsung's mobile phone, I thought of her, and that kind of pain followed and filled my body, I was never willing to use a mobile phone of more than 2,000 yuan, but when I bought it for her, I didn't hesitate, no matter how good it was to a person, but one day when she changed her mind, all the mountains and seas and vows disappeared.
The best of the domestic brands
Huawei is a high-quality product in China.
Low-key CEOs and enterprises rely on technology and quality to win customers, which is completely different from the current business atmosphere of relying on advertising operations to increase visibility!
It is impossible for an enterprise without strength to do this, and it is not daring to do so!
That's why I chose Huawei.
I bought it and used it for more than half a year, and it feels very good, very good.
The reason why I didn't give a full score is because once when I was using it for offline navigation, there was a phenomenon of non-positioning, I didn't find out the reason in the end, and the rest of the time it was fine.
And it's online input destination, after the search automatically designed out of the route, after leaving the wifi departure, its automatic offline navigation function is very practical, no need to run traffic, it directly talks to the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation, very good!
Sony Dafa is good
Sony's low-end machine,The sense of design is still full,And the price is cheap,The screen is big enough,The battery life is first-class,It's very suitable for the elderly。
It's been a long time, but there's still nothing wrong with the machine.
However, because my Z2 is decentralized, this phone has also fulfilled its mission.
