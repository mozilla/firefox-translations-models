Last week, the costume drama "American Private Food" was temporarily suspended, which unexpectedly triggered a heated discussion about the fake ratings of domestic dramas.
Civil rights groups issue travel warning for Missouri
Due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the American Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued a travel warning to people of color who were preparing to travel to Missouri.
“The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which took effect on August 28, 2017, calls for all African-American travelers, tourists, and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling in Missouri due to a series of suspected racial incidents in Missouri in recent times,” the group’s statement said.
The recent passage of a Missouri law makes it harder to win discrimination lawsuits, and the state enforces laws to some extent against minorities, prompting the group to issue travel warnings.
Violations of civil rights are happening to people.
They were stopped for questioning, beaten or killed because of their skin color,” Missouri NAACP President Rod Chaber told The Kansas City Star.
“We have received many complaints, an unprecedented number.”
It was the first such warning issued by the group in the United States against a state.
The group cited racial defamation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tolly Sanders, a 28-year-old black Tennessee male.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year. He ran out of fuel while traveling in Missouri and was detained by Missouri police without charge for a crime.
The consultation also noted that a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General’s Office showed that “black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.”
“The consultation was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chaber said.
“People need to be prepared, whether it’s carrying bail to Missouri or letting relatives know they’re traveling in the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI’s Hate Crime Reporting Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; the state ranked 16th in the nation, based on the number of crimes.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to prosecute businesses for housing or employment discrimination.
U.S. states have passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain immigration violators, a move the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said would increase the number of racial lawsuits and issued travel advisorys for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government against other countries, but recently, advisory groups have taken this approach to address certain laws and trends within the U.S.
After the "golden age" of the box office surge in 2015, the overall film market entered a cooling-off period in 2016, and whether it could break through the total box office results of 44.069 billion yuan last year became a suspense.
From the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, in October, the prices of new and second-hand houses in Beijing both cooled down, rising only 0.6% and 1.1% month-on-month.
Lu Pesco, now UEFA's chief technology officer, made a technical report on the 2016 European Championship and last season's Champions League at the conference.
BBC says Beijing is the most exciting city: make foreigners feel ‘living in a new era’
Reference News Network reported on January 18 that Beijing may have a long history of 3 thousand years, but it is also rapidly becoming today's modern charm city.
The Chinese capital has an astonishingly high-speed Internet, cutting-edge technologies such as face recognition software, a huge investment in artificial intelligence and an unrivalled international energy, which is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners with a spirit of exploration.
According to the BBC website on January 16, the German expatriate Clemens Seich said: "If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere in the future." He quotes singer Frank Sinatra to praise the lyrics of New York City.
“If Sinatra lived to this day, he would most likely sing about a city like Beijing,” says Seich, who works as creative director for Traveler’s Archives magazine, “and lives in a city that makes you feel like you’re living in a new era and always keeping up with the trend.”
Simon Norton, who is home to his hometown in England but recently lives in Beijing, wrote on the personal blog site 4 Corners7Seas: "There is a feeling that people are generally at the center of something big, it's hard to say, but it's got many foreigners to stay there for a long time. They want to see what it's going to be and want to see for themselves."
The city’s high-quality, high-speed internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever.
Andy Peña Fuerte, from Manila and currently deputy editor-in-chief of the Beijing Children website, said: “Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society, and the Internet has integrated the functionality of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions.”
But smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing’s technological ambitions, facial recognition software has become widespread, and many mobile apps use it to make bank transfers and payments, get people into apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of ride-hailing drivers.
Beijing also recently announced plans to spend 13.8 billion yuan to build an artificial intelligence technology park, where more than 400 companies will settle down when they are built, and they will focus on developing various artificial intelligence technologies from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food is also the core of many major festivals in China over the years, participating in these celebrations is respected by foreigners, the Spring Festival is the most important social and economic festival, and it is also one of the most easily participated festivals for foreigners.
“I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year, cleaning their apartments and putting on their homes with New Year’s greetings, and that on New Year’s Eve, all family members gather for a big meal, and then celebrate the New Year with a bright flame of fire. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and family is indeed an opportunity to blend in.”
The number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but China’s language barriers and the ease of communication between expatriates can easily be an excuse for their incomplete integration into the local culture.
"Some foreigners have been living in China for many years, but they have little experience for their host country. If your initial attempt to reach out to the Chinese is not successful, it's easy to have a more easy feeling about getting along with other foreigners," Sehi said.
In these so-called “foreign bubbles” (“foreigner bubbles”) refer to foreigners only mixing among foreigners, not touching locals and local cultures, foreigners holding groups in their own communities, eating in Western restaurants, and only foreigners among friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin – it’s easier than people might think.
“A one- or two-hour weekly Chinese private lesson or an entry-level radio drama should be suitable for everyone’s busy schedule,” says Seahy.
Even learning a few classic phrases can help with shopping, ordering at a restaurant, or chatting in a taxi.
Recalcitrant air pollution is also a fact of everyday life, but in recent years the government has worked to contain some problems.
Residents stressed that it is important to go outdoors in warm months, where pollution is often mild, and that those blue sky days should be used as an opportunity to wander around in the historic hutongs or explore the popular Temple of the Day.
“Beijing is the Chinese city with the most to discover below the surface, and you can find great artistic and musical activities, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and ancient alleys,” Norton said.
The report believes that the role of aging in the growth of human capital is becoming increasingly obvious, especially in the northeast, the annual contribution of aging to human capital growth is -1.28%.
Pan Gongsheng pointed out that at present, the risk of cross-border capital flows is controllable, and the fundamental factors supporting the balance of payments still exist for a long time.
BEIJING, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- The 2016 International Summit on the Restoration and Protection of Ancient Chinese Painting and Painting was opened at Renmin University of China on December 17.
In April, the European Commission accused Google of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre-install software such as Google Search and Chrome, otherwise it would not allow them to use other Google apps.
The European Commission believes that this is detrimental to the interests of consumers and hinders competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
If convicted, Google faces a fine of up to 10 percent of its global revenue, at about $7.4 billion.
Google has not immediately commented on this.
Google is also facing an EU investigation because it favors its own shopping service in search results.
Zhang Yuning's stay in the ocean is real, it can be said that he achieved from the national youth to the national Olympic "jumping" is not accidental, and the magnitude of his leap growth is still surprising.
A picture to understand: the legal status of Bitcoin around the world
In addition to the price correction naturally caused by speculative properties, the sharp decline of this round of digital currency is also related to the "enemy" - regulatory risks.
From the visual map, the attitude of Eastern countries towards Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West, and countries that account for the majority of the world are still waiting for the legitimacy of digital currencies, which represents the "black swan risk" is still very large.
*This article is from Wall Street News (WeChat ID:wallstreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more information, please visit wallstreetcn.com or download the Wall Street News app.*
With the regulatory storm in major bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union, the global digital currency led by Bitcoin has been bloodbathed this week, and the price of Bitcoin has fallen below the $10,000 psychological integer bit on Tuesday and the largest one-day decline in three years.
In addition to the price correction naturally triggered by speculative properties, the sharp decline of this round of digital currency is also related to the long-standing "enemy" - regulatory risks.
At this important juncture, visual big data website HowMuch.net has created a map showing the legitimacy and degree of regulation of Bitcoin in countries around the world.
As the following figure shows, green represents the legal market of Bitcoin; orange represents the neutral market, although it has not yet publicly legalized the status of Bitcoin, but there is no major use restriction; light pink represents the restricted market, that is, the local government tries to use the digital currency through red line policy or regulation; deep pink represents the country where Bitcoin is defined as illegal; gray is the country that has not yet commented.

The article pointed out that from the green color distribution in the figure, it can be seen that the traditional Eastern countries' attitude towards Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West.
Russia is currently the largest country to define Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries that has not yet commented on Bitcoin and has not yet introduced relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of Bitcoin, where the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
The views of countries in the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are clearly divided, and the distribution of color blocks in these areas is more mixed.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are all legitimate bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and other countries have a certain degree of restrictions on their trading and use, and more Latin American countries have not yet voiced their voices on Bitcoin.
Combined with the above data, a total of 99 countries (or 40%) of the 246 countries in the world are not subject to restrictions on the transaction and use of Bitcoin, that is, green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (light pink), 10 countries (or 4%) have defined Bitcoin as illegal (deep pink), and 130 countries (or 53%) have not treated digital currency information (grey).
This shows that countries that account for global entities (53%, more than half) are still waiting for the legitimacy of digital currencies led by Bitcoin in China, and also represent the “black swan risk” of Bitcoin, which is still very large, because some countries may eventually make legislative decisions to restrict digital currencies.
The article believes that global regulators have not yet fully understood the emerging category of digital currencies, which may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made a statement.
Although Bitcoin’s “pobility” has grown exponentially since last year and does not represent the interest of all countries, some countries may be concerned that local fiat currencies are under threat or that digital currencies are being used by criminal organizations.
Wall Street has written an article detailing the international regulatory news on bitcoin since last week, including China’s start to crack down on online platforms and mobile apps for centralized services on over-the-counter exchanges, South Korea’s ongoing consideration of closing digital currency exchanges, the European Union’s belief that bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warning investors of the risk of “losing their blood.”
Wall Street editor-in-chief selected "Reading News | 2018: Global Central Moms Open the Year of Digital Currency?" has mentioned that from any point of view of supervision, acceptance/criticism, and adoption, 2018 will become the first year of digital currency for global central banks.
Russia and other major countries criticize the legitimacy of Bitcoin, in fact, is also to give way to the official issuance of digital currency.
Xinhua News Agency, Madrid, January 8 (Reporter Xie Yuzhi) Barcelona's new aid Coutinho debuted in the Barcelona jersey for the first time in the Camp Nou on the 8th.
Coutinho passed the Barcelona medical examination on the morning of the same day and signed a contract with Barca president Bartomeu, who is due to expire in the summer of 2023.
He then appeared as a Barcelona player in front of nearly 7,000 fans at Camp Nou.
According to Spanish media, Coutinho's total transfer fee may reach 160 million euros (1 euro is about 7.77 yuan), which is the first price in the history of Barcelona club and La Liga.
Because Coutinho is still injured, he still needs to rest for nearly 20 days to usher in his debut in the Barcelona shirt.

Now Trump's White House is Targeting the Statue of Liberty
The most certain sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statue.
The Americans, like anyone, agreed with this. So, in 2003, Saddam Hussein in Paradise Square in Baghdad was swas orchestratedly overthrown.
Stephen Miller, one of the key think tanks in the Trump administration, is in a heated debate with CNN’s Jim Acosta over the president’s proposal to severely restrict legal immigration, and he is sure to know what will happen when he slashes a symbolic axe of the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, then a group of cruise ship owners and liberal followers would surely devour him alive.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was engraved on the pedestal in 1903 (the monument was built in the next 17 years).
As Miller rebuked Acosta for saying, “I don’t want to talk about the whole truth of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world...”
The poem you are referring to is later added, not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
In fact, Miller is right, but as he himself put it, it’s not really about history.
This involves the modern echo of Lazarus’s surraught words, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: “Your exhaustion, your poverty, or your crowded people’s desire to breathe freely, and the afflicted reject your crowded beaches.”
There is no “suffering man who refuses” at a moment when our screens become more dazzling.
Miller, who has not worked on literary commentary, made it clear that these people would not be popular in Trump-era America.
This conflict over the meaning of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it actually conflicts with the American spirit.
Lazarus, along with her friends who held an event after her death, engraved her verses on a pedestal, was well aware that the behavior they were involved in was highly political.
The purpose of the sculpture is to express the connection between French and American republicanism through ancient classic metaphors that serve as the feminine incarnation of the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed that: in her poem, the female image is no longer abstract, she wants to speak.
She gave herself a very different name: Mother of Exile.
The combination of the poem and the painting was a successful feminist coup d’état and was a devastating blow to American nativism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers have always wanted to change it back to their original meaning.
Rush Limbaugh, a great speaker who was a baptist when Trump came, argued in 2010 that liberalism was not inviting anyone, and that he was now an early neoconservative who brought the flame of American wisdom to the world of ignorance: “The Goddess of Liberty is courageous.”
She meant to bring the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not the way to illuminate America.”
Unusually, Limbo was actually moved by something.
The significance of the statue depends entirely on the perspective of cognition.
Lazarus's imaginative practice was to be able to see it. When tired, poor but hopeful people would see it on the deck of the ship after a long and often terrible journey.
On the surface, this involves the perspective of those who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveyed to them the original intention of hope and welcome that they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a view that Miller and Trump once wanted to admit.
They are not torched to light the way, but to ignite hatred of their only source of power.
In 2006, Sading joined Universal Records with a unique musical style, becoming the first Chinese to sign a contract with Universal's British headquarters.
2017 World Championships: Neil Black highly praises Scotland for the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle recalled that the British national team had only two Scotsmen at the time.
Neil Black, executive director of the British Athletics Association, said the team of 16 strong Scots in the World Championship group would make a “great contribution to the national team”.
The number of Scottish field athletes selected for the London Athletics World Championships in London 2017, which opened on Friday, is the highest in history.
Black believes that "Scotland is making extraordinary development" and British track and field athletes must learn from it.
“We accept and manage to understand that, and we’ll stick to it until we’re successful,” Black said.
"I was talking to the people of the Scottish Sports Academy. They thought it had something to do with their actions.
Scottish track and field athletes believe this has something to do with their actions.
The British Athletics Association believes this is related to their actions.
Even the street people think so.
No matter what the situation, it is extremely brilliant."
A number of Scottish track and field athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be on a scale of 5,000 metres with Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle has been selected as captain by the group.
“Elivia is a bit modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," Blake said.
“Many track and field athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, or wherever they live or train, are proud to walk out the door and energetically out of the door.
Elied’s naturally engaged passion and true affection are very good.”
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400-meter hurdles at his fifth World Championships, said it was “incredible” that there were 16 Scots on the UK national team.
Previously, the number of Scottish track and field athletes participating in the World Series was up to seven, which was the number of participants in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, a mid-runner, is the leader. She has set five British records and two European records in the past year.
She will compete in the 1500m and 5000m events.
Chris O'Hare, who competed in the 1500m event, is another Scottish player to watch for, having previously achieved good results in the season, winning the British national qualifiers and the Olympic anniversary.
Doyle recalled that she was at the first world championship, when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was very proud that so many of her compatriots would not only join the team, but in some cases, they would also challenge medals to reach the finals.
"What's special about being captain of the national team is that it's voted for by the rest of the national team. So knowing your teammates voted for you to fight for something extremely unusual, it's a great honour for me anyway," she added.
“Of course, I’m very proud of all the Scottish players.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are all the old track and field athletes here, and they are about to move forward with the purpose of winning the podium.
How is my captain’s speech?
Well, I think it's great.
I just referred to the fact that in this case we are very lucky because we are hosting the World Championship at home.
That’s why it’s really important that we grow with home support and back to the Olympic Stadium.
I will get a second chance to play, and the atmosphere there will be wonderful.”

Blocking critics on Facebook: If you can't stand the censure of voters, don't run for office
Our father understood the bad media style.
Americans love Washington, but soon after, the major newspapers began to lash out at everything he did, from domestic policy to political principles.
He was annoyed with these criticisms, no doubt.
But he did not silence these critics.
For as early as 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech is taken away—we are slaughtered like a lamb in silence and ignorance.”
It reminds me of Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people because they posted their views on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor’s staff described the lawsuit as hasty, and online coverage was rife with their strong resistance: “Who cares?”
A lot of people say, “It’s just Facebook.”
But this is important.
This is especially important because it is faced with people like Hogan.
It was a Republican who served as governor in a state that had a democratic majority, and he was surprisingly popular.
Among the 50 governors in the country, he received the second praise.
Hogan was not a reactionary impatience.
He was in good control of Maryland, strictly following the rules.
He is also very good at using Facebook as the main way to connect with voters, jokingly showing his baldness after chemotherapy for the first time on the homepage.
So it's completely unnecessary to block people who come to the governor's homepage for comments, and it's ultimately dangerous. The home page is a public forum, an official management platform that is blared by public tax-funded staff.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman, Amelia Shas, defended the governor’s actions, saying she thought blocking their comments was nothing more than trying to keep them restrained.
But they have too sloppyly described it as a flood beast or cynic who has swept the network.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with people who were blocked by Hogan.
They are nothing more than ordinary people talking to their chosen leaders: their status is a teacher, a small business owner, and a pastor, not a flood.
They have expressed their deepness, respect, and disquellence in their comments.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Bowie's barrister in Maryland, Rakshimi Salma Ramani, was not cynical, but she asked questions about hate crimes.
She wrote in the News Story Review section of The Washington Post, “I’m politely commenting that I’m disappointed that he didn’t respond to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also don’t like a bunch of people commenting on the same topic, because they’re being ignored by some people, who are called herd mentality, not as a bunch of worried citizens.”
What the governor’s staff called a “dense spam bombardment” may seem to others to be “persistent.”
The Facebook era has made it easy to change a message, just blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It was also much cleaner than in the past, and to do the same in the past, it was necessary to send staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical speech or to arrest or silence protesters.
But that’s what’s happening now, but on a digital level.
Hogan isn’t the first public official to be blamed for silving others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users because he blocked them on Twitter.
Last week’s landmark ruling in Virginia was about such a problem.
According to District Judge James C. Kacharis of Alexandria, the chairman of the Lawden County Oversight Committee blocked voters from her Facebook page in violation of the First Amendment.
Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) is also patronized by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so difficult.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet had similar influence.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and some wrote anonymous letters criticizing his leadership.
And even at that time, Washington had an anonymous flood of beasts against him.
People used pseudonyms such as Yurikra, Valerius, Belisarius, and Pogius to write to the newspaper to sharply criticize Washington's decision-making.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper's online project, his office was inundated with petitions, criticizing his attitude on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America, which he signed with England.
But he didn’t silence them.
Freedom of speech, political freedom, and freedom of speech are the foundation of this country.
Real leaders need to accept this.
The slightest glimmer of wind and grass in the property market affects people's sensitive nerves.
The purchase restriction is a hard bar for real estate regulation and control policies in many cities.
In May 2017, Jinan issued regulations that undergraduate students should pay social security for six months in a row, and they can enjoy the same purchase policy for residents of local permanent residents;
In June, Wuhan issued a policy that stipulates that college students can settle down with a graduation certificate and employment certificate within 3 years.
Then the policy increased, the official said, "college students can buy a house at a price of 20% below the market price";
In July, Chengdu issued regulations that young talents with bachelor's degree or above in foreign universities can apply for Chengdu with a graduation certificate.
In addition, there are also cities or regions such as Kunshan and Shanghai Lingang that have also issued relevant policies for the introduction of talents to lower the threshold for talent purchase and settlement.
Zhang Hongwei believes that this is actually the competition of major cities for the population, especially talent, to retain the population, especially talent, the city is competitive, this is the most important significance of these real estate policies.
Some people even think that this means that the time has come for the property market to be cancelled.
Director Er Dongsheng said on the same day that the shooting plan has been a long time, the first adaptation of the script was in 1999, and even ready to find Jincheng Wu to play Yan XIII.

It feels amazing to be here,
Golf is great here.
Last year’s memories came up, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year’s win had a special meaning for us.
It’s a really special memory, and we’ll always remember that.”
Returning to the homeland, he returned to the tournament by Gary Orr, who turned 50 earlier this year and then took part in the European Evergreen Tour.
This is his first time competing in Scotland since the 2013 Scottish Golf Open.
Helensburg Orr said: "There will always be more meaning in the race back home.
You want to do it well; but you can feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, I’ve been playing golf.
I am very happy with the current situation.”
Joining the three-person team were former Masters winners Ian Wosnan and evergreen champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNuit.
Of the six Scottish athletes on the field, Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two, while the other four are Andrew Odekron, Stephen McAllister, Bill Langmue and Ross Drummond.

Zou Shoumin, director of the Environmental Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, introduced in Beijing on the 22nd that in August, a total of 57 cases of continuous punishment were implemented nationwide, and the new revision of the Environmental Protection Law implemented at the beginning of this year significantly increased China's environmental law enforcement efforts.

Poverty and Death in Kinzhu, Indonesia
Badtina DeJe didn’t use a stove when cooking.
She rarely even uses pots.
Her wooden house is located in Enarotali, the capital of Pania County, Papua, Indonesia, and the housewife usually just puts a sweet potato — locally called “nota” — directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the charred sweet potato was taken out by a pair of hands that had not been washed, and devoured it.
Dai Jie sat on the mud floor—she had no furniture, and it was where she did everyday family chores, such as washing her clothes, and the water was very turbid, all from the nearby swamps.
In a room without a roof is a bucket, which is the outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of the husband’s four wives, so she was not placed in the field to take care of her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, it is dangerous to work until the evening: most of the men in the village are not working, and many are drunk, plus there are many soldiers here.
She said, "No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.."
It was a rare glimpse into daily life in the Papuan highlands, once a Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after a 1969 referendum, but that referendum was also controversial when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by show off in front of the army occupying the area.
The current campaign to hold for independence and opposition to Dutch rule soon points the finger at the Jakarta government, which has imposed repressive rule in the region and isolated by foreign journalists and activists.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua provinces, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is remote and deserted; it takes 90 minutes to fly from the provincial capital of Chayapura to Nabire, then rent a car for 5 hours and turn the river in your stomach.
There is no public transportation.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the wooden house is surrounded by bamboo fences, and the folded iron roof is a variety of yellow-brown coverings made of rust.
Few Indonesians have come in, not to mention journalists, and almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian evangelist, the Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god named Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here as well.
Dai Jie said, "We're not used to these clothes." She was referring to her brightly colored hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to cover our bodies with only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 percent of the population lives below the poverty line and has the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But it is also the golden continent of Indonesia.
Panier County is located in the highlands, approximately the same area as New Jersey, with 153,000 people. The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grassberg, is just 60 miles from it, and the gold mine is owned by Phoenix-based Philip MacMoran Copper Gold.
In 2015 alone, Philips mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper mines here.
In addition, Papua is rich in wood resources, with an estimated value of $78 billion.
Yet these rich resources are also the source of the Papuan tragedy, and it is only by this fact that Indonesia’s powerful military forces have been able to suppress them.
A 2005 New York Times investigative report showed that Felipe paid nearly $20 million to local military and troops between 1998 and 2004, and $150,000 for an official alone.
Papuans’ demands for independence grew stronger, threatening the gold, and they were subjected to cruel treatment.
Since 1969, more than half a million Papuans have been killed and thousands raped, tortured and imprisoned by Indonesian forces, according to activists.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings in the Papuan tribal highlands of the 1970s have escalated into genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane, “We Will Lose Everything,” included proofs of the previous year’s demonstrations of demarcance, such as extrajudicial executions, torture — another report that rape and electricity were particularly common — and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
Andreas Halsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch, said that “violence happens every day, so it is difficult to count the number of victims”.
Papua's resources attracted large numbers of immigrants outside Indonesia, and the oppression began.
Eighty-three percent of the province's population of 3.5 million are Christians, but the demographics of Muslim economic immigrants have changed since they arrived from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
The Javanese food stall sells a mix of fried chicken and vegetables with peanut butter.
Locals are fighting.
Aposyu, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Chayapura to find work, explained that “those immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans.
This has caused the local Papuans — the mama-mama — to lose their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo (often referred to as Jokowi) vowed on his 2014 campaign to address Papua’s inequality and abuse of power.
The former carpenter’s road to the presidential palace in Jakarta was supported by 27 of the 29 districts – including Panyia.
But Papua has nothing changed, and today the locals feel betrayed.
“We are heartbroken, we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and hope that he can achieve our wish and restore fairness.”
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai had his worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotali sang Christmas carols in front of a bonfire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly rushed over on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavet Tebe, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
The victims and witnesses said the drunken soldiers used their guns to chase the children.
Then one of the soldiers fired at the children.
16-year-old Julianus Yemer was in a coma after being severely beaten.
Hours later, a raging fire broke out at the election commission building of a nearby government agency, and the incident escalated the next day.
Some 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
They carried ritual bows and danced the waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua – running around the circle and imitating the birdsong.
Some protesters began throwing stones at military posts.
According to an official document seen by Time magazine, when emotions continued to intensify, the soldiers received orders through internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot immediately." But the document was not released to the local media.
Jeremias Kayamu, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighbourhood of Enarotali, felt imminent danger, and called for calm in the crowd and begged them to go home.
But no one was in the mood to hear him.
He stood on the porch of his brightly colored wooden house and told Time magazine, "When I turned back, my left wrist was suddenly shot."
Kayamu still doesn’t know who fired the gun, but he said the bullets came from among the assembled soldiers.
He added, "It was very crowded, they fired a lot of guns."
According to the cousins of local Olfius Yul, he witnessed the shooting and saw Orfius Juul in three shots.
Yuhanes sadly told Time magazine, “I ran over to check his body to see if it was him.
I found out he was dead...I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Juje Mende told reporters that his subordinates were simply "protecting" the police station because the police station had been attacked.
In 2015, Papua police spokesman and police chief Pugio Sulistio said, “When someone threatens to kill us, we have to defend ourselves.”
It's a matter of death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The next day news of the killing spread only slowly in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a speech in Cayapura expressing deep sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the abuse of power left over from Papua’s history.
“I hope that this case will be resolved as soon as possible, so that it will not happen again in the future.”
In October 2016, Security Minister Wilando said he wanted to set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuses of the push also almost immediately sounded.
He said, “Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but it will still require a process.”
Then on June 5 in Jakarta, Vilando, in a conversation with Time magazine, said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be settled in accordance with the law.”
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Wilando over the more than 1,000 deaths in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999, but said 11 human rights violations in Papua have been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Pania incident sniffed at these statements.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven’t progressed at all,” Yuhanes said.
Years later he said, "I'm tired."
He is still living in fear.
He said, “I’m scared.
I was afraid of being arrested by the army, afraid of being shot.”
His brother, Yucabos, also believed that the people of Paniai were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
He said, “After the body was buried, the military came to me.”
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deyai County, Paniai County.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a coma man to the hospital, where one person was killed and 17 injured, including a child.
A 24-year-old man, Lavianus Dovu, drowned while fishing in a nearby river and died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's live office.
Police said villagers threw stones at police, so police fired warning shots.
But the riot-mobile unit (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
Domingor Buddy, 29, told Time magazine, "We were all panicked and now were afraid they would take revenge." He lived near the hospital and witnessed the wounded being rushed to the hospital.
“I’ve been hiding at home for two days.”
The Deyai parliament has called for the police to be brought to justice and the riot mobile forces to be evacuated from the area.
Pania has always been a place of injustice to the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has led to the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes, which are scattered across the lush central highlands of Paniai.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the Papuans by dispersing attacks and raids to kidnap Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papuan movement were born in Paniai, including Tadius Yugi and Daniel Yudas Kogoa.
As a result, thousands of Panyias have been arrested by the military in recent years under the guise of “upholding national sovereignty” and deliberately detained.
Some have never appeared again.
In the eyes of the Papuans, Paniae was a “forgotten place of tragedy.”
Poverty breeds discontent.
Enarotali sells so little rice that the locals simply can’t afford.
The bread is out of reach.
The people here grow everything they can eat: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leaves and vegetables.
Farming is a woman’s job, and every woman can take care of four or five sweet potatoes.
They usually use most of the harvest for writers, and the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has been drawn among local Papuans and newcomers, and the number of these migrants has increased significantly since the opening of a new route to Nabire Airport.
A small amount of existing work usually falls into the hands of better-educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans have very little money or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
John Gobai, President of the Paniai Tribal Council, said that “young people do not want to stay in this village ... because there is no work and no money.”
Papua is isolated from the world.
In addition, the restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Lonschamp were expelled from Papua because they “do not cooperate with the authorities,” even though they have been granted a rare license to shoot.
According to Felim Kane, Asia’s deputy director at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi’s election vow to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not materialized.
In a statement, he said that “if foreign journalists try to cover the disaffected provinces of Papua and West Papua in the easternmost part of Indonesia, they are at new risk: denying visas and pulling them on the blacklist.”
The absence of media scrutiny means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua’s neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands — asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “all kinds of widespread human rights violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papuan Movement .
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Almanata Nasir, who is indifferent to the group’s allegations, told Jakarta’s reporters that “Indonesia is still practicing democratic institutions and media freedom, so the evidence of human rights violations is difficult to hide.”
Locals want more attention from foreign governments.
According to a person familiar with the matter, on May 4, when the Dutch human rights ambassador, Kess Wan Barr, led a delegation of officials to visit Jayapura, the local people broke their silence and begged for "we want freedom." He also attended the meeting, but requested anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
Gobai, the council’s president, said “Zokowi’s intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shootings”.
He wanted Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai were not only living under the threat of a greedy army, but also of nothing, with few educations in the region and a lack of public health care.
Gobai said the Paniai people, like other Papuans, think that the vote they put on Jokowi is the debt he has to pay.
He said, “They don’t need money, they need justice.”
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the Paniai victims made their last symbolic revolt: to bury the body of a victim across from the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they will not let those culprits forget their crimes.
Yukabos said with his head down, “My family was killed.
What else can we do?”

Beijing time on the 9th Reuters said that Samsung Electronics on Tuesday released the first set of self-driving vehicles jointly developed with Harman International, as well as infotainment solutions, which is an important move by the company to enter the car electronics market.
Samsung Electronics acquired Harman International about a year ago.
At this week’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Samsung unveiled vehicle cameras with collision warnings, lane shift alerts, and cruise control features, developed in collaboration with Harman.
Samsung plans to begin shipping the camera system this year, which is built on technologies such as machine-automated learning and augmented reality.
Samsung also showed the "digital cockpit", even if the driver is not the owner, can also make the vehicle more personalized features, because the system can let users download the driver's data from mobile devices and the cloud.

The fire once again engulfed Dubai's "torrent" skyscraper
On Friday, a fire broke out in one of the world’s tallest residential buildings in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-high, 79-story supertall building.
It was the second fire sweeping through a high-rise building in just two years, and happened to be the skyscraper known as the Torch.
The building has been evacuated, there are no reports of injuries, and no cause of the fire has been found.
“We were sleeping and then we were woken up by the fire and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down the 50th floor,” a resident named George told Reuters.
Civil protection authorities in Dubai said the fire brigade had extinguished the fire around 4 a.m. local time (0000 GMT) and was cooling the building.
The Government indicated that it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The accident could once again raise concerns around the world about the safety of high-rise buildings using exterior wall materials.
A survey conducted by the management of the " Torch" skyscraper after the fire in 2015 found that most of the objects damaged were cladding exterior panels for decoration and insulation.
British police have said they believe problems with the insulation and panel-covering system at London's Grenfell building could be responsible for the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
Williams also hinted that Massa might return, although he has announced his retirement.
January 9 is only one month away from the opening of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea, with the Olympic flame from the south to the north of the transmission of warm-up and preparations intensively, South Korea's domestic winter Olympic atmosphere is becoming increasingly strong.
South Korean public opinion is looking forward to this long-lost inter-Korean talks, which can bring an "egg" to the countdown to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics one month.
On November 1 last year, the flame of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics arrived in South Korea.
The boom set off by the Holy Fire is directly reflected in the ticket sales of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the ticket sales rate of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics was only hovering at 32%, and the ticket sales rate of the Winter Paralympics was only 4.3%, and the sluggish ticket sales rate once worried the outside world about the popularity of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
However, as Li Xifan, chairman of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Organizing Committee, predicted to reporters not long ago, "With the transmission of the Olympic flame in various parts of South Korea, the heat of the Winter Olympic Games is getting higher and higher, and I believe that ticket sales will soon improve."
According to South Korean media reports, as of January 3, the ticket sales of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics have reached 64%, and the ticket sales rate of the Winter Paralympic Games has also exceeded 50%.
In order to encourage foreigners to go to Korea to watch the competition, the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea also announced on the 8th that it will extend the stay in South Korea for foreigners who visit the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, with a maximum stay of 120 days.
Survey finds more than one in five U.S. travelers carrying prohibited items on board
An investigation into the aircraft's passengers found that more than 20 percent of passengers had intentionally or unintentionally entraind illegal items to board the plane through a U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoint, and at least 6 percent of those passengers had unintentionally boarded the plane with prohibited knives or other stripes.
Less than 1% of passengers claimed they had only since been found to have traveled by gun, ammunition or explosives.
The survey, which looked at more than 1,000 people, was conducted by charter services company Stratos Jet Charters Inc., and found that younger travelers were more likely to blatantly ignore the rules.
Among the respondents who admitted to having deliberately tried to board the plane with TSA prohibited items were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent of Gen X.
The most common items that deliberately slip through TSA security officers are food and beverages.
More than 3 percent admitted to having deliberately carried a blade through security, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents said they had intentionally brought a banned drug on board.
The company said the survey of travelers across the country was intended to understand the number of people who accidentally carried and deliberately carried embargoed goods through the security check-in of the plane.
Not surprisingly, those most likely to carry embargoed goods through security—intentionally or unintentionally—are those who fly the most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and difficult to understand.
People are usually not sure what kind of liquid they can carry and how much.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the most seized TSA is the illegal liquid.
It was once thought that the TSA might also use books as embargoes.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but international flights are not allowed.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Pruitt changes his mind about Obama-era emissions-reduction regulations
A day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt changed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era regulations to reduce emissions of smug air pollutants.
Pruitt proposed this change because the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state agencies for environmental regulation than previous administrations.
He did not mention the legal challenge brought by the Federal Court of Appeal against his predecessor.
The dispute focused on setting October 1 as the deadline for states to begin meeting the 2015 ground-level ozone standard.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance for a year to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid “interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth.”
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Pruitt was the Oklahoma attorney general who has long opposed the rigorization of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly turned to regulations that have blocked or delayed opposition from the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday’s sudden reversal is a recent legal hurdle in Pruitt’s regulatory turnaround to the agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped his authority to try to delay enforcement of the Obama administration’s rules requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday night, Pruitt offered a U-turn in his approach to ozone standards, saying he wanted to strengthen the Environmental Protection Agency’s commitment to work with states to adopt complex procedures to meet new standards.
“Under previous administrations, the EPA usually falls short of the specified deadline, and then waits for radical groups and other people to sue and then agree to asser to assertially set the designated schedule through agreement.” He has filed more than a dozen prosecutions against the Environmental Protection Agency in his previous work.
“We don’t believe in the regulation that goes through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously.”
Still, the EPA statement said Pruitt could again use his “delay authorization and all other legally available authorizations” to ensure that the provisions comply with “good policies and the best available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broad rewrite of the ozone layer regulations.
The House bill, which was approved last month, is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rule by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman led the state coalition to sue the EPA this week for its intention to maintain legal pressure.
“The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s reversal — after we filed the lawsuit — is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with communities of more than 115 million Americans directly affected by smoke emissions,” Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, and the District of Columbia all joined New York in the case.
Ground-based ozone is the result of a reaction by the reaction of common pollutants emitted by automobiles, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources under atmospheric sunlight.
The resulting smoke causes severe respiratory problems for sensitive populations, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Prutt’s surprising shift.
Lori Ann Bird, of the Centre for Biological Diversity, said: “It is disturbing that this common-sense measure is under intense pressure from the head of the department that protects the air we need to breathe.”
“We must fight the Trump administration to the end against the ideological movement that caters to polluters and special interest groups.”

Since the second half of 2009, Xiaoshan flower and wood sales (value) has maintained a high trend, especially this spring, Xiaoshan seedling sales hit a record high, sales increased sharply, prices rose sharply, according to statistics, from January to June this year, Xiaoshan District to achieve seedling sales revenue increased by 48% over the same period last year, the growth rate is the highest in nearly 20 years.
Shi Haiyong, deputy director of the Xiaoshan Forestry Bureau, said that with the good sales situation, Xiaoshan flower and wood production has also achieved rapid development.
In the past two years, the planting area of Xiaoshan flowers and trees has expanded by 30,000 mu, with a total area of 180,000 mu; at the same time, it has actively developed outside the region, and Xiaoshan Miao farmers have established a flower and wood base in various parts of the country to reach 80,000 mu, an increase of 30,000 mu over 2008.
At the same time as the planting area is expanded, the quality of seedlings has also been continuously improved, the value of nursery storage has been continuously improved, large specifications and high-quality seedlings have been retained more, and some seedlings have been sold.
Shi Haiyong also reminded that in the face of the current prosperity of production and sales, producers should calmly face and objectively analyze, both to see that the society's demand for flowers and trees will be long-term and increasing, but also to realize that the market competition will be more intense.
On the morning of July 13, Beijing time, Somaltus Corporation of the United States filed a lawsuit in the Eastern Texas District Court, accusing Apple of infringing a battery technology patent it applied for in 2010.
The company has previously sued Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba with the same patents.
The lawsuit alleges that both the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices infringed on U.S. patents number 7,657,386, which are called Integrated Battery Services Systems.
The plaintiff wishes to receive cash compensation or charge a patent fee for the infringing equipment after the judgment was announced.
Judging from the indictment, the plaintiffs appear to believe that the iPhone’s fast-charging feature infringed on the company’s patent.
iPhones with fast charging will quickly charge up to 80%, and then trickle-down charging.
Somaltus is actually a so-called “patent rascal” because the company does not offer obvious products and services, and it is difficult to find relevant information online.
However, they have successfully reached an out-of-court settlement with automakers such as Ford and Nissan for the patent.
The meeting believes that accelerating the development of information technology, promoting the integration and efficient use of resources, and improving the digitalization and intelligence of the industry are of great significance to promote "Made in China 2025" and mass entrepreneurship, innovation, cultivate new momentum, and improve the quality of life of the masses.

According to leaked phone records, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the wall.
The Washington Post leaked transcripts of calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States reportedly expressed his dissatisfaction with his public attack on the wall, and Putran reportedly said to him: “Don’t tell the media.”
Trump pledged in the presidential campaign to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and solemnly announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
Records of the call between him and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, which showed a tense exchange between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. taking on a deal to send refugees to Australia was “absurd,” “unsable” and “stupid” that he had advised the U.S. to ban refugee resettlement, and now stick to the deal brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a “fool.”
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull that "this is the most unpleasant call today."

SEOUL, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and North Korea concluded high-level talks in Panmunjom on the evening of the 9th, and the two sides issued a joint statement to reach an agreement on the DPRK's participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and the holding of military-department talks between the two sides.
According to the joint statement issued by the two sides, the DPRK will send a high-level delegation and a delegation of the National Olympic Committee to participate in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
In addition, the DPRK will also send athletes' groups, cheerleaders, art troupes, press corps and other groups to visit South Korea; the ROK side will provide necessary facilities for this.

The report analyzes the results of a survey of 1,045 foreign tourists who visited Seoul in December.
The report pointed out that the per capita purchase volume of foreign tourists was 1.06 million won.
Among them, the average amount of Chinese tourists shopping is the largest, 2.13 million won, 6.5 times that of Japanese tourists, and 3.2 times that of US and European tourists.
When asked about the purpose of traveling to Seoul, 62.2% of Chinese tourists answered "shopping" and 94.9% of Chinese tourists bought cosmetics.
96.3% of Chinese tourists shop in duty-free shops in urban areas, spending 1.56 million won per capita.

Moore Beach tragedy: activists re-enact racist lynchings, justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car runs through a group of onlookers in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, toward the tiny Moor Beach Bridge.
The car was carrying four black passengers and a white driver, and before the car reached the bridge, a group of white men with guns walked forward and blocked the road of the car.
The mob’s head — a middle-aged man in a fine-striped suit — took a deep sip of his cigar and glanced into the windshield.
The passengers in the car were full of fear.
“We want – Roger!” the man shouted.
“Get him out of the car!”
A young black man was dragged down the front passenger seat and screamed to break into silence.
Fortunately, the terrible scene of July 22 is just a repeat.
But when “Roger” put a noose around his neck, almost all the onlookers gave a real gasp.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moor Beach Bridge, recreating the scene of two black couples — Roger and Dorothy Malcon — along with Georges and Merey Dossy — hanged by the K.K. in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
“While we know who they are, even though we’ve seen them in the community, it’s incredible that none of them have been arrested in all these years,” said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the re-enactment.
“This is the stain of history, a burden to our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia lawmaker and lifelong activist.
For him, a repeat is a remarkable call to action, reminding the people of the Monroe community every year that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want to prosecute, we want to close the case, we want a cure, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he said.
“Unless we receive justice, we will not be healed or reconciled.”
On July 27, 1946, the coroner put a bed linen on the body of a victim of a lynching in Moore's Beach.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in the lynching.
None of them have been prosecuted.
While the suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motivation for lynching is well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote in the primary for the first time later that summer.
According to FBI statistics, around the same time, black tycooner Roger Malcolm assassinated white landowner Barnett Hurst in a fight — it looked like it was for a woman.
Brooks said the town was rumored to be Hirst sleeping with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband's.
The FBI said that on July 25, 1946, the prominent white landowner, Roy Harrison, spent $600 to release Malcolm on bail.
Dorothy and his cousins, Mai Merry, and George Dorsey accompanied him to prison.
But as they returned from prison and were about to reach the Moore Beach Bridge, a group of lynching thugs surrounded the car.
“It turned out that it was Harrison who organized and ordered the execution of this murder,” an FBI report concluded.
“It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, who not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witness.”
Brooks is very brief.
He said, “This is a voting rights tragedy.”
“They were killed in a message that the killers sent to the black people of this community: ‘If you register and vote, you’re going to end up in the same way.’
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has been leading an annual re-enactment of the Mor Beach Bridge lynchings.
Her expression is vivid and gripping, with a deep racist background. Many people hope that this racism no longer exists in the United States.
It’s hard to look, it’s harder not to look, but Greene says that’s the point.
“We don’t want to talk about lynching because lynchings make us face the ugly side of everyone,” she said.
“But if you don’t listen to me or if you don’t hear me talk about my own experience, I can’t have a relationship with you.”
This year’s show began in June, with nearly 30 actors — a dozen whites and the rest black — huddled in a room on the first day to listen to an overview of Green’s rehearsed show.
Wade Malbow is co-director of Green.
He has been playing the K-K role for years, but he says the role is never easy.
“I feel dirty because I’m not that kind of person,” Malbow said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this history alive, because we don’t want to go back to that era.”
In the room, actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hirst, were rehearsing their lines.
At the beginning of the show, Malcolm yelled and pushed away Hirst, angry at his sleeping wife Dorothy.
“I said, get out of my place!”
Rascona shot back.
And then they fought.
Then everyone (at least all the black actors) burst out laughing.
Green laughed the most.
“What’s wrong?!” asked Rascona.
He was panicked and confused.
Have I played too much?
“No,” Green said with a laugh.
"I just don't think white people will say 'ah' when they hit back."
“Yes,” another black actor quipped.
"Your tone must be tough."
In this way, the energy in the room changed; the feeling of fraternity drove away the discomfort.
Everyone worked hard to do this, not only to perform the play, but also to commemorate the four victims.
The place begins again.
This time, when Rascona said this "ah", the tone was sharp and powerful.
No one laughs.
The re-enactment ended strongly and quickly.
Screams, gunshots, and then there was silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black stood by the actor’s body and sang Billy Hallede’s mourning “Strange Fruit.”
Her voice pressed against other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators were constantly wiping sweat and tears.
Blacks and whites accounted for almost half of the audience.
There are a couple who come to see the show from Ithaca, New York, and many people live near the road.
Brooks took them to the cemetery of Malcolm and Dorothy for a feror, and nearly eight hours later, everyone was suffering from Georgia's uncomfortable feeling of humid heat.
Until then, the murderer was still a fan. But now, standing in the same land where the lynching took place, there was anxiety in the air.
When the song’s final note disappears, Green asks people to approach some to check the body of the actor.
The children leaned over, looked at the false blood and corpses, and whispered to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” a little boy muttered, as if reminding himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and then the show ended.
The actor brushed the lynching rope and wiped away his tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marlbow, a suit man who plays the head of the Three K parties.
Nick Rasconner hugged two of his colleagues and wept in their arms; the emotion in the show eventually infected him.
“It doesn’t matter,” one of the women whispered.
“We know that’s not the case in your heart.
You do it for a reason."
After that, the audience sat down to have dinner with the actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted intimately with a black couple they had just met, talking about a repeat.
It was difficult for Dennis Duplinsky to find words to describe how she felt after watching.
“It’s hard to imagine those horrible words and actions ... that people like you say and do it because they look like you,” she said.
“It really made me think that the lynching was still going on,” she added, “and now this kind of thing is only called a police shooting.”
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat at the table watching, tasting and reminiscing about civil rights.
He said he had already started planning for next year’s show.
“Reuncoming is an inspiring way because it describes the horrors we’ve been through, but it’s also very educational,” he said.
“If you don’t learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not study and do not know their own history are doomed to repeat them.”
For the reform of natural gas market reform, the reform of "independence of the pipeline network" is self-evident, but the resistance and controversy are also large.
The reporter learned from Hebei Kailu Group on the 7th that at 11:25 a.m. on the 7th, an explosion occurred in the emulsification workshop of Kailu Group Chemical Co., Ltd. in Guye District of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, and 13 workers were trapped at the scene.
Up to now, of the 13 people trapped, one has been rescued, rushed to the hospital for rescue, and the remaining 12 people are in the process of search and rescue.
It is understood that the scene has been blocked, the local public security, fire, medical and other departments are on the scene of rescue.
According to witnesses, there was a loud noise at the time of the incident, and a mushroom cloud vacated in an instant.
According to the site organization of search and rescue of Kailu Group personnel, Tangshan Kailu (Group) Chemical Co., Ltd. is located in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, the ancient metallurgical district Zhaozhuang North, is the state-approved civilian blasting equipment fixed-point production enterprises, was founded in 1958, the original name of Kailu Mining Bureau six O two plant.
Since his debut 15 years ago, Jay Chou has made a new album every year, but last year he was a rare out of contract.
However, the fans did not express any dissatisfaction with this, but sent their blessings, because the reason for the loss of the contract was that Jay Chou was happy to become a father.
After waiting for everyone for a whole year and a half, yesterday Jay Chou finally came to Beijing to present this first work of his upgraded father, and also the 14th album of his music career, "Chou Jieren's Bedtime Story."
Scientists at China's Air Force Engineering University study laser satellite for removing space junk
Reference News Network reported on January 18 that Chinese scientists have put forward a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up cluttered Earth orbit, destroying old satellites and their sky litter.
According to the US "Newsweek" website reported on January 15, the researchers of the Chinese Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled "Space-based laser removal small-scale space debris re-orbiting model study", the paper describes how by the use of space-based platform lasers, space debris can be irradated into smaller, less harmful debris.
Space junk has been a concern for the International Space Agency for years, and NASA has considered a variety of options to track, detect and remove man-made debris.
The way large-scale space debris is removed includes a giant network for cleaning and collecting waste, as well as magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted laser simulation studies and concluded that this will be an effective way to clean up Earth's orbit.
The abstract of the paper states: “(simulation studies) provide the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based platform laser removal space debris technology.”
A 2014 study by U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin found that there are about 200 threats a day for satellites that are orbiting.
High-speed debris moving along Earth's orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions, described by European Space Agency experts as a "deadly cascade of threats." High-speed debris has continued to increase over the past year.
According to the U.S. "Popular Machinery" monthly website reported on January 17, space is basically empty, but the space next to Earth is becoming more and more crowded. Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris orbiting the Earth, and over time, these debris will pile up.
The more debris there are, the higher the chance that a satellite that is still functioning will be hit by the debris, which in turn will damage or destroy a multimillion-dollar investment.
All space agencies have plans to remove space junk in the future.
NASA is considering using jet gas to reduce the speed of debris, de-orbiting it, and Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net to capture debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan's idea is to capture the debris with an electric chain.
Right now, China is also proposing a solution to space junk, using a large laser to hit floating space junk into less harmful small pieces.
According to a paper published in the German journal Optics by a group of researchers at the China Air Force Engineering University, installing such a laser on a satellite would be enough to clean up space effectively, at least according to the simulation.
The only way to prove its effectiveness is to test it, and there are no arrangements for such a mission, but it may be sooner or later that someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space.
Once that’s done, we can finally start eliminating the problem of space junk once and for all.

Pearson to cut 3,000 more jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash an interim dividend of 72% as it began another restructuring project to deal with business pressures.
Chief Executive John Faron said most of the job cuts would take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, after a previous restructuring that had reduced 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut another £300 million ($394 million) in costs in its third cost-cutting program to revive businesses hit by the rapid development of digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsman, and published a report saying its base sales rose 1 percent in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion, but said the outlook for the year remained unchanged.
A few days ago, the China Field Association seriously issued a notice, severely cracked down on the phenomenon of running, and prepared to give offenders a heavy penalty for life-long bans.
Suicide bombing in Kabul kills NATO soldiers
According to official sources, a military convoy was attacked by a suicide bomber in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Karabag area.
It was the latest violent attack in Afghanistan — Tuesday's bombing of the Herat mosque that killed more than 30 people.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO statement, an explosion late Thursday saw a joint Afghan and NATO coalition patrol being attacked with “personally carrying an improvised explosive device.”
The statement said all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to reports, the growing presence of the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State (IS) group in the Karabakh region has raised serious concerns among NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, while the death toll in the capital accounted for about 20 percent.
A suicide car bomb attack in a predominantly Shiite area of Kabul in late July killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban claimed they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a huge explosion in central Kabul killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since the U.S.-led multinational force toppled the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underscores the dangerous security situation in the country as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs whether to increase troops to Afghanistan to support its troops and police.
The suicide bombing in Kabul in recent weeks has also sparked a crisis of public trust in the government and its policies, particularly President Ashraf Ghani’s reputation, according to reporters.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Refuse Resolutions After Litigation, Delays Smoke Regulations
During his tenure, Obama made a rule that required states to curb the various emissions that caused smog, and 15 states sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for that purpose. A day after the indictment, the EPA overturned the rule.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced on Wednesday its decision to continue the so-called “Ozone for 2015” and pledged to work with states.
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement, “We are confident in our dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to them.”
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA plans to delay the implementation of the ozone-compliant area standard until October 2018, with a one-year delay — a year-long delay — according to which existing smog pollution is measured in some areas to determine which areas should reduce emissions from smog pollution to comply with air quality standards.
Fifteen major Democratic states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit Tuesday, claiming it was illegal.
As part of a broader agenda, President Donald Trump authorities have been working to reinstate the various environmental regulations pushed by former President Barack Obama to spur economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups. They fear more emissions will affect public health.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency website claims that breathing ozone-containing air “will reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms, such as asthma.”

McKee Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time to discuss possible future battles
The most high-profile 147-pound-down boxing match will take place shortly, with Vasily Lomachenko and McKee Garcia meeting for the first time in a potentially conflict-ridden state.
They were in the separate room in the ESPN office in Los Angeles, and the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia took the lead in walking down the corridor to pay tribute to the world boxing organization super-heavyweight champion Lomachenko.
At the Showtime boxing on Saturday, the referee unanimously determined that Garcia had defeated the four-subition world champion Adrian Brona to victory, and the two boxers had become the top five players on the same heavyweight list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, “Champion, how are you?”
Good luck to you."
In an ESPN game Saturday night at 7 p.m., Lomachenko defeated Miguel Mariaga, preserving his status.
As the two of them took the picture, Lomachenko’s agent, Egiss Klimas, noted that the potential matchup between the two players depended on the “perfect size”.
“I was lightweight before,” Garcia said.
“I went up to fight Brona (140 pounds), but I didn’t weigh that much.
Compared to 140 pounds, I weigh a little bit.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he has to get to the lightweight (135 pounds) before we can fight.
That’s what the fans want too.
Then we will satisfy them."
Lomachenko agrees.
“The boxing world needs this fight.”
Klimas asked if he should pay for it, and part of his strategy was to have Lomachenko make his debut match with a 135-pounder later this year, thinking he would make a date with Garcia (37-0,30 knockout) next summer. Garcia was also interested in a showdown with the winner of the battle against Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after the September 23rd Forum Lightweight Championship.
"Since all the fans are asking this question, this match may be on charge," Garcia said. After that, he was open to playing on the web that offered the best financial solution.
“We are the main people.
No one else can generate that much attention.
As long as they are ready...”
Garcia appreciated that Lomachenko was "an excellent player" and could watch his boxing match on Saturday.
But Lomachenko hesitated in his praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-part champion from Riverside looked "slow. Sorry, McKee ... you're going to be eliminated."
Garcia said the point is to show the power of the fist and then boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing match.
“This is a necessary battle,
Concern and heat are beyond the reach of other boxing matches.
I’d love to play,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I’ve been waiting for the top fighters, this time it’s McKee’s turn.
It's going to be a great fight."

China's National Development and Reform Commission officials' statement on the early completion of the 11th Five-Year Emission Reduction Targets has given the steel industry with a strong expectation of resumption of production.
Although the steel mill has not received a clear notice from the local government that the energy conservation and emission reduction work has been completed, the industry estimates that around December 15, 2010, the steel mills that were originally limited in various places will resume production one after another, and the steel price may begin to be under pressure.
At present, the notice of the end of the power limit has not been received, but in fact, the pressure of various enterprises has been much smaller than in September and October, a private steel company in Hebei Province told reporters.
Some places in Hebei have repeatedly issued power-limiting production documents, and once adopted a forced way to restrict enterprise production.
The reporter learned from local enterprises that at present, steel mills in most areas of Hebei have resumed work, and the pressure of production restriction has been eased.
My steel network analyst Zhang Tieshan expects that because the north has entered winter, the terminal demand for construction steel will gradually change from strong to weak.
Coupled with the gradual end of energy conservation and emission reduction, by December 15th, most steel mills will basically resume production, and products will reach local markets before New Year's Day.
The increase in resource supply will put a certain pressure on the current rising steel prices.

Latest results of age assessment test for asylum seekers in Sweden announced
The Swedish asylum-seekers test uses the latest method to medically assess their age, and the latest results show that more than 80% of the subjects were judged to be over 18 years old, but not all people believe in their accuracy.
The Swedish National Forensic Science Centre (R?ttsmedicinalverket) began the test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees claiming to be minors, the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) designed the tests to allow for a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
To date, the Swedish Migration Board has sent 6,880 testers, and the Forensic Medicine Center has released the results of a total of 2,481 testers between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002 persons) were sentenced to be 18 years of age or older, but in another 25 tests, the Swedish National Forensic Science Centre determined that the subject “may be 18 years of age or older.”
In 432 tests, the result was that the person “may not be under the age of 18.”
The test is only for people with age questions.
According to John Granson of the Center for Forensic Medicine, these results are consistent with those of the previous months.
He told The Local: “There is not much difference between this data and the data of previous months, and the numbers are very consistent.”
The higher percentage of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that these asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the center released 581 test results and said there were 442 “inspects that the subject was 18 years of age or older.”
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 test results and found that 243 of them had publicly stated that they would be 18 years old this year.
X-rays of the wisdom teeth, MRI scans of joints, and then analysis by dentists and radiologists, are also questioned in some areas.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose work includes assessing people’s biological maturity to determine whether they experienced puberty earlier or later than normal age.
He told the newspaper Metro: “I have reason to think that, and I think the measurement used shouldn’t be that way.
It is very inaccurate to determine the biological age in this way.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can do it."
However, the Forensic Science Center's Glandson defended the accuracy of these tests: "In general, there is little risk that a child will be judged to be an adult."
The biggest risk is that the person is just under the age of 18, which is about 10%.
West Virginia Governor Announces Change of Party
On Thursday night, West Virginia Democratic Gov. Jim Justice announced at a rally with President Trump that he would change party.
“Like it, don’t like it, the Democrats are gone,” the governor’s judge said.
“Today, after a lot of prayer and a lot of reflection, I’m going to tell you... Today I’m going to tell you as a West Virginian, I can’t help you as a Democrat governor anymore.”
The rally erupted with cheers.
“So tomorrow, I’m going to change my membership to the Republican Party,” Jastis added.
"As a coach, I'm going to tell it's time to start another game."
Trump earlier promised a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42% of the vote in West Virginia, and Jastis did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Jastis was voted the state’s only billionaire in 2016.
Forbes notes that he inherited his father’s coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.
Currently, he is worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement late Thursday saying: “Governor Jastis’s change of party is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, which, not only will it not hinder our country from being great again, but will make our country great again.”
“The Democrats currently have only 15 governors and control the number of state legislatures at an all-time low, and Governor Jastis’s statement is the latest rejection of a party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unified slogan,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Rona McDaniel said in a statement to the CBS News.
Fang Wenshan admitted that using music to tell a complete story is his dream.
A song of four to five minutes, it is difficult to tell a story in its entirety.
When I wrote songs, I only had emotions, there was no story line, and I always felt very sorry.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's 'candid' apology for doping scandal
On Thursday, International Federation of Athletics Federations president Sebastian Coe praised Russia for its apology for the doping scandal, saying the apology was “candid,” but he reiterated that now is not the time for Russia to re-join the sport.
Mitri Chiracdin, president of the Russian Athletics Federation, said at the IAAF convention on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country was right to be banned from the sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he regretted that “all athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were stripped of their medals”.
Despite his comments, the IAAF voted in favor of maintaining the ban. Previously, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report mentioned the discovery of evidence of state-sponsored doping, which was implemented in November 2015.
“I think today’s response was very candid, very candid,” IAAF President Kek told reporters.
“The entire Council and the AAL General Assembly are pleased ... the Russian Federation admits that it has been through a very burning period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can re-enter the competition.”
Ko said he was also "happy" that Russia accepted the criteria for re-entering the tournament.
“I think it’s been a very constructive day and also think we’ve made some progress, but the AAF General Assembly supports the task force’s recommendations and it’s not time to restore eligibility for Russia,” Ko said.

How did the football financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris?
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted spending by European luxury football clubs will not prevent Neymar from moving from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Football Club (PSG) in France at a record price.
The result is a further relegation of Paris's St. Germain Football Club by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). The European Football Association is the governing body of European football, which has the right to ban teams from participating in the widely watched Champions League.
The 2011 UEFA Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP) means that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club will eventually have to prove that Neymar’s transfer was funded without causing a huge loss.
FC Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to pay for the Brazilian player’s untos, while Neymar’s salary will be as high as tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Neymar’s move to France.
Considering that the team’s funding came from the financially coarse Qatari ruling family, Paris Saint-Germain Football Club could certainly sign Neymar in cash and include him in the ranks of other stars.
Clubs can spend a lot of money to buy players, but they have to use their legal sources of income to make up for the huge sums of money they spend to break even in football-related businesses.
The Financial Fair Play Rules were conceived by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believes that for clubs that are heavily indebted in pursuit of success, if the bank or everyone withdraws their support funds, they are actually cheating and putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the Rules shifted from club debt issues to club loss monitoring.
The change means that the business model that Roma Abramovich used when he bought Chelsea in 2003 to buy a club with potential, and then spend a lot of money to improve the team and build a global brand, now facing a more demanding situation.
During the three-year Rules assessment period to 2018, the club is likely to lose €30 million.
Despite Abu’s debasement by his then-president in 2015, UEFA’s successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to stopping excessive spending.
“Of course the Rules have not yet lapsed, and we will certainly strengthen the regulations of the future,” Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of the rules-related matters at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
While Paris Saint-Germain Football Club will pay Neymar’s buyout terms at one time, it can also be distributed within the duration of the contract based on the amount of the accounting purpose.
Neymar has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee may be shown as a fee of 44.4 million euros in the annual account for the next five years.
The first wave of Rules sanctions imposed in 2014 imposed the toughest sanctions on Paris Saint-Germain and the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City club.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the time), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and asked the team to reduce the number of players to 21 players in the 2014-15 season, instead of the normal 25 players.
UEFA is staring at clubs that try to increase their income by pegging to their owners and deceiving financial regulators.
While Qatari companies can sponsor Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, UEFA will not consider it a legitimate income if the amount of sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market prices.
This is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled at the time that the amount of money the Qatar Tourist Board sponsored by Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was overstated.
According to reports, a part of Neymar's income from Paris Saint-Germain football club may come from payments made by the 2022 Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee.
But Paris’s Saint-Germain football club and the organizing committee have denied that Neymar will be the World Cup ambassador, and it’s easy for UEFA’s regulators to do so.
The recent sanctions imposed on Paris’s Saint-Germain football club mean that UEFA will be more wary of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, people familiar with the matter said that UEFA had not held advance discussions with Paris Saint-Germain Football Club about Neymar's transfer.
The individuals were contacted only by the Associated Press on an unnamed name because they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the Paris Saint-Germain football club.
The last published accounts show that Paris Saint-Germain had operating income of €542.4 million in 2015-16, with a profit of more than €10 million.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not yet been published.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club expects Neymar’s joining will bring a boon to sponsorship events, franchises and jersey sales.
The club expects revenue to grow by at least 30 percent after signing Neymar.
It is clear that seeing one of the most famous players leave, the Spanish league is deeply angry, trying to hinder Neymar's move and claiming that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club violated the Rules.
La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS that "this is a clear illustration of a 'financial doping', with clubs and countries alike", referring to Qatar, which has ultimate ownership of Paris's Saint-Germain football club.
Arsenal team (all of the club's owners are American sports tycoon) head coach Arsene Wenger, with reservations about the attitude of state-funded clubs with La Liga.
“It’s a consequence of ownership, and it’s revolutionized the entire ecology of football over the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“Once the country has a club, everything happens.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, because for a country there are many different ways or interests to require big-name players to represent a country.”

Nostalgia is a popular market – “Hala Summer Camp” and “Detective Shuangxiong”
The story is retelled to remember the actors in the 80s and the garbage of the 90s (David Wayne and Michael Shuwalt made the sketch comedy "The Nation" for MTV), but also nostalgia for nostalgia itself, nostalgia for 2001; before that, many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller, and Paul Luther were not yet born.
As a cultural art, it is the imitation and embodiment of our permanent memories of the Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is not enough.
The response was strong after the first day of the camp aired, but it wasn’t just because of its absurd humor (the plot is an original story about a canned vegetable that cans of talking, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
The plot doubles the use of core snargiers — middle-aged actors playing children of a trick-or-treating age — makes it a funny part of not being able to get back in the past.
Ten years later, adults actually play as adults, and the emotions are not too deep-rooted and more diffuse, including the improvisation of the 90s tracking movies, such as "The Hand to Push the Cradle."
At one point, a character is trapped in an Apple notebook, some straight skates, and “some other things from 1991.”
Many of the core stories are the same.
Mr. Sweetheart (Mr. Shuwart) has now become a novelist, but he still hasn’t forgotten about Katie (Margarete Morrow).
Victor (Ken Marino) remains a virgin.
There’s another sinister conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Shuwatt), instigated by George H.W. Bush (Michael Ian Black, who was impressed).
As always, the best part of this series is the conversation.
It’s especially interesting to see this forever young Mr. Luther, who ostrached the soul patch of Matt Dillon in the movie “Single Nobility,” where Andy, formerly The School Giant, now feels like a giant.
It’s a random crazy moment that might power the movie, like the recursive Seven Years of Life series, until I come to my logical conclusion: Summer Camp Hala: Twenty Years Later, and its final scene is for the kassers to see the movie premiere of Summer Camp Hala.
At the same time, Amazon's "Detective Shuangxiong" tells different nostalgia: the Cold War revivalist "American Spy Dream", the film "The Cold City", and even the "GLOW: Gorgeous Women's Wrestling Alliance" of the East-West wrestling image.
The comedy, created by Brian Gethwood and Alessandro Tanaka, was pushed onto a television screen by director Reese Thomas: a difficult comedy set in Romania in the 1980s, about two Bucharest officials fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist line.
The main characters – hard-faired Grigor and idealistic Eisseff – were played by Florin Pearzi Jr. and Korneliu Ulich, respectively, whose conversations were voiced in English by Chanin Tatum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
But this is not just an idea.
There are some good visual gimmicks (police watch chess on TV to pass the time because Americans like to play football).
And there are many celebrity voice actors – including Jenny Sret, Nick Overman, Mahsera Hashbaz Ali and Kolo Sevigni – that have created a wonderful voice event.
But Detective Shuang is so committed to creating a hustle and bustle of propaganda comedy — a killer with a Reagan mask in the show — and it usually plays that role.
The six-episode TV is a little dragging, and the comedy effects are not released fast or frequent enough.

The reporter recently interviewed and learned that the benefits of steel, rail transit, shipbuilding, machinery manufacturing and other industries in the northeast region have generally declined, and even losses have occurred.
Some experts believe that under the current situation, the new round of revitalization of Northeast Industry is not only related to the current round of economic recovery in the country, but also has an impact on the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, so it is urgent to adjust the transformation.

Bank of England to maintain interest rate of 0.25%
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and easy inflation have dashed hopes of an upward hike.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be “weak” as it tightens interest rates while tightening household incomes.
Policymakers at the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to maintain interest rates at 0.25 percent, while a handful of members this month called for higher interest rates, even as weak economic growth has weakened the boost.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England shrunk its growth forecast for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, and warned that the household income crunch will continue, while inflation will skyrocket to nearly 3% in the autumn.
But it said interest rates would need to be raised over the next few years to curb inflation from Brexit, while borrowing costs could need to rise more sharply in the financial markets.
Large-scale economic promotion policies were implemented a year ago by the effects of Brexit, and members voted to withdraw them.
The Bank of England will announce a halt to its regular financing scheme, which will start providing cheap funding to banks in February, although the bank said under the plan it now needs to add an additional £15 billion to a £115 billion.
In the minutes of the interest rate decision-making meeting, the Bank of England said: “In the core forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term, as tighter real household incomes will continue to suppress consumption.”
With regard to interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for “some monetary policy tightening” to suppress inflation, and it needs to be “greater” than market expectations.
The market is currently expected to achieve its first growth in the third quarter of next year and the second in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any call-up would be “slow” and “restrained.”
The bank’s growth forecast for this year and next is on a downward trend, compared with a forecast of 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
The bank maintained its forecast of 1.8% growth in 2018.
The British pound fell against the dollar, and the euro followed suit.
The British pound fell 0.5% against the dollar to 1.31, while the euro fell 0.4% to 1.11.
Prior to the change in the decision, rising expectations were dashed by recent unwarranted growth data. GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with just 0.2% in the previous three months.
The bank said growth in the third quarter was likely to remain at 0.3 percent, although it would rise slightly at the end of the year.
The average household is hit by inflationary inflation, and wage growth is negligible, and the Bank of England's recent inflation report did not bring them good news, because the bank said the tightening will get worse before it gets better.
He also said monetary policy “cannot prevent” a blow to income in the coming years, but wages are expected to recover “massively” by the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, due to the depreciation of the pound and the substantial increase in demand for British goods, the economy will be stimulated to offset the impact of some low consumption.
The decision came a year after the shocking EU referendum sent the pound plummeting, with interest rates cut to 0.25 percent in August.
The Bank of England estimates it could take four years to fully affect prices and the UK economy.
The bank’s announcement of its latest interest rate ruling comes a long time ago, as inflation has made the already stressed average household worse, and three policymakers called for a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation retreated to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, although the Bank of England said that was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that compared to its 2% target, the excess part is completely weak the bottom line of the pound.
Andrew Montereyke, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market seems to be going to be more competitive again, as lenders are strongly calling for more business and look forward to a positive end to this year.”
Such a market looks particularly advantageous to those who may be close to ending existing deals, as remortgaging (many of which are free of fees and low interest rates) is becoming more popular.

The National Health Service (NHS) has a green light for controversial HIV drugs.
After the High Court settles the dust for NHS drug funding, patients will be able to receive “transformative” HIV prevention treatment from September.
The NHS England has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sex, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk groups by about 86 per cent. Health services will now provide the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year initial trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after an appeals court upheld the High Court ruling last year. The ruling said the NHS was entitled to pay PrEP for the cost of the drug, despite the NHS's claim that local authorities should fund the drug.
The move announced on Thursday was described by British NHS chief Simon Stevens as a "major new intervention", while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "critical moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to be registered. More clinics will be added in October, followed by full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medication taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Trials have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there are enough specific medications in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This medication can be taken daily or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay, bisexual men, transgender people, and those who have not successfully received treatment.
The clinic will determine whether participants who are eligible and consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and their sexual partners who are in an HIV status with an unknown person who has received antiretroviral treatment.
Those who live in England and register as general practitioners can also sign up at the sexual health clinic they attend locally.
The scheme will cost £10m, while the NHS England branch has signed a contract to procure the drugs this week after making an international competitive procurement.
The trial aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence about how it is positioned, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr Stevens said: “This significant new intervention should complement and reinforce HIV prevention broadly and increasingly successfully.
This is another milestone in more than 30 years of action that deserves progress in addressing the major health challenges of humanity.”
Dipola King, chief executive of the UK AIDS Trust (NAT), said: “This is a critical moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target people in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offers the possibility of changing the UK AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will receive a new, approved tool through the NHS-funded trial in England that can be implemented alone, without consultation with sexual partners, which will bring improvement to the lives of many people.
We are in favor of this announcement with both hands.”
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terence Higgins Trust, said: “The first priority now is to ensure that trials are pushed away rapidly across the country and that no one living with HIV can fall behind.
Now that we have purchased the PrEP trial drug, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV.”
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “After months of delays and delays in the government, the start of the PrEP test is very popular and should come sooner.”
Evidence shows how this drug can change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stop spreading this deadly infectious disease.
This trial will allow us to further and fully understand the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important to roll out the trial as soon as possible across the country to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us further end the spread of HIV in society.”

High quality of life: the application of the loft and clever design to make the small apartment of the Count's Palace into a spacious home
Joanne Ray was a former banker who was keen to renovate the house, and in 2014 she moved from a large house on Knightsbridge to a small apartment in the Count's Palace.
This apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne-style terrace – Joanne didn’t pack her bags to sell it, which is a strong proof of the new design.
“Before that, I was living with my ex-boyfriend in a larger house on Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for the right house with an offer.
I saw this apartment in the Count's Palace, and its ceiling was high.
I made a big offer that day.”
Since first looking at the room, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has now been completely overhauled.
The apartment was originally a complex single room — requiring a walk through the kitchen to walk to the bedroom — and Joanne wanted to add storage space and loft to make the most of the ceiling height.
“I want high ceilings, big windows, plenty of light.
That’s what I ask for,” she said.
To do this, she hired Elvan Azadi from Duck & Shed's architecture and design studio (located in Notting Hill) to use the 12.5-foot ceiling to build a home. The home is not only a development, but also a place where Joanne lives.
The ceiling is not high enough to add two up-and-down spaces, so the architectural challenge is to create a loft that is high enough for people to stand.
Erfan must be creative in mind so that he can solve this problem.
“Steel structures are quite complex,” he explained.
“We have to arrange the space so that it is displayed up and down, and there is no need to shrug the back of the shoulder.
It is not only as simple as building a simple platform, but also to start these steels to put them at the appropriate height of the realization of functions.”
Through this arrangement, Erfan was able to get two full-body high rooms in the space—with many interesting elements added.
The loft features retro copper windows under the Retrouvius brand overlooking the charming living area.
The golden furniture with mirrors, small silver furniture and Serge Mouille retro lighting laid the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
A mirror is mounted at both ends of the short corridor that can make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a splash-proof plate with a mirror is like a window leading to another room.
At the porchy, small plaids with mirrors provide Joanne with storage space for tableware and glassware.
The beautiful living room has a fascinating sense of space that can be put away when the kitchen is not in use.
The kitchen is not new.
But what’s unique about this folding kitchen is a garage-style lift door.
“There’s some knowledge of engineering here,” Elvan explains the reinforced veneer MDF door.
“It’s a balancing principle, so it’s easy to slide when you push the door.”
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne got an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom, and an improved layout.
“Eventually, what you sell is the size of the home — or your valuation is based on the size of the home,” Erfan said.
“Basically, real estate agents walk into the room and calculate it based on the size of the floor.”
They will try to increase the footprint of the space, while using high-quality materials, thus bringing a sense of luxury to this space.
“The material is your own choice, and therefore helps create an emotional bond in your home,” Elvan said.
“You’re not going to love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they won't hold your heart."
It turns out that with good design and an extra area, standard apartments can be shaken to make you marvel.
In fact, you might choose to live like Joanne.

Two brothers stage a $500 million real estate empire battle
Forty years after the founding of the Italian family, the two brothers fought for one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million.
Colin De Lutis, a former Carlton Football Club director and developer, lives in a mansion in the Tukala district, while the three gates are located at the residence of his brother Paul. The latter took him to the Supreme Court for the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have been in a heated debate on the separation of assets in the Supreme Court.
The brothers and their mother owned a total of 38 real estate properties worth more than $500 million, which have been accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in the Collingwood district in 1973.
There, the family founded the Westco Jeans Company and gradually grew to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold for $85 million.
After that, the money was invested in real estate. Currently, the De Rutis family's portfolio includes city office buildings, Brunswick and Sorrento developments, Gold Coast and Bühler Hill apartments, and suburban shopping centers.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin, who was described by his brother Paul as the "primary promoter and dominant figure" of the De Rutis family, had about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounted for about one-third.
Documents submitted to the court state that, after conversion, Colin owned property worth $316 million, while Paul owned property worth $17.6 million.
Paul came to believe that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the negotiations.
“Colin’s proposal for a division of property left him what I thought was the best property,” he wrote in a first court affidavit in 2015.
On Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several failed mediations.
Now, the two brothers are still fighting for control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has kicked him out.
Colin denied this and accused Paul of poor management of certain real estate.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed a desire to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian tradition dictates that family is the most important option. My Italian descent determines that family is the most important option," he wrote.
The cost of the case continues to rise, along with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, corporate reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC and other top law firms, as well as senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Ms. de Rutis and her late husband, Luigi, were both Italian immigrants. They have been operating mass and deli since the late 1950s, and bought a shop in Braunschig in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family’s first jeans store.
Colin said, “I was in high school when I was in high school,” and he started Westco there, “when Paul was still very young (about 10 years old).”
Anna de Rutis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, want to be able to pass on property to her son in peace.
“Luigi used to say to me that he would never want his brothers to end up in court,” she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of the De Rutis Group of Companies, and Colin said Mark paid him $10 million and $26 million to Luke when he left the company.
Paul said both Luke and Mark were “dissatisfied with the division of their property.”
According to TV star Eddie McGuire, who kept a low profile despite being a member of the former AFL club’s biography in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul on Friday, along with their lawyers.
However, only Colin responded via text message. He said that because the case had been brought to court, "I really can't say much."
“It was very, very sad that my brother Paul chose to prosecute me and bring our family affairs to court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he had tried to meet his brother’s demands.
“Our father doesn’t want to see Paul and me finally have a current dispute,” he said, adding that he “remains hopeful that the dispute will be resolved.”
On Friday, that hope seemed to be dashed.
“Our problems will be resolved through the courts in the near future,” Colin wrote.

And Henan Lancao County, there are twenty-eight poverty-stricken counties in the country out of poverty.
The withdrawal of poor counties requires special inspections through preliminary review, review and evaluation.
Publicity has no objection to exit, and the exit standard is also very strict.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media time
Others have tried, but all have failed.
John F. Kelly might actually be able to do that.
If that’s the case, then he’s the first.
According to Politico, a U.S. political news website, the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump — including news media reports — to keep big bosses more stable.
Here is a quote from journalist Josh Dorsey:
“As the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, began his first day of work to gather discussions with senior officials, he pointed to a major problem for President Trump to be in the White House: bad information flowing into the president’s hands.”
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information helps the president make better decisions, so the information needs to be in his hands — in both written and briefing form.
Kelly’s diagnosis looked like a muting one, but others tried to tame it by spying on Trump’s media time, but all ended in failure.
President Trump’s TV addiction has been around for a long time — and now in the White House, his habit of watching TV is deepening.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Nenberg told Politico: “If candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, it would be helpful to let him know that he has received positive coverage on a credible channel.”
Tala Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that “based on the experience of six former campaign officials, the point in controlling Trump’s Twitter habit is to ensure that the media messages he receives have always included some praise.”
This is completely no problem.
But Trump’s Twitter habit used to be “controlled” that the view is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don’t know about — that is, if there isn’t any intervention by them, Trump’s tweets will be even more fiery.
We may never have known about the tweets that Trump didn’t send.
If his clerks were able to save him from the water and fire, even if only a few times, their efforts would be worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House of competing groups, people are pushing their careers by delivering potentially or unreliable data to Trump that may be reliable and unreliable.
Politico — all about the story — reported in May that advisers were hobbling about strategically providing suspicious information to the president.
This is an example described by journalist Shane Goodmancher:
“Current and former Trump officials say Trump’s reaction to negative news footage such as a volcanic eruption, especially as destructive information leaks, he would frantically want to find out where it came from.
At the end of February, an article on the website of the cyber instigator Charles C. Johnson, GotNews.com, was copied to the president, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the “source of a large amount of information leak” at the White House, as Trump did at the time.
Even though Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, he had provided no concrete evidence, and he had blown up a large number of false controls, which he later publicly denied.
Trump read the article and began asking officials about Walsh’s situation.”
Goodmancher also said that then-chief of staff Reins Pribas and White House secretary Rob Porter “had tried to build a system to manage and document documents that Trump received.”
What about the result?
Kelly was going to do the same, in three months.
He may prove that he is a more efficient manager than Pribas, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his aides are still competing against each other for influence.
These timeless influencing factors can make Kelly’s mission more difficult.
Travel style town: how to get drunk
The potential of Zhejiang town has been gradually awakened.
Today, these small towns have become an important destination for tourists to Zhejiang to enjoy Zhejiang mountains and rivers, read Zhejiang culture, and feel the sorrow of Zhejiang nostalgia, and will also provide important assistance for our province to strive to build the most beautiful tourist destination in China.

These small towns are Zhejiang tourism "hands treasure", but also the eight tourists "heart"Love.”
In recent years, with the advancement of global tourism construction in our province, the potential of Zhejiang town has been gradually awakened.
In 2016, the general office of the provincial government officially released the "Zhejiang Province Tourism Town Creation Work Implementation Measures", proposed to pass about 5 years, in the province's acceptance naming about 100 folk folk style thick, beautiful ecological environment, tourism rich provincial tourism style town.
Today, these small towns have become an important destination for tourists to Zhejiang to enjoy Zhejiang mountains and rivers, read Zhejiang culture, and feel the sorrow of Zhejiang nostalgia, and will also provide important assistance for our province to strive to build the most beautiful tourist destination in China.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Provincial Tourism Bureau, under the boom in the creation of tourist towns, towns and villages in my province now pay more attention to the creation of personalized tourism industry, and new tourism projects and formats have emerged in an endless stream, bringing rich experience to tourists and winning a good reputation.
Focus on promotion
Recently, sponsored by the Zhejiang Provincial Tourism Bureau and Zhejiang Daily Newspaper Group, the "Small Town × Future Artist" shared and "Poetry Painting Zhejiang? Town Style" 2017 Zhejiang Tourism Style Town Promotion Season Closing Ceremony was held at the Zhejiang Provincial Exhibition Hall hosted by the Zhejiang News Group Tourism All-Media Center.
"The style of the town has the beauty of art and the temperature of life.
The style of the town lies in the original, the original taste, the original hometown, a kind of original ecology of purity.
Xie Hanfeng, a teacher in the Department of Film and Television Animation Arts of the Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, a domestic first-line film and television advertising director, and Professor Xu Xiangwei, Dean of the School of Art and Communication of China University of Metrology, told cross-border stories of small towns such as "Small Town in the Lens" and "Small Village Renovation".
Many of Zhejiang's touring towns have deep cultural resources, and Dong Xinxin, a representative from Nanxun, Huzhou City, interpreted the national painting Nanxun at the scene.
Jiangnan Shuixiang style has been loved by book painters since ancient times, and now Nanxun Ancient Town has carried out in-depth cooperation with art colleges such as the Chinese Academy of Art.
The necessary elements of the town, the tourism element, the service element and the environmental element.
Among them, the service facilities and environment of tourism are also very important.
If you hand a timely umbrella on a rainy day, you can also let tourists better experience the style of the town.
In this era of sharing, the Zhejiang News Group Tourism All-Media Center joined hands with the hottest shared umbrella company to customize a number of "poetry Zhejiang" version of the sharing umbrella, hoping to advocate the concept of "sharing? green", enhance the civilized tourism awareness and public pride of tourists and small town residents, and create a beautiful tourism environment.

Looking forward to wonderful.
Up to now, Zhejiang Province has released the first batch of 21 provincial tourism town creation list and 115 provincial tourism town cultivation and creation list.
As the key area of priority development during the "Thirteenth Five-Year Plan" period of rural tourism, the style town will eventually build a tourist attraction above level 3A, which will become a new model for tourism products, outstanding tourism benefits, and win-win industrial integration.
The reason why the tourist style town is attractive is its original taste.
The beauty of the tourist town is not only derived from the smoke and rain, but also from the long cultural tradition; the revitalization of the countryside stems from cultural self-confidence.
Throughout the world, the small town of Liser in the Netherlands, the small town of Hallstatt in Austria, and the small town of Pumpkin in France, attracted by tulips, "salt" and pumpkin, attracting a large number of tourists from all over the world every year, and realizing tourism to promote the economic take-off of the town.
For the style of the town, the focus of "highlighting the characteristics and retaining nostalgia" has made the town have a clear personality and soul, and it is more about providing cultural infiltration, carrying local culture, and highlighting the local civilization.
The tourist town, with culture and nostalgia as the link, with the humanities and scenery as the carrier, connects the four tourists, so that the traditional style and culture are inherited and innovated in the co-construction and sharing.
In essence, the tourist town is a complex open tourist attraction, which should be a shared living space for local residents and foreign tourists and even sojourners.
As the main battlefield for the growth of tourism in the future, the tourist town may not only change the ecological appearance of the countryside, the mode of economic and social development, and the direction of the flow of industrial factors, but also the important force to eliminate the gap between urban and rural infrastructure and awaken the recovery of rural culture.
In the tide of accelerated rural revitalization, Zhejiang tourism town will interpret richer and more wonderful stories.

Motorhomes negotiate the ditch and return to the "Rich Street"
Some of the richest owners in the West Midlands are in a dispute again with determined motorhomes who negotiate a government-digged ditch to demand the return of land outside the mansion.
Motorhomes parked their 20 trailers in an open space beyond the bustling Solihull Street, dubbed “Rich Street.”
The motorhomes, who were holding the horses, holding the baby and leading the motorhome fleet, returned after being driven away in May, and the “moat” dug by the municipal department did not stop them from entering.
The sleek team found a gap in the defensive line, and although there was a section of the road that was not fit to pass by, their vehicles squeezed through the gap.
Angry residents have sharply criticized the Solihull Council, saying it was “bad at dealing with this issue.”
One resident, who did not want to be named, said: "They came there on Monday night and came to Bingricheth Street to throw stones at passers-by.
The Commission should be ashamed of what they did, because they are simply useless in dealing with problems.
Motorhomes came here in May, then driven away, and now they’re back.
I came here a lot last night, and probably more today."
She added: “The Birmingham City Council knows how to handle it by imposing a long-term ban on protecting its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and if Parliament can’t stop such a thing, I’m not willing to continue paying the municipal tax.
A local resident, who asked not to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last group of motorhomes go away, just to destroy another group."
This time the number has increased again, and some people have even seen horses on the park lawn.”
A Solihull committee spokeswoman said: “We are aware of unauthorized camping in a clearing on Sjutzbrook Road and now we work with the Solihull police and take the necessary legal action to get them out as soon as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is important to ask as many local residents as possible to report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.

Italy takes tough stance on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has issued a warning to non-governmental organizations operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue to implement rescues if they do not sign new rules for managing operations.
In an interview with the Turin daily News, the Minister of the Interior, Marco Minetti, said: “If NGOs do not sign new norms of conduct, it is difficult to see how they will continue”.
The warning came a day after Italian officials detained a German aid group, the crew of a boat, who was suspected of collaborating with human traffickers to help illegal immigrants.
The aid group, which operated for just one year, declined to comment on the specific theme of the charges against Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
In a social media statement, the organization said, “For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing for us now, so we regret that we are not currently operating in the search and rescue zone.”
“After collecting all the information, we can only assess all allegations and situations at this time.”
Italian officials have been monitoring the Youth Rescue ship Iuventa since October.
Its crews are suspected of carrying human traffickers directly from small boats to transport migrants, and allowing smugglers to flee hastily and re-use the ship.
According to prosecutors' documents, at least one such meeting allegedly took place at sea 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast. The document was published by Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of blatant disregard for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversaw rescue operations in the area out of humanitarian enthusiasm and not for any other motive.
According to the code of conduct, ships such as Iuventa clearly need an Italian police officer to supervise their activities on board.
Currently, only three of the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue operation have agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: Save the Children, the Malta-based Migrants’ Maritime Assistance Station and the Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it did not consider the new rules, if necessary, to be acceptable because they did not bring any "significant changes and obstacles" to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign were the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks showed that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal guards and unite local mayors had come to fruition.
The minister said: "In recent days, we have begun to see the dawn at the end of the tunnel."
He unveiled plans for in-depth talks this month: discussions with Libyan mayors about economic development activities and discussions with Chad, Niger and Mali on ways to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave those countries for Europe.
Lian Ping, chief financial scientist at Bank of Communications, said that due to the end-of-season growth in industrial added value in the first three quarters of 2017, it is expected that the growth of industrial added value may accelerate to 6.6% in December.
It is expected that the cumulative growth rate of fixed asset investment in December will be 7.2%, which is the same as the previous month and lower than last year.
Although industrial production will be weaker than in October, it is basically the same as in November.
In December, China's manufacturing investment was running at a low level, but infrastructure investment improved slightly, so fixed asset investment is expected to be flat in November.

Beijing "university dredging" new measures: North Chemical tens of thousands of teachers and students will enter the new campus of Changping
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Beijing University of Chemical Technology was held in Changping District of Beijing on the 2nd, and the green campus covering an area of 1,800 acres was officially put into use.
The reporter learned from the ceremony that in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and manage the "big city disease", in recent years, under the background of the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the dredging of non-capital functions, Beijing has accelerated the promotion of the central urban area of colleges and universities to the suburbs, and some universities are gradually moving to the new campuses in the suburbs of Shunyi, Daxing, and Fangshan.
The new campus of Beiji Chemical is located in Changping Nankou Town, covering an area of 1,800 acres, 40 kilometers from the urban area, and is one of the key projects for Beijing to relieve non-capital functions.
The new campus is divided into three phases of construction, the current phase of construction has been completed, the second phase of construction is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year, all completed plans will meet the needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduates, graduate students and faculty members to study and live.
Looking back at this year's film market, we found that the original text of the film and the two groups of fans who participated in the performance of the film became an important part of the expected audience of the film.
Today at 17:10, Shaoyang City 119 Command Center received an alarm, located in the city's Shuangqing District, Longshutang Hongzhi chemical plant stored tetrahydrofure fire.
Shaoyang City Fire Detachment immediately dispatched 5 squadrons of 20 fire trucks carrying heavy anti-chemical clothing, anti-chemical washing trucks and other equipment to the scene.
After preliminary investigation, the fire was a small storage tank for storing tetrahydrofurans and other chemicals, and the smoke at the scene was large.
As of the reporter's press release, fire officers and soldiers are nervously rescued, and the city's health, safety supervision, environmental protection, public security, transportation and other departments have rushed to the scene one after another, and no casualties have been found.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texting Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for instigating her boyfriend’s suicide by texting and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve a 15-month sentence, which can be turned into a suspended sentence after the expiration of the sentence.
Carter was convicted of unintentional and unpremeditated murder in June by Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at Thursday’s hearing: “My family is heartbroken.
My son is my best friend."
While awaiting appeal, Carter was granted personal freedom.
She faces up to 20 years in prison, but her group believes she and Mr. Roy are mentally ill.
At the time of the sentencing, Carter stood, wearing red trousers and beige hoodies, his hands clasped, his eyes tearful, his eyes down.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended his life for living better for herself.
She was not responsible,” the prosecutor said.
"She has no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence, and she feels very sorry."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her “age or maturity, or even her mental illness, would have any significant impact on her behavior.”
One prosecutor read a statement from Lynn Roy, a mother of Roy, saying, “I haven’t had a day without pain in losing my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of what I've done for me and me. I'm trying to stand with my sisters in all my pain that will stay with us forever," the statement said.
Mr Roy’s sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was “spiritually tramped” for realizing she would never be able to attend her brother’s wedding or become his child’s aunt.
“It’s a pain to lose someone who has been with me since I was born, and the rest of my life will be with that pain,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent because the Massachusetts law does not require the prosecution of others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his car; Carter was 17 years old.
Carter’s text message revealed that the case drew national attention after she encouraged him to kill himself.
“There are many ways to hang yourself, jump, and stab yourself,” she said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was on vacation with his family.
The time before he committed suicide, she wrote: “You need to do this, Conrad, “All you have to do is start the generator and then you get freedom and happiness.”
Judge Moniz said Carter drew attention through Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are differences of legal opinion in this case.
Amanda Knox, one of the few who defended Carter, was acquitted two years after she was charged with murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Ms Knox, 30, said in an op-ed published in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment.”
Zhang Yimou is destined to be a controversial film artist, from the beginning of his first film "Red Sorghum", he has been leading the Chinese film trend at the same time, but also gained a lot of criticism.
The reporter learned from the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club on the 2nd that recently, the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth Team won the fourth place in the National Youth Basketball League Finals held in Beijing.
The Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth Team consists of 11 local players, and the head coach is Tsering Samdrup, assistant coach of the Lhasa Pure Land Men's Basketball Adult Team.
The Tibetan "basketball boy" before traveling to Beijing for the finals.
Liang Junchao, general manager of Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club, told reporters that compared with last year, the team's achievements have improved, and the self-confidence of the players and the certainty of the game have been significantly improved. The communication between the players and other teams is also more comprehensive, and the exchanges on the court and the court are more and easier.
After the game, captain Jiang Tsuo said that he hoped to accumulate experience through the competition and do his best for Tibet's basketball career.
It is understood that in the Beijing game, the players overcame factors such as low-altitude oxygen and showed the image of Tibet.
Although track and field are the big gold medals in the Olympic Games, and the track and field players get the world, the track and field name will compete for gold but are in the downstairs.
Automakers face shock, Audi to retrofit up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before Audi announced the remodeling, BMW said it would offer software upgrades for more than 350,000 cars.
BMW’s chairman said BMW believed “driving has more smart options than restrictions,” meaning major European cities — including Munich, where BMW’s headquarters are located — consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would retrofit 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed the move as a recall.
European carmakers have vigorously promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by the diesel engine are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset diesel exhaust emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to keep diesel cars competitive in price.
As German automakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has also been accused of overly laissing these powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid a repeat of Volkswagen’s mistake of covering up its use of so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions to comply with regulations while testing cars, and returning to normal under normal driving conditions.
Several VW executives have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated by countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi’s engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zachero Giovanni Pamio is Italian and therefore not protected by extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was embroiled in a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, with the German government accusing Audi of installing a system to evade European emissions claims, expanding the scope of the previous investigation, which was limited to the United States.
The investigation by Audi could have a significant impact on Volkswagen: luxury carmakers account for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
A film from preparation to release, lasted for a year or two or even years, can be described as common.
The animated film "Big Fish Sea" has been announced to be released on July 8, and the film has lasted 12 years from preparation to release!
"Big Fish Seatang" original author Liang Ruo, 21 years old from Tsinghua University heat power professional bus, and friend Zhang Chun together to create the other side of the day, in 2008 to obtain a joint venture from the source of millions of dollars of venture capital, launched the animation film debut "big fish sea".
The film has won many awards at home and abroad in the creative sample stage, and has been included in the French Centre for Contemporary Art in Pompidou and praised as "one of the most outstanding works of art".
Because of the six years from creativity to production, the film was called "God's Pit" by millions of fans who were looking forward to the release.
"Big Fish Sea" tells a fantasy story that belongs to the Chinese people. With the announcement of this scheduled trailer, it brings new expectations to all audiences.
Liang said: "These 12 years have only done this one thing, and now it has changed from a dream to a reality, and I am both nervous and excited."
Zhang Chun said: "I always want to use one-fifth of other people's budget, to make the same picture effect as others, the team will be forced to go crazy by me."
Dongguan, once the "world factory" that once relied on incoming processing and a large number of universal workers, is setting its sights on high-level talents who can lead the city to reposition.
Recently, the high-level talent activities held by the Dongguan municipal government last week, the first financial reporter saw that some local powerful enterprises have participated in the talent fair.
On the particularly bright billboards under the orange background wall, they each marked a high price.
Therefore, the China Television Production Industry Association decided to sign a self-regulatory convention in conjunction with the national TV production industry.
Lavender in Provence is threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is bad news that it is being threatened by climate change.
Lavender is in decline as a result of ongoing drought and the emergence of virus-carrying insects, leaving scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute in Provence (CRIEPPAM), said: “Lavender in Provence is facing a huge threat as the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with rainfall drastically reduced in spring and rainy in the autumn.
This can affect the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a smaller individual cicada, a leaf cicada that can spread tiny bacteria, and in very dry weather, they appear in large numbers."
The key is its huge number.
In addition to attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is also sought after by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric Chase said: "Contrary to the plants that can bloom a lot of flowers and have long spikes, we have a small, less-developed, or weak-inadequate plant.
So we have less essential oils."
Solutions being studied include adopting better irrigation techniques and slowing the evaporation of soil moisture, spraying protective mixtures of clay and water on plants, and developing more drought-tolerant varieties.
Compared with the sci-fi elements of the film, the two stars have said that they are more attractive to the story in the film.
On the afternoon of September 5, a reporter from the Huaxi Metropolis Daily interviewed a number of famous people in the field of sound, as well as two performance artists, and surprisingly, they were almost consistently silent.
One is the Berlin Emperor, one is an ascent young actor, and "Psychological Sin" is also the first partner of Liao Fan and Li Yifeng.
Mexico is in danger, journalists killed
All of Riodoce’s weekly employees usually rall on Wednesday to review their plans to report on the Sinalo state riots caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and endless wars on drugs.
But today, the shadow of tragedy hangs over them, who come together to discuss security.
They’re told to change their daily habits, and that’s important.
Two senior journalists discussed which was safer: whether to take their children to the office (which had been hit with a grenade in 2009) or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals, and allies.
They let these reporters name each column below—no evidence needed, observation and intuition enough.
There are suspected drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on government lists, or cartels, which have made Mexico’s reporting dangerous efforts.
Violence has never stopped, with more and more journalists across the country, including a growing number of journalists: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists have been under federal protection after being attacked and threatened; and so far this year, at least seven journalists have died in seven states.
The last to die was their editor and source of inspiration, and he was also the co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdez Cárdenas.
Valdez has written a lot about drug violence, and in one of them he wrote: “The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and becoming a journalist.”
It was a deep sense that he was gone, even though he was everywhere—a huge photo hanging on the front of the Riodec office building, with the word “justice” draped by the middle finger; and Aaron Iwara and Miriam Ramirez, two journalists in their 30s, wore T-shirts that showed his smile, and he wore glasses or his signature Panamanian straw hat.
The seminar took place less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and suspicious disorder.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, the Office prosecuted only two people, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Most of the thousands of crimes committed each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so it is rare to bring to justice the perpetrators of the killing of journalists.
In Riodoce, they insist on reporting on the violence in Sinaro, though they are heartbroken, even though the land is broken.
Ivara said that without information on the killers and no justice, it would not be very useful to hold a security seminar.
He said, “It’s stupid to waste time attending a seminar like this.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the capital, Culiacan.
His red Toyota Corolla drove only a few blocks away and was stopped by two men; they forced him to get out of the car and fired 12 shots, guessing because of the name of the newspaper, translated as The Twelve Rivers.
The gangster drove his car away and knocked it down nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two grown-up children.
Culiacan is talking.
But about Valdez’s topic, there was actually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinaro has become the country’s bloodiest battleground, with hostile forces frantically fighting.
One or several people are shot every day on the streets of Sinaro, and the cemetery is filled with two-story mausoleums filled with poison lords, which have become commonplace.
The momentary forgetting of the “calm” state is when only a cartel controls the coastal state and its ports to the United States and the drug trafficking route.
Even so, even though Valdez knew the dangers of the job, 60-year-old Riodoce co-founder and director Ismail Pohokui was still guilty for not protecting his friend.
He believed that two mistakes had caused the tragedy.
First, an interview with Damaso Lopez was published in February, where he led a cartel fighting several of Guzman’s sons.
The report may have angered the sons; the newspaper was bought out by suspected gang members as soon as it was sent to a newsstand.
The second mistake was that another newspaper covering the same story was confiscated without forcing Valdez to leave Mexico for his own safety.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great significance to Mexican violence against journalists.
His spirit endures, and his friends and colleagues believe that he has always been with us.
In 2003, he was a senior reporter for Noroeste, and he co-founded Riodoce with five colleagues and sold a $50 stake.
In Sinaro, Pohokui said, “it is impossible to set foot in journalism without dealing with the drug problem.”
Over time, the newspaper gained a good reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish investigation reports that directly attack the key without worrying about censorship, and readers also like newspapers to publish stories that others dare not report.
Five years after its founding, Riodoce received the Marian Moscapo Prize for Journalism in Latin America.
In the same year, the Society for the Protection of Journalists awarded Valdez the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug reporting.
He admitted that he was also scared.
At the time of the award, the Society for the Protection of Journalists, he said, “I want to live.”
Later in late October, he said in an interview on local television station Rompeviento TV that “in Sinaro, drug trafficking is a way of life.
You have to be a journalist with the task that falls on your shoulders—either or deafly dumb.
I don’t want to be asked, ‘What have you done in the face of so many deaths... why don’t you speak out about what’s going on?’”
All the employees of "Riodoce" miss Valdez, miss him as a dock worker, miss this friend who has never been reluctant to embrace and advise, miss this teacher who knows how to live.
They depend on their habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar, which is often opposite the office, is always sitting at the same table.
Now, they’ll ask: Was it his daily habit that caused his fall?
His death also forced them to think about how to do a good job and live well.
“They don’t like the women and kids you give them to get in trouble, and they don’t like the secret airport where you affect their legitimate companies and the drugs used to transport them,” Pohokuui said.
All of this has crossed their bottom line.”
The result is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation, even at the safest time.
Trust your intuition.
If you smell danger, get away.
Riodoce editor Andrés Villarier said the problem was that “breath is a feeling of being cheated ... and then something like Havel happens.”
He and others say that previous rules no longer apply to Sinaro — just as they no longer apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states, where smuggling routes are lucrative, while agencies are weak, government officials are corrupt, and they are smoky.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees participated in the security training, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed; a few days ago, spyware allegedly sold only to the government was already used in Mexico to spy on journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers cooled in the shade, sheltering 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius) from the heat.
They were state-sent to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood in Culiacan.
Some reporters half-jokingly ridiculed that they did not know whether these police officers would belong to the 50 percent of the letter that the governor himself said.
Journalists have been going to the mountains for months, where drug cartels are under real control.
This week’s Riodoce majored three major events.
Among them was the killing of the brother of the great former boxer of Sinaro, Julio Cesar Chávez,
There is also a disclosure of government funding for the governor's hometown,
As well as the kidnapping inside an expensive restaurant in Culyacan, which is just a block from the prosecutor’s office.
The authorities did not release information about the victims and the kidnapping process, so it was necessary to be careful when writing about what the city knew: the restaurant was a place that both drug dealers and officials loved.
A journalist learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), which dominated all political strata almost all of the previous age.
Recently, several governors of the Revolutionary Institutional Party have been accused of corruption in several highly regarded cases.
Villarier asked reporters to write about what happened at the site of the incident, including the escape of a son of Guzman, Mexico's number one drug lord, to escape a military attack.
If a few months ago, readers would check out Valdez’s column to find the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
The 46-year-old Villarier, who is known as “skinny” because of his thin figure, said: “Before, we already knew what was going on.
Now all our sources of information are being cut off.
Valdez’s office is now being used to store signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists because employees have become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, the reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a sign and walked out of the room, going to the local prosecutor’s office to participate in a march related to another reporter.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoen three days after the killing of Valdez.
An charred body was found and said it was based on DNA testing, which was his body.
Across the country, journalists have become more outspoken, organizing protests, painting the words “Save the Media” on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, director Pohokui is not in Washington, and he is trying to get justice for the Valdez case and win international support.
The day after Valdez was killed, during a meeting with the governor of Sinaro, Ramirez complained about the official spying on the reporter's message and killing them because they had told the truth.
Given that her anger has affected her objectivity, she has also asked to step down from reporting on government affairs.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that journalists in Mexico are “encircled” by organized crime, government officials and indifferent societies.
In his last book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that journalists were not only maimed by drug cartels, but also on a list of politicians and security forces who were tainted with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 blamed police and public officials for more than half of last year’s journalistic attacks.
Ramirez said, “In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up.”
Obviously, these murders are chilling.
No one forgets that six years ago, the blogger Maria Elisabeth Marcias died on the border north of Tamaulipas.
Next to her body was a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “I have come for my reporting.”
Her head was cut off, and next to her was a computer keyboard and headphones.
After Miroslava Brech was killed in March, some newspapers chose to close, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others continue, and the directors of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo were killed in 2014, but they continue.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke publicly with a front-page news about the drug cartel, titled “What Do You Want from Us?”
Some journalists have fled their homes or even left the country.
This is a difficult choice.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still need to be careful and alert to danger on the streets.
Sometimes they would be arrested, and in 2015 photographer Ruben Espinoza was said to have been killed in a Mexican city along with four women three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind the scenes and continue to work, this is a daily dance step for high-risk decisions.
Ivarra, who wanted to become a poet, admitted that reporting on the drug trade terrified him.
“Mexico is going to hell, so I’m a journalist,” he said.
In the middle of the night of the recent Friday, the latest issue of the newspaper had been printed, and the editors of Riodoce sat on the aisle outside their offices drinking beer, and suddenly their phones rang.
A series of gunfights between gangs and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan have confirmed 19 deaths.
The fighting is still escalating, as foreshadowed by a series of cartel information found in the region.
They uploaded the news to Riodoce’s website on the roadside via their mobile phone.
The next day’s headline had to be changed.
The sirens sounded nearby—there was another dyell in the area.
Pohokuui glanced at the policeman who stood there guarding, watching if they were alert.
If they are a little scared, then they don’t show it.
The founder of the newspaper had been killed, and on his large portrait, his middle finger pointed to the whole of Sinaro, where the whole state of Sinaro needed to look, and the entire staff of Riodoce followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even want to shut down?" said Bohokui, who was killed the same day the intern asked me to send her to the street to cover the report.
China's self-driving car tourism market size in 2020 or break through trillions of yuan
[Abstract] In the context of consumption upgrading and free travel, self-driving travel is encouraged by national policies and more and more consumers are loved.
But at the same time, the self-driving tour market, which is expected to break through the trillion scale, is also facing a double challenge.
In the context of consumption upgrading and free travel, self-driving travel is encouraged by national policies and more and more consumers are loved.
But at the same time, is expected to break through the trillion scale of the self-driving travel market is also facing a double challenge, on the one hand, the development of self-driving travel industry and market demand is not proportional, self-driving travel clubs and travel agencies and other self-driving tour organizers are facing a meager profit dilemma; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services facing self-driving travel are still in the initial stage.
60% of the total number of domestic tourists, the market size is expected to break the trillion
In 2016, 4.44 billion domestic tourism trips, self-driving travel accounted for about 60% of the total number of domestic tourism, and the scale of self-driving travel is expected to exceed trillions by 2020.
According to the statistics of the China Tourism Vehicle and Boat Association on the number of self-driving trips, the number of people from driving has continued to grow in the past five years, and the proportion of tourists accounting for the domestic tourist number is stable at more than half.
At the same time, the region and the national level have shown more attention and support for self-driving travel, and from 2016 to 2017, policies and regulations related to self-driving cars, sojourners and camping tourism were intensively introduced.
In July 2017, the National Tourism Administration, the State Sports Administration and other eight departments jointly issued the "Automobile Sports Camp Development Plan"; in the same month, the Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance and other 14 departments jointly issued the "Promotion of Rural Tourism Development Quality Improvement and Upgrading Action Plan (2017)", self-driving travel was highlighted.
The introduction of policies has provided opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self-driving tourism.
Self-driving tour club profit is meager, the complete industrial chain is the key
Although the domestic self-driving tourism market has great potential and national policies are actively guided, the self-driving tourism industry is still in its infancy.
According to the "2016-2017 China Self-Driving Tour Annual Development Report", there are thousands of domestic self-driving clubs, car clubs, and car owners, but the proportion of tourists self-driving trips accounts for the majority, and only about 15% of tourists participate in various institutions such as ride-hailing clubs and self-driving clubs.
At the same time, independent research and development of self-driving travel products of online travel enterprises and traditional travel agencies are also a handful, many online travel platforms sell only some of the suppliers to provide self-driving travel products, some self-driving travel clubs are also important suppliers.
From the organization of self-driving activities, covering "eat, live, travel, travel, purchase, entertainment" a number of aspects, high degree of fragmentation, upstream supply chain heavy, tourists spend randomness.
Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of Beijing Xingtian Automobile Club, believes that self-driving travel clubs are essentially similar to travel agencies, and the early main profit models are mainly based on offline activities, and the core point is self-driving tour line products and leader services.
However, now that the homogenization of line products in the field of self-driving travel is serious, the level of leadership service is uneven, and the self-driving tour club is facing the need for another transformation.
It can be seen that self-driving travel itself is not an independent industry, but with the displacement characteristics of self-driving travel to form a cross-regional, industry ecological circle, the formation of a complete industrial chain is very important.
Experts pointed out that in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important consumption element.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving tourism industry, the experience characteristics should be enhanced, and the theme of "self-driving tour +" should be developed and the IP of self-driving travel products.
The scenic road is not only a road, the car camp should not only meet the accommodation.
In the face of the rise of self-driving travel, the basic supporting development of self-driving travel is also relatively junior.
Li Guanjie pointed out that the tourist scenic road is not just a road, but the need to integrate the elements of transportation and tourism, but the road and tourism itself are responsible for the two departments, the transportation department to increase the tourism elements, but also stay in the construction of toilets, consulting centers, publicity columns and other facilities, and the combination of tourism is not high.
Compared with the well-known self-driving route "American Route 66", the construction experience is worth learning from.
The landscape design is no longer the most direct and fast path between the departure point to the destination, but follows the design concept of "experiment driving pleasure" to provide self-driving tourists with the best enjoyment of the beautiful scenery along the road; the scenic road can connect the point-shaped and face-like tourism landscape, which not only retains the historical value and cultural value of the eco-tourism resources along the route, but also can hold various thematic activities to enhance the participation and leisure experience of tourists and create economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to the scenic road, the camp is also an important supporting facility for self-driving tours.
However, among the self-driving tourists who are known to the Beijing News reporter, there are not many consumers who choose to stay in the camp.
They believe that many camps are biased towards infrastructure, can only meet the needs of eating and living, the grade is not high, and the product is single, which cannot meet the needs of self-driving travel, which contains many elements.
Some people in the industry who did not want to be named said that many of the companies that did the camp in the past few years were to take land, and after taking the land, the supporting infrastructure construction and services in the later period did not keep up, and many of the operating conditions were losses, and without the late capital injection, it was difficult to do some corresponding supporting products.
Consumer groups
According to the data released by the China Tourism Vehicle and Boat Association in 2017, from the perspective of age, the self-driving tour group is concentrated in 21-40 years old, especially between 31 and 40 years old, which has a certain economic foundation, and the demand for personalized tourism is high, and most of them are parent-child travel customers.
From the accommodation survey, self-driving tourists have a relative preference for non-standard accommodation.
From the perspective of self-driving travel, the surrounding self-driving is the most important type of self-driving travel, accounting for 84.32%.
Driving abroad is the yearning of many people, but the proportion is still small.
At the same time, with the increase of consumer demand, tourists who used to like to drive to "visit attractions" began to change their concepts, no longer "take pictures and sleep in the car" during the self-driving tour, but pay more attention to the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs use camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks terrible, but it looks like a statue.
The researchers released the first work on the incredible fossils found by Canadian miners the size of rhinos, pointing out that the fossil is well preserved, so experts call it the "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaur World".
The fossil is well preserved, and it can even be concluded that its squamous skin is reddish-brown. This suggests that it has had some "annoying experiences."
A report in the journal Current Biology describes it as "the best-preserved dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodule dragon that lived between 110 million and 11.2 million years ago in the mid-Cretaceous period.
It was remarkably well preserved, shocking researchers who described it as “really breathtaking.”
According to National Geographic, the herbivorous dinosaur fossil is the best-preserved dinosaur fossil ever found.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the fossil while mining at the Senkel Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
At that time, he came across something that seemed not to be the same as the rocks around him, so he decided to look at it carefully.
After that, the fossils he found were sent to the Royal Canadian Museum of Terrell Paleontology.
It took six years for the researchers to bring the beast inside the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) cart to its true face.
After such a hard work, the final results are now announced.
"If you look at it, you're almost sure it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrell Museum and the first author. The creature is on display at the exhibition.
“It will be one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science – the Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world.”
By studying its skin, the researchers found that the herbivorous creature, although dressed in armor, like a walking tank, was likely to be a major threat from a carnivorous dinosaur.
The dinosaur, which is heavily dressed in heavy armor, used red-and-white camouflage to avoid predators and used concealment known as "anti-shadowing", which was also used by many modern animals.
In this way, experts say, it is better able to blend in with its surroundings and thus avoid enemies, suggesting that it is preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, who is part of the denctional dragon family, made headlines for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrell Museum of Ancient Biology.
After one of the team members, Mark Mitchell, a museum technician, spent 7,000 hours carefully unveiling the beast, the researchers now studied it and named it “Borealopelta Markmitchelli.”
The samples were well preserved, allowing Dr. Mitchell, as well as an international team of scientists, to record the patterns and shapes of the scales and armor on their bodies.
They found “anti-shade”, a common defense in the animal kingdom, meaning the creature’s back was darker than its side color.
Although “anti-shadowing” is common, the findings are surprising because the dinosaur is far bigger than the existing animals that use anti-shadowing.
This dinosaur faced pressure to be hunted by meat-eating dinosaurs, and thus evolved in a favorable direction, allowing it to hide in the front as a means of survival.
However, most of the animals in existence that use anti-shadowing, such as deer, zebras or armadillos, are as small and vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the creature faces real pressure to survive.
“The wild predation of large heavy armor dinosaurs shows how dangerous it is for Cretaceous carnivorous dinosaurs,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic complex in its scales also indicates that the dinosaur’s skin color was reddish-browd.
Scientists are continuing to study the creature’s life cues, including the stomach content it retains, to find the last food to eat.
They believe that dinosaurs fell into the river at the time of their death, then washed into the sea, and finally sank to the bottom of the sea in a back-to-back descent.
At the time, Alberta’s climate was as warm as it was in southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans were likely to be deeper inland than they are now.
Brown said: "This nut noduly dragon is truly amazing, because it is completely covered with preserved squamous skin, and, to this day, it is preserved in the dimensional space, thus allowing its original shape to be preserved."
“So the creature is now in almost the same shape as it was in the Cretaceous.
You don't need to rebuild it with too much imagination; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping."
The Cretaceous period was the period when two-legged large theropods roamed the earth.
Although Tyrannosaurus rex was the king of dinosaurs, it appeared millions of years after the draped dinosaurs. The dragon dinosaurs may have been hunted by some of the tyrannosaurs.
They include high-thornosaurus, a 6-ton, 38-foot-long (11.5-meter) behemoth.
New research has found that scientists who appear in the journal Current Biology believe that the knot dragon was washed into the sea after death and later formed a mummy in the soil.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink excavated the creature at a Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved drape dinosaur in the world, and the skin and armor in the area from the nose to the hip are complete.
The average length of this creature is about 18 feet (5 meters) and weighs 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch-long sharp angles that protrude from the shoulder.
The researchers believe that this herbivore dinosaur was active in what is now western Canada, and was then washed into the sea by a flood-prone river.
However, the dinosaur's burial at the bottom of the sea allowed it to preserve its armor intact.
The fossil remains of this particular sample are well preserved, leaving the remaining skin still covered with uneven slices of the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic, this level of preservation is as rare as it is.
The more I look, the more I feel it is unbelievable.
Remnant skin fossils are still covered in the mottled armor of the dinosaur skull.
Its right front palm is on its side, and the five toes are unfolded upwards.
I can count it."
The reporter learned that adding natural or plant-based seal algeic acid, humic acid and amino acid to the urea production process can change the traditional urea production process, and the utilization rate of seaweed urea, zinc humic acid urea, and urea in grain is increased by 5 to 10 percentage points compared with ordinary urea.
Environmentally friendly, crop yield potential is obvious, especially large particles of value-added urea is a high-quality raw material for BB fertilizer.
The total number of security personnel is double that of the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest security linkage plan in history.
Earlier, the Brazilian government said a total of 85,000 people from the army and police would work together, including 20,000 military personnel and 65,000 police officers.
Most of the military will be responsible for the defense of the Olympic venues, while the new 3,000 will be responsible for the security of international airports, subway stations and streets.
Police patrol the rest of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is reported that 6,000 military personnel have arrived in Rio for the Olympic security service.
In addition to the four major areas responsible for the Rio Olympics, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport and the main roads connecting the airport and Olympic venues.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service industry is no longer new, and in order to make the evaluation mechanism effective, it is important to make supervision more effective and not in form.
How can radicalists learn to answer this question: “Whose streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was troubled.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louiser sat in his rented bed with Audemarius and browsed Facebook on his mobile phone.
She stumbled upon a high school student post.
“The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and the child is still lying in the street.”
She found that no one else had posted the message on the feed, and she was confused. She turned off Facebook and opened Twitter.
A @TheePharoah user keeps pushing her the dynamic time.
The St. Louis-area rapper tweeted about Michael Brown's death. Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's body lying on the street with his body missing from life, and his body lay in the street for four hours.
"Crazy," thought Ferrer.
But for her and her community, death is nothing new.
She put down her phone and didn’t open Twitter again that night, reading about the gathering of people on Canfield Avenue.
There were police footage and people shouting photos, and a photo of a man who claimed to be Brown’s father, which read: “Ferguson police have just killed my unarmed son!”
She saw a message at the scene where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman raised his rifle and screamed: “I will kill all of you ... animals.”
“It’s not normal,” Ferrer recalled.
“This is not something we take for granted, and can be called a typical murder.”
At that moment, I felt a bit of a shudder.
I was angry and crying.
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father’s house and decided to travel to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrer and Ferguson over the next three years was the subject of a new documentary, “Whose Streets?”, which was released in theaters on August 11.
It’s a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the perspective of people who live in this community and crowd the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrer and his daughter (wearing a floral dress and with a crowned accessory) driving to Ferguson, the two re-discussed the topic they had discussed countless times before that morning — “about the black experience and the black situation.”
“Do you remember when I taught you that black people had to fight for their faith?” she recalled.
“We’re going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is not right.
“I had to take her with me,” Ferrer said later.
“What happened today is the climax of everything in the past.
She wants to know, see, and rise from this.
Not only does she need to develop well in terms of activism and organization, but also to understand the different aspects of the black experience and the situation of black people, what we must do to achieve freedom and liberation.
Even though I had the privilege of providing her with the racist experiences she hadn’t experienced firsthand, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I feel like I'm hurting her."
Their first stop in Ferguson was located at a site opposite the police station of South Florida Road. The militants became their camp after the result of the eventual non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
Ferrer and her daughter contacted a local business owner who made a bagged lunch.
They prepared bags and were responsible for passing them to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new kind of activism.
“My activism changed completely after August 9,” she said, as she enrolled at Missouri State University’s St. Louis campus, she was president of the Society of Minority Nurses, focusing on the food justice and health disparities in the black community.
“I have no organizational experience.
That's how it all came about."
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with the film's co-director, Sabah Foleyan, during a night parade.
Foleyan said she and her photography director, Lucas Alvarado Falle, were “just trying to document” what happened.
Ferrell’s mind came up with the question: “Do you want to record or do you want to find a story that you can use?”
This skepticism stems from many of these cases: people — often white people — enter a community to benefit from their pain and tenacity.
As Fleyang explained in a recent interview, “We have heard that natives of Ferguson are not concentrating their voices, and we want to do it differently.”
Foleyan has been in contact with co-director Dimon Davis. Dimon Davis is a regional artist known for his activism against death row inmates.
His involvement led Ferrer, along with six other locals, to join the “Whose Streets?” project team, which remained in mind for several years after Brown’s shooting.
“This documentary is not about someone talking to us or talking to us, that’s what we’re talking to,” Davis said.
“I’m mainly concerned with how these characters are presented, because that’s how I’m presented.”
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrer’s experience — but to show that the movement is “not about the messiah leader, but about community cohesion,” Foleyang said — it turns out that she is the most open to film participants.
The result, “Whose Street?” is a surprising record of Ferrer’s personal life, such as falling in love and getting married.
“I feel naked,” Ferrer laughed the first time he saw the finished product.
“But I understand that to do this work and humanize the Negro, there has to be a certain degree of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrer’s story reaffirms and repositions the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement’s three founders — who created #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 shooting of black teenager Trevorn Martin — were identified as queer.
“Black queer women in leadership have supported this movement in general,” Ferrer said, “because we’re constantly fighting on multiple fronts.”
Black queer women have to endure it all."
Foleyan agreed and mentioned that “this movement really has the support of black women and many black queer women.”
Because of her identity, Ferrer was chosen as the centerpiece of the film. However, she insisted that "this is not an affirmative action for things".
“She’s the one who inspires that kind of energy,” she said.
"Although she's on the front lines, it's no coincidence. Because in life at these crossroads, as a black queer woman, you have a lot to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy."
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have long since disappeared, but tensions between the community and the police remain in race.
Ferrer was sentenced to more than two-and-a-half years on probation for trying to block the highway during a parade.
She described the socio-political atmosphere of the region she called home: “a mess.”
Still, since taking to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has stuck to the hymns she’s struggled to remember.
“We have a responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We can't lose anything, except the shackles on our bodies."
In fact, online translation services were available on the Internet a decade ago, and in fact, a long time ago, the tone of “machines are about to replace human translation” is endless.
Similarities: Artist Creates Portraits Using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the Friedman Museum of Art in New York, there are multiple faces: white, black, and brown, with almost imperceptible similarities between each face, which are tied by a rope that is hanging from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea Manning’s sent to her cheek cotton swab and hair crumbs.
Manning sent bruises from the Fort Worth prison for leaking classified diplomatic cables through WikiLeaks, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
The exhibition opened on August 2 with the title “Similarities.”
It was the result of two years of communication between Dewey Haggerburg and Manning, who combined his discipline with his own technology, computer science, and art, while Manning was a prominent political dissident who had been in prison and had undergone sex reassignment surgery in prison. Former U.S. President Barack Obama pardoned her remaining sentence three days before the end of his term.
An algorithmic analysis from Manning's DNA, and by creating 30 portraits of "probable appearances". Heather Duwey Harberg made a sharp and slightly lenser comment. His comments were both poercious to DNA and to the concept of identity itself.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, publicly admitted to identifying herself as a woman during puberty. He was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six counts of espionage law violations, computer fraud, and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photo, a black-and-white selfie with a granular feel, looking distinctly uneasy, sitting in the driver’s seat, wearing a platinum wig.
In 2015, Heather Duwey Harberg was a huge success in her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
In that work, she used forensics from the smoking tyres and chewing gum in the middle court of DNA extracted from crumbs to create 3D portraits of people who might have looked similar.
That’s when she received an email from Paper magazine.
“They wanted to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and needed a portrait,” Heather Duwey Harberg told the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning couldn’t visit or take pictures at the time, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
As a result, the artist and her imprisoned muse became an impossible pen pal, exchanging many letters with each other over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, The Repressed Head, by Shoili Kanungo. The comic book foresees that the president will grant Manning privileges in the future, and that she will be able to see the exhibition in prison.
Obama asked for her release just days after the book was published. It may have been a coincidence that Manning spent his seventh year in a Kansas military prison.
In addition, the exhibition has another layer of deep meaning. Because in the contemporary United States, the Trump administration has repeatedly declared war on government leakers and transgender soldiers, while finding new ways to frighten the division in a way that can be hyped on Twitter, and this exhibition is about bridging such a split.
Asked about the timing of all this, Heather Duwey Harberg said, “There’s a reason for anything to happen.”
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's oversized signature is below (the "i" in the name is drawn with a heart), calling for an end to the "partisan conflict based on gender, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, twisting and twisting the words Cs, Gs, and As with a pencil.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleotide, a complex scientific dictionary for each artist), Heatherdouwe Haborg hopes to express that, at least in terms of physiological structure, everyone is like these by depicting these strangely similar portraits.
“I want people to get out of this mess, and our genome doesn’t care who we are, how the publicly available genetic data is interpreted, and how subjective it is,” said Heather Duwey Harberg, whose 2007 video, False Memory, is also on display.
“DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so that’s 30 of them.”
The last piece in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page from the previous illustration of a novella.
Manning, which shows the pompous, Kong-shaped shape of Kongong, is displayed by soldiers in the United States holding a loudspeaker.
“When they make your speech stop, they win,” the wall wrote.
"Don't shut up."
“These are from a letter she wrote to me,” the Philadelphia-based artist said.
"I'm afraid, I'm still going to say it."
Manning hasn’t seen the exhibition in person, as foreseen in the comics, but when she does, she will be greeted by her own DNA portrait mask, just as a group of protesters get cheers in the center of the pavilion.
It also serves a purpose, as with all items in the exhibition, reaching the height of the genetic halogroup information she wrote in pencil (5.2 feet, the height of Manning).
“In the past, I hung them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a group of people,” Dewey Hargburg said of the portrait.
“But I want them to feel like a bunch of protesters following Chelsea, just as people protested against her release.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted in murder
Police said a man was found fatally stabbed in a luxury Chicago apartment and that a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were subsequently wanted and are now looking for suspects across the country.
Cook County Court records show that on Monday, 42-year-old Wyndham Lessham and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were arrested on a first-degree unbailed murder warrant for the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranlow.
According to documents, 26-year-old Cornell Duranlow died from multiple stab wounds.
A Chicago Police Department community alert said the body was found on July 27.
Police received a phone call at the Grand Plaza apartment and found multiple ruptures on the victim.
Police said Cornell Durranlow died instantly and detectives were investigating the killing, while police were actively searching for two suspects.
Lessham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kobec, deputy director of campus relations, said in an emailed statement that Lessem has now been separated and has been barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
“Now this is a criminal case, the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation.”
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for Somerville College, Oxford, said in an emailed statement: “We have been in contact with the British police and stand ready to assist the U.S. investigative body on demand.”
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped he would turn himself in.
Chicago Police Chief Liaison Officer Anthony Gullemi expressed strong encouragement for the suspect to turn himself in from authorities.
“The police already have a general idea of their whereabouts, and we are trying to locate a possible location,” Gulemi said.
Gullimi said local, regional and national authorities were doing their utmost to assist in the search for suspects.
Gurlemi said police had received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment, and he had just received a secret reminder that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police said the situation was terrible.
Gulermi said it was still unclear whether the incident also occurred on July 27.
He said that according to security cameras, it was confirmed that Lessem and Warren were in the building at the time.
“We believe that Professor Lessham has a certain relationship with the victims,” Gulermi said.
Grand Plaza’s management team issued a statement to residents saying: “Police are currently studying the victim’s timeline and background, and are investigating various motivations, including a possible domestic incident.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said: "We will complete the roadmap of the World Anti-Doping Agency in the near future".
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitali Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“The implementation of the roadmap standard has reached a certain stage, and RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard,” Mutko said Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko made the remarks in commenting on Part II of the WADA Roadmap, Compliance Regulations. This section sets out the criteria for restoring RUSADA rights and was recently posted on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the standard does not contain anything that might cause concern to Russia.
He added, “Everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will also be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future.”
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency must publicly accept the findings approved by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on WADA’s support for doping incidents in national sports.
Speaking about the matter, Mutko said: “We are investigating and there is no doubt that our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have already been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind it, and we will not admit that there is no such thing.”
Mutko responded to the words of Vitali Smirnov, head of Russia’s Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged the past problems with the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, but added: “We have said on various occasions many times that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally,” Smirnov said.
After the doping scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended RUSADA’s right to perform doping inspections in Russia.
But in June, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director-General Olivia Negri, visiting the group’s headquarters in Moscow in July, said RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” in an effort to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it is checkers or national chess, beating humans is no longer spoken decades ago.
Croatian Football Association President Davo Suk said in an interview that participating in the Chinese Cup is very meaningful for Croatian football, and the bonus number of the Chinese Cup is very large.
No need to buy anymore!These more than 8,000 kinds of products zero tariff
At the regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, the spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce said that as of now, there are 15 free trade agreements that have been implemented in China, involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 kinds of zero-tariff imported products.
At the same time, imported cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean red wine, ASEAN tropical fruits... these products you want no longer need to spend a lot of money on behalf of the purchase.
At present, China has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, and 15 have been implemented in force, covering more than 8,000 kinds of zero-tariff imported products.
Taking agricultural products as an example, with the implementation of the free trade agreement, consumers can taste agricultural products from different origins, high quality and low price throughout the year.
For example, tropical fruits such as durian, lychee, and dragon fruit in ASEAN have tariffs ranging from 15% to 30% to zero tariffs.
The import duty on Icelandic salmon is reduced from 10% to 12% to zero.
Wine imports from Georgia and Chile are reduced from 14% to 30% to zero.
There are also New Zealand's specialty agricultural products such as beef and milk powder, which have a large tax reduction.
Take industrial products, for example, the import tariffs on some cosmetics in Switzerland have been reduced to zero;
The import tariff on some watches has been reduced by 50%, and the tariff will be reduced to zero after a few years.
South Korea's refrigerators, rice cookers, massagers, beauty machines and other products import tariffs reduced by 40%, and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years;
There are also consumer electronic products and other large tax cuts.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the free trade zone also include the intermediate products and raw materials required for the manufacture of many domestic terminal consumer goods, and also promote the structural upgrading of domestic consumer goods to a certain extent.
Gao Feng, spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce, said that nearly one-third of China's total imports can enjoy preferential tariffs on free trade agreements, most of which are terminal consumer goods, which bring tangible benefits to consumers.
Further reduction of import tariffs on consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted the import tariffs on some consumer goods, further reducing the import tariffs on consumer goods, covering various consumer products such as food, health care products, drugs, daily necessities, clothing, shoes and hats, household equipment, cultural and entertainment, and daily necessities, involving 187 8-bit tax numbers.
The average tax rate on these consumer goods will be reduced from 17.3 percent to 7.7 percent, almost being cut off!
Since January 1, 2018, China has also made some adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
Lipstick, eye shadow, perfume and other parts of the cosmetics import duty from 10% to 5%;
After reducing tariffs, it means that consumers do not have to buy on behalf of them, and they do not need to run abroad to buy their favorite foreign products.
2018 Yiwu Imported Goods Shopping Festival: Imported red wine, snacks, fruit... all cheap!
Foreign reports: the end of the year, the United States shopping malls require large differences in shopping returns need to be cautious
New Network December 29
According to the United States "World Daily" reported that just after Christmas, ushered in the return tide.
According to ABC, more than half of the goods sold last Christmas were returned.
In addition, some readers have repeatedly revealed that online shopping has been cheated, and consumers need to pay more attention to shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have regular and reasonable return procedures, but if you buy gifts or e-commerce shopping from some small stores, you must be careful.
On December 1, local time, Ms. Hou of Rolandoka bought a jacket for more than 60 yuan (US dollars, the same below) in an online shop that specializes in printing coats, and has not yet sent them.
She emailed the customer and did not reply.
Another netizen broke the news that he went to the United States last year to travel to the United States, bought a mobile phone from a third-party seller, and found that it was a box of plaster.
After knowing that you have been cheated, you can apply for a refund from the website, and you will get a full refund.
However, some customers believe that the website refund service is not 100% perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident of Northern California, said that he had twice purchased an emergency delivery service for a website, and one emergency service was four yuan, but he was not delivered on time.
After that, I asked for a refund and did not get a response.
Large shopping malls or shopping malls have a better return policy.
Most of the Macy’s products are fully refunded within 180 days.
However, the goods must remain "original" and must have purchase vouchers such as receipts or bank purchase records.
If there is no voucher, the customer can also get the mall points, which can be used to buy other goods.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for general goods, and electronic products usually have 15 days.
However, the return period for electronic and entertainment products purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017 has been extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day refund period is from December 25, that is, it is necessary to return it before January 25, 2018.
The ultimate shopping experience, the new era of shopping development in the business district is coming
More than a decade ago, China is still in the seller's market in general, people's choices are limited, and demand is limited.
But after a decade of development, the market has already achieved a shift from the seller's market to the buyer's market, and today's consumer tastes have become more and more sophisticated, and they are no longer satisfied with the simple "one-handed delivery" shopping behavior.
Therefore, how to get consumers to get an extreme shopping experience has become the next competition for real estate developers.
Among the many factors that affect the consumer shopping experience, the impact of shopping centers in the business district is the most significant.
See how city builders pay attention to the shopping experience.
There are no two identical leaves in the world, and there are no two shopping centers that are exactly the same, and a famous shopping center must have its own characteristics.
For example, Turkey's world-famous Kanyon shopping center, its unique wavy architectural design inspired by the Grand Canyon (Canyon), so named homophonic Kanyen, walking in the Kanyon Minister's 200-meter walk is like being in the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon-style design, there is also a large oval performance venue in the middle of the shopping center, with a unique appearance, and often special performances.
Because of the open platform design, visitors can walk on each floor to see the activities carried out in the "canyon", and have the effect of shifting scenery.
In China, Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, known as China's first forest-style strolling consumer field, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
7000 square meters of green space square, 3000 square meters of roofing water platform, the project consists of 9 single buildings, the air corridors between the buildings, the overall sinking courtyard design, take the French sycamore tree on the geographical edge for the construction skin, the roof water roof platform, to create a forest-like feeling.
Walking into the forest moor, like accidentally falling into the rabbit hole in Alice's roaming adventures, climbing along the trunk of the building around the building, grass, springs against each other, will bring people into a forest full of vitality and vitality.
In Chongqing, Longhu built Lijia water business district, planning Baifang business, plans to introduce more than 50 international top monopoly flagship stores, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 domestic and foreign famous brands in the future, to become a service industry agglomeration, the theme of distinctive characteristics of the commercial center.
Not only that, Lijia Waterfront Business District will also integrate ecology into the building, TOD public transportation as the guide, set fashion shopping, life services, catering, entertainment, education, sports in one, in bringing consumers the ultimate shopping experience while also leading them to enjoy Chongqing's unique "waterfront culture", shopping and water entertainment, leisure perfect integration.
In summary, it can be found that at present, some housing companies have gained insight into the discovery trajectory of this new urban business, and industry insiders said that this consumption model centered on consumer experience and how to combine shopping and experience will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
The current business district is not only a distribution center for goods, but also a comprehensive place that integrates art, culture and creative themes, and also carries people's responsibilities for urban living.
Therefore, while meeting the one-stop material needs of consumers eating and drinking, maximizing the spiritual needs of transmitting the multi-level cultural and artistic needs and giving full play to the livable housing needs must be the commanding heights for the future development of the business district.
In Chongqing, the northern shore of Guoxing, located in Jiangbei, close to Guanyin Bridge, the essence of world business, the left and right of the international giant, the first brand gathered together to connect with international fashion.
Here step by step prosperity, the essence of the world;
Dongyuan Jinyue has a better shopping environment, Dongyuan Jinyue near the Nanping business district, exclusive to the west and even the country's leading four-storey traffic system, enhance shopping comfort.
In addition, the landscaping and landscape flooring of the two pedestrian streets of Huigong Road and Wanda Square have been upgraded, about 300 trees have been planted, and the renovation of the field is 40,000 square meters, which enhances the image of Nanping Business District;
Longhu Yuhu No., near Chongqing's first low-density waterfront business district - Lijia waterfront business district, surrounded by nine parks, the commercial district is low density, high degree of openness, making people more willing to stay, stop, slowly enjoy the fun of shopping, rather than being rushed forward by the people behind, really realize the "walking shopping".
Today's business competition will only become more and more fierce, how to kill a bloody road in a homogenized market, won the reputation of the future consumer heart of the "shopping mecca", worthy of all real estate developers to seriously think about.
Only with the differentiation strategy is not enough, only those who really put consumers in their hearts, urgent consumers, want consumers to think, to provide consumers with the ultimate and simple shopping experience of developers can laugh in the storm market.
Of course, in the end, I think the most happy people in Chongqing, with such a good shopping experience and business circle, put in 10 years ago no one can imagine today's prosperity.
Things Festival: Consumerism Carnival Covers Real Environmental Prices
168.2 billion yuan, this is November 11, 2017, "tmall double eleven global carnival" within 24 hours, Tmall users to spend turnover.
Specifically, after the start of "double 11", the turnover of Tmall in just 3 minutes exceeded 10 billion, more than 20 billion yuan in 6 minutes and 05 seconds, and 100 billion yuan in 9 hours.
On this day, the total number of payments completed by global consumers through Alipay reached 1.48 billion, an increase of 41% over last year.
These purchases will result in 812 million logistics orders.
Whether it is Tmall online shopping platform or Alipay payment platform, all belong to Ma Yun's Ali Group.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that on November 11, the "Singles Day" subculture created by single youth out of self-deprecation will be compiled by e-commerce and become the phenomenon of "double 11" shopping carnival.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used the marketing gimmick of "Singles Day big promotion" for the first time: no one fell in love with you, so "single dogs" came to the online shopping bar.
The result was surprising, and the transaction volume of Taobao Mall (the predecessor of Tmall) exceeded 52 million yuan on this day, which was 10 times the daily transaction value at that time.
Since then, "double 11" has become a shopping carnival created by Alibaba, from the beginning of the domestic buyers and sellers to entertain themselves, and now the influx of global merchants, nine years have passed, Tmall "double 11" 100 billion transactions have been more than 3,200 times that year, so that "Black Friday" can not be seen.
Follow the trend of Tmall "double eleven" promotion, there are many electricity suppliers, of which "Jingdong" is the most powerful.
"Jingdong" has its own shopping festival "6.18", but there is no "double 11" has a big impact, this year from November 1 to 11, "Jingdong" cumulative sales reached 127.1 billion yuan.
After the "double 11", it is followed by a similar "double 12" discount carnival, Christmas and New Year shopping schedule.
After the New Year, waiting for Chinese consumers are also the Spring Festival before the annual purchase schedule, Valentine's Day shopping schedule, consumption, will not take a vacation.
The environmental problems brought about by the mass consumption of instant time have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to the Xinhua Daily Telegraph, according to the usual standard of 0.2 kilograms per box in the industry, at least 300,000 tons of garbage were generated during the "double 11" period this year.
Liu Hua, director of the pollution prevention and control project of Greenpeace East Asia, told China and foreign dialogue that this year's "double 11" only Tmall's order volume will produce 160,000 tons of packaging waste.
The State Post Bureau issued a report in 2016, pointing out that during the "double 11" period in 2015 (November 11 to 16), the express volume of about 780 million pieces, the use of more than 3 billion woven bags, 9,922 million boxes, 16.985 billion meters of tape, the length of the tape can circle the earth's equator 425 times.
This year, the State Post Bureau expects the "double 11" express business volume is expected to exceed 1.5 billion.
Wang Shi, manager of a garbage incineration center in Beijing, told Xinhua that the daily entry of more than 2,000 tons of garbage after "double 11" also exceeded the processing capacity of the incineration station.
The express delivery company has realized that the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry cannot be looked at.
Some e-commerce logistics companies, including Suning, "double 11" before the introduction of recyclable and reused plastic express boxes, can be repeated as shopping bags and garbage bags of circulating bags, etc., but the unpleasant consumer acceptance is not high.
Ma also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics" in Weibo.
This micro-blog has gained more than 68,000 "likes".
What kind of mobile payment do Germans want?
Zhang Dongfang: The mobile payment war opened in Germany is not expected.
WeChat Pay and Alipay only moved the battlefield to Europe, competitors have not changed, snatching positions have not changed - Chinese, this is also globalization?
Where there is a payment, there must be micro-payment.
According to the agreement with the German electronic payment service Wirecard, WeChat Pay officially began to land in Germany in November this year, and gradually deployed merchants in Europe.
The reunion of the two "goddens" took place in Europe.
All along, Alipay and WeChat Pay have been singing on the road of globalization.
For the globalization of mobile payment in China, iResearch's "China Third-Party Mobile Payment Industry Research Report 2017" summarizes two kinds: one is through strategic investment, experience output, shareholding and support foreign local mobile payment enterprises.
The second is to promote mobile payment services to foreign merchants through Chinese tourists' consumption behavior abroad, thereby changing the perception and acceptance of foreign-local mobile payment to China.
In fact, the Chinese have to go to heaven.
With China’s rapid economic development and a large population base, the spending of Chinese tourists in Europe is a tantalizing number.
But this is also destined, this time in Germany to open the Chinese mobile payment war is not expected.
WeChat Pay and Alipay just moved the battlefield to Europe, competitors have not changed, the grabs of the position or have not changed - or the Chinese, this is also global?
More pioneering discussion is whether China's mobile payment can be expanded in Europe?
Take Germany for example.
The Magic of the “New Retail”
Chen Yilei and Yang Kaihan: When Amazon announced its entry into bookstores and grocery stores when it squeezed into the world's top ten retailers, it was worth playing with regardless of timing or motivation.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and San Diego.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened a store in New York and planned to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
At about the same time, Amazon announced that its unmanned supermarket (Amazon Go) trial operation, customers to the store do not need to queue, do not need to checkout, enter the door to scan the code, take the desired goods to leave, the amount of shopping will automatically be deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, it is a very unexpected thing that has suddenly been used in physical stores in recent years.
Because as early as 2007's "Open Letter to Shareholders", CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon will not easily open a physical store, unless the following four conditions are met at the same time:
We must be confident that this new opportunity will allow shareholders to return on their investment;
We must be confident that this new opportunity is of great significance to the company as a whole.
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is ignored by the market.
We must be confident that in this market, we have sufficient resources to differentiate our customers.
Bookshops and grocery stores are the most shaky categories of both brick-and-mortar retail, and the first to fall after the rise of Amazon.
Amazon announced its entry into both physical markets as it squeezed into the world’s top 10 retailers, both timing and motivation.
Is Amazon’s approach contrary to the guarantees in the shareholder letter?
Similar voices were heard on the other side of the globe. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Yunqi Conference, Ma Yun, Chairman of Alibaba's Board of Directors, delivered a keynote speech.
He said: "Starting next year, Alibaba will no longer mention the term 'e-commerce'.
The era of pure e-commerce will soon end, and the next ten or twenty years will be without e-commerce, replaced by “new retail”.
Online and offline and logistics together will produce new retail.”
For a time, the three words of "new retail" were like magic, and they were frequently hung on their lips by the industry.
What does “new retail” mean?
If it is just a combination of online and offline, then this concept is not novel.
In 2016, eMarketer, after tracking 180 of the largest e-commerce companies, estimated that the total e-commerce sales were about $200 billion, and the 25 largest accounted for more than $159 billion.
Of the 25, 18 have started operating online traditional retailers in the past five years (e.g. Macy’s, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
Alibaba Group's 28.3 billion yuan of shares in Suningyun merchants are also vividly seen.
Globally, retailers and e-commerce are moving from a single channel to an omni-channel retail system that covers physical stores, e-commerce, mobile and social media.
Is Ma Yun talking about "new retail", more a summary than a vision for the future?
If not, then the concept of omnichannel, what is the difference between "new retail" and "new retail"?
Perhaps the key to the problem is not whether online and offline will be integrated, but how to integrate.
Looking back at the past 20 years of retail, the rise of e-commerce, like the rise of early-year discount retailers, has focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, e-commerce has moved products with a very high degree of standardization, such as books and CDs, from offline to online.
With the development of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, e-commerce has extended its tentacles to other categories and begun to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, "Using the ideas and technology of the Internet to comprehensively reform and upgrade the existing total of about 30 trillion social retailers, so that the increasingly escalating consumer demand of Chinese consumers can be effectively met, so that the entire process of commodity production, circulation and service has become more efficient because of the extensive use of the Internet and big data."
Therefore, the road of e-commerce is a road of light assets on the surface and actual heavy assets.
"Light" refers to the burden of fixed assets, staffing, management processes and so on is not the traditional retail industry; "heavy" refers to the need for huge investment in logistics, warehousing and so on.
The change of logistics methods ensures the high efficiency of e-commerce.
According to the Chinese government network, Premier Li Keqiang hosted an executive meeting of the State Council on April 28, which concluded that expanding domestic consumption demand is an important measure to stabilize growth and adjust the structure.
The meeting determined that the relevant departments should urgently come up with specific plans on the basis of scientific assessment.
For some foreign consumer goods with large domestic consumer demand, the pilot reduction of import tariffs will be carried out by the end of June this year, and the scope of tax reduction goods will be gradually expanded;
In combination with the reform of the tax system, improve the consumption tax policy of mass consumer goods such as clothing and cosmetics, and comprehensively adjust the scope of taxation, tax rates and collection links;
Add and restore port entry duty-free shops, reasonably expand the tax-free varieties, increase a certain amount of duty-free shopping, and facilitate domestic consumers to purchase foreign products in China;
We will further promote the facilitation of overseas passenger shopping customs clearance and tax refunds, and strictly implement the tax requirements for entry-into-country goods to voluntarily declare their taxes according to law.

On January 18, Alibaba held a e-commerce poverty alleviation peak dialogue in Chongqing, announcing that it would promote accurate poverty alleviation and rural revitalization by exploring a new model of "Internet + poverty alleviation".
This is after the introduction of the rural strategy, the launch of the rural Taobao project, the on-line agricultural poverty alleviation platform, the establishment of Alibaba Poverty Alleviation Fund, Ali on the fight against poverty again "plus".
Poverty alleviation is one of the most important national strategies in China.
All-out poverty has not been achieved in China in the past few thousand years.
"E-commerce poverty alleviation is an innovative measure of a new round of poverty alleviation and development, and an important starting point for achieving accurate poverty alleviation and precision poverty alleviation."
The central government attaches great importance to and points out that it can give full play to the role of the Internet in promoting poverty alleviation, promote precision poverty alleviation, precision poverty alleviation, and let agricultural products go out of the countryside through the Internet.
Therefore, as early as 2014, Ali put forward the rural strategy, and the big data cloud computing and globalization are listed as Ali's three core strategies in the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the rural Taobao (village Tao) project to recruit "village two" in the countryside and lead farmers to get rich through e-commerce.
In 2017, Ali cooperated with the business department to build a channel for poverty alleviation for farmers, and currently has a total of 13 provinces and 120 national poverty-stricken counties across the country.
The Taobao village spawned by Ali platform has 2118.
Among them, nearly 400 appeared in poor counties in the province, and 33 in 13 national poverty-stricken counties.
In 2017, on Alibaba's China retail platform, the sales of Taobao Village nationwide reached 120 billion yuan.
Zhang Yong said that in the face of the national strategy of poverty alleviation, Ali has been thinking about how to make good use of the innovation capabilities of Ali's economy such as science and technology, big data, and cloud computing to walk a new path for poverty alleviation.
Among them, Village Tao is the main carrier platform for Ali e-commerce to get rid of poverty, and has walked through a new link of Internet poverty alleviation for direct sales.
In the planting process, the village and ant financial service jointly carry out agricultural tools and small loan support.
In 2017, among the 832 national poverty-stricken counties, Ant Financial served 795, providing convenient payment, credit and other services.
Rookie to solve warehousing and logistics, Tmall is responsible for sales, Aliyun's big data back-feeding guide agricultural production, and further improve the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of e-commerce out of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
Ali opened an e-commerce course through Taobao University to teach farmers standardized, quality and large-scale planting methods, and realized the combination of "poverty alleviation + support for the mind" to allow farmers to sustainably get rid of poverty.
These courses already cover about 92 per cent of state-level poverty-stricken counties.
The idea of "public welfare mentality and commercial means" to get rid of poverty can also ensure that Ali can achieve "true poverty alleviation" when poverty alleviation.
Ma Yun, chairman of Alibaba's board of directors, has said that poverty eradication should be divided into three stages: poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation and wealth.
Poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish, to get rid of poverty is to teach people to fish, to get rich is to create a "fish pond" for farmers, so that farmers have fish to raise.
The industrial poverty alleviation driven by e-commerce is the production of fish ponds.
In terms of industrial poverty alleviation, the Luochuan apple industry poverty alleviation model created by Ali and Shaanxi Luochuan has been replicated and promoted in the country by relevant departments as an example.
Ali e-commerce poverty alleviation work has also been recognized by the decision-making level.
E-commerce companies represented by Alibaba have been sent messages to ensure that farmers increase production and income through online and offline channels.
Some village small and ant financial staff have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of e-commerce out of poverty.
At present, the China office of the United Nations World Food Programme has been working with the village to carry out poverty alleviation in the e-commerce industry in Anhui and other places.
The "Third New Economic Think Tank Conference" jointly organized by Ali Research Institute and China Visionary Think Tank Ontan was held on January 16, and Zhang Li, director of the E-commerce Institute of the Research Institute of the Ministry of Commerce, attended and spoke.
She believes that our globalization actually ignores the most important issues, namely, the body and use of globalization, and the stage of globalization.
In this way, many people think that globalization has stagnated, and many developed and developing countries, in the new stage, their attitude towards globalization is not the same, is different from the model.
The second concept is the question of the medium-term stage of globalization, and what are the constraints of the medium-term stage of globalization?
Constrained by the foundation of the economic environment, it is precisely because the economic foundation has changed the globalization constraints.
Zhang Li believes that the global economic adjustment at the end of 2017 is basically over, and after 2018, it will enter a new round of growth, and the next round of growth must be driven by raw products.
Jingdong's first fresh supermarket, 7FRESH, has officially opened, planning to lay more than 1,000 stores across the country in the next three to five years.
Coupled with Ali's box horse fresh life, Yonghui's super species, Su Ning's Su fresh life, Meituan's palm fish fresh, etc., "new retail stores" began to pile up, and in the innovation mode and even the price of each other "call the board."
The competition for fresh supermarkets has become a phenomenon-level topic in the field of new retail, where is the new retail?
"In 2018, we will quickly enter the country, and a lot of stores will be opened in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival."
Hou Yi, CEO of Box Ma Fresh, revealed the "new play" in 2018 at the second new retail summit on the 10th.
"Since 2018, Box Horse is not only a fresh electricity supplier, but a life category of e-commerce that meets the immediate services of consumers."
The core mode is offline to divert, experience, and online is the real sales.
Different from the traditional hypermarkets and supermarkets, Box Horse Fresh is a fun and delicious "net red shop" in the eyes of many consumers, and even an intermediary agency has played the concept of "box room".
Online e-commerce platforms and offline retailers have their own advantages and disadvantages, but consumers are appearing in a variety of channels, so both sides are trying an omni-channel model.
The industry believes that under the background of consumption upgrading, there will be more and more stores of "box horses" in 2018.
The box horse has continuously explored more consumer areas from the initial fresh, indicating that in the new year, there will be more innovation in the retail market.
"For example, the combination of online and offline business model, attracted the attention of consumers, around the fresh supermarkets called and cheered."
"But these relationships say more, no longer useless, and finally implemented to you whether you have brought a good experience to consumers, I experienced it well before I was willing to pay."
In the view of Yuan Bin, CEO of Darun Feifei Network, in the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed, and purchase demand has also changed.
The original pure online, offline is divided, offline to beat the line, online to counter-offensive line, now is together hand in hand, because consumers have no online and offline distinction.
The rush of capital to enter the market makes the new retail gunpowder currently represented by fresh supermarkets full of flavor.
The analysis believes that at present, the competition of new retail in first-tier cities is far from the pattern of the Red Sea, and there are still large second-tier cities that have yet to be tapped, and the market still has great opportunities and space.
The layout of different types of industries for new retail will bring the development of new retail to a diversified development.

But this year the situation is not the same, online retail sales re-accelerated, from January to September this year, the growth rate rebounded to 34.2%.

Helping you avoid the company becoming the next Uber startup
Amy Erret once wanted to investigate employee happiness at her e-commerce startup, but the survey didn’t work.
The responses received are often vague, unhelpful, and even worse, deceptive responses.
Even though she promised to take the form of anonymity, some employees still distrust the process.
Madison Reed, a San Francisco-based e-commerce hair care company that runs 75 people, said she “has a lack of consistency and objectivity in the responses.”
So she called for help.
A new group of human resources startups has sprung up to help companies understand how employees feel.
They build and empower software specifically designed to measure employee engagement, allowing companies to conduct rapid polls for specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass executives and report directly to the board.
“Now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company’s Fitbit?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint. The Glint software analytics tool is used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Erret said that in three years, she used Glint to gain more insights into what employees think and feel.
In addition to team-specific quick surveys and polls, Glint offers company heat maps, which units have the most complaints, and which managers approve low scores at a glance — which allows her to get a deep understanding of why.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must be proficient in controlling their workplace culture to avoid becoming the next Uber. Former Uber employees have previously published a blog post describing the harassment environment, and these speakers were punished by the company, and then Uber was caught in a scandal.
For startups like Glint, the company’s desire to oversee is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to financial technology analytics website Let’s Talk Payments, the global governance, regulatory, and compliance industry could be worth more than $11.87 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a start-up in Denver, Colorado, is dedicated to helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, and they saw an increase in interest and activity in this area during Uber’s reputation damage earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up to become a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized “diagnosis” surveys that collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides an anonymous SMS hotline for employees to report bad behavior.
If the chairman is implicated, the complaint will go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent, said: “The court of public opinion has usurped the power of regulators.
If a company is found to be ill-treated or unethical for employees, the company could face high consequences of consumer boycotts, employee churn and lawsuits, even if regulators don’t step in, Mr. Quinland said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain that spans more than 500 locations and employs more than 25,000 people, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees understand the work guidelines and procedures, providing an easy way to connect with the company’s headquarters.
Until then, if employees want to report the problem, they must find a company headquarters phone number or email, make a formal complaint, and hope that headquarters can take it seriously.
This is often a frightening and unsettling experience, says James Vitrano, general counsel for Ruby Tuesday, who doesn’t think there’s a good way to track down employee complaints.
But now that the company uses Convercent, it can more quickly identify and address issues that executives in remote offices, cities, or states did not know about — such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair wage behavior.
“I can get a closer, 360-degree view of the work experience,” said Vitrano, who is in charge of the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
“We are protecting our shareholders from employment lawsuits.”
Quinlan said that after the collapse of Andorran accounting firms because of the breach of ethical code of the Enron scandal, companies have paid more attention to ethics, values and employee engagement since 2002.
But it wasn’t until “social media went into their own world” that companies realized they couldn’t stop their revelations from spreading virally online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people see hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service and charge companies recurring fees for their product use.
This business model and business opportunity is supported by venture capitalists who have already supported both startups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with total capital rising to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, with a total funding of $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness of companies, culture and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing body of research shows that today’s employees have higher expectations of the workplace than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high-paying water and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued, and that their time is spent on a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to join the company, feel their voices being heard, and the work they do is beneficial, they’re more committed to making the company successful,” said Nina McCartney, LinkedIn’s vice president of global benefits and employee experience.
Investors pay off when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well when they are loyal and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it’s no surprise they’ll be looking for financial support.
Workplace culture experts say it’s important to have employee engagement data.
However, this data is useless unless the company’s administrators take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can expect the company to be changing.
If the change doesn’t go fast enough, or if it doesn’t make a little bit of progress, it can lead to disappointment and disengage employees from the company.
Russell Ruth, head of consulting at business management firm Kott International, said: “If you want to seek 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations.” He has seen some companies over-residence in data collection.
“Because if you don’t follow up the whole time, the employee will think, ‘Did you really hear what I said?’
Do you care?
If you don’t care, why should I care?”
Emerson said Madison Reed now conducts monthly employee surveys and has been able to take action on the day Glint reports the problem.
After collecting feedback from employees about their frustration with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve problems by reorganizing her internal team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees, and in the long run they want to be able to make a shift in an industry known for high brain drain rates to better retain employees.
“If you’re not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you’re going to lose talent,” Vitrano says.
“If you lose talent, you lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose the company."

NCAA cancels twice-daily training, prolongs Bears daytime training
It’s close to 11 p.m., UCLA football team members are tying around the team’s new campus practice.
Some players have taken off their sweatshirts, revealing their sweaty bodies after the first day of training in the training camp.
For a large part of the team, this few minutes is a break.
Players taking summer classes will return to their dorms after three hours of practice to prepare for their final exams, and then return to the Wasserman Football Centre for a meeting at 6:30 the next morning.
“The next three days are a run-in for these guys,” Bear coach Jim Mora said as Monday approached Tuesday.
The NCAA canceled two daily exercises (designed to ease the burden on players) but actually extended their daytime training time — at least until Friday.
That’s why UCLA’s first three workouts are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to fit the schedule on which players have squeezed.
From cancelling two training sessions a day to training more once a day, the Bears started training almost a week before last season, and Mora trained at summer school for the first time in six seasons in Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions on August 20, and then start preparing for the first match for the first Texas workers in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA’s rule adjustment, though that would add another program to a player’s busy schedule.
“In three or four days, we’re going to give them a huge amount of training, it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
"They've just passed. They're honing, they're all great kids.
I think on Saturday, we'll have more time, it's really great."
As soon as the training camp was over, UCLA would stop training. It was not an easy task, given the neighboring parking lot and the clear line of sight of the Luskin Center. The Luskin Center Superior Hotel had been thrown through the ball post protection net.
Starting this weekend, the Bears will be staying at the hotel. But Mora admitted that there could be problems once these rooms are vacant in the season.
“We’re going to take security measures,” Mora said.
"It's a real concern. The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in a room to record a training scene is not far-fetched.
If you have a training tape, it’s also pretty good.
But we will take security measures there, and we will take security measures in the parking lot No. 8.
We will use the available resources to do our best.
I will not worry too much about this.
We've made a plan."
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the value of homes across Australia rose by an average of 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent in the second quarter of this year, an annual increase of 3.5 per cent, the lowest annual increase since March 2013.
Just as real estate agents look to sell more properties during the holiday season, Australian house prices are growing at their lowest level since 2013.
The Wall Street Journal reported that AT&T had canceled plans to sell Huawei's new flagship smartphone in the United States.
Huawei had planned to announce the partnership at CES this week, and AT&T canceled it at the last minute.
In response to this situation, Huawei responded to the surging news reporter on January 9 that on January 9 local time in the United States, Huawei will release new products and specific listing information to the US market.
Huawei said that in the past five years, Huawei has proved its strength by launching high-end products in the global and US markets.
According to previous reports from the IT House, Huawei will release a "best phone you've never heard of" at the CES exhibition in Las Vegas on the afternoon of January 9, and the battery life of this phone can support two days of use.
The industry generally believes that Huawei's upcoming flagship phone is the Huawei Mate 10 Pro with Android Oreo system.
Yangcheng Evening News reporter Wang Li led by Fan Bingbing, Guo Tao, Dapeng, Zhang Jia translated and other starring film "I am not Pan Jinlian" will be released nationwide on September 30.
Yesterday, the film held a seminar on the theme of "Comedy Sadness" in Beijing, and three guests, Feng Xiaogang, Ning Hao and Dapeng, attended the event.
Composition circle alternation, the director is the wayward "I am not Pan Jinlian" special, is the composition of the circle alternating, especially with the mask lens taken the circular picture is very fresh.
Feng Xiaogang explained: "This theme is very similar to Zhang Yimou's "Qiu Ju's lawsuit", it is easy to think of together, I want to use the way everyone has not used to shoot. In fact, there is no special idea, is to think of fun, want to do something out of the way."
Feng Xiaogang said that he regarded the work as a debut, learned from the photographer how to shoot a circular picture, and even spent millions of dollars to let the photographer take a ten-minute test.
Facebook to launch fact-checking feature to combat fake news
Facebook announced on Thursday that it would send more potential hoax articles to third-party detection agencies and show the results below its original post. Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to combat so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, Facebook said it would start using newer machines to learn to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact-checkers, and could show the results of fact-checking below the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main points of communication for so-called fake news, and many believe that Facebook has influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, with voters experiencing a proliferation of false stories ahead of France’s presidential election in May, and Germany taking the lead in passing support for the fine plan ahead of the September election, and fines if social media networks fail to remove hate posts in time.
In a separate statement in Germany on Thursday, Facebook said it was launching a new fact-checking feature test in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Sarah Sue, product manager for Facebook News Feed, said in a blog post: “In addition to seeing which stories are questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to help them make informed decisions about what they read and share.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its “relevant article” feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a Graphic Novel: The Story of an English Castle
Recently, the small Scottney Castle became the protagonist in the compressed music video and at one point became a refuge for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scottney has witnessed 700 years of turbulence in the comfort of the Belle River Gorge in Kent, and now it is the inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a special interest in historical documents.
“I can see the handwriting of the ancients 300 years ago, and I found it too beautiful,” he said with a look.
“What kind of relationship is this to get this letter to fall into my hands.”
Across the Middle Ages until the Edwardian era, the “An English Castle” reading book chronicles the families of the Scottney, each of which was written by different British future artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This isn’t Rhodes’ first archival-based book: He also wrote The Teeth of the Dead in 2014 and Other Stories, a book inspired by British library literature, a work he has done with uncontrollable creative passions.
He said: "I can't suppress my impulse to write from the moment I saw the thumb mark left on the side of the letter, which was written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 18th century."
That's his fingerprint!
And the letters have always smelled of smoke, because at that time, you need to ignite to have light.
For us 300 years later, the smell feels like they’re all around us.
Oh, I like the archival literature!”
For those who are impressed by the old paper, being able to get the support of the National Trust of England and the Arts Council and living in the castle for nearly four months (“to be honest, I’ve been here a little longer”) seems fantastic and simply doesn’t believe it’s true.
Rhodes spent days visiting Victoria’s “new” castles, flipping through archives, studying many of the manor’s treasures and antiques, such as the hyena head hanging on the wall, and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered over the land and ruins of the old castle, chatting with wanderers, gardeners, and sometimes artists illustrating for his books.
Then in the evening, he would “drink some whiskey and write.”
Scottney's secret history is not yet clear, because the National Trust only entered after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hessy, in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff began to process the archives, describing them as “hundreds of years ago the nobles were leaving: ‘Oh, put it in the attic’.”
The diary, the letter from the British imperial era, depicts a map of the borders of each country: "You will think that land disputes will be boring," Rhodes said, "but two families will fight for a birch tree."
“Let it go, guys.”
Some of the stories in the work take the castle as a starting point, and then study British history on a broader level, including The Labourer, a trail of a man who left the new castle to participate in the 1381 peasant uprising.
“The story of the book, “Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,” chronicles a riot that took place in the castle in 1380,” Rhodes said.
“The peasant uprising began in that area, and I think it was a good place to launch an uprising.
Maybe the two are related?”
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the British Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, the story of the story of 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have given himself a funeral by filling his coffin with stones (which was discovered years later by revealing the ground in his coffin).
The Darrells is Roz’s favorite Scottney Castle family: “These gentlemen seem to be very scoundrels, constantly borrowing money and buying things they can’t afford.
Generations of Darrell men solve their debt problems by marrying rich old women, and I think they should be a group of handsome lads who know how to pursue women.”
As his mission in the castle ended, Rhodes began to search for other bizarre writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness completing a drawing novel about El?¤m?¤nm?¤ki “El?¤m?¤nm?¤ki” which was an early 20th-century nursing home that was slowly abandoned.
But Scottney had a special place for him.
“I’m sad to leave,” he said.
"It's like: 'Oh, I have to face the real life of the trough."
According to the surging news reporter, the ZTE intelligent car team is headquartered in Zhuhai, and the operator is Tian Wenguo, executive vice president of ZTE.
Large energy companies are all "rich and enemy countries", so which of the world's many energy companies are the most expensive?
Yesterday, the famous PFC energy company announced the 2011 list of listed energy companies in the top 50, the U.S. oil and gas producer ExxonMobil with a market value of 406.3 billion U.S. dollars to win the championship, after the Chinese oil and Royal Dutch Shell.
In the PFC list, PetroChina was indicated twice in 2007 and 2009, and the top spot in other years was all occupied by ExxonMobil.
In the top 50 list in 2011, a total of three companies from mainland China were shortlisted, in addition to PetroChina, which ranked No. 2, and China National Offshore Oil, which is ranked 9th and China National Offshore Oil in 15th.
According to the PFC, although the current oil price is much higher than four years ago, the CEO of PFC Energy pointed out that there are many reasons for the low total market value, mainly including the decline in the price of natural gas in North America and the low activity of the global stock market.
According to Xinhua News Agency, the heavy pollution weather in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding areas began on the 16th to further intensify on the 19th, and the AQI of Hebei Shijiazhuang, Xinji and Handan appeared "explosion table".
U.S. Changes to Green Card Regulations
The media quoted President Donald Trump as saying that the United States will launch a new immigration program and amend the green card regulations.
The program is intended to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 per year, and temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications are subject to stricter restrictions.
The new rules were proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
U.S. media quoted Trump as saying, "This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars, and achieve the above benefits by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries."
The law will replace the current programme to reduce chain migration.
This new application process favours applicants who speak English, have financial support, and have skills that are good for economic development.”
On May 29, the first China Fireworks and Firecracker Safety and Environmental Protection Expo will be held in Liuyang.
The event revolved around the theme of "science and technology, safety and environmental protection" for a period of two days. At that time, the most advanced fireworks machinery, the safest and most environmentally friendly flower cannon raw auxiliary materials and new products in the national fireworks and firecracker industry will gather in Liuyang.
The expo will invite a large number of experts and entrepreneurs to carry out academic exchanges in the fireworks and firecracker industry and share the latest technological achievements of fireworks and firecrackers.
Among them, fireworks and firecracker mechanized production equipment and safety and environmental protection products display will be carried out in Dayao Town, the main exhibition projects include mature technology, after relevant scientific and technological identification and safety demonstration of fireworks and firecracker production of pharmaceutical-related machinery and equipment, low sense, low explosive energy and other safe type of fireworks, no sulfur, micro-smoke and other safe and environmentally friendly personal combustion products.

Referring to the upcoming 2017, Zhao Lei said: "After the tour next year, I want to clear myself, and then precipitate it and write more new works."
In order to optimize the environment of the scenic spot and build a beautiful southern Yue, recently, the "636" volunteer service team of the Tobacco Special Bureau (branch of Nanyue District) has carried out the environmental protection activities of "climbing the forest and protecting the home".
The event not only received the support of all cadres and employees of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also attracted retired old cadres, employees and family members to participate in environmental protection practices, and the three generations of old and young people worked together to protect the forest, clean up the garbage, and contributed their own strength to the construction of the "beautiful South".
This volunteer service activity aims to protect the scenic resources of Nanyue, promote the concept of volunteer service of "caring for others, caring for society, and caring for nature", and also let the next generation accept the cultivation from an early age and inherit the virtues of volunteer service.
It is reported that since the establishment of the "636" volunteer service team at the beginning of April this year, a total of 16 members have been developed, and have carried out a series of volunteer service activities such as visiting disabled retail customers, helping tobacco farmers to care for tobacco leaves, and Ya'an earthquake love donations, becoming a volunteer force that conveys positive energy with heart.

Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful
Just when you don’t think 2017 will be any more strange, the field of sex robots has released a new technology development report.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) released a report looking ahead to the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Shaki, an honorary professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the robot’s eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
Shaki said of the new report: "People are laughing behind their backs, but the major companies do launch a lot of sex robots, and we will see more."
Modern sex dolls have evolved from sex dolls to robots, which have silicone skin, are very warm to touch, and deliberately use artificial intelligence to set up human-like sexual reactions.
Users can also “customize” their bots to suit their preferences, from eye color, nipple shape to nail type or color.
But what’s even more disturbing is that many robots with “personality” make “copy wives” look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot can be defined according to the characteristics that the user finds attractive, such as shyness.
There’s also the Roxxxy Gold sex robot, developed by True Companion, which pre-sets character traits, including a slightly shy “cold-flared Fara” and “wild Wendy” of “adventured.”
“Roxxxy Gold robots have the personality to be as worthy of you as possible,” True Companion’s website relishes.
So she loves what you love, and evil you.
She also had a little emotion like a normal person in those days!
She can be lazy, she can be talkative, she can be ‘sexually energetic’!”
The rise of sex robots has caused a lot of unease – not just replacing real human relationships – but also grovelling feminine traits and the cursing rape hints of twitching on Fara in cold air (interpreted as: resisting).
True Companion compares Roxxxy to a man’s shaker on its website.
The site says, “If women have shock sticks, why can’t men have Roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not a simple fetish, nor are they just sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing maturity point to the darker, deeper part of our culture: escaping from perfect gender equality to sex with surrender as an additional option.
Of course, most men do not have sex robots, and although FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the verge of consumer culture.
But what permeates from the edges allows us to see the course of our time.
Many people are not weird and not aggressive until the free market gives them the chance to become so.
It’s no coincidence that these fine sex robots are emerging in an era when women’s rights are under threat, and that the White House and one president have boasted of sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the TV series "The Handmaid's Tale" is not in the realistic picture, not in the hanging body, not in the pair of eyes that have been dug up, but in the excessive real imagination.
The Republic of Gilead was a jump, but it doesn’t seem far away right now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to do everything possible to create the most real female body (although it is in the proportion of porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have a human touch and imitate real human movements.
But to put it bluntly, their “personality” does not represent real women.
They can’t break up, they can’t get out.
They have no recourse to institutions and no follow-up stories, no independence at all, and no possibility of breaking the illusion of total slavery.
In other words, they are sex slaves.
Or according to the popular saying of 2017: the maid.
"Great Wall" tells the story of an ancient Chinese elite force to defend mankind, in the world-famous Great Wall with the monster 饤.
"Run the Brothers" the last part of the fourth season has been recorded, "run men's group" captain Deng Chao on May 30th accepted the Shenyang Evening News, Shenyang network reporter's WeChat interview, from "running men" in the "student" to "scrupult angel" in the "funny villain", and then to "degenerate man" Chen Me, Deng Chao gave the audience the impression of like "variable star", constantly changing.
Deng Chao said, "In the performance, the same thing I will not do, to be constantly updated."
Trump's great achievements?
Let Mitt Romney be the epitome of common sense
Political differences have polarized American voters, and from a micro perspective, American family harmony has been undermined. This is no wonder for the Trump era.
Around Christmas and around Thanksgiving, major newspapers in the United States are filled with the fear of how to vote for Trump's relatives in their comment columns.
It is often assumed that we are doing everything we can to puncture our “filter bubble.”
Less vocal is the power of Trump to bring his family together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, who had a long discord with our Republican family, was coming to New York this week to visit me.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
By working with Trump in the White House, everyone she knew, including Republican relatives who had been in a political squabble for decades, was now suddenly and strangely on the same front.
It's certainly a good thing if it's all at the table. But what strikes me is that from a broader perspective, it can be a big risk.
While the left has long been instigated by Trump, the warping effect of his presidency has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we’re referring to the possibility of worrying about the possibility that his quirky behavior might one day stop.
Yet, in a more worrying long-term scenario, Trump’s “normalization” of relations with right-wing Republicans, who had previously opposed Mr. President’s standards, now suddenly seemed to be a symbol of reason.
I’ve found myself recently on Mitt Romney’s version of the frenzy somewhat nostalgic: putting dogs in cars, with a 14 percent income tax (but at least we know his tax return), for the crimes of these two moves do seem to be too minor compared to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate only needs to be sane enough to make an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin lived in town, we took the kids to the carousel in New York Park, the biggest carousel run by New York’s Central Park administration, and if you don’t need coffee, the three-dollar ticket is your most consumer value in the city.
The sound of the trojan was as loud as thunder, the central cylinder was designed for glass fiber, all the clowns and animals turned their heads, looking terrorarily and sinisterly at their shoulders, while the tingling music was strangely ringing.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: the landscape overlooking high-rises has become old-fashioned, the skyline has become too familiar with the already not-so-greater thrill, and the city’s reality has not supported the dream.
Thirty-five years later, I haven’t completely forgotten that day, when I found out that this “Swiss hut” was not actually a Swiss hut, but a “Ye Olde Swiss Cottage” in the themed bar, which I could not remember, but near a junction in north London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a magical experience, and for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four girls in their 40s can all attend events where everyone has a good time having fun.
If I could evaluate the carousel, I would give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before swiping my credit card, I was asked to rate my transaction “experience” by one to five stars.
The same is true of the coffee shop on the corner of my street, and you can choose to rate it with a 15% tip, which is to buy things on the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down the speed of what should be a neutral transaction, but also to put pressure on the waiter to add personal factors to the unwanted scenario.
The poor woman in the department store smiled apologetically, and I was exhausted, and the credit card experience gave her a five-star rating.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
This is the second time Pistolis has left prison and transferred to hospital.
He was taken to a hospital last year to treat wrist cuts, which prison officials say were caused by his fall in his cell.
After prosecutors appealed the original manslaughter ruling, Pistolis was convicted of murder.
In the early hours of Valentine’s Day 2013, he shot Stingkamp several times through the toilet compartment door at his home in Pretoria, until his death.
Pistorius claims to have mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder hiding in the cubicle at night.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time in the case of a six-year prison sentence against Pistolis, which they consider too benevolent.
The State Prosecutor's Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard this year.
If prosecutors win, Pistorius faces an increase to 15 years in prison.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

Two Bulgarians detained in Greece for illegal camping
The bTV quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying that two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, Sisonia police detained a group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians.
The detainees were released on the same day, and the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed to bTV that two Bulgarians were subsequently released.
Greek authorities have tightened controls on random camping and imposed hefty fines on anyone who rests at a non-designated campground.
The inspection will continue for a season.
The foreign ministry said the court could impose fines on random campers.
On May 18, the Ministry of Finance announced the "Measures for the Management of Special Prizes for the Structural Adjustment of Industrial Enterprises", which will arrange special award and supplementary funds to promote the resolution of excess capacity in the coal and steel industries, with a total amount of 100 billion yuan.
Recently, many local governments such as Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang have successively put forward reform opinions on resolving excess capacity.

Does meat, dairy, and chocolate help alleviate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
Meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But the results of a new study show the opposite: a meat-rich diet with protein and dairy products can help relieve the symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease has a life impact for about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 Britons, leading to stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or hemorrhagic diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington typically recommend that patients avoid eating meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but researchers have found that the protein’s key amino acid, tryptophan, helps boost immune cell growth, and that these cells can improve the tolerance of the gut.
Lead researcher Dr Marco Colonna explained that immune cells patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not sneak into the body.
Maintain a balance between the cells that trigger inflammation and the cells that improve tolerance, protecting the body from damaging all kinds of sensitive and fragile tissue.
When the equilibrium state is too biased towards inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
In experiments, it was found that an immune-promoting cell appeared in mice carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need tryptophan (one of the components of a protein) to form the appearance of a cell.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a link between a bacterial population (Lactobacterium Royce, which is a normal part of the gut microbiota) and the development of a cell population that promotes tolerance.
The more tryptophan mice consume in their diet, the more immune cells they have.
He suggested that if humans use the same approach, i.e., a combination of Lactobus lutyl and a tryptophol-rich diet, it may form a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, who studied an immune cell that improved tolerance, did not have another group of identical strains when she discovered that one group of studied mice had such cells, but the other group of the same strain was not raised separately.
She suspects that this difference is related to the gut microbiome of mice (referring to the communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract).
DNA sequencing of mouse cholesterol found that six bacterial populations were present in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
Rats are raised in a sterile environment, so they lack gut microbes and cannot appear in this immune cell, and the presence of Lactobacterium Lucilla produces immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultured Lactoblastin in a liquid and then transferred a small amount of bacteria-free fluid to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
This immune cell develops into a cell with tolerance.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be proved that the active ingredient is a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, called indoe-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the number of tryptophans in mice’s feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people, like mice, have the same cells that improve tolerance, and most of us have L. lutterilus in our gastrointestinal tract.
Whether humans can induce cell development by-tryphanide products from Lactobia L. lutylc in the body, as in experimental mice, is not yet known, but genetic defects related to tryptophan have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
“The development of these cells may be exactly what we want to achieve, because these cells can control the inflammatory response on the surface of the gut,” she said.
It is not true that high levels of tryptophan present in L. lutteria can lead to an increase in the number of the species.
Jose Mourinho sees Manchester United signing 'genius' Nemania Matic
On Wednesday night, after Neymania Matic made his debut in the Sampdoria match, Mourinho determined that United had signed a "genius" midfielder.
Matic, from Chelsea, signed a gold sum of up to £40m, playing 2-1 in the final pre-season of the league before Dublin's European Super Cup against Real Madrid, winning the favour of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, in the Blues pre-season Asian Tour, Matic's playing was seriously understated, only 45 minutes to complete, and Mourinho admitted that improvements needed to be made before the Premier League season began.
“He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and a genius way of thinking – he thinks about football,” Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get ready as soon as possible."
Mourinho began his starting line-up at the start of the season. Like Matic, new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the match at the Injever Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still wants to bring in three more signing players, but he insists the club "does a great job" and he has four preferred signing players in mind, three of whom the club has brought in.
“The club brought in three of the signing players and I am very grateful,” he added.
"I'd be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they've done a lot for me."
Will China lag behind if it does not build such a warship?
With the recent major naval powers in the world has announced the construction plan of new frigates, as if overnight frigates have become the focus of the Navy of major powers, first Japan in the 2018 annual defense budget to determine the purchase of two new frigates, so that the Japanese DEX frigate plan finally had a substantial breakthrough, and then the United States Lockheed Martin recently announced the latest plan of the United States FFG frigate plan, then China's new frigates where to go?
With the launch of a new Type 054A frigate at the end of 2017, it marks that the 054A frigate has built up to 29 ships, has been close to the sum of the 053H series frigates, and from the first 054A in 2006 to the present, the construction of the 054A has been 12 years, even in the world, the construction of such a large number of high-performance general-purpose frigates, in addition to China, only the United States in the 1970s and 1980s construction of the "Perry" class frigate can be compared.
And why build so many 054As is simple: it is affordable, easy to use, and complementary to the Navy’s debts of years.
054A frigate with high cost performance and good combat effectiveness for many years to get the favor of the Chinese Navy, its displacement of about 4,000 tons, equipped with a 76 mm main gun, 32 units of sea red flag-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missile co-launched vertical system, 8 eagles 83 and a straight-9 helicopter, although it began to build in 2006, the design time is a kind of ship, but its combat effectiveness even today is not too bad, looking at the world's frigates can reach the level.
But after all, this is a type of 21st century design of the ship, the weapon configuration is set aside, its power system and electronic radar equipment and the current world mainstream frigates compared to the existing gap, such as Europe's same type of frigate has been equipped with full electric propulsion, small multi-function phased array radar, large-scale helicopter deck, it is also time to develop a new model.
So how China's new frigates should develop is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic approach of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese navy will be completely blue water navy, and the future will also be to the ocean, with the rapid deployment of areas with close interests in China, showing the existence of force, if necessary, to have a strong combat power to ensure that China's vital interests in the region will not be damaged, so it seems that the new Hu Weijiang will be towards large-scale and ocean-going development.
Looking at the positioning of the new frigate in the future Chinese naval sequence, the future Chinese Navy should be similar to the U.S. Navy, in addition to the necessary offshore defense ships, other main ships will form an aircraft carrier battle group or amphibious assault ship strike group according to the needs of the situation.
The role of the new frigate in the future carrier battle group should act as the anti-submarine main force and the positioning of the hollow and near-regional release, in the amphibious assault ship strike group should act as a escort ship class, then according to the demand for the new frigate must have a strong anti-submarine capability and good medium-range area release capability.
Based on the above positioning, you can boldly imagine the general appearance of domestic frigates in the future.
First of all, the displacement relative to the current 054A frigate will have a substantial increase, it is estimated that the displacement of the new frigate will reach about 5000-6000 tons; the power system will use a QC280 improved gas turbine and two diesel engines composed of an integrated electric propulsion system, the maximum speed is expected to reach about 30 knots, the endurance will also increase significantly; as for the weapon configuration 76 mm main gun and 1130 near fire cannon should be retained, but will increase a red flag 10 launch system, the main gun should have a 32-48 unit.An 8-16 unit of large vertical system should be installed for launching Eagle Strike 18 and a new cruise missile; the hangar and shutdown platform will also increase, reaching the parking and storage of two 10-ton helicopters; for the electronic radar system, the high-end system should be equipped with small four-sided fixed phased array radar based on the 346A, and the low combination can use a multifunctional rotary phased array radar similar to the European frigate.
In this way, the overall level of the new frigate will reach the current world-class level, even if it is not more than the United States FFG.
Of course, the above concept is only the author's conjecture about the domestic new frigate, how can we only wait until the new frigate is launched to find out, let us look forward to it together.

In recent years, the city has encouraged enterprises to actively participate in the construction of national, industry standards and regional group standards, given a reward of 300,000 yuan for enterprises that are the main or participating in the formulation of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards, and awarded 500,000 yuan to enterprises that have passed the Zhejiang manufacturing brand certification, which is the highest amount of the reward in the province, which stimulates the enthusiasm of enterprises to participate in the standard.
A few days ago, Wang Li Group production workshop, the group system responsible person Gao Jian and employees together with the staff is a potter anti-theft security door sealing box packaging, as a participant in the Zhejiang manufacturing group standard standard to meet the standard work sample, ready to send to Shaoxing quality testing center.
Just two days ago, Wang Li has passed the on-site audit of the "Zhejiang Manufacturing" certification expert group.
Gao Jian said that the professional team composed of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations praised the group's achievements in the core aspects of quality excellence and independent innovation, and agreed that it was fully in line with the standard, and that as long as the product passed the inspection, Wang Li will become one of the first enterprises to pass the standard.
Wang Li Group is only a microcosm of the transformation and upgrading of the standard driving industry.
The city and its simultaneous development of Zhejiang manufacturing group standard benchmarking and standard work is also Buyang, Qusheng Group.
Since the Zhejiang manufacturing team standard formulated by the city's anti-theft security industry last year, Xingyue, Xinduo and other enterprises are also actively applying for docking and benchmarking work.

China's household debt rate is close to the United States, more terrible than not being able to afford a home is not being able to pay the debt?
Recently, everyone is discussing what changes in real estate policy has recently, is it real estate policy to relax? land policy supply subject diversification, will the house price decline?
However, when we are worried about real estate prices, worried about macroeconomic regulation, and worried about the future trend of the real estate market, the People's Daily once again wrote, the last time we specifically discussed the "People's Daily" comment on the setting of real estate regulation, and now the "People's Daily" wrote an article on a more serious topic than not being able to afford to buy a house, is even if you can afford to buy a house, still have to get a debt?
Today, we’re going to talk about a bigger problem than buying a house: paying off the loan.
China's Growing Housing Debt Crisis
"People's Daily" published an opinion article on January 17, "Award and Loan: The Joy and Worry of Struggle Youth", according to the data of the article, in November 2017, the "China Deleveraging Process Report of the Third Quarter" released by the National Finance and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Center pointed out that the leverage ratio of the residential sector still continued to rise, from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, up 1.3 percentage points, up 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The proportion of debt in the residential sector in the entire real economy has increased, and the leverage ratio has risen rapidly.
Relevant research shows that the debt of Chinese households in financial institutions is dominated by consumer loans, accounting for about two-thirds of the debt of residents, about twice the amount of operating loans.
Among them, in consumer loans, medium- and long-term loans, mainly housing loans account for about 80%, but from the incremental point of view, short-term consumer loans are growing faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition, China's household debt ratio only counts the total amount of credit received by the family sector from financial institutions, while Chinese families also have many private loans, including borrowing money from relatives and friends, and there is a large-scale hidden debt.
According to statistics from the Suning Institute of Finance, the leverage ratio of Chinese residents was only 3% in 1996 and only 18% in 2008, but the leverage ratio of residents has begun to show a rapid growth trend since 2008, doubling to 36.4% in just six years. By the third quarter of 2017, the leverage ratio of residents had reached 48.6%.
In May last year, HSBC released a survey of tens of thousands of respondents across nine countries.
The report is aimed at “millennial” young people (born between 1980 and 2000) in nine countries.
The report pointed out that China's 80-90s young people's homeownership rate is as high as 70%, far ahead of second-place Mexico (46%), which is also the United States' two-fold level of this indicator (35%).
The data tells us a high-probability problem that Chinese residents are probably unable to pay off their debt compared to the biggest potential “gray rhino” at this stage.
Why is the housing crisis the most serious problem?
As we have analyzed before, although we have been saying that China's housing prices are higher, compared with other countries in the world, China's housing ownership rate is actually quite high, so not so much about high house prices, I am afraid that the question for many friends is that you still have to get a loan?
Throughout the world's real estate market, China's real estate market has started late, and there has been no major real estate crisis except for Hainan, as we said before, but the origin of the 2008 world financial tsunami a decade ago was the real estate crisis in the United States.
The cause of the U.S. real estate crisis is blamed on two houses: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
At that time, in the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold their houses to low-income people in the United States at that time in order to expand sales, and when the U.S. economy was good, the real estate market was also thriving, but the good news was not long, and with the stagnation of growth in the US economy, it caused a decline in the income of home buyers, so a large amount of household consumption expenditure began to decline.
However, the current situation in the United States was an integral part of the financial assets and real estate assets of American household assets, and almost all the household assets of the low-income group in the United States were real estate, while the majority of the assets of the top 20% of the high-income group were financial assets, so the debt ratio of real estate in the poorer people in the United States was the higher.
A serious fact is that these people are buying houses when the economy is better, so the money paid for the mortgage is also calculated by their better income, when the income has declined, the pressure of the mortgage not only did not reduce or even because some subprime plans became floating and increased, so the real estate problems of these American families in this way gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
Therefore, some people because the income is too low to pay the mortgage, so the bank began to recover the property, when the bank from the arrears of the buyers of the hands of the property, they will sell at a very low price, resulting in the region's house prices gradually decline, the process led to a further decline in house prices, the formation of a vicious circle, when the house prices fell to a certain extent, more and more buyers found that their home value has even been lower than their own loans, so there are more people to stop the repayment of mortgages, and caused more bad debts.
Thus, a huge vicious circle is formed:
“The economic downturn – the decline in income – some people can’t afford to pay off the mortgage – the bank sells the homes of the debtors at a low price – the house price falls – more people stop paying the mortgage – the bank sells it again – and the house price falls again...”
And the problem is not more than that, because the price of housing prices continue to fall, we stop the loan to the bank after you do not have debt, if the bank auction house to get the money is not yet you owe the bank loan, then you still need to pay back the money, simply put to say that you used the first payment of 600,000, the loan 2.4 million to buy a house worth 3 million, when the house fell to the house only worth 2 million, you no longer repay the house to the bank, after the bank auctioned the house, you not only lost their own debt of $ 600,000, you still owe the bank.
So, in one vicious cycle after another, the U.S. economy gradually collapsed, which eventually triggered the 2008 financial crisis in the United States.
Therefore, at this stage, China's household debt ratio level reached a high of 46.8% is a very need to be vigilant problem, this data is still lower than the level of developed countries, but the problem has begun to appear, the country from last year began to repeatedly emphasize the problem of deleveraging, this is a very prescient judgment, if the household debt ratio is allowed to continue to climb, it will inevitably lead to huge risks, so to prevent the emergence of financial risks.
So with the fact that the house is used for living, not for speculation, the state has accelerated the establishment of multiple measures such as multi-subject supply, multi-channel security, rent-purchase and mergers and acquisitions to further resolve potential risks.
For our individual families, we must give up real estate speculation, buy a house when the ability to do, to avoid their own family into a huge burden, only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt level is a healthy family wealth development path.

One of the reasons for the delay is that due to the impact of smog weather, traffic control has been implemented in many places, and the capacity is insufficient.
British inventor implants a chip in his body and can enter the house and enter the car with a wave of his hand.
A British inventor installed a chip for himself, just wave a hand to open the front door of his home, enter the office and even start the car, becoming the first person in the country.
Steven Northam, 33, has implanted a small chip between his thumb and forefinger, and is now offering the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, a service that is being implemented by his company BioTeq through technology.
He has teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, a senior consultant at Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure that the implantation process meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to a dog-dog chip implant and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company will also replace the locks of various rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, which costs £300 per lock.
The married father, who has a child, has now installed the technology for his family and his BMW Z4, and he can start the car by simply putting his hands on the steering wheel.

White House tools cost thousands of dollars
According to military records released by Time magazine, the White House decided last month to transport a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the glory of American manufacturing, costing up to $24,000.
The Green-White Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as Marine Corps One at the time of the presidential ride) is an important exhibit on the White House’s July 17 highlights the U.S. construction project.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials have toured manufactured products from all 50 states.
Exhibits include Connecticut-built helicopters, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the record of the first Marine Corps Helicopter (HMX-1) team (HMX-1), which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter, the White House Military Office asked the helicopter to appear on a daily order (FRAGO), that is, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn to participate in the "special" event.
The day before the event, Commander HMX-1, in an email to the superior Marine Corps flight deputy commander, said, “I just want to confirm that you know, because this event is highly valued.”
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive at the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17 to attend the 3 p.m. event and leave after the lawn is emptied from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. that same day.
The information also said that in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, the return flight required the second group of crew members due to the duty time limit.
The original crew was on standby at the helicopter side during the event, while members of the security forces were on standby at the vicinity while the aircraft was on the ground.
The records obtained by Time magazine do not clearly indicate whether a second crew member is needed in the end.
The Hachi Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The records state that HMX-1 had asked whether the event violated the bill.
The commander wrote that “one of the questions we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hachi Act and was told that there was no violation”.
“Sounds like you’re locked up,” the deputy commander replied.
The White House defines the “Made in America” campaign as an official activity and is therefore not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even official events are political.
At the event, the president pursued the Senate’s agenda: health care reform, and touted the control of government regulations.
The use of Marine Corps One or Air Force One for political propaganda purposes is nothing new.
Successive presidents have been required to travel by these planes.
However, it is not common to requisition it for the purpose of taking photos only.
In February, Trump received attention, when in Melbourne, Florida, the presidential plane slowly glided, and finally stopped the background of his first campaign rally, and his Twitter account was full of complaints about the former president's use of the presidential plane.
White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said: "The White House is excited about the 'Made in America' exhibition, which showcases products from all 50 states, which are made by American workers using American materials."
The HMX-1 crew regularly conducts flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn, practicing the accurate placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
During Trump’s G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 practiced 58 landings at the White House.
One official said the U.S.-made event flight was counted in the crew training requirements for this month.
The helicopter also flew an additional 11 hours of “non-presidential support missions” that day.
The White House said taxpayers did not cover the cost of any other items at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging a South Lawn helicopter display.
The HMX-1 does not keep a budget record for the president’s flight, making it very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Department of Defense’s hourly expenses for fiscal year 2017, the VH-3D’s Reimbursable Costs are $24,380 per flight hour.
The troop records recorded a 30-minute flight each time the aircraft flew from a base at the Marine Corps airfield in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower than that.
Walters said: “It is very misleading to estimate the costs incurred by taxpayers based on reimbursable fees.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance and many other sunk costs included in the annual appropriation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the Department of Defense’s reimburseable expenses did not include personnel costs, but did include fuel costs, maintenance and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicke defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to show what America makes this week.
And I know that both the Sikorsky company and Connecticut are proud of it, and they both contribute to our national security, and I suspect that even without thousands of people there are hundreds of jobs to rely on.
And I feel like most Americans, like most Americans, we are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of countless Americans' hard work.
So of course, it is not out of date to show this.”
It’s not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while on the South Lawn tour at the event, but he did get in the driver’s seat of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about the company plane he owned.
He said, "I know the Sikorsky plane very well. I have three."

According to the Market Star, from 2005 to 2011, the GDP of our province was tied for "bottom" from the central to the second place.
But our province's economic growth still has the dilemma of low investment efficiency and lack of core competitiveness in the industrial economy. To this end, the latest issue of the Economic Blue Pages of the Provincial Economic Information Center proposes to improve the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
Based on some representative indicators of the province's economy in 2005 and 2011, it is compared with the whole country and the central region.
In terms of industrial economic benefits, in 2011, in our province accounted for a considerable proportion of industrial energy, raw materials and other high-energy-consuming industries, affected by market fluctuations and overcapacity "double pressure", at the same time, home appliances, automobiles and other leading industries lack of innovation, resulting in meager profits.
A large number of investments have not brought corresponding economic benefits, which is an important reason for the low quality and efficiency of economic growth in our province.
In this regard, experts suggest that effective measures should be taken to encourage enterprise innovation, and the scientific and technological achievements of universities and research institutes should also be "transferred" to enterprises in a timely manner.
For industrial economic benefits are not high, experts said, but also to actively promote industrial mergers and reorganizations, optimize industrial layout, extend the industrial chain.

GMB focuses on investments in the Glasgow plant of McVitie
The union wants the management of the biscuit manufacturer McVitt to guarantee a long-term commitment to production at the Lasgo plant.
The Scottish chapter of the British General Union said the company had been silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory employs more than 500 people and manufactures products such as oat biscuits (Hobnobs) and Rich tea.
Pladis, the owner of the company, said the company has invested more than £5 million in the plant over the past few years.
He added that if there are changes in plant operations, employees and union representatives “will be the first to know.”
In a letter to the company’s director, the Scottish Section of the GATS called on McVeten to “resolve the problem of the unconsultable modernization of the funds on the production line”.
Drew Duffy, senior sponsor of the General Union of Britain’s trade union, said: “We are not able to get a clear picture of Tollcross’s future business needs and investment plans from the plant’s managing director, which has deeply worried our members.
Generations of families work here, and the high concentration of local communities and the Greater Glasgow workforce, are important pillars of high unemployment and social deprivation of decent employment in areas.
Therefore, from the perspective of employment, pay and economic prosperity, in the context of Brexit, rising living costs and a long-term decline in manufacturing, there is an urgent need for the eastern part of Glasgow to expand the production network.”
A spokesman for Plathis said: “The director of Tollcross received a letter from the Scottish Section of the General Union of England yesterday and the company will respond immediately as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the British General Confederation of Trade Unions in Tollcross to discuss some issues publicly.
We had discussions with our employees and then, like all other companies operating in a competitive and economically uncertain environment, we reviewed the ongoing operating model we applied to businesses and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross facility, especially in terms of production lines and operational improvements.
We are fully aware of Tollcross’s historic position as a production site, and if there are any changes in our operations at the plant, employees and union representatives will be the first to know.”

Paris Saint-Germain warned Barcelona three years ago to sign Neymar?
La Liga may regret throwing olive branch on Marco Villati
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up signing Neymar after making a £189m offer to try to get it to exercise the exemption, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago to attack the world record raider?
The sensational approach has opened a summer transfer window, with Ligue 1 clubs ready to break the world's transfer record for more than twice the last transfer record. Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season for £89m.
Once the transfer is complete, Neymar will jump to become the world’s most valuable player and the world’s highest-paid professional athlete, Paris Saint-Germain, to offer a post-tax salary of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are angry about Neymar's attacking approach and the way out, and sources who know the Catalan team's board insist that the club has been doing everything in its power to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the Paris Saint-Germain president make such a prediction to the world of football three years ago?
When City expressed interest in signing Blyce Matedi in 2014, Nasser Alglaifi issued a stern warning to any club that wanted to sign the best player in Paris Saint-Germain.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we’re going to have to fight against them and we’re going to contact their players, too,” Alghelefi said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to sign our players, they have to do it themselves."
The Spanish club appeared to cross the line earlier this summer, with Barcelona throwing an olive branch on Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Villati.
Paris Saint-Germain have made it clear that they will not allow the Italian international to leave at any rate, and Barcelona are likely to be more affected by the loss of the midfield genius Neymar.
