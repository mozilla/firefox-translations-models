The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on the 26th that Iran has begun to use advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, further violating the 2015 nuclear agreement with the world powers.
The IAEA report notes that advanced centrifuges at the Natanz Nuclear Facility at Iran's Natanz Nuclear Facility are "building or are ready to build up to enrich uranium."
Since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal in May and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the 2015 nuclear deal with the major powers.
The agreement stipulates that Iran can only use the first generation of IR-1 centrifuges to extract uranium.
The other signatories to the deal, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to salvage it, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.

The women's volleyball team is expected to defend the World Cup in advance!
On the 27th, in the game against the Dutch women's volleyball team, the Chinese team was won back by the opponent in a row, and finally took a three-way streak to the Netherlands, ushering in nine consecutive streaks.
The World Cup schedule is nearing its end, and although the title is on the horizon, the Chinese women's volleyball team can't be taken lightly in the face of Serbia.
In the first two innings of the match with the Netherlands, the Chinese women's volleyball team's performance was as strong as ever, and the two cities were first set-up with 25: 19,25: 16 respectively, until the third inning, and the team met setbacks.
The Dutch women's volleyball team strengthened the offensive of the serve in the backward situation, and the Chinese team was hit by a pass, and the girls attacked, and the mistakes began to increase, and finally won back a city by the opponent at 21: 25.
Lang Ping also pointed out in an interview after the game: "The third inning, because of the mistake we sent about eight points."
Of course, the strength of the Dutch women's volleyball team should not be underestimated, the Chinese women's volleyball team before the game is also a difficult preparation, although losing a game, but everything is still in the hands of Lang Ping, "and the strong team to win the game is very normal, it is normal to play five innings, so we said to the players to focus," Lang Ping said.
In the fourth inning, the players actively adjusted the state, Zhang Changning in the offensive end of the fire, a single innings to get eight points, for the team to win a lot of success.
So far, the 11-round confrontation is only two rounds left, although the Chinese women's volleyball team has touched the championship trophy, but in the game against the Netherlands team did alarm the alarm bell: the more critical, the more to go all out.
In the other game on the 27th, the Russian and American women's volleyball teams were full of five innings, and the U.S. team failed to take all three points from their opponents, so that the Chinese women's volleyball team can be defended in advance as long as they take all three points against Serbia.
All kinds of situations are moving towards a favorable situation for the Chinese women's volleyball team.
However, although the Serbian team was all short of six mainstays, this does not mean that they will easily give the three points to the Chinese team.
Judging from the current form of the standings, the Serbian team has basically missed the medal, which means that they can "lightly put on the stage" in the match against the Chinese women's volleyball team, put down the burden of hitting the opponent, and the Chinese team is under the pressure of winning the title, but there may be ups and downs.
In addition, the substitute Serbian team is not a "severe slaughter" lamb, before the Netherlands in a battle, the two sides in the battle of the five, Serbia second team finally 3: 2 reversed the Netherlands' main lineup, which can be seen in the depth of its lineage thickness.
Before the opening of the third stage of the game, Lang Ping also said that the two teams are not good to deal with: "The game in Osaka will be very difficult, we still have to be as good as possible, carefully prepare."
Now that the defending horn has been sounded, the game has really entered the "white-hot stage."
On the strength of the lineup, the Chinese women's volleyball team is above the opponent, but only the last is the most important moment, but also to see whether the women's volleyball girls can play the normal level, in the field to release themselves.

On September 24th, the "One Pass on a Ticket to See" Lovely Help the Disabled Event was held in Changsha Orange, and more than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to board the Orangeland Star Cruise Line to enjoy the magnificent scenery of Xiangjiang and jointly celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Most of the more than a hundred disabled people attending the event were on a cruise for the first time.
Fifty-six-year-old Zhao Zhengang is a limb-losing man who rarely goes out because of the inconvenience of mobility on his feet.
He said: "Today for the first time on the cruise, enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Xiangjiang River, feel the pulse of Changsha's development, the mood is very excited, it is unforgettable."
Volunteers from the Fukang Social Work Service Center and the Blue Sky Rescue Team in Changsha City have provided nuanced services for people with disabilities.
Especially for people with serious physical disabilities, volunteers will carry them up and down the cruise ship.
The relevant person in charge of the Fukang Social Work Service Center said that in the past 70 years, with the support of the party and the government, the cause of the disabled in Changsha City has continued to develop and progress, and more and more people with disabilities have truly become participants, contributors and recipients of social and economic development, and caring for helping people with disabilities and caring for supporting the cause of disabled people have gradually become the consensus of the whole society.
The Republic is about to celebrate the 70th anniversary, and the spotlight of the various media is on, so that many ordinary images we do not remember, glittering - it is they that are for our shining days, bringing heat energy to the strands of silk, bringing light source...
However, if the hero walks around, it also seems ordinary as you are like me.
Yuan Longping, deep in rice research, good cultivation of good cultivation all over the world, so that more than a billion people are not hungry and discouraged, the big agri, this is usually like an old farmer who likes to walk in the field; Nanrendong, exhausted to let China's "sky" angry chief scientist, a man, a lifetime, a pot, only do one thing in the mountains of Guizhou, the old man in the mountains of the cold steamed buns, and the old man in the cottage is no more than two ways;The students, in the middle and the west, with a messy white hair, talk about learning to feel, like to laugh; Qin Yi, red half of the sky film artist, after ninety years old, but also for the arrangement of the plateau every bump for six or seven hours, but also happy to dress in the "Best Cat" in the unknown old handmaiden...
They, forekindness, live simple, simple and persistent, as long as they are immersed in the cause of outsiders and their brooms and their own, it is easy to live up, not concerned about the famous reins, rich and prosperous.
Just like Jin Yong's novel, the Shaolin Monastery, the sweeping monk of the castle, although it is a murderous, it is not dazzling, and there is no joy and sorrowful.
Every "sweeping monk", every pair of bare hearts, has a home country behind whichever is my own.
The national responsibility is not only carried on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the palm of hundreds of millions of people.
Once, the words of a female high school student, by netizens crazy, "When the hero passes by, there is always someone sitting on the side of the road to applaud... I don't want to be a hero, I want to be a person sitting on the side of the road launder."
In fact, when a hero and a ovation of the hero, there is no contradiction.
The people who clasped on the side of the road were also passing on the heat and light, and they were also glowing bodies themselves.
Ordinary as you are like me, there are always some opportunities in life, there are some moments, there is a kind of accumulation, is also shaping the appearance of heroes.
Shanghai excellent judge Zou Bihua, shoulder to the judicial reform, but in the annual meeting let the communication room teacher Fu on the stage to tell their own story, a year to send and send countless newspaper letters, from no mistake, "to do a simple thing, is not simple", Zou Bihua led the judges to give applause to the "sweeping monk" style of old hair and hair.
It's a sympathetic relationship between heroes, and it's a hero who applauds another hero.
Sweeping monks have Shaolin Monastery Tibetan Pavilion, Yuan Longping has a vast rice experimental field, Nanren East has a "eye in the sky", Qin Yi has a stage, Zhou Ruchang has a pulpit... Whether to be a hero, not alone depends on their own efforts, to have a good environment and positive incentive mechanism.
For example, "Chinese eyes", now seems to be a myth.
In the 1990s, the Chinese scientific and technological community was still climbing hard, and the novelist Liu Cixin had not yet written "Three Bodies".
At that time, the most cattle "eye", the United States in the valley of Puerto Rico, a single-sided radio telescope in the U.S. island valley, Arecibo, 350 meters in diameter, is considered to be the "insurmountable" world.
At that time, the Chinese radio telescope was not as divided as one-tenth in diameter.
Nan Rendong, who enjoys world-class scientific research conditions and salaries in Japan, insists on returning home and bringing back an almost crazy idea: building a new generation of radio "big telescopes" in China to receive more messages from outer space!
China is a hundred waste, investing a lot of money to play the stars?
The motherland trusts Nan Rendong, and the "Sky Eye" project has opened.
The site was used in 12 years, and the project was inaugurated again and again.
The 500m-caliber "eyes" opened, and China has made it a precedent to follow, "the world's unique big science project."
Therefore, "the sky" is remarkable, the Nanrendong people are remarkable, and the republics with great tolerance and high standing are great.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, the Nanren East has the opportunity to become the liver and courage of the people of the country.
There are young talents, white-haired heroes walk by kindly, there are people in the roadside gently clapping, such a country, very beautiful and harmonious.
Garbage classification education first into Jilin kindergarten environmental protection concept from the doll grabbed
On the 27th, a kindergarten in Jilin City, Jilin Province, conducted a garbage sorting class to teach young children to distinguish between recyclable and other types of garbage.
It is reported that this is the first time that garbage classification has entered the local early childhood education classroom.
Recently, Jilin Province nine departments jointly issued the "Jilin Province to promote the classification and treatment of prelander urban domestic waste work plan."
In 2019, on the basis of the pilot of the compulsory classification of domestic waste in Changchun, the province decided to carry out the classification of domestic waste in prefecture-level cities.
Jilin is one of them.
Through this event, we hope to achieve the effect of driving the family with young children and driving the society in kindergarten, and advocate the concept of environmental protection.
Liu Lijuan, executive director of the Hi Fan Children International Kindergarten, who held the event, said.
On the same day, the director read out the environmental initiative, hoping that the garbage sorting would start with the child.
The children made a small game of garbage sorting after performing the "Low Carbon Bei Bei" dance.
The instructor also issued the "recyclable" and "other garbage" label, suggesting that the children stick the label to the trash can and record the little video when they get home.
Liu Lijuan introduced that the kindergarten has always advocated the concept of low-carbon and green environmental protection, and regularly opened environmental protection lecture halls.
The garbage drop in the park also has a sortable garbage can set up, which is marked with the drop category.
The teacher taught the children what is recyclable garbage.
According to preliminary statistics, Jilin Province in 2018 urban domestic waste generated about 546.52 million tons, all into the domestic waste disposal site for processing.
Among them, sanitary landfill 329.29 million tonnes, incineration 209.23 million tonnes, the comprehensive utilization process is treated with 8.01 million tonnes.
After years of efforts, all cities and counties in the province have the ability to treat domestic waste harmlessly.
In the "Jilin Province Promotion of Land-level Urban Waste Classification and Treatment Work Program", the work plan for the classification of prefecture-level urban waste is clearly required to carry out in-depth activities such as garbage classification into the campus, into teaching materials, and into the classroom, and strengthen the interaction between students and parents by creating works such as garbage classification songs, songs, comics, micro-videos, and achieve the effect of "education of a child, affecting a family, driving a community, and training a new generation of new people".

Chirac's death of political legacy
On the 26th local time, former French President Chirac died at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is in a century of great changes, the many political legacies left by this French politician when he came to power are still worthy of our praise.
Chirac has been the president of France for 12 years in a very personal charismatic fashion.
He has inherited both the spirit of de Gaulle's independence and independence, and his firm support for European integration, and is a representative figure chasing the "European dream."
At the same time, he also strongly advocated the world's multipolarization and multilateralism, and was a strategic politician.
That's why the French press rated him as "a distinguished representative of France on the world stage."
One of Chirac's relished political decisions was against the U.S.-led Iraq war.
Under his leadership, France and Germany have withstood the pressure of the United States and are at the forefront of the war.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the Iraq war would lead to increased terrorist activities and made the world more dangerous.
It later turned out that Chirac's warning was quite right.
At a time when European integration is in a turbulent way and the unilateralism of the United States is becoming more and more prominent, and Chirac is undoubtedly of great implications for strategic thinking and choices about international politics and global affairs.
Chirac is also a French politician who has made the Chinese feel familiar and affectionate.
He is one of the advocates and creators of the "Golden Decade" of China-France relations, and after his first election as the French president in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of China-France relations with the strategic vision of politicians.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges between China and France entered a new stage.
During the reign of Chirac, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and the two countries had made breakthroughs in cooperation in aviation, nuclear energy, railway transportation and other fields.
The Chirac's China-France Cultural Year, which created a new model of cultural exchange in the history of China and France.
Chirac ’ s lifelong love for Chinese culture is particularly impressive.
It is understood that his Chinese diplomats introduced that Chirac could back some of the poems of Li Bai and Du Fu, and even accurately judge the historical years of Chinese bronzes.
"Not to see the pyramids is not really to Egypt, do not see that the Qin figurines have really been to China" - this golden sentence comes from Chirac.
In an interview with Xinhua, Chirac said: “The West has concerns about China ’ s political and social development, the ecological issues arising from China ’ s economic growth, and China ’ s political status in the international arena.
But I have confidence in China.
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is enough to help it build the ideals and values for achieving harmonious development, and assume its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time. "
I also believe that China's renaissance will bring new creative vitality to the world's culture and enrich the world culture.
The Sman is gone, but the political legacy and revelations that Chirac has left for the world will last forever.

The statement, co-sponsored by 40 establishment lawmakers, said that the rights currently enjoyed by Hong Kong are conferred by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, including maintaining the status of the free trade port and the separate customs territory, and entering into bilateral and multilateral agreements in the name of "Hong Kong, China" in different fields such as economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, and sports, and the signing and implementation of bilateral and multilateral agreements.
These rights are not administered by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always strictly abided by international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, discussed with different countries and regions, and participated in many relevant fields.
The statement said that the move of the United States Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committee to pass the relevant bill is not necessary, but only to respond to the call of its bane Hong Kong agent, as a means of grossly interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs and to fight for political chips for its agents in Hong Kong.
The establishment lawmakers expressed deep regret and strongly opposed the move.
The statement noted that Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the largest source of trade surpluses.
Hong Kong's excellent rule of law, a fair and free business environment, and a clean society make it a good location for American businessmen to do business.
If the United States passes this bill, in addition to hitting the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself, it will make China-US relations worse, and have no benefit, and will damage others.
The statement said that Hong Kong will, as always, unswervingly implement the "one country, two systems" policy, continue to enjoy the rights enshrined in the Basic Law and earnestly fulfill its obligations.
Whether past, present or future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and international commerce.
According to the European Times on the 26th, the two houses of the French parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week.
French President Emmanuel Macron recently claimed that France could not "accept everyone", but at the same time he would try to "properly accept".
Macron is trying to find a compromise on immigration matters, slowing the impact of the upcoming debate.
Recently, Macron said in an interview during the general debate of the UN General Assembly in New York that he hoped to have a real "two-pronged" solution on immigration policy to find a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Macron said: "If France wants to be able to properly admit (immigrants), it cannot accept everyone."
Macron cited four priorities of immigration policy: granting asylum as soon as possible to refugees in need of protection; promoting the integration of migrants more efficiently; hosting and protecting all migrants entering French territory; and more efficiently resettle people who entered France illegally and should not stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the "National Medical Assistance" system is the most discussed topic in the past.
Macron said he wanted to be able to "assess" the system, but not to lift it, but to limit it.
After Macron's remarks, Le Pen, leader of the far-right "National Alliance," tweeted that Macron's statement was "empty talk."
Lassher, a right-wing Republican and president of the Senate, also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a "de-escalation" but "face reality" and indirectly criticized Macron.
Valau, a left-wing Socialist lawmaker, believes that France should "accept more and better" on immigration issues, and criticized Macron for "manipulating" the issue.
The new asylum and immigration law, which has been enacted for a year, has led to disagreements within the ruling party, but at the same time is unable to placate the right-wing opposition party.
In the next 2022 election, the topic of immigration policy will once again be the focus of far-right attacks, and Macron needs to make a difference on this issue, but at the same time risking angering leftists within the ruling party.
According to reports, the lower house of the French National Assembly will debate immigration policy from September 30, and the Senate will debate it from October 2.
There are signs that China's A-shares are ushering in a "repurchase tide", and many listed companies have come up with "real gold and silver" to buy back the company's shares.
According to the statistics of financial data service provider Oriental Fortune, as of the 27th, the total amount of repurchase implementation of A-share listed companies in 2019 has exceeded 100 billion yuan (yuan, the same below), far exceeding the data of the same period in previous years, setting a record high in the amount of A-share share repurchase funds.
In this regard, Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Mai Kerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said that the overall valuation of the A-share market this year is low, and the share is repurchased at a relatively low price at a relatively low price, which is conducive to the improvement of the efficiency of the use of funds by listed companies, and also reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage the market value and the abundant cash flow situation, which is conducive to boosting investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the share repurchase system has also promoted listed companies to actively carry out share repurchases.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued the implementation rules for the repurchase of shares of listed companies, providing listed companies with detailed share repurchase norms and guidelines.
According to media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented repurchase plans have been mainly concentrated in the infrastructure industry, real estate industry, information technology industry and electronic equipment manufacturing industry.
In addition, from the perspective of the amount of repurchase payment, six listed companies have repurchased more than 1 billion yuan this year.
Among them, the first place is Yili shares, and its repurchase amount is more than half a billion yuan.
What impact will the repurchase of shares in public companies have on the market?
Zhao Xijun, vice dean of the School of Finance and Finance of Renmin University of China, said in an interview with the China News Agency that on the one hand, the repurchase shows that listed companies have strong economic strength and good financial situation, and have the ability to maintain the stability of stock prices and give investors confidence; on the other hand, it also shows that listed companies and their controlling shareholders are responsible to the company, are responsible for the market and responsible for investors.
The former is based on the company's good operating performance, and the latter requires listed companies and their controlling shareholders to have higher quality.
For the capital market, this is the core of the basic elements.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence and exerting a supporting effect on the stock price of listed companies.
According to the Oriental Securities Research Report, according to the number of projected stock repurchases set by A-share listed companies since the beginning of this year, as well as the average price of the repurchase of shares, the incremental funds brought by the repurchase of shares for the A-share market this year are expected to break through the 15bn yuan.

Wang Boxiang, Secretary of the Party Committee of Shandong Yuan Shouguang County - Qiang County Rich People's Heart - Xinhua Network
Wang Boxiang, Shandong Shouguang, born in February 1943, participated in the work in 1967, and has successively served as the Secretary of the Township Party Committee, the Secretary of the County Party Committee, the Mayor and so on.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang was the secretary of the Shouguang County Party Committee of Shandong Province, when Shouguang was the poor county of Weifang.
In the five years of Shouguang's tenure, Wang Boxiang has the heart of the people and concentrated his efforts to do three things: one is to promote the industrialization of vegetables; the second is to develop the Shou North Salt Alkaline Beach; the third is to lay the foundation for the industrial rollover, so that the Shouguang people have since bulged their pockets and stood up the waist plate.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables, and there are lessons to grow vegetables.
In the early 1980s, the shoguang farmers planted a good harvest but could not sell, rotting in the ground.
Wang Boxiang Research found that the key to catching vegetables is to do a good job in circulation.
Shouguang took the lead in building a wholesale vegetable market, which kicked off the development of a market economy.
Party members and cadres should take the lead and mess up, and all the losses in the county bear.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Boxiang, 17 party members such as Wang Leyi, Sanyuan Zhu Village, set up 17 winter-war-warming vegetable greenhouses, and 17 "double yuan households" emerged in the village that year.
Subsequently, the county set up a promotion group, under the mobilization of Wang Boxiang, Wang Leyi to tour in various townships; the first year to promote more than 5000 vegetable greenhouses, after which the vegetable greenhouses such as the trend of the prairie to the whole county and even the whole country.
For thousands of years, Shoubei's 1.1 million acres in addition to the saline flats, is the shallow beach coating.
The local people ’ s lives are very difficult.
Shounan has a vegetable greenhouse, what about Shoubei?
Wang Boxiang organized more than a hundred thousand people to engage in a conference war, camped on the alkali beach, and did it for forty or fifty days.
Wang Boxiang and the leading cadres in the county eat and live on the site, as the migrant workers push the car to pick, the wind and sleep, the people see them all stretch their thumbs, and the eyes of the heart admire... At that time, Shoubei developed a 150,000 acre shrimp pond, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and developed a "polypot pot" on the salt-altide beach.
In July 1986, Wang Boxiang participated in the Weifang Municipal Industry Conference for the first time as the county party secretary.
During the meeting, a "digital comparison of industrial economy in the twelve counties of Weifang City" was issued, which at first glanced the total industrial output value, Shouguang is good, ranking fourth.
But if the original salt is removed, the pure industrial output value of Shouguang is only 1.19 billion yuan, ranking third in the penultimate.
Wang Boxiang took more than 70 people to the passage regiment and ran to the field to "change their brains."
After coming back less than a year, the county invested 1.5 billion yuan and went to 77 projects.
Since then, every year, the "judgment group" has been organized to learn from Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai.
Shouguang lacks businesses, and there is more lack of entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang presided over the convening of a special meeting: in the county to openly select the manager of the factory manager, 40 "careful people" stand out, was pushed on the industrial front line.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the hundred-strong county in the country, and Wang Boxiang was transferred to the deputy mayor of Weifang City.
What he left behind was more than 200,000 vegetable greenhouses, which are 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, 4854 enterprises, and more than 100,000 "million yuan households", and are the cadres recognized by the people.
On September 26th, local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presided over the meeting of foreign ministers of China and the Security Council of African member states at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The meeting was attended by the current African Security Council Foreign Minister Tano, Foreign Minister Oyono, Foreign Minister of Equatorial Guinea, Foreign Minister Pandor of South Africa and Foreign Minister Kara, Minister-General-elect of Niger, and Tunisian Foreign Minister Jessinawi.
Wang Yi put forward four suggestions on strengthening China-Africa cooperation in the Security Council.
First, by unity.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, and the direct consequence is that the basic norms governing international relations are challenged, and the role of the United Nations has been affected, which has damaged the interests of developing countries and small and medium-sized countries, including African countries.
To meet this challenge, it is necessary for China and Africa to shoulder and shoulder to shoulder, so that unity can only be empowered.
In the Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, and the focus is not just three votes, but the entire African continent.
China and Africa stand together, not just 4 votes, but will lead other countries to follow suit, influence and shape the agenda of the Security Council.
Since 2018, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council, which should be fully utilized.
Second, by consultation to solve disputes.
China has always advocated the political settlement of hot-button issues, has a good tradition of consultation in Africa, and has the experience of successful mediation by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex challenges on the Council ’ s agenda, in particular the African hotspots, are mostly the root causes of colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.
We must make good use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and play a good role in the role of the United Nations in good offices and mediation.
Third, self-reliance.
African countries and people know best about Africa's problems, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
The Security Council, dealing with hot-button issues in Africa, should focus on listening and respecting Africa's will, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is willing to strengthen coordination with Africa and firmly promote capacity-building for Africa's autonomous peace operations.
Fourth, by development.
Both China and the vast number of African countries are developing countries. We must adhere to putting economic and social development first and supporting each other's chosen development path.
China is willing to jointly build the Belt and Road Initiative with the AU's Agenda 2063, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries enhance their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflict.
We must jointly promote the United Nations to increase its investment in Africa.
China has made every effort to provide human and material assistance to the United States, and is willing to coordinate its actions with African countries to mobilize the United Nations and the World Health Organization to increase assistance and play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Zhang Hong introduced, at present, the city is organizing the implementation of intelligent transformation projects 373, the plan to invest a total of 297.6 billion yuan, Hongxin communication Huzhong's first 5G intelligent production line, Motorola national leading intelligent mobile phone production line, Wuhan Siemens transformer digital unmanned factory, aerospace industry's first batch of satellite production line, backhengsheng biological world-leading new veterinary drug intelligent production line, Obang smart home Internet of energy intelligent production line and a number of industry-leading intelligent workshop and smart factory have been started construction.
In addition, Wuhan has also increased financial and financial support for intelligent transformation projects.
Among them, including the implementation of intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises, according to its actual completion of investment; including equipment hardware investment, R & D soft investment, to give 8%, up to 20 million yuan of transformation subsidies.
At the same time, financial institutions such as the Wuhan branch of the joint transaction bank and the Zhejiang Commercial Bank Wuhan Branch provide personalized financial services for the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises, and vigorously alleviate the pressure on corporate financing.
Trudeau's "people collapse", he can still be re-elected?
This time, Trudeau stumbling out of the "big pit", it was Trudeau himself who dug a little bit.
Recently, the Canadian media has successively exposed an old photo of current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and in the photo, Trudeau dressed as a black man.
This is considered to be a clear act of racial discrimination, which immediately caused uproar in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, Canadians are not buying it.
Trudeau was a stone and smashed his feet.
As the political critic Riley et al. pointed out, since the rise of the "anti-blackface movement" from the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been high-profile accusations that opposition parties or dissenters in this regard have been "broadly" in this regard, and repeatedly threatened that "no matter who makes this mistake should be expelled immediately."
In simple terms, this time, Trudeau stumbling out of the "big pit", it is Trudeau himself who dug a little bit.
Trudeau is the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, young and handsome, and when he first made his debut, he scraped a whirlwind of "political icons."
He was originally a "political amateur", after taking over as the leader of the Federal Liberal Party, and a beautiful battle was played in the 2015 Canadian federal legislative elections - the Federal Liberal Party held more than half of the seats in the lower house of the Commonwealth, gaining the right to hold a separate cabinet.
At that time, Trudeau put forward many deafening political platforms and ideas, such as "ethnic and gender equality", "ecological and environmental protection" and "economic revitalization", emphasizing the elimination of corruption and "undue wind".
However, in the past five years in power, he has been trailing in almost all of the above aspects, "opening down".
Taking the issue of "ethnicity and gender equality", leaving aside the "blackface" incident, he has previously "passed off" on a series of questions about indigenous people, which has allowed indigenous groups and chiefs to move protest tents to the gate of Parliament on the 150th anniversary of the founding of Canada.
In terms of eliminating corruption, at the end of last year, Trudeau was involved in the boiling "Lan Wanling Incident" at the beginning of last year.
It was exposed, and the major violation of the "Lan Wanling" case of the construction company in his hometown, pressured the departments and officials responsible for investigation and punishment, and demanded that the latter "raise the noble hands".
Moreover, after the incident, Trudeau was angry at the disclosure of the evils, Wang Zhoudi, who mentioned the above-mentioned case, is the first to disclose the case and directly handle the case of Canada's attorney general.
Although the case itself is doubtful, its suspicion is difficult to wash.
Many observers pointed out that Trudeau's five-year collapse, mainly caused by his "swing pit", and the biggest "pit" is the "tiger tail", "self-inflicted" and "wide self-discipline, strict" three.
Canada's most authoritative Angus-Red poll shows that since 2015, respondents who support Trudeau have slipped from more than 60% to more than 30%, but their opponents have soared from less than 30% to more than 60%.
Although other opposition parties and their party leaders have not performed equally well, even if a significant number of voters who are still willing to vote for the Federal Liberal Party, they are now dismissive of the federal prime minister and the leader of the ruling party.
On October 21st, the new federal legislative election in Canada is about to begin, and can Trudeau repeat the repertoire of the big victory five years ago?
The answer may be a word: hard.
Both from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or from the level of regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration, have far-reaching impact and positive significance.
On September 25th, Beijing Daxing International Airport officially opened.
Beijing News reporter learned from the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission that the capital airport is in a state of supersaturated operation, and the opening of Daxing International Airport will enhance the capital's aviation service capabilities.
After Shanghai, Beijing has become the second city in China to have two airports, and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport mainly serves domestic aviation affairs, Pudong Airport is mainly similar to international shipping aviation, the future capital airport and Daxing Airport will also serve the differentiated positioning of domestic and international aviation business, to provide more segmented services.
Daxing Airport navigation, from the perspective of business development, is more of a positive impact on the capital airport.
Capital Airport's passenger throughput exceeded 100 million in 2018, ranking first in the country, but there is still a significant poor capacity compared to the rapidly growing business needs, especially the demand for international routes has a large gap.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passenger tourism, travel, etc., and adapt to the urban development trend of Beijing's increasingly open and international standards, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub airport, and plans to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million passengers and the throughput of four million tons of mail in the future.
Therefore, the positioning of the two airports does not overlap, and it also has sufficient market space for different customer bases.
From the perspective of economic accounts, the navigation of Daxing International Airport will obviously form a win-win effect, ease the tension of Beijing's aviation capacity, accelerate the growth rate of passenger and cargo throughput, and create an incremental cake for the dual-core operation of the capital's aviation.
From the user point of view, with the navigation of Daxing International Airport, the future does not have to be concentrated in the capital airport travel, can also reduce the route too concentrated to bring a series of problems, such as the long-term service of the station, the slow flight speed of passengers, indirectly increase the stranding time of the aircraft and passengers in the airport, increase the burden of airport operation, through the capital airport shipping burden, in fact, also improve the passenger travel experience.
According to the media to go to the large international airport a variety of transportation routes time and cost calculation, such as from the south five ring departure Beijing high-speed high-speed road to Daxing airport high-speed, driving 50 minutes can be to reach, oil money back and forth about 40 yuan, high-speed cost 15 yuan; and choose the rail transit subway Daxing airport line, according to the distance to 20km, 30km as the limit, the fare is divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan yuan.
In general, the public to Daxing airport has a variety of transportation options, and the cost and time are also within a reasonable range.
From the perspective of trend development: Daxing Airport is positioned as a transportation hub for Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, so it is a little far away from the city of Beijing, but it strengthens the radiation for Hebei and Tianjin, which facilitates more people's travel, which is of great significance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, passengers from Hebei and Tianjin can enjoy more international air line services provided by Daxing International Airport, which can be seen in the traffic planning of Daxing Airport.
Daxing Airport's supporting transportation facilities are very well, in addition to the new airport line of Beijing's direct to Daxing Airport, there are a number of highways connecting Daxing Airport and the surrounding area.
This is just as passengers in Guangdong Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other cities can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport through the highway such as Guangfu and Guangshen, and residents of Beijing's Langfang and Xiong'an New Area will also benefit from Daxing Airport to obtain convenient and efficient air services.
It can be seen that Daxing International Airport's navigation, not only to increase a few runways and a few aircraft, whether it is from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience level, or from the regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration level, has far-reaching impact and positive significance, not only related to the long-term layout and development of Beijing's shipping industry, to provide diversified options for the travel of the vast number of residents of Beijing-Tian-Hebei, to promote the quality of service quality of the Beijing-Tian-Hebei industry, more conducive to promoting the development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integration process, stimulating the economic and economic development of the surrounding areas of Daxing Airport.
Therefore, for the navigation of Daxing Airport, we must not only count the small accounts of individuals in the economy, but also count the big account of the overall development.

Vietnam Economic and Social Issues Forum Held in Chengtian Hue Province
Deputy Director of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, Nguyen Dejian, said that at the beginning of this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new improvements and continued to grow.
The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first few months of 2019, and proposed measures for economic and social development at the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the forum, the participants exchanged in-depth views and views on the economic development situation and the impact of some free trade agreements in 2019, some outstanding issues of Vietnam's economy in 2019, outstanding issues in Vietnamese social culture in 2019, and forecasts and suggestions for Vietnam's economic and social development in 2020.
Delegates generally agreed that in the first few months of 2019, the global economic growth slowed, and the risks and challenges increased.
Trade frictions between major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) determined that despite the uncertainty of the global economy, with 70% of the world's economies falling into stagnant growth, Vietnam's economic development has achieved many gratifying achievements, macroeconomic smooth operation, and effective control of inflation. The consumer price index of residents increased by an average of 2.64% in the first half of 2019, the lowest increase in nearly three years.
GDP grew 6.76% in the first half of 2019, although it was lower than the 7.05% of the same period last year, but the increase was still a high level compared with the level of the same period in the period 2011-2017.
In making a forecast of Vietnam's economic development trends in 2019-2020, Deputy Director of the Vietnam National Center for Economic and Social Forecasting said that in the context of world economic turmoil, Vietnam's economy showed a high growth momentum in 2019.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macro-economic system will continue to remain basically stable, the implementation of various free trade agreements will boost trade development, and the improvement of economic restructuring and business environment will be further strengthened. Due to the impact of trade frictions, Vietnam's foreign export activities will show a downward trend.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring and forecasting early warning mechanism, take the initiative to find trade remedy measures for Vietnam's export commodities, find opportunities to expand new export markets, and create convenience for the export of various commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, the inflation rate is controlled at a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of auxiliary industries and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and ecological agriculture.

Witnessing the decade of digital China in the small town of Yunqi - Xinhua
If the 2009 local website forum is the original point, the 2019 Cloud Ping Conference, which was held in Hangzhou from 25 to 27, has gone through a full decade.
From the concept of "cloud in the cloud" to the practice of "cloud", big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies to support China's economic development, social management, and public services in the past decade.
In the Zhengtai new energy photovoltaic cell workshop in Haining, Zhejiang Province, the quality inspector has a number of new "colleagues" loaded with Aliyun artificial intelligence next to the nearest quality inspector.
It is 24 hours, the recognition speed is more than twice that of manual, and the quality inspection accuracy is stable at more than 95%.
According to the company's head, the "quality inspector" with the camera has focused on learning more than 40,000 defective samples, and with the cloud computing power behind it, it can quickly convert the infrared image into a binary language, and will have the defective battery sheet classification.
The company is just a microcosm of today's cloud computing-powered manufacturing transformation.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the "Guidelines for Promoting the Implementation of the Enterprise Cloud (2018-2020)", proposing that by 2020, we will strive to achieve a significant increase in the awareness and enthusiasm of the enterprise on the cloud, and significantly improve the proportion of the upper cloud and the depth of application.
Wang Jian, founder of Aliyun, said that today, data-centric cloud computing has built a bridge for data for the digital economy of key elements and opened the way.
At the same time, in the past decade, the scale of China's cloud computing industry has also continued to expand.
The "White Paper on Cloud Computing Development (2019)" released by the China Information and Communications Research Institute in July this year shows that the overall market size of China's cloud computing reached 962.8 billion yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2% from 2017.
In addition to becoming a key technology to support industrial transformation and digital economy development, the invisible "cloud" has also unknowingly changed urban management and social life.
At this year's Yunqi Conference, the "urban brain" that has been unveiled for three consecutive years is still interesting.
At present, the urban brain has become the center of urban management from transportation governance tools, and the relevant cooperative applications have expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithm, urban brain through powerful computing power, so that "park first pay", "the number of people in real time perception", "tourism route design" and other new city management service functions can be realized.
In the field of government services, with "a cloud" docking "one thing", the "hands-on office" and "hands-on" will be promoted in a coordinated way, and cloud computing has brought convenience to the supply of government services at both ends.
At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform in the province through the government cloud.
As of September 11, this platform has covered more than 15 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province, and has collected the governance of 3066 class 1190.8 billion data.
The average monthly call and shared data between the Zhejiang provincial government departments has reached twelve million times, and the flow of data every time the 'cloud' is called, which may mean that the masses do less running errands.
Make tea with plastic tea!
According to the Central News Agency, a recent Canadian study found that a packet of plastic tea bags may release billions or even tens of billions of plastic particles, which is significantly higher than the amount of microplastics estimated that a person's annual intake of microplastics is not available, but there is no evidence to show that ingesting plastic particles can pose a threat to humans.
According to reports, researchers at the University of Magill University in Canada found that immersion plastic tea bags into a cup of almost boiling hot water (Celebration 95 degrees Celsius), and the tea bag will release about 116 billion plastic particles and 31 billion smaller nanoplastics into cups.
This amount is significantly higher than the amount of microplastics an estimated amount of microplastics a person per year.
According to the research published earlier in 2019, people generally eat at least 50,000 microplastics a year and inhale the same amount of microplastics.
It is reported that the study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, where researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in the Montreal Store and Cafe, opened the tea bag, and immerged the tea bag in the almost boiling water for five minutes, and analyzed with electron microscopes and spectrometers.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 116 billion plastic particles, "several years higher than the plastic load of previous foods."
Most of the tea bags are made of natural fibers, but many tea bags that use natural fibers are still used to seal the bottle.
Some branded tea bags no longer need paper to use plastic instead of plastic, and these plastic tea bags are the test subjects for researchers.
Plastic particles are tiny fragments of plastic, which the researchers define is between 100nm and between 100nm and 5cm, and is mainly produced by the breakdown of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and the most deep-sea trenches around the world, and can also be found in running water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
In October 2018, the researchers first found microplastics in human stool samples in several countries in different regions of the world.
To test the potential toxicity of the tea bag release of microplastic particles, the Canadian team put fleas into contaminated water, finding that microplastics can affect the behavior of these fleas and allow them to develop deformities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that ingesting plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO notes that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread to the environment and what impact they have on humans.
The researchers speculated that the reason these tea bags release large amounts of plastic particles, which may be due to contacting boiling water in these plastic tea bags, which may break down or seep toxic substances even when "edible grade" plastic is heated to above 40 degrees Celsius.
Guterres said the climate emergency is the biggest threat to the survival of small island nations.
There, a natural disaster erodes the development gains of a generation.
The devastation in Babuda, Dominica and the Bahamas, which have been hit by hurricanes so far this year, is illustrated by the devastation.
Approximately a quarter of the people in small island developing States live in places at an altitude of 5m or less.
The relocation could seriously affect their social and lifestyles and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At this Monday's Climate Action Summit, small island nations are working together to achieve carbon-neutral 100% renewable energy by 2030, which they are once again leading the world in the right direction.
Guterres said: “The climate crisis is piling new injustices on top of old ones.
Although small island developing States have little contribution to global warming, they have paid the highest price.
Because of the middle-income status of these countries, many countries are also in a cycle of disaster and accelerated debt and unsustainable debt.
The world must act, and it is time for the time to take major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States. ”
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for help in small island developing States to manage disaster risk, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and ways to transition to renewable energy; and urged international institutions to help small island developing States, especially debt-laden middle-income countries, access to funding.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of the protection and preservation of the lifeblood of the Earth.
The latest special report, released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, confirms that the oceans have suffered the severe consequences of the "engulfing" climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, many regions may have seen some extreme sea-level rise that would have occurred once a century.
The report warns that some island nations are likely to become uninhabitable if they don't invest a lot of money in adaptation.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused huge losses.
In the last 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, and in the last 40 years, plastic pollution has increased tenfold.
Demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to reduced resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.
Small island states are also facing high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, leaving them affected by price fluctuations.
Some countries are also working to address the security impact of illicit trafficking in persons, weapons and drugs.
Guterres said: "By addressing one problem in the most challenging environment, this problem can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with the tools, lessons learned and examples that can be used worldwide. ”
He stressed that small island developing States were a special case for sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
India ’ s finance ministry says the financial system is liquid enough.
India's Finance Minister Sitharaman said on the 26th that the current financial system is well liquid, and the growth rate of India's economy is expected to recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by festive consumption demand.
Sitharaman made the remarks after meetings with representatives of Indian private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks and others.
Sitharaman did not say what was targeted.
Previously, some Indian media and overseas media blamed the continued slowdown in India's current economic cycle on liquidity constraints from non-bank financial institutions.
Sitharaman cited the decline in car sales as an example, negating that tight liquidity is the main reason for the decline in sales.
Sitharaman pointed out that the decline in car sales is mainly due to cyclical factors.
Sitharaman expects that, driven by festive consumption, India's economic growth may recover in the second half of the fiscal year.
India's annual shopping season begins in September and will continue until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping consumption will greatly boost India's economic growth.

“Some over-age migrant workers are estimated to account for more than half of those on some sites.
Where to find young workers?
There is no way to use so many 'old people' on the site, there's no way. "
Recently, for the construction site there are many over-age migrant workers (beyond the retirement age) phenomenon, for many years in the construction industry as a project contractor Zou Kui lamented.
Recently, the author's university to carry out rain and sewage diversion project, there have been a lot of migrant workers on the campus, if you pay attention to observation, you will find that there are a lot of over-age migrant workers in this area.
Over-age migrant workers are not "not idle", but because they are "not idle", with "have to be so" helplessness and hardship - whether it is saving money to solve their own pension and medical problems, or to help their children, they are driving these old people who should have been "sleeping down" to continue to work hard.
The "old age" of over-age migrant workers is not as easy as we think.
Raising children, supporting the elderly, reading for the children, helping the children to build a building and buying a car, helping the children to start a family, and raising the grandchildren over generations, when these migrant workers have completed the "life task", the money bags have been hollowed out and even have a lot of debt, and most of them lack wealth accumulation.
In order not to drag down the children and save some wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "doing it until you can't do it."
Many of the new generation of migrant workers who are "post-80s", "post-90s" and even "post-00s" are reluctant to engage in difficult, labor-intensive secondary or low-end service industries, resulting in structural "labor shortage", these lack of attractive jobs provide opportunities for over-age migrant workers.
Due to the lack of a skill, physical function and labor capacity have declined, and many over-age migrant workers are working hard with high intensity, low income, high risk and little security.
To be able to do a day is a day, can earn a little more is a little, "can not be idle" behind the survival dilemma of over-age migrant workers, can not be ignored and ignored.
To solve the problem of unpaid wages and pay, improve labor protection, reduce security risks, increase labor income, and improve the survival of over-age migrant workers, in addition to their "self-redemption", it is also inseparable from the institutional protection and humanistic care of the public sector.
Some scholars have pointed out that over-age migrant workers are no longer likely to rely on going home to solve their own problems of old age and medical care, and they must adopt other means to feed their families.
Reading the helplessness and strength of over-age migrant workers "not being idle" will help us to better understand the love and pain of over-age migrant workers.
Seeing the backs of over-age migrant workers, hearing their sighs, trying to find ways to get back to the countryside, they really achieve "old-fashioned dependence", and need the public sector, markets and society to share responsibilities in a benign interaction, and need to work together.
Chemezov said that Russia will not export this system for the next five years, because "the first is to supply its own troops, and then export production will be carried out."
This approach is in full compliance with international practice.
The major producers of arms and military equipment always ensure their national defense needs first before they process export orders.
Earlier, General Utiliser, deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian Space Force, said the development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by the "Diamond-Antai" space defense Kangzen.
This is a new generation of air defense systems that are used to work on the working principle of destroying ballistics and aerodynamic targets.
The main role of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles with a range of 3500km.
In addition, depending on some information, the S-500 can also destroy hypersonic cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles that exceed five times the sound speed, and even be located near-space targets.
This weapon can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defense systems, especially the S-400 system, which is very important from a defense perspective.
Sergei Chemezov expressed particular concern about the S-400.
He said the system is currently in great demand in the world, but Russian forces also need it, which includes in the Arctic.
S-400 air defense systems are in service to the Arctic Air Defense Regiment.
According to the September 15 news, work on the modification of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system by the Arctic Air Defense Corps of the New Earth Island has been completed.
This is not Russia's militarization of the Arctic.
The Russian Defense Ministry said that this is entirely within the transition plan to more advanced defense tools in the strategic direction of the north.
According to the news service of the Russian Northern Fleet, “With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controllable airspace in the Arctic region has increased significantly. ”
It is very important that, according to the military's assessment, the system was successful in the use of the Far North and Arctic.
The Air Defense Corps officers trained the new system and prepared them on combat duty.
Previously equipped there was a S-300 long-range air defense system, which is still kept a part of it.
When it comes to air defense systems, they must have weapons capable of destroying various aerial targets, whether it is targets at high altitudes or those close to protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph, developed by the Golden Diamond-Antai Aerospace Space, is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other aerial attack weapons.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic target within a range of 400km and shoot down a ballistic target flying at a distance of 60km per second.
Russia has never concealed that it will supplement the deployment of air defense forces in the far north to ensure the security of the airspace of the northern sea.
Not long ago, the first 12 sets of "Tor (Tor) - M2DT" air defense systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, and they were enough to form an air defense battalion to strengthen the Arctic's air defenses.
At that time, the Russian Defense Ministry said that the Arctic "Tor" forces will be expanded to complete the brigade formation in the future.
Coupled with the newly deployed S-400 long-range systems on the New Island and the Kola Peninsula, as well as the "Pantsir) - SA" short-range system deployed in the far north, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons powerfully defend Russia's polar skies.
Enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles will find it difficult to break through this defense.
According to the Russian government's idea, the flagship store will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complicated and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
As the operator of Russian goods stores, the Russian-pind multi-company focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
Russian Pins have online stores on China's largest trade platforms such as Tmall, JD (JD) 1688, Pinduoduo, Hand Q (ShouQ), and multi-functional instant messaging software WeChat (Wechat), and have its own online platform Epidoo.com and the Russian commodity retail chain.
The Russian Export Center will work with Russian products to develop store marketing strategies and participation standards, and screen virtual shelves for product companies.
The store plans to open before the end of the year and set up at least 10 Russian manufacturers' products.
According to the Russian Export Center, the total monthly visit of China's e-commerce platform is as high as one billion times.
At the same time, food exports to China have been showing steady growth since 2014, with more than $1 billion in 2018.
Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores within the framework of the global import strategy to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.
According to Alexei Kozhevnikov, the new store will display the goods of companies with sales of at least half a billion rubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and sales of half a billion rubles are not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers' attitude towards Russian goods is quite positive, and it is regarded as a high-quality and green environmental protection product. "
Kezvnikov said that the competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and intensifying.
“Our goal is ambitious and to launch 500 businesses through this store within three years, ” he said.
At the same time, the platform will also put the products of enterprises in the Russian Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor in the Trade Policy Foundation Department of the Plekhanov University of Economics in Russia, said: “This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export center is a state-owned, not private institution. ”
“I don ’ t see a lot of very competitive Russian goods in the market. ”
He thinks the project will most likely not actually be implemented, but it will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to RIA Novosti, Andrey Slepnev, president of the Russian Export Center, said on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum that the product information of more than 1, 170 Russian companies has been released on the largest international wholesale online platform, Alibaba.com, and can be purchased in both China and other countries.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, where experts from Taobao University are training Russian companies, and its first seminar has been held in July this year.
In November this year, the Russian Export Center at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai will also serve as an organization for Russian companies to participate in industry exhibitions and business projects.
A large-scale exhibition will be held in the 1000m2 exhibition hall, which will also serve as a center for commercial project activities, signing ceremonies, promotion meetings and talks with representatives of Chinese enterprises.
About 50 applications have been received from Russian agribusinesses.
The Russian Export Center Information Service said: "In addition to the agricultural booth, we will definitely hold a business meeting, that is, arrange direct contacts between entrepreneurs."
“This is another direction we ’ re working towards supporting businesses and ensuring that dozens of special meetings are arranged for them. ”
In addition, the expo will host a masterclass, a cooking contest and a Russian food tasting for famous Russian chef cooking in the Shanghai station of Russian cuisine.

Xinhua Time Review: Unswervingly take our own path
The white paper "China and World in the New Era" released on the 27th answer: In the past 70 years, the fundamental reason for China's development has been successful in the past 70 years, and under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the right development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and have been unswervingly following this path.
China takes the path of development that suits its own development, and is the choice of history and the choice of the people.
In modern times, in the environment of poverty and weakness and internal and external troubles, generations of benevolent people have sought to find and go up and down in order to find the way to save the country and save the people.
However, “constitutional monarchy, restoration of the imperial system, parliamentary system, multi-party system, presidential system have all been, tried, the results will not work. ”
It was not until there was the Communist Party of China and a new China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The road out of China is the road of happiness for the Chinese people, the road of rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the common path of China's common development with other countries in the world.
It is precisely because of the right path that China can do its own thing well, and it can become the world's second largest economy and the country that has the greatest contribution to global economic growth, so that it can continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As pointed out in the white paper, China's development path, in line with China's national conditions and adapts to the requirements of the times, will increasingly show bright development prospects as the times progress.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how easy it is to find the right path; looking around the world, the Chinese people cherish this right path more.
The Chinese people know the truth of the southern 橘北枳, and understand that the right for others is not necessarily suitable for themselves, and only the right for themselves is the best.
It is with this path of self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created a miracle of world attention.
In the tortuous process of human progress, the "final conclusion of history" has been famous for a moment.
Today, the success of the socialist road with Chinese characteristics has proclaimed the end of the "end of the historical conclusion", the collapse of the "China collapse theory", and the failure of "socialism failure".
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries to achieve the prosperity of the rich and the people, expanded the way for developing countries to modernize, and provided experience and reference for those countries and nationalities in the world who want to accelerate their development and want to maintain their independence, and take the path in line with their own national conditions.
The world is rich.
China has always respected the right of all countries to choose a development path that suits their own national conditions.
China does not "input" the foreign model, nor "exports" the China model, but will unswervingly follow its own path, realize its own continuous development, strengthen exchanges with other countries in governance, and make due contributions to the common realization of good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that the owner of a Foodworks supermarket fired an 66-year-old female worker by text message because he was more willing to hire an employee from an Asian background, and the boss's approach was slammed as "shameful."
The committee said that the way Ms. Gail Ayton, who has worked at the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, is "extremely unfair" in the way that Eddie treats employees and may have violated anti-discrimination laws.
Ms Ayton told the committee that Mr Wang took over the store in 2016 and that he had always "wanted to fire me" because she wasn't Chinese.
In this case, the vice chairman of the committee, Peter Sams, conducted a search on the Internet and found that "some of the job advertisements that Mr. Wang has published in the past at various Chinese-Australian employment forums."
Among the job requirements listed in these positions, one of the said "Preferred Asian ladies" and the other said "Preferred Asian employees"
The third post says he "fisted more attractive to overseas people (the original)"
Mr Wang fired Ms. Ayton by text message in April this year, which he later said was due to her absence and the alleged drop in cash from $5.10 to $30 for the cash register.
But Mr Sams said the reason for Mr Wang's dismissal of Ms. Ayyton was weak and there was also a lack of evidence.
In the past three years, she has only been absent from one shift, and the “missing amount ” totals a few Australian dollars.
He said Ms Ayton's dismissal "actually had nothing to do with her behaviour or performance."
He said: "In my opinion, with the evidence of the job adverts posted by Mr Wang, the real motivation for the defense to fire her was that he was more willing to hire an employee with an Asian background.
Under section 7772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's conduct ostensibly constitutes an unlawful violation of the Anti-Discrimination Act and / or dismissal of an applicant. ”
Mr Sams said that in view of Mr Wang's "apprompral treatment" to Ms Ayyton, it would not be appropriate for him to consider resuming her position.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton, who is a temporary worker with a salary of $26 at the time.
In light of possible violations of anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation, Sams said he would submit his rulings and documents to the head of the committee to consider whether Mr. Wang's conduct should be referred to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
He said Mr Wang had not given Ms Ayton any chance to respond to the reasons allegedly for dismissing her.
“I believe that the defence should have taken an incorrigible injustice and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant, and Mr. Wang ’ s “wait ” for this opportunity, which he believes would be ‘ proof ’ of being justified in termiophagement of employment to the applicant, ” he said.
"He was wrong... the respondent completely ignored any natural and just treatment accorded to her when he dismissed the applicant, and it was shocking that he was perfunctory and extremely unfair."
Mr. Sams said that while Foodworks was a small business, “it must be frank that any decent employer will not fire employees in a very unfair and perfunctory manner that is acknowledged in this case. ”
He said, “It ’ s shameful, and it ’ s extremely unfair. ”

Six people deny that the sale of fake macar newspaper paper case submitted to the high court for trial
Six men suspected of falsifying and selling passports, paper and identity cards in China, including the assistant director of the National Registration Authority, and one Datuk-level businessman, were interviewed on Thursday, where the court judge approved charges of anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking migrants and handed them over to the Most High Court.
Among them, the defense lawyer, who originally represented Datuk Chinese-American defendant Li Zhenhua, was also a member of the delegation of the Sunset Dong District, applied to the judge to withdraw from the trial on behalf of the case, and no longer became the lawyer representing the defendant, and was approved in court.
He indicated that he had drawn criticism from political opponents on behalf of the defendant, and that the action party he belonged had also been implicated.
He stressed that he did not fear any threat in itself, but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to smear the Pakatan Harapan Government and other Pakatan Harapan leaders, so it was carefully considered to make this decision.
He also said that there was no conflict of interest on behalf of the accused and members of Congress, and that he was not legally prohibited from representing any defendant, and that so far, the defendant, Li Zhenhua, has not been convicted.
The six defendants, charged with court on September 12 this year, face a number of provisions of the Anti-Trafficking and Anti-Trafficking Migrants Ordinance, as well as the charges of article 466 of the Criminal Code (Fake Documents), are all guilty and not granted bail pending trial by the court.

The six earlier defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Act (Soma ” (SOSMA), so the judge did not grant bail.
Walking with the motherland - a team of the armed police force quickly wrote
Jin Qiu, the parade training ground, the average height of 1.83 meters of officers and soldiers composed of an armed police force, training is busy.
The shiny gun thorns, the unique olive green and the bright red epaulettes together form a bright landscape.
A few days ago, the reporter walked into this team and felt the determination of the armed police officers and soldiers to be loyal guardians of the party and the people and their feelings and pursuits of "honor first" and their pursuit.
“Dreams shine a glorious life, write the immortal legend of the new era... ” This is the team song created by the collective creation of the officers and soldiers of the team —“ Walking with the Motherland ”.
In the team, this song is the motto of every member of the team.
Qi Xiaoguang, who is 1.92 meters tall, stands in the team with a particularly conspicuousness.
As the flag bearer of the former armed police flag guard, he has a deeper understanding of honor.
The honor of the military comes from hard training.
As the flag bearer of Qi Xiaoguang, training has always been high standards and strict requirements.
He tied sandbags to practice, stuck seconds to practice pace, walk with blind eyes, and practice stability with a high wind.
In his "Kingdom career", there is a picture that is always unforgettable.
A flag-raising ceremony, the heavy rain down and down, and no one came to watch the flag-raising ceremony left.
The moment the flag was raised, Qi Xiaoguang deeply felt the glory represented by this five-star red flag on his shoulders.
In 2019, Qi Xiaoguang was selected as the benchmark military parade.
The standard of benchmarking and flag bearer action is different.
Qi Xiaoguang introduced that although the progress of the flag bearer and the benchmark soldier is only more than 20 steps away, more efforts have to be made in training.
The benchmark soldier is the first in the first row, which directly determines the level of uniformity of the square.
After the military parade was intensively, he kicked his leg every day and practiced a hard hand.
In the demonstration demonstration, his precise stride and pace won the applause of the officers and soldiers.
In the square, almost every officer and soldier has the same experience as Qi Xiaoguang.
The father of the warrior Zhu Xu Oriental participated in the 50th anniversary parade of the National Day by 20 years ago.
To follow in the footsteps of his father to become a member of the team, he suffered setbacks again and again, but never discouraged.
He said: "Be able to walk through Tiananmen Square like my father, and to receive a review of the party and the people is the glory of my life, and I am willing to eat what I have eaten."
Entering the Fangzhuan Hall, eight big words of "the elite division of stability in the capital" came to the eye.
Wang Qian, a member of the commissar of the Fangzhu team, introduced that the members of the team are all from the armed police Beijing General Team - a force with a glorious tradition, which has successively undertaken major tasks such as the founding of the National Convention, the National Day celebrations, the security of the National Congress of the Party, and the anti-terrorism and stability maintenance of the capital, and cultivated a large number of British model groups and individuals such as the "National Flag Guard" and the "National Hero Squadron", and more than 50 units and individuals have been awarded honorary titles by the State Council, the Central Military Commission and the Armed Police Force.

World's top-aged barber dies aged 108, cut haircuts for 96 years
There is an honorary world-certified record-rated global barber Anthony Mancinelli in New York. At the age of 108, he never retired his daily 孜矻矻所 haircut for his guests, but 19-day Mansieri died of complications of jaw cancer and bid farewell to his 96th haircut life.
According to CNN, Mansieri immigrated to the United States when he was eight years old, and it wasn't long before a barber shop to help clean the floor, and at the age of 12, he began picking up scissors to serve guests, thereby reducing the financial pressure on the family.
Mansieri did not graduate at the time, although he was in elementary school.
Mansieri's son, Robert, revealed that Dad loves work, and people from all over the world like him, but although Dad has always been healthy, he was diagnosed with cancer in February this year, and finally failed to work for the first six weeks of his death, but this is not a retirement, because he plans to wait for himself to get up and cut his hair.
Robert, who is 82, says that after his father's death, he must now find a new barber, because he has been to let his father help cut his hair in his life.
During the year, the repurchase scale of listed companies exceeded 100bn yuan, which reached a record high - Xinhua
In order to stabilize the company's stock price and maintain the company's image, listed companies have begun to repurchase shares frequently in the past two years, and through targeted repurchases, collection bidding transactions, etc., they hope to pass on the information that the company's value is underestimated to the market, thereby stabilizing the stock price and enhancing investor confidence.
Oriental Wealth Choice data show that in 2017, the funds used by listed companies to buy back shares were 79 billion yuan, which surged to 5.10 billion yuan in 2018. Since 2019, the total amount of A-share listed companies' repurchase implementation has exceeded 100 billion yuan, setting a new high in the amount of A-share repurchase funds in the history of repurchase funds, and far exceeds the previous year.
From the point of view of the purpose of repurchase, the company's repurchase of shares and the increase of major shareholders seems to be the same, but there are big differences in the implementation of the main body, the source of funds, the repurchase use, the stock itself's
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Mai Kerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said in an interview with the "Securities Daily" reporter that the "Opinions on Supporting Listed Companies to Repurchase Shares" issued in November 2018, for the problems of the current system such as the narrow scope of share repurchase, complex decision-making procedures, and the imperfect inventory system have been repaired, due to the previous policy from the policy to encourage listed companies to buy back shares, so the phenomenon of repurchased shares in that year has increased significantly.
In January this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange officially issued the Regulations on the Implementation of Repurchases of Shares by Listed Companies, which have broadened the source of repurchase of listed companies, appropriately simplified the implementation procedures, guided and improved governance arrangements, and encouraged all kinds of listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee stock ownership plans.
After the introduction of the opinions, the operation of the listed company to carry out share repurchase, with more applicable circumstances, the repurchase process is simpler, and the enthusiasm for repurchase of shares is greater.
Repurchasing shares in a relatively low position is also conducive to improving the efficiency of the use of funds by listed companies, thereby increasing the profitability of each share, increasing the yield on net assets, and reducing the pressure on the company's profit index.
Compared with the increase in the holdings of major shareholders, the significance of the repurchase of shares by listed companies is greater, and also reflects the willingness of listed companies to manage their active market capitalization and abundant cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that the undervaluation of stock prices is the main factor in the repurchase of listed companies, and the company's share price has been unable to reflect the company's future development prospects, so such companies deserve investors' attention, but they can't blindly invest, and they need to pay attention to the financial reports of such listed companies and the specific business situation.
Listed companies with large-scale repurchase behavior at least indicate the company's development confidence and financial strength.
A-share listed company repurchase enthusiasm gradually warmed up, but also normalized the repurchase behavior, data show that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented share repurchases this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the main force of the repurchase market.

Yili shares have been paid 57.92 billion yuan for share repurchases, and in the near future adjustments to the purpose of repurchasing shares, by the original plan "repurchase shares will be used as a source of equity incentives for the later implementation of equity incentives" changed to "accumulated repurchase of 1.83 billion shares, of which 1.52 billion shares are used to implement equity incentives, and the remaining 30.49 million shares will be used to cancel to reduce registered capital."
Yili shares said that the cancellation of some of the shares that have been repurchased will help to further improve the level of earnings per share and effectively improve the return on investment of the shareholders of the company.
TCL Group issued a repurchase progress announcement on September 25th, showing that TCL Group cumulatively repurchased 3.59% of the company's shares, spending a total of 16.5 billion yuan.

Based on the confidence in the future development of the company and the maintenance of investors' interests, combined with the performance of the company's shares in the secondary market in the past year, and taking into account the company's operating conditions and financial situation, the company plans to use its own funds, self-financing and other financing methods to buy back the company's shares.
Yang Delong, chief economist of Haihai Open Source Fund, said that the operation of listed companies to buy back shares, on the one hand, can reduce the number of shares in circulation in the market, and increase the share price per share of listed companies, which is an important benefit for the share price of the secondary market; in addition, listed companies are willing to take the initiative to pull out real gold and silver and buy back stock cancellation from the stock market, which greatly boosts market confidence.
The gradual increase in the repurchase of domestic listed companies in recent years, especially the performance of the shares, and the confidence of investors is a very good way to boost the confidence of investors through share repurchases, and it is also a practice worthy of affirmation and encouragement.
Hunan Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee, Changsha Municipal Party Committee Secretary Hu Henghua and construction machinery manufacturing Xiangjun four leaders - Zhan pure new, Liang steady root, He Tsinghua, Liu Feixiang, around "Changsha from construction machinery to intelligent manufacturing" set a "small goal" - three or five years to build the world-leading level of construction machinery industry cluster.
In Changsha to build the world's leading level of construction machinery industry cluster, in the current fashionable words, is to create "the strongest surface".
As an inland capital city, Changsha shouted out this magnificent speech, where is the confidence?
It is the strength of domineering side leakage.
The four construction machinery and Xiang enterprises participating in the dialogue, are themselves in hand, covering the sky, underground, sea, land in all fields: light aircraft of mountain and river intelligence, the concrete conveying pump of Zoomlion, the whole ground crane of Sany Heavy Industry, the tunnel shield machine of the iron and heavy industry, and its "hard strength" can be described as unique in the world and the pride of the group.
Once upon a time, China had little right to speak in the field of construction machinery manufacturing.
Time to move, Chinese enterprises "introduction" "going out" two-wheel drive, take the "Belt and Road" initiative of the east wind, acquisitions, mergers, plant-based and other measures, a leap to become the world's leader in the global construction machinery industry.
Among them, Sany Heavy Industry, Zhonglian Heavy Industry, Iron Construction Heavy Industry, Shanhe Intelligent and other leading enterprises in construction machinery, its output value, market share, sales and other major economic indicators, has been significantly ahead of the same kind of enterprises.
It is the camera-movement of the currents.
Construction machinery Xiang Jun "four major King Kong", is the leader of the Changsha construction machinery industry cluster, but also the head of the global construction machinery industry enterprises.
In the global industry, who lives down and lives well is the hard work of speaking.
In the early years, the global construction machinery industry suffered a cold winter, many internationally well-known construction machinery manufacturing enterprises have fallen, but Changsha construction machinery manufacturing enterprises have put "cat winter" as "winter swimming", self-intensification of pressure, self-breakthrough, through the transformation of industrial structure, from manufacturing to intelligent manufacturing transformation, not only survived, but also strengthened the body bone stronger.
It is based on the government and enterprises of the stars holding the moon.
The development of advantageous industries requires both enterprises to be aggressive and necessary for the government to act positively.
The reason why Changsha has the reputation of "construction machinery capital" is that it brings together the whole industrial chain from upstream to downstream, creates many related industrial clusters, and reduces the cost of R & D, manufacturing and sales of enterprises through optimizing the business environment, improving supporting services, simplifying the approval process and other management service measures.
Good business ecology, so that the construction machinery manufacturing enterprises are coming.
History has pushed Changsha to the front desk to build a global construction machinery leader, when I don't, benevolent.
Whether it is the government, or enterprises, or even related to the industry, academia and research businessmen and other links, we should seize the opportunity, follow the trend, set goals, continue to make efforts, and contribute to the construction of a manufacturing power.

Gansu Qingyang: Lake sheep carry to "excluding poverty".
September autumn renders the yellow plateau.
In the professional cooperative of Yimin farming in the town of Gaima, Shavili, a 58-year-old villager, filled the last spat grass for the food trough in the sheep fold, kept it on the edge of the trough, and looked at the mouth of the white lake sheep chewed.
"Eat well, wait for autumn and winter to be full of fat, out of the column to sell a good price."
Shavyli said that he fed the sheep a "specially nutritious meal" every day, cleaned regularly, sterilized and disinfected, and did not dare to snub.
Shavili raised sheep for more than two decades, until he came to the cooperative to work, and learned how extensive the sheep had in the past.
Xiavili is a native of Xia Shuai Shui Pool Village in Qingyang City, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His left and right neighbors are sheep farmers, but adhere to the traditional way of frees, the quality of the sheep is poor, the amount of the column is small.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, the village of 140 poor people joined the cooperative, and everything began to change.
Shavili buried his head all day into farming, because he always held a breath of energy in his heart.
The people who took shares were all poor households, and they all entrusted sheep to the cooperative, and whether they could pay dividends and sell the price at the end of the year, they could count on him.
Fortunately, with the guidance of technical personnel, he slowly learned to engage in epidemic prevention, mastered scientific feeding, and became one of the few breeding "good-style" in the village.
The professional cooperative is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1400 lake sheep.
Zou Tao, the head of the cooperative, said that there are all doorways in and outside the standardized sheep shed.
"The wool is thick, easy to breed bacteria, the lake sheep in the sweltering, rainy and wet place, the sheep shed must be built in the three-sided ring ditch, but also have to be installed to change the fan to ventilate and heat dissipate."
Zou Tao said that in order to prevent the epidemic, it is necessary to regularly spray disinfect the sheep shed and give the sheep three to four anti-epidemic needles in the first quarter.
"Small fat sheep" in addition to living well, but also have to eat silage corn, wheat, alfalfa and other mixed grass, and have a wide enough "playground" stretch bones.
The cooperative adopts the method of hosting and breeding, and guides local farmers to put good breeding of lake sheep here, and uniformly raise, manage and sell them, so as to achieve good breeding, scientific, standardization and intensive breeding.
Today, the 140 poor households with sheep shares, each household dividends of more than 6000 yuan per year, there are four people who have built a file card to work in cooperatives.
From "full mountain grazing" to "precise feeding", from "local mating" to "artificial insemination", from "seeing body type, touching the belly" to "doing B super one by one"... in Gansu Qingyang, meat and sheep farming is not only a change in feeding methods, the model of "leading enterprises + cooperatives + farmers" has changed the scene of "mountains and sheep in the market", overcoming the weak and small scattered in the traditional farming industry, the poor days of farmers have become better because of modern sheep.
Zou Tao said that if the market price is weak, the local leading enterprise Gansu Zhongsheng Agricultural and Pastoral Development Co., Ltd., will be acquired at the market protection price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers spread market risks.
Xu Jianfeng, general counsel of Gansu Zhongsheng Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd., said that enterprises have led more and more poor households to read the "sheep" by providing loan guarantees, sheep supply, order breeding, order breeding, quotation acquisition, unified processing and sales.
In Qingyang, at least 8200 poor families have achieved stable income growth through the forage farming, good breeding, large-scale breeding, slaughtering division, and market sales.
Qingyang City is located in the northern agricultural and animal husbandry staggered belt, rich in forage resources.
At present, there are 913 large-scale breeding farms and cooperatives in the city, and more than 5 million meat and sheep are raised, and two processing production lines for 1.3 million meat and sheep slaughter scale have also been built, and the sheep are becoming the "leader" of poverty alleviation in the local industry.
French finance minister says it will cut taxes more than ten billion euros next year and calls on Germany to follow suit
PARIS (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France would cut taxes by more than 100bn euros ($109 billion) next year, while Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revive the sluggish economy.
Introducing France's 2020 budget, Le Maire said the ECB's latest monetary easing has created an opportunity to increase investment for those able member governments.
The European Central Bank cut interest rates to a record low on September 12 and plans to restart bond purchases to depress borrowing costs in hopes of incentivizing the recovery and pushing up inflation.
“Low interest rates will not allow Europe to prosper, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough, ” Le Maire told reporters.
"Germany needs to invest, and it needs it now, the sooner the better. Don't wait until the situation is worse and then act," he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany on several occasions.
France has already implemented tax cuts of more than €100bn this year, giving a big boost to France's economic growth.
And the global economy lost momentum, and the export-dependent German economy bore the brunt.
Le Maire noted that the tax burden on French households will be reduced by €93bn next year, including €5bn in income tax relief.
In addition, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly €1bn as the corporate tax rate is gradually implemented from 33.3% to 25% over the five-year period.

Study: U.S. National Healthy Eating Index Grows Smallly, Still a Challenge
According to the U.S. Overseas Chinese News Network, a recent study shows that in the past 16 years, the U.S. government's healthy eating index has grown moderately, growing from 56 to 58.
But in the case where the full score is 100 points, it's not worth celebrating.
American nationals still face “significant challenges ” in their diet.
Dr. Zhang Fangfang, one of the study's authors and a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said that Americans still consume too much food that may cause diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, which are the most common diseases of the United States.
The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on the 24th.
The study was based on the conclusions of the U.S. government's health survey of 4.4 million adults conducted between 1999 and 2016.
The authors write, "Despite considerable improvements, significant dietary challenges remain."
These challenges include reducing the intake of snacks, hot dogs, fat cows, butter and other foods containing saturated fat.
The study found that people's daily intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended 10% intake.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. diet is that the sugar intake has been reduced from 16 percent to about 14 percent, but the intake is still too high.
Officials believe that the daily diet of added sugar intake should be less than 10%.
For the reasons for the decrease in sugar intake, the researchers believe that people are related to the reduction of sweet soda, but Zhang Fangfang stressed that sugar is often added to even sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
U.S. adults have increased slightly in their intake of fruits, nuts, oats, and other whole grain categories.
However, data from 2016 show that these foods still account for less than five percent of their daily diets.
Although people's slightly less salt intake, and the reduction in drinking fruit juices has led to low-quality carbohydrate intake, Zhang Fangfang said they still account for up to 42 percent of daily calories, many of which come from refined white-sided bread and other refined grains.
The study, based on a biennial personal health survey, would allow adults to recall the food they ate in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have been asking the issue twice every few days since 2003.
The U.S. Department of Dietary Guidelines for U.S. Residents advises people to adopt a "healthy eating model" to reduce the likelihood of developing a chronic disease.
The guidelines point out that people should eat more nutritious foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and the seafood, lean meat, poultry meat, eggs, and seed foods that can provide protein.
During the survey, the number of people with diabetes among U.S. nationals nearly doubled, more than 7%, and the obesity rate increased in many years of the survey, and about 70% of American adults are overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among U.S. nationals.

The first financial subsidiary of the national joint stock bank set up a science and technology to empower the asset management business
On the 26th, Everbright Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary Everbright Financial Co., Ltd. was officially established in Qingdao, which is the first joint-stock bank financial subsidiary established in China.
Experts said that asset management is an important area for the development of financial technology, and the establishment of financial subsidiaries by banks is conducive to its use of scientific and technological means to enhance asset management business.
In April this year, Everbright Bank and China Merchants Bank issued separate announcements saying that they had been approved by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission to build a financial subsidiary.
On September 24th, Everbright Bank announced that Everbright Financial has been officially approved for opening.
Just two days later, Everbright Bank led many joint-stock banks, taking the lead in setting up Everbright Financial in Qingdao.
Li Xiaopeng, chairman of Everbright Group, said that Everbright Group will accelerate the pace of innovation and use modern scientific and technological thinking and means to rely on big data, Internet of Things and cloud computing to improve the coverage, utilization rate and penetration of financial capital, and improve customer satisfaction, and security.
By 2021, the establishment and sound of the "four beams and eight pillars" of China's financial technology development will further enhance the scientific and technological application capabilities of the financial industry, realize the deep integration and coordinated development of finance and science and technology, and significantly enhance the satisfaction of the people with digital, networked and intelligent financial products and services.
Zhang Xuyang, chairman of Everbright Financial, introduced that the asset management platform of Everbright Financial will use intelligent investment, intelligent investment research, big data and other technologies to help Everbright Financial to better judge the macroeconomic situation.
In the future, new technologies such as blockchain will also be applied to grasp the direction and trend of everything from traditional assets to alternative assets to digital alternative assets.
Dong Ximiao, a special researcher at the National Finance and Development Laboratory, said that under the face of a new competition in the asset management industry, financial technology companies and asset management institutions will use asset management technology to explore new growth paths.
Fintech empowers the asset management industry, which is not only the need for the transformation and development of financial technology itself, but also injects new vitality and vitality into the development of asset management business.
At the beginning of this year, Jingdong Digital Technology launched a new asset management technology system, with the help of technology and digital means to enhance the product development and risk control capabilities of asset management.
The new system starts from the four major capabilities of product design, sales transactions, asset management and risk assessment, and improves the overall intelligent operation level of the asset management industry.
Experts believe that asset management technology can enhance the ability of customer service and innovative products at the same time, but also to enhance the ability of risk prevention and improve the efficiency of asset management management.
Zhang Xuyang said that in the past, it was easy to bias in positioning customers' risk appetites through questionnaires, and now using artificial intelligence for user portraits, it helps to better position customers, and launch corresponding products according to customer investment preferences, which helps to defuse risks.
"E-commerce, space-time data and other alternative big data can help us to better characterize the activity and prosperity of a region and an industry."
Zhang Xuyang said that while defusing risks, big data technology will also help improve risk control capabilities.
The deepest record of China's railway tunnel shaft was set
China News Agency and Insurance Mountain September 27th (Zhang Weiming Xu for Guozhou Jingbo) After more than 1200 days of day and night construction, the construction of the Da (Li) Railway Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel 1 shaft was completed on the 27th, the depth of the underground 762.59 meters below the ground, breaking the deepest record of the Chinese railway tunnel shaft, and this record was created in a large number of gushing water.
The full length of 34.5 kilometers of the Great Rui Railway Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel is located in Yunnan, the tunnel from the west bank of the river crossing the Gaoligong Mountain Mountains, is the longest tunnel in the two lines of the Asian double-lined single-hole tunnel.
The tunnel traverses the 19 fracture zone and is buried up to 1155 meters deep, because it covers almost all tunnel construction may encounter adverse geology and major risks, and the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel is known as the "geological museum" of tunnel construction.
The shaft is the most important auxiliary pit road in the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel, and is responsible for increasing the operational surface to achieve "long tunnel short" and the important task of ventilating the operation of the railway.
1 shaft successfully dug to the bottom of the well, marking the high-rigo cave into the tunnel officially into the horizontal tunnel construction, to be dug at the bottom of the well and the replacement of equipment, the underground can be added to four work surfaces, speed up the tunnel positive hole excavation speed.
"The shaft is all in the granite formation, because the granite formation is more cracked, can't stop the water, from the top to the downs and downs, basically how much deep the well is how much is the pressure."
Jingzhao, chief engineer of the Dalian Railway Project Department of the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, told reporters that in the construction of the shaft, there have been many times in the mud surge, collapse and other dangerous situations, and the construction party invites experts to take the pulse on the spot, and more than 20 seminars and treatment plans.
"When the water in the shaft is the largest, it is more than 300 cubic meters per hour, and the bottom of the deep well is more than 700 meters, and the water pressure is equivalent to the bottom of the sea floor of 700 meters deep."
"If you do not drain in time, it will flood the wells in one hour, and we spend almost 85% of the time to cure water, and 15% time is used to dig in."
In order to overcome the longitudinal development of the shaft rock, the longitudinal development of the shaft, the surge of mud, and the granite, the tunnel construction adopts the system water treatment measures combined with "detection, injection and excavation" to reduce the construction risk.
After many improvements, the construction of the 1st shaft has formed a mechanized assembly line such as excavation system, out of the system, suspension system, and winch upgrading system, and realized the whole process of mechanization such as eye-catching, blasting, laying out, template installation, concrete pouring, etc., and accelerating the construction progress.
Eventually, after more than 1200 days and nights of construction, the shaft successfully completed the excavation of the depth of 762.59 meters.
The Great Rui Railway is an important part of the China-Myanmar International Passage and an important transportation infrastructure for the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative.
After the completion of the car, Dali to Ruili's driving time will be shortened from six hours to the current highway, which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in the western region of Yunnan, and promote economic and trade cooperation and personnel-friendly exchanges between China and South and Southeast Asian countries.

In the afternoon, I began to be lonely, and I did not want to go out, and I have not adjusted the state of the children who were not around.
Done the spirit, say to the dog Nana: Mom took you out.
Carefully wrote about the few things to be done to go out, the character characteristics of type A blood are getting stronger and stronger, and they all feel very awkward.
Take the suit, buy the nutrients, pay, buy sashimi, nana's small snacks.
Here is the reason to go out.
On the phone, I just said to his sister that there was a little thanks to Nay, otherwise there would be no excuse for buying small snacks.
I smiled a few perfunctorily, and said the child came to the phone and hung up.
Nana jumped into the assistant seat, honestly lying down, she knew that she was fickle, panicked, and not willing to accompany me.
Her husband came back early.
Even admire the salad made deliciously made of salmon mixed with avocado, and then went to the bedroom to lie in bed and watch TV.

The circle of friends is inventing the moon, and it turned out to be the Mid-Autumn Festival today.
A bunch of grapes sent by a group of friends, leaving half to Beau, and the rest is in the little flower bowl that they like and come out to see the moon.
And Nana sat on the ground, I ate the grapes she ate the skin, and I spit the seeds of the grapes so far.
The moon is hiding in the clouds, fortunately the clouds are walking, and the moon suddenly appears, and the light and light are a little glaring.
There are various poems in the mind about the moon, and only clearly like this sentence: every three or five on the reunion / full of the clear guang jade column / the last round of the sky to hold out / the human surnames look on the back.
Maybe we give the moon too much emotion, for me to say, in fact, that God's God, Caesar's return to Caesar is the best.
The moon color is moon color, the emotions are your own.
After eating the grapes, this cold moon chilled.
Nana had a slight snoring at the edge of his feet, and stood up, and laid down Nay's little blanket on the edge of her little house, and Nay was lying cheerfully on it.
Pull the door open and shout: Is the bathing water boiling?

UN awards "Guardian of the Earth" for Ant Forest
In a warm applause and grand music sound, Xu Di, the head of the "Ant Forest" project, and the user's representative Shen Junliang took the podium and took over the trophy of the 2019 United Nations "Guardian Award" from the host.
The 2019 "Guardian of the Earth Award" ceremony was held in New York, United States on the 26th, and the "Ant Forest" project, which led hundreds of millions of people to participate in environmental action with mobile phone mini-programs, won the "Inspiration and Action Award" award.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme had announced the list of winners at its headquarters in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, but the people who attended the awards ceremony on the same day were still difficult to hide.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Inaquis, said that Ant Forest is an exciting innovation, and it has made hundreds of millions of people take action to understand the environmental challenges facing mankind and what human beings can do for the environment.
It uses technology to connect people and the environment, so that every individual can participate in the protection of the earth, which will have a huge impact.
"Ant Forest" was launched by China Ant Financial Services Group (referred to as Ant Financial) in August 2016 on the Alipay platform, and users have accumulated "green energy" and "plant trees" in mobile phones by recording their daily life's green travel in Ant Forest and online payment of utility bills.
Every time a user develops a virtual tree, "ant forest" and public welfare partners will plant a real tree in a desertification area.
As of August this year, 5 billion "ant forests" users have accumulated carbon emission reduction of 792 million tons, planting trees in desertification areas.
At the "Guardian of the Earth Award", Costa Rica was awarded for its national environmental protection efforts, and Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado, who came to receive the award, praised the contribution of "Ant Forest" on the spot, which is impressive to inspire so many people to participate in green actions.
An Jinfu Chairman and CEO Well Xiandong said that the "Guardian of the Earth Award" is an affirmation of the "Ant Forest" project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for people to participate in low-carbon life, and this honor belongs to all participants.
Jing Xiandong said that the "Ant Forest" has affected half a billion people in the past three years, and the goal of "Ant Forest" in the next three years is to drive one billion people around the world to participate in low-carbon actions.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how to make farmers' income more from green mountains and green water.
In addition to providing employment opportunities through planting trees, we also hope to help farmers achieve income growth through agricultural product development projects and e-commerce platforms.
The "Ant Forest"-based public welfare and environmental protection model based on digital technology has also been successfully launched to sea and has been borrowed by other countries.
In June this year, the Philippines ’ largest “e-wallet ” GCash launched the Philippine version of Ant Forest, which encourages Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon life.
According to reports, GCash will work with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, environmental welfare organizations, etc., and plan to plant 36.5 million trees in the Philippines within a year of the project.
The "Guardian of the Earth Award" is the highest award in the field of environmental protection and is presented annually.
"Ant Forest" won the award, after China's Sehanba Forest Farm Builder, China's Zhejiang Province "Thousand Village Demonstration, Wan Village Remediation" project, China's Zhejiang Province, green innovation project won the "Inspiration and Action Award" for the third consecutive year.
Economic and trade frictions affect the "report card" of the US economy.
The U.S. economic "tran note" for the second quarter of this year showed that the growth rate of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) slowed significantly compared with the previous quarter due to the sharp decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts pointed out that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty it brought about is the main reason for the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data released by the US Department of Commerce on the 26th showed that U.S. GDP grew at an annual rate of 2% in the second quarter, which was the same as the previously announced revised data, but significantly lower than the 3.1% in the first quarter.
The data show that consumption growth became a major factor underpinning U.S. economic growth in the second quarter.
Personal consumption expenditure, which accounts for about 70% of the total U.S. economy, increased by 4.6% in the quarter, driving economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumption spending and investment drive economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment fell 6.3% in the second quarter from the previous quarter, dragging down 1.16 percentage points of economic growth in the quarter; exports fell 5.7% from the previous quarter, and net exports dragged down the quarter's economic growth by 0.68 percentage points.
Barry Knapp, managing partner of the U.S.-based Aynside Macroeconomics Consulting, said that private-sector investment has not only failed to maintain last year's growth momentum, but has fallen sharply, because economic and trade frictions and rising uncertainty have hit corporate confidence.
Knapp believes that under the influence of policy uncertainty, U.S. corporate capital spending is expected to remain in a downward trend next year.
Analysts believe that although consumption growth strongly supported the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are growing signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty it brings about affect consumer confidence and adversely affect the U.S. consumption outlook.
Richard Curtin, head of the survey and a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, said that in the most recent survey, 38% of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, which is a new high in a year and a half.
For the future of the U.S. economy, analysts generally believe that the U.S. economy will continue to slow down
But some experts said that if the economic and trade frictions are eased, the performance of the US industrial sector and financial markets will improve.
Kailyn Birch, a global economist at the British Economist think tank, expects that the U.S. economy will continue the gradual decline trend this year in the future, and the growth rate will fall to a lower level than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody ’ s Analytics, predicts that the U.S. economy ’ s growth will be 2.3% this year, and it will slow to 1.6% next year, assuming that economic and trade frictions will not continue to escalate.
Ellen Hatyn pointed out that the biggest concern of enterprises at present is the economic and trade disputes and the uncertainty it brings, and if the economic and trade disputes can be resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced, and the performance of the industrial sector will be much better than it is now.
Matt Meli, equity strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said that economic and trade frictions are still the "top number one problem" and the main reason for the large fluctuations in the US capital market this year, and whether economic and trade frictions can be properly resolved will be the key to affecting the direction of the US capital market for the rest of the year.

It is understood that the Regulations adopted this time are revised on the basis of the Measures for the Implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests in Ningxia in 2007, which are divided into 9 chapters 65, including general rules, political rights, cultural and educational rights, labor and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, marital and family rights, legal responsibilities, and by-laws.
In the Regulations, Ningxia encourages the exploration of the implementation of the joint parental leave of husband and wife, which is still the first in the country.
In April this year, the Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Development of Care Services for Infant and Young Children Under the Age of 3rd issued by the General Office of the State Council had a relevant description of the joint parenting of husband and wife.
In the process of revising the Regulations, Ningxia introduced the innovation "to encourage employers to give each year to ten days of common parental leave for couples who have children in accordance with the laws and regulations, and during the child to the age of three weeks, they are given each day of mutual parental leave every year."
At the same time, the Regulations highlight anti-sexual harassment and the protection of women minors.
In article 43 of the Regulations, it incorporates the latest legislative achievements in the current compilation of the personality rights of China's civil code, and details the constituent elements of sexual harassment and the main body and mechanism of anti-sexual harassment.
Article 44 of the Ordinance is expressly prohibited for frequent sexual assault of girls, and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and prevention work, which will become a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
In view of women's right to know and dispose of the common property of marriage and family, article 35 of the Regulations clearly stipulates that women's right to know about common property and the obligations of property registration agencies and related subjects, and provides solid institutional support for women's rights protection.
In addition, in response to social hot issues - gender discrimination in employment - article 26 of the Regulations not only prohibits direct discrimination, but also orders the prohibition of indirect discrimination, and absorbs the latest practical experience of joint interviews, enhances the punishment of gender discrimination violations, and more vigorously safeguards women's legitimate rights and interests.
In recent years, the Ningxia Women's Federation, the Joint Public Prosecutor's Law Department, Civil Affairs and other departments have promoted and introduced social professional forces to participate in the mediation of marital and family conflicts and anti-domestic violence, which has achieved remarkable results.
The Regulations summarize and enhance this, and in a number of laws, encourage the mobilization of social forces and the accumulation of social resources to jointly safeguard the rights and interests of women, and require people's governments at or above the county level to provide stable and institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services.

Liu Kun, Minister of Finance: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred to the state-owned 8601 billion yuan to enrich the social security fund.
Finance Minister Liu Kun said on the 27th that so far, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of some state-owned capital enrichment social security funds, and the total amount of state-owned capital transferred is about 8601 billion yuan.
Liu Kun made the above statement at the meeting on the same day by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the SASAC jointly held a number of national transfer of state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund work task deployment.
"The transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund is an important measure to reform and improve the basic pension insurance system, and it is a full manifestation of the intergenerational fairness of the development results of state-owned enterprises and the intergenerational fairness of the basic pension insurance system, and is a policy measure based on the current and long-term consideration."
In 2017, the State Council issued the Implementation Plan for Transferring Some State-owned Capital Enriching Social Security Funds, which requires the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to carry out pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, the pre-transfer work has achieved positive results.
At the central level, three batches of a total of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been transferred, and the total amount of state-owned capital transferred is about 8601 billion yuan.
Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions whose functions of the Ministry of Finance fulfills the duties of funders has been basically completed.
The transfer of central enterprises has a certain scale.
At the local level, the preliminary work of enterprises transfer has been carried out successively.
As of the end of 2018, the pilot work in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces was basically completed, transferring state-owned capital of 158 billion yuan and 185 billion yuan respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also carried out pre-transfer preparatory work, laying the foundation for the next step of the implementation of the transfer.
According to the joint issuance of notices by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the SASAC, the State Administration of Taxation and the Securities Regulatory Commission, the work of the central and local governments to transfer some of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund was fully launched in 2019 and basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on the same day made a specific deployment of the comprehensive transfer work.
The meeting stressed the need to complete the transfer work pragmatically and efficiently.
"According to the schedule, the transfer work should be basically completed by the end of 2020."
Transfer working hours are tight and the task is heavy. ”
Liu Kun said that all regions and departments should carefully organize and carefully arrange to ensure that the transfer work should be completed as required; solidly promote the work, accurately grasp the transfer policy content; strengthen communication and coordination, and solve difficult problems in a timely manner.
State-owned capital transfer to enrich the social security fund - starting from the starting point of "enriching the social security fund money bag", the destination is to provide strong support for the pension security.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple "physical displacement" of equity, but the "mathematical addition" is opened.
On September 20th, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human and Social Affairs, the SASAC, the General Administration of Taxation and the Securities Regulatory Commission jointly issued the "Notice on Comprehensively Promoting the Transfer of Part of the State-owned Capital to Enrich the Work of the Social Security Fund", which clarified the timetable for the transfer of state-owned social security funds, that is, the central and local transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund.
After the release of the document, the Ministry of Finance and other departments implemented it soon.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred all 10% of the equity stakes held by the Industrial and Commercial Bank and the Agricultural Bank to the Social Security Fund, and the total value of the two shares was more than 11.5 billion yuan.
According to the regulations, the Social Security Foundation, as a financial investor, enjoys the right of income, disposal and right to know the state-owned equity.
In its announcement, ICBC and Agricultural Bank said that this change in equity will not cause changes to the shareholders and actual controllers of the Bank.
In this regard, the author believes that similar equity transfer of state-owned enterprises is not a simple change in equity ownership, but can stimulate a series of "additional operations" that can stimulate a series of effects.
The first step of some state-owned enterprises to transfer social security "additional results", which is naturally a way to reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises and the development results are shared by the whole people.
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are in important industries and fields in China's economy, and the overall profitability is stronger and relatively stable.
Among them, leading enterprises are continuing to achieve better and bigger and stronger.
On July 10th, the executive meeting of the State Council decided to comprehensively launch the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the work of the Social Security Fund this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately said that it will work with relevant departments and in accordance with the deployment of the executive meeting of the State Council to do a good job in comprehensively promoting the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, fully reflecting the intergenerational fairness of the basic pension insurance system and the development of state-owned enterprises.
The second step of the transfer of "additional results" is to enhance the sustainability of China's social security fund and further consolidate the foundation of the pension social security system.
With the aging of the population, China's social security funds are facing pressure, and most of the state-owned capital, as the subject of the transfer, most of them have the ability to maintain profitability and dividend, not only can effectively supplement the social security fund, but also provide the source of living water for the social security fund.
Some calculations show that for every 13.8 percentage point state-owned capital transferred, the proportion of deposits in basic pension insurance can be supported by one percentage point of reduction.
The third step of the transfer, "additional results", is to increase the stabilizer for the capital market.
The way to transfer the main body to obtain income is "redifice-oriented, supplemented by operation".
As a financial investor in state-owned capital, the Social Security Fund does obtain equity dividend income.
However, as a value investor in the capital market, the Social Security Fund has a strong ability to operate capital.
For listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in holding shares will further optimize the governance structure of listed companies, which will help improve the operating level of enterprises and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the Social Security Fund, as a bellwether for investment vane, is conducive to further enhancing its influence in the market and playing a role as a "stabilizer" in the market.
In addition, it is also conducive to giving full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors and guiding investors to rational investment and value investment.

Iran has been confirmed to develop advanced centrifuges to further suspend implementation of Iran nuclear agreement
According to the Central News Agency, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on the 26th that Iran's use of advanced centrifuges to make enriched uranium has once again violated the Iranian nuclear agreement.
According to reports, Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the Iran nuclear agreement in response to US President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement in May 2018, and the resumption and strengthening of sanctions against Iran.

According to the nuclear agreement, Iran can only set up about 5000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to accumulate enriched uranium, and only allows Iran to use a small number of more advanced models for research, but does not produce enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium at a rate several times faster, possibly for the use of nuclear bombs.
According to the report, the International Atomic Energy Agency report said: "On September 25th, the Agency confirmed that the advanced centrifuges of the two, the model of the model 3 in Iran... are accumulating or preparing to accumulate enriched uranium."
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented the report to Member States on the 26th, and a diplomatic official responded: “They are busy at the [Nutriun enriched uranium] facility. ”

China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
(New China 70th) White Paper: China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The white paper pointed out that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The white paper said that with the rapid improvement of China's comprehensive national strength and international influence, some people in the world are worried that China will take the road of "national strength must dominate", and some people have proposed the so-called "China threat theory."
This has both cognitive misreading, deep-seated prejudice, psychological imbalances caused by power growth, and deliberate distortions to safeguard their vested interests.
The realization of national prosperity, national rejuvenation and people's happiness is not only the dream of the Chinese people and the common dream of all peoples.
"China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge."
The white paper pointed out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth. China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, China's scientific and technological innovation has injected new momentum into world economic growth, and the role of China's economic stabilizer and power source in the future has become more prominent.
At present, the world's economic growth momentum is insufficient, and the sound Chinese economy is becoming more and more important to the world.
China's economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development, with the acceleration of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, in-depth adjustment of economic structure, continuous upgrading of industrial optimization, and new economic growth points.
"The McKinsey Global Research Institute research report believes that by 2040, the integration of China and other economies around the world is expected to create an economic value of 22 trillion to $37 trillion, which is equivalent to 15% -26% of the total global economy, and the cooperation between the rest of the world and China will create great economic value."
The white paper emphasizes that China's economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and are deeply integrated.
China, which has a more stable economic operation, has a higher quality of growth and a promising growth prospect, is a long-term positive for world economic development.
It is neither feasible nor harmful to "decouple" from China's economic development as a "threat" to try to squeeze China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain and value chain, and "decouple" from the world economy.
The white paper pointed out that the all-round opening up to the outside world creates more opportunities for all countries to share the "China dividend".
China unswervingly pursues a mutually beneficial and win-win-win opening-up strategy to achieve greater efforts and a higher level of opening up to the outside world. China has the most potential consumer market in the world. China is the most attractive investment destination, and it has more countries "going out" on a larger scale.
"Opening should be two-way, mutually beneficial, and not one-way, one-sidedly beneficial."
Mutual benefit can be long-term long-term. ”
China is committed to continuously expanding imports, easing market access, improving the business environment, and strengthening intellectual property protection. Other countries should also expand opening up and take corresponding measures to improve their own business environment.
Only when all parties meet each other can we create an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment, and jointly make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger, forming a mutually beneficial and win-win community.
The white paper points out that China provides more public goods to the international community.
This includes promoting high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, building a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively carrying out foreign aid.
"China's development has benefited from the international community, and has never forgotten to give back to the international community and provide more and better public goods for the international community."

Referring to the two countries' goals of achieving $200 billion in bilateral trade turnover in 2024, Slepniov said that agriculture, machinery manufacturing, chemical industry and forestry and other fields will play an important role in achieving this goal.
The Russian side intends to promote the diversification of supply in these areas and promote the export of deep-processed products.
He stressed that Russia intends to push its exporters into the global value-added chain, of which China is one of the development directions.
Russian manufacturers in the fields of agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas and chemical industry are well positioned to participate in this process.
At present, the two countries need to continue to deepen cooperation between enterprises, and "start more Russian-Chinese joint ventures to jointly develop exports to third countries."

Demonstration Bomborch President kaoke Egypt Mountain Rain and the Ways Authorities Show Demonstrate a Strong Crackdown
Twitter hashtags and social media are a strong advocate that the Egyptian masses take to the streets today to peacefully demand President Sisi step down.
But the authorities have made clear their intention to use force to suppress it.
Since then-military chief Sisi took authority in 2013, when he launched a military coup to seize authority, such a thing of expression of dissent has almost disappeared in Egypt, where any form of protest is more in extreme danger.
The Guardian newspaper reported that the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, a Cairo-based NGO, pointed to more than 19,00 arrests since protests that erupted in a rare outbreak of protests demanding Sisi's ouster over the weekend.
Allegations of vanity surrounding Sisi and his family's splurge of his public money led thousands of people to take to the streets to demonstrate on the streets on the 20th.
Egypt's Interior Ministry firmly stated that any attempt to destabilize the country will be decisive and will not be soft.
The city centre of Cairo has long been on alert, and riot police, security agency vehicles and plainclothes police are visible in the streets around Tahrir Square, the detonation point of the Egyptian revolution in 2011.
Al Jazeera reported that the security forces detained a number of key scholars and social sages on the 25th, including Nafa, a political science professor at Cairo University and a well-known columnist.
He tweeted on the 24th: “Continuing that Secie absolute rule will cause disaster, and I have no doubt that ” I have no doubt.
"It is in Egypt's interest that he will step down immediately."
Before Narfa's arrest, Hosny, a spokesman for Annan, a spokesman for Egypt's former military chief of military staff, was taken into custody.
Annan was arrested last year after trying to compete with Sisi for the presidency.
The president of the Constitutional Party, Davude, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that at a time when the economic woes of the poor and the middle class are exacerbating, the scrambled practices of the dissidents reflect the government's instability and fragility.
Ayman Nour, the opposition leader, who once roed for the presidency, said: “The arresting action highlights how much the regime is ignoring the Egyptian people and how much fear it is. ”
"Because the economy has been brought in by him, coupled with the widespread political oppression, Sisi is trying to send a clear message to the important generals and politicians who may replace it."
Noor pointed out that under the premise of the continuous deterioration of the socio-economic situation, the government's high-handed approach will only increase the anger of the people.
Now that the fear barrier has been broken, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor in exile in Spain, a former Egyptian military build contractor, began to upload a series of videos at the beginning of the month, benefiting from government corruption, detonating a small wave of demonstrations in different cities last weekend.
Ali said his company, the Amrak general contracting, could get lucrative contracts without going through the statutory bidding process, underscoring the greed of the military and the relatives of Sisi, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply dedicated about his involvement.
Ali claims that he helped Sisiga's pallious palaces and luxury hotels in stark contrast to the current life of the abject poverty of the Egyptians, and that the other side has not paid for it.
On Twitter, hashtags such as "Singen You Don't Be Alone", "Sisi Gets", "Sisitao", "Next Friday", etc., have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and burgeoning, and the content has called on the people to take to the streets peacefully to demand that Sisi step down.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Amawick's tweet has nearly seven million followers.
He tweeted in Arabic yesterday: “Sisi is destined to be finished... He ’ s done, and the people who support him are now going to be making a big mistake. ”

Let Chinese citizens "go out" more at ease - Visit Cui Aimin, Director of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Wherever you go, the country is behind you.
On the 25th, the first foreign ministry's consular protection public welfare short film on the line, the short film at the end of this sentence resonated with the majority of netizens.
Cui Aimin, director of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency that the short film aims to further make the people feel the feelings and temperature of "diplomacy for the people", so that Chinese citizens can feel that no matter where they are located in any corner of the world, Chinese diplomats will lend a helping hand to them, give help, strength and hope.
Overseas peace is no small matter, a leaf of total concern.
Cui Aimin said that in the past seven decades, the number of Chinese citizens "going out" has increased sharply, from the "annual average of less than one million" before the reform and opening up to the current hundred million people every year. At the same time, the safety of Chinese citizens' overseas travel is more secure, and the work objects of consular protection and assistance have also expanded from overseas Chinese to overseas Chinese to overseas Chinese, tourists, international students, and migrant workers.
According to statistics, since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, we have organized and implemented more than ten major actions to evacuate overseas Chinese citizens from overseas, and safely evacuated more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.
Receiving and coordinating the handling of all kinds of help cases is about half a million cases involving nearly one million Chinese citizens.
In a dangerous moment, the motherland can take you home; if you want to "walk on a trip", it is no longer a dream.
According to Cui Aimin, as of the end of August this year, China has concluded a mutual visa exemption agreement with 14 countries covering ordinary passport holders.
In addition, more and more countries have unilaterally granted Chinese citizens visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to the country.
Forty-two countries and regions, such as Thailand and Egypt, unilaterally grant visas to Chinese citizens with ordinary passports, while 15 other countries and regions, such as Indonesia, unilaterally allow Chinese citizens with ordinary passports to enter the country without visa.
In addition to visa-free, visa-on-arrival and other arrangements, Chinese citizens are becoming more and more convenient to apply for visas, and procedures are becoming more and more simplified.
As of the end of August, China has reached agreements or arrangements to simplify visa procedures with 41 countries.
These include the two-year multi-time visa issued by the United States, Canada, Israel and Argentina for each other for tourism and business personnel, and the issuance of two-year multiple visa arrangements for each other's travel, business and family visitation with the United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom and Belgium jointly launched a "visa one-stop" service, with France, Italy and Singapore reducing visa acceptance times to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
For business people who often go abroad, the APEC business travel card that has entered the country multiple times and has convenient customs clearance is a good choice.
According to Cui Aimin, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining a multi-year visa for 16 economies around the Asia-Pacific region for five years, which is of great significance to business personnel, especially private enterprise personnel, "going out".
At present, China's effective card holdings rank first among APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, promote more countries to adopt visa facilitation measures for Chinese citizens, so that the results of diplomatic work will be more translated into measures to benefit the people and facilitate the people, and continuously improve the "gold content" of Chinese passports.

"One-to-one-to-one" two major UHV projects put into operation
On the 26th, the ±1100 kilovolt high-voltage direct current transmission project from Quangdong to the south of Anhui, and the Sutong 1000 kilovolt AC UHV GIL integrated pipe corridor project was put into operation.
Both projects occupy the commanding heights of the world's transmission technology in their respective fields, and will make China's large-scale optimized allocation of energy significantly improved after being put into operation.
Guo Zhi, chief economist of the National Energy Administration, said that the quasi-East to the south of the project is the world's largest power transmission capacity and the longest transmission distance of transmission.
Its operation is of great significance to promoting the development of Xinjiang's energy base and ensuring the power supply in East China.

The Sutong Pidens Corridor Project, which has created a record of the highest voltage level and the strongest transmission capacity of the global volt level of the GIL project, and has achieved the "communication duo loop" joint operation of the highest voltage level of the East China backbone power grid.
According to the State Grid Corporation, the power transmission distance from Quandong to Wannan is up to 3324 kilometers.
If conventional technology is used, more than 15% of the electrical energy will be lost on the way, and the project will be developed through research and development, which greatly increases the economic transmission distance to more than 3000km.
After the project is put into operation from Quandong to the south of Anhui, 100 million degrees of electricity can be delivered every eight hours and 20 minutes, which can help crack the problem of the consumption of existing new energy in Xinjiang.
According to the full load estimate, this line will reach 600 to 8.5 billion kilowatts of electricity per year, which can meet more than half of Shanghai's electricity consumption throughout the year.
The Sutong GIL integrated pipe corridor project is a control project for the UHV AC ring network across the Yangtze River.
If the conventional overhead line is used to cross the river, two giant towers of more than 450 meters need to be erected on the Yangtze River, and a super four football stadium-sized artificial islands are built for each tower.
In this regard, the national power grid bold innovation, developed a compact UHV AC GIL transmission technology, through the tunnel from the underwater river, to avoid the impact on the gold channel.
Two projects have promoted China's electrical equipment manufacturing capabilities to achieve a new leap.
At present, the national power grid has been built "10 to 11 direct" ultra-high voltage project, and there are "4 direct" in the construction.

He believes that Taiwanese businessmen need to keep pace with the times, and closely follow the mainstream industries in the development of the mainland, paying special attention to innovative products related to the fields of science and technology, culture, tourism and health.
"In the past, Taiwanese companies have attached importance to quality, effectiveness and delivery."
Chen Mingzhang believes that the above conditions alone are not enough in the present.
He pointed out that Taiwan-funded enterprises should have both the speed and service, speed up the supply chain, and attach importance to the extension service and life product services.
In addition, "service value-added" is also a new area that Taiwanese businessmen can vigorously develop.

New regulations for consultation: social capital to obtain rural land management rights need to be qualified
Social capital to obtain rural land management rights must be qualified
The Measures for the Management of Rural Land Management Rights shall be publicly solicited for comments, and the social capital transfer such as industrial and commercial enterprises shall be regulated for land management rights
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued a notice on the Measures for the Management of Rural Land Management Rights (Draft for Comment) (hereinafter referred to as the "Draft Opinions"), which increased the supervision and risk prevention of the right to land management of industrial and commercial enterprises and other social capital transfer.
The draft opinion is now open to the public for comments.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that in order to implement the newly revised Rural Land Contracting Law, further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system, and implement the "separation of three rights" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has revised the Measures for the Management of Rural Land Contract Management Rights and Management, and formed the "Professional Opinions".
Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned that the "Opinions Draft" published for the first time has many important changes.
The newly revised Rural Land Contracting Law clarifies the scope of land transfer, implements the concept of "separation of three rights", and sets up "land contract management rights" and "land management rights", respectively, and makes a clear distinction between the transfer, exchange and transfer of land management rights (rent, subcontracting, equity or other means).
In this "Draft Opinions", in order to implement the concept of "separation of three rights", effectively respond to the essence of the revision of the "Rural Land Contracting Law", taking into account the transfer of land management rights and land contract management rights swap, transfer in the parties, procedures, supervision and other aspects of the big difference, the draft of this revision of the scope of circulation, focusing on the land management rights of land management, including leasing, equity, etc.
For the transfer and exchange of land contract management rights, the management measures will be issued separately.
The "Professor" pointed out that in the context of "separation of powers", farmers' equity is only a land management right for a certain period of time.
In theory, even in the event of bankruptcy liquidation, the farmer only has the risk of losing the right to operate for a certain period of time, so it is not necessarily in principle that the return of the contract to the original contractor is no longer necessary and there is a conflict with the Bankruptcy Law.
In view of the problem of preventing the risk of landlessness of farmers, in practice, there are methods such as preferred stocks, first rent and then stocks, and repurchases.
Taking into account the fact that preferred stocks already have more mature theoretical discussions in the company law, it is recommended to use it as an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of loss of shares.
