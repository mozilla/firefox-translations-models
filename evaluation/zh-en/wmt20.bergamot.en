The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a report on the 26th that Iran has begun to use advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, in further violation of the 2015 nuclear agreement with the world's major powers.
According to the IAEA report, advanced centrifuges at Iran's Natanz Nuclear Facility are "accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium."
Since U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal last May and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran is gradually violating the limits of the 2015 nuclear deal with major powers.
The agreement stipulates that Iran can only use the first generation of IR-1 centrifuges to refine uranium.
Other signatories to the deal, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to salvage the deal, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
According to the Japanese Kyodo News Agency, on the afternoon of the 25th local time, Japanese Foreign Minister Motegi Minchong held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York, the country where he visited the United States, and confirmed that he would promote the conclusion and negotiation of a peace treaty including the four northern islands (the disputed islands of Japan and Russia, the Japanese name the "Northern Islands", the "Southern Kuril Islands") territorial issues, and the development of bilateral relations in a wide range of political and economic fields.
This is the first consultation with Russia since Motegi took office as foreign minister and as the head of the peace treaty conclusion negotiations.
Motegi told the Russian side that "including the promotion of common economic activities (in the four northern islands), we hope to effectively carry out consultations."
According to the Japanese government, the talks did not hold detailed discussions on the territorial issue.
At the Japan-Russia summit in December 2018, the two foreign ministers were confirmed as heads of the two countries to accelerate negotiations.
At the talks, the foreign ministers of the two countries welcomed the progress of consultations on common economic activities in the fields of tourism and waste disposal.
Motegi expressed his expectation for the pilot tourism business scheduled for October: "I hope to successfully implement it and promote the next step."
In addition, the talks also confirmed that Lavrov will cooperate with the G20 foreign ministers' meeting in Nagoya in November.

The women's team is expected to defend the World Cup in advance!
On the 27th, in the game against the Dutch women's volleyball team, the Chinese team was pulled back by the opponent in two consecutive games, and finally won nine consecutive victories with 3:1.
The schedule of the World Cup is nearing the end, although the defending is in sight, but in the face of Serbia, the Chinese women's volleyball team can not be taken lightly.
In the first two games of the match with the Netherlands, the performance of the Chinese women's volleyball team was as strong as ever, with 25:19, 25:16 respectively, the next two cities, until the third game, the team suffered a setback.
The Dutch women's volleyball team strengthened the offensive of the service in the case of backwardness, the Chinese team was hit by a pass, coupled with the girls' offensive heart, and the mistakes began to increase, and finally 21:25 was pulled back to a city by the opponent.
After the game, Lang Ping also pointed out in an interview: "The third game, because of the mistake we sent about 8 points."
Of course, the strength of the Dutch women's volleyball team should not be underestimated, the Chinese women's volleyball team also made a difficult preparation before the game, although losing a game, but everything is still in Lang Ping's control, "and the strong team to win or lose the game is very normal, playing five games is also very normal, so we said to the players to focus," Lang Ping said.
In the fourth game, the players actively adjusted their status, Zhang Changning was fully open in the offensive end, and he scored 8 points in a single game, making great contributions to the team's victory.
So far, the 11 rounds of confrontation are only two rounds left, although the Chinese women's volleyball team has touched the championship trophy with one hand, but in the game against the Netherlands, it did ring the alarm bell for the Chinese women's volleyball team: the more critical the moment, the more to go all out.
In another game on the 27th, the Russian and American women's volleyball teams filled five sets, and the U.S. team failed to take all three points from their opponents, so that as long as the Chinese women's volleyball team took all three points in the game against Serbia, they could defend one round ahead of schedule.
All kinds of situations are developing in favor of the Chinese women's volleyball team.
However, although the Serbian team is all absent from the six main forces, this does not mean that they will easily give the three points to the Chinese team.
From the current form of the standings, the Serbian team has basically missed the medal, which means that they can be in the game against the Chinese women's volleyball team "lightly loaded", put down the burden to attack the opponent, and the Chinese team is burdened with the pressure to win the championship, but the state may appear ups and downs.
In addition, the replacement of the Serbian team is not "man killed" lamb, before the Netherlands team in a battle, the two sides in the war 5, the Serbian second team finally 3:2 reversed the Netherlands's main lineup, which can see the thickness of its lineup depth.
Before the third stage of the game, Lang Ping also said that the two teams are not good to deal with: " Osaka's game will be very difficult, we still have to be as serious as always, seriously prepare."
Now the defending horn has been sounded, the game has really entered the "white heat stage".
On the strength of the lineup, the Chinese women's volleyball team is above the opponent, but only the last critical moment, but also depends on whether the women's volleyball girls can play a normal level and release themselves on the field.

“For 70 years, NATO’s containment and defense measures have been based on maintaining technological superiority,” Stoltenberg said in a speech at U.S. Military Academy at West Point.
He said, but times are changing.
Stoltenberg said: "We are facing increasingly fierce competition.
So we should now redouble our efforts to be sure that no one will overtake us."
"Some of the new technologies are not developed by NATO members, but in authoritarian countries," he said.
Chinese companies are working on 5G networks.
Russia is developing an independent Internet and investing heavily in the development of next-generation weapons, such as hypersonic missiles.”
Stoltenberg said NATO's future security "depends on the ability to understand, accept and apply the latest advanced technologies."
On September 24, the "one ferry ticket took me to see" love and disability activities were held in Changsha Orange State, and more than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to board the Orange Star Cruise to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Xiangjiang River and jointly celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Most of the more than 100 people with disabilities who participated in the event were on the cruise for the first time.
Zhao Zhengang, 56, is a disabled person who rarely goes out because of the inaccessibility of his feet.
He said: "Today for the first time on the cruise, close to enjoy the magnificent waves of the Xiangjiang River, feel the pulse of the development of Changsha, the mood is very excited, unforgettable."
Volunteers from the Fukang Social Work Service Center and the Blue Sky Rescue Team in Changsha City provided meticulous services for people with disabilities.
Especially for people with severe physical disabilities, volunteers will carry them on the cruise ship.
The relevant person in charge of the Fukang Social Work Service Center said that in the past 70 years, with the support of the party and the government, the cause of disabled people in Changsha has continued to develop and progress, more and more disabled people have truly become participants, contributors and enjoy social and economic development, and caring for and supporting the cause of disabled people has gradually become the consensus of the whole society.
The Republic is about to celebrate the 70th anniversary, and the spotlights of all the media are suddenly shining, so that many images that we usually do not remember, glitter - it is they who bring heat and light to our shining days, silky wisps, and bring light sources.
However, if the hero walks around, it also seems as ordinary as you are like me.
Yuan Longping, painstaking rice research, breeding good seeds all over the world, so that more than a billion people no more hungry, the success, this man is usually like an old farmer who likes to walk in the field; Nan Rendong, the chief scientist who is exhausted to let China's "eyes" rage, a person, a lifetime, a pot, a lifetime, only do one thing in the mountains, in Guizhou deep mountains.Youchang, a red scientist, a village boy who is very late, still like a bare child, studying in the west and the west, with a messy white hair, talking about learning to the heart, like to laugh; Qin Yi, a film artist who is half-red, over the age of ninety, also in order to play in the plateau every day bumping for six or seven hours, but also happy to play in the "fascination cat" in the unknown.
They, benevolent, live a simple, simple and persistent, as long as they are immersed in the cause of outsiders, they are not comfortable with their self-care, it is easy to be happy, do not care about the name of Lisuo, rich and prosperous.
Like Jin Yong's novel, the shrine monk in Shaolin Temple, although he has a shocking martial arts, is not dazzling, and there is no joy or sorrow.
Every "sweeper monk", every bare son's heart, has a country behind me.
The responsibility of the country is not only on the shoulders of heroes, but also on the palm of hundreds of millions of people.
Once, a female middle school student's words, by the netizen crazy, "when the hero passed, always have someone to sit on the side of the road to applaud ... I do not want to be a hero, I want to be sitting on the side of the road applauding people."
In fact, when the hero and the hero applaud, is not contradictory.
People who applaud on the roadside are also passing heat and light, and they are also luminous bodies.
Ordinary as you like me, there are always some opportunities in life, there are some moments, there is a kind of accumulated, but also to shape the hero's appearance.
Zou Bihua, an excellent judge in Shanghai, shouldered the responsibility of judicial reform, but at the annual meeting, let the communication teacher Fu take the stage to tell his story, a year to send countless newspaper letters, from no mistake, "to do simple things, is not simple", Zou Bihua led the judges will applause to the "sweeping monk" style of old send and receive.
This is a pity between the heroes, and a hero is applauding another hero.
The sweeping monk has Shaolin Temple Tibetan Jingu Pavilion, Yuan Longping has a vast rice experimental field, Nan Rendong has a "eye", Qin Yi has a stage, Zhou Yuchang has a pulpit... Whether he can be a hero, not only rely on his own efforts, but also has a good environment and positive incentive mechanism.
For example, "Chinese eye", now seems to be a myth.
In the 1990s, China's science and technology world was still struggling to climb, and the novelist Liu Cixin had not yet written "Three Body".
At that time, the most cattle "eye", is the United States Puerto Rico Valley in the single-sided caliber radio telescope - Arecibo, diameter of 350 meters, is considered "invincible" the world's most.
At that time, the Chinese radio telescope was not as large as one-tenth of the diameter of the people.
In Japan, who enjoys world-class scientific research conditions and salaries, Nan Rendong insists on returning home, bringing back an almost crazy idea: building a new generation of radio "big telescopes" in China to receive more information from outer space!
China is in ruins, investing a lot of money to play the stars?
The motherland trusts Nan Rendong, and the "Heaven's Eye" project is grand.
The site took 12 years, and the project was completed in 9 years.
The 500-meter caliber of "eyes" opened, China made no precedent, "the world's only unique big scientific project."
Therefore, the "eyes of heaven" are great, the Nan Rendong people are great, and the republic that is far away is great.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, Nanrendong has the opportunity to become the soul of the country.
There are young talents, white-haired heroes passing by, and people gently applauding on the roadside, such a country is very beautiful and harmonious.
Garbage classification education first into Jilin kindergarten environmental protection concept from the doll
On the 27th, a kindergarten in Jilin City, Jilin Province, carried out a garbage classification education class to teach young children to distinguish recyclable garbage and other types of garbage.
It is reported that this is the first time that garbage classification has entered the local early childhood education classroom.
Recently, Jilin Province, nine departments jointly issued the Jilin Province to promote the classification and treatment of municipal domestic waste work plan.
In 2019, on the basis of the pilot project of compulsory classification of domestic waste in Changchun, the province decided to carry out the classification of domestic waste in prefecture-level cities.
Jilin City is one of them.
We hope that through this event, we can realize the effect of driving families with young children and kindergartens to drive society, and advocate the concept of environmental protection.
Liu Lijuan, executive director of the International Kindergarten, who held the event, said.
On the same day, the director read the environmental protection proposal, hoping that the classification of garbage will start from the children.
After the children performed the "Low-Carbon Beibei" dance, they started a small game of garbage classification.
The instructor also issued “recyclable” and “other garbage” labels, suggesting that children stick to the trash and record small videos when they get home.
Liu Lijuan introduced that the kindergarten has always advocated the concept of low-carbon and green environmental protection, and regularly opened environmental protection lecture halls.
The garbage drop-off office in the park has also set up a taxable garbage can, which is marked with the placement category.
Teachers teach children what recyclable garbage 苍雁
According to preliminary statistics, the amount of urban domestic waste generated in Jilin Province in 2018 was about 5,465,2 million tons, all of which entered the domestic waste disposal site for processing.
Among them, the sanitary landfill was 3,292,900 tons, incineration of 2.0923 million tons, and 80,100 tons of comprehensive utilization processes were taken.
After years of efforts, all cities and counties in the province have the ability to treat domestic waste harmlessly.
In the work plan of Jilin Province to promote the classification and disposal of prefecture-level urban domestic waste, it is explicitly required to carry out in-depth activities such as garbage classification into schools, teaching materials, and into the classroom, and strengthen the interaction between students and parents by creating garbage classification songs, songs, comics, micro-videos and other works, so as to achieve the effect of "teaching a child, influencing a family, driving a community, and cultivating a new generation".

Due to the strategy of increasing brand value from a long-term perspective and reducing prices, it is reported that it has also had a great impact on sales.
Mazda's sales in the United States increased 7% year-on-year to 27,482 units, after a 14-month increase.
In August, the sales day of the seller was one day more than the previous year, and the "enhanced promotions such as publicity" (Mazda) increased sales of SUVs such as "CX-5".
Domestic sales in Japan fell 6% to 14,422 units.
The company said the emergency snap-up before the tax increase "didn't go to the level of the last time (2014)."
Sales of small cars such as "Demio" decreased.
Chirac's death, political legacy persists
On the 26th local time, former French President Jacques Chirac died suddenly at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is in the midst of a century of unprecedented change, the many political legacies left by this French politician during his time in power are still worthy of our praise.
Chirac served as president of France for 12 years in a very humiliating manner.
He inherited the diplomatic spirit of Gaullism's independence and independence, but also firmly supported European integration, and was a representative of the pursuit of the "European dream".
At the same time, he also vigorously advocates multi-polarization and multilateralism in the world, and is a politician with strategic vision.
That is why the French media described him as "France's outstanding representative on the world stage".
One of Chirac’s relishing political decisions was his opposition to the US-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France and Germany stood up to the pressure of the United States and were at the forefront of the anti-war.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to increased terrorist activity and made the world more dangerous.
Later it turned out that Chirac’s warning was correct.
At a time when European integration is in a trance and the unilateralism of the United States is becoming more and more prominent, Chirac is undoubtedly of great inspiration for strategic thinking and choice in international politics and global affairs.
Chirac is also a French politician who makes the Chinese feel familiar and affectionate.
He is one of the advocates and creators of the "Golden Decade" of Sino-French relations, and after being elected as the French president for the first time in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of Sino-French relations with a strategic vision of politicians.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges between China and France entered a new stage.
During the Jacques administration, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and the cooperation between the two countries in various fields such as aviation, nuclear energy and railway transportation has made breakthrough progress.
The Chinese-French Year of Culture initiated by Chirac has created a new model of cultural exchange in the history of China and France.
Chirac’s lifelong love of Chinese culture was particularly impressive.
It is understood that his Chinese diplomat introduced that Chirac can carry some poems of Li Bai and Du Fu, and even accurately judge the historical era of Chinese bronzes.
"Not looking at the pyramids is not really to go to Egypt, and not to see Qin Jun really to China" - this golden sentence comes from Chirac.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Chirac said: "The West has concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems caused by China's economic growth, and China's political status in the international arena.
I have full confidence in China.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is enough to help it build the concept and values of harmonious development and shoulder its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time.”
I also believe that China's rejuvenation will bring new creative vitality to the world culture and enrich the world culture.
The Szs have gone, but Chirac left the world with a legacy and revelation will live on.

The statement, signed by 40 formed councillors, said that the rights enjoyed by Hong Kong are vested in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, including maintaining the status of free trade port and separate customs territory, signing and implementing bilateral and multilateral agreements in the name of "Hong Kong, China" in different fields such as economy, finance, shipping, trade, trade, trade, tourism, culture and sports, and signing and implementing bilateral and multilateral agreements in the name of "Hong Kong, China".
These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always strictly adhered to international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, trade with different countries and regions, and participated in many relevant areas of cooperation.
The statement said that the move by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House and Senate of the United States to pass the relevant bill is not necessary, but in response to the call of its agents, as a means of crudely interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs and seeking political leverage for their agents in Hong Kong.
Members of the establishment deeply regretd the move by the United States Congress and strongly opposed it.
Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the largest source of trade surplus.
Hong Kong's excellent rule of law, fair and free business environment, and a clean society make it a good place for American businessmen to do business.
If the United States passes this bill, in addition to attacking the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself, it will make Sino-US relations worse, without any benefit and harm to others.
The statement said that Hong Kong will, as always, unswervingly implement the "one country, two systems" policy, continue to enjoy the rights granted by the Basic Law, and earnestly fulfill its obligations.
Whether in the past, present or future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and international trade.
According to the European Times on the 26th, the two houses of the French parliament will discuss immigration reform next week.
French President Emmanuel Macron recently claimed that France cannot “accept everyone,” but at the same time strives to “accept properly.”
Macron is trying to find a compromise route on immigration, slowing the impact of the upcoming debate.
Recently, Macron said in an interview during the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly in New York that he hoped to have a real "two-pronged" solution on immigration policy to find a balance between humanitarian and efficiency.
Macron said: "If France wants to be able to accept (immigration) properly, it will not be able to accept everyone."
Macron listed four priorities for immigration policy: granting asylum status to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; more efficient promotion of integration of migrants; receiving and protecting all migrants entering French territory; and more efficient resettlement of people who enter France illegally and who are not suitable forstaying.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the National Medical Assistance (AME) system is the most discussed topic.
Macron said he hoped to “assess” the system, but would not lift it, but would limit it.
After Macron's remarks, Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Alliance, tweeted that Macron's statement was "empty talk".
Senate President Josh Lascher, a member of the right-wing Republican Party, also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a "mitative" but "realistic" way, indirectly criticizing Macron.
Varau, a member of parliament for the left-wing Socialist Party, said France should "accept more and better" on immigration, and criticized Macron for "manipulating" the issue.
The new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act, which has been in place for a year, has led to disagreements within the ruling party but has not been able to appease right-wing opposition parties.
In the next 2022 election, the topic of immigration policy will once again be the focus of attacks on the far right, and Macron needs to make a difference on this issue, but he will also risk angering the left wing inside the ruling party.
The lower chamber of the French National Assembly will debate immigration policy on September 30, and the Senate will debate it on October 2.
There are signs that China's A-shares are ushering in a "repurchase tide", and many listed companies have come up with "real money and silver" to buy back the company's shares.
According to the statistics of financial data service provider Oriental Wealth, as of the 27th, the total amount of repurchases of A-share listed companies in 2019 has exceeded 100 billion yuan (RMB, the same below), far exceeding the data of the same period in previous years, setting a record high in the amount of A-share stock repurchase funds.
In this regard, Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Mei Kerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said that the overall valuation of the A-share market this year is low, and the repurchase of shares at a relatively low price is conducive to listed companies to improve the efficiency of the use of funds, and also reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage market value and abundant cash flow, which is conducive to boosting investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the share repurchase system has also promoted listed companies to actively carry out share repurchases.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued the implementation rules for the repurchase of shares of listed companies, providing detailed share repurchase norms and guidelines for listed companies.
According to media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented the repurchase plan have been mainly concentrated in the infrastructure industry, the real estate industry, the information technology industry and the electronic equipment manufacturing industry.
In addition, from the perspective of the amount of repurchase payments, six listed companies have repurchased more than 1 billion yuan this year.
Among them, the first is Yili shares, whose repurchase amount is more than 5 billion yuan.
What impact will the stock buyback of listed companies have on the market?
Zhao Xijun, vice president of the School of Finance and Finance of Renmin University of China, said in an interview with China News Agency that on the one hand, the repurchase shows that listed companies have strong economic strength and better financial situation, and has the ability to maintain stable stock prices and give investors confidence; on the other hand, it also shows that listed companies and their controlling shareholders are responsible for the company, the market is responsible and responsible for investors.
The former is based on the company's good operating performance, while the latter requires listed companies and their controlling shareholders to have high quality.
For the capital market, this is the core basic elements.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence and supporting the stock prices of listed companies.
According to the Oriental Securities Research Report, according to the estimated number of shares repurchased by the A-share listed companies as a whole since the beginning of this year, as well as the average price of repurchased shares, the incremental funds brought by the repurchase of shares for the A-share market this year are expected to exceed 150 billion yuan.
In nearly two months, the restoration of the large-scale mural "Tianjin Tin Hau Temple" of the national key cultural protection unit was announced on the 26th, and it will be reopened to the outside world during the National Day this year.
The Tin Hauss map is a large-scale traditional mural that comprehensively reflects the life of the mother.

In the restoration, we have also made innovations and attempts in color, materials, pen and ink and so on.
After the restoration, the original mural style, spirituality, spirit and artistic style were maintained.

Shandong original Shouguang County Party Secretary Wang Boxiang - Qiang County Fumin Ao Zixin - Xinhua.com
Wang Boxiang, Shandong Shouguang, born in February 1943, participated in the work in 1967, and has successively held the positions of township party secretary, county party secretary, mayor and so on.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang was the party secretary of Shouguang County in Shandong Province, and at that time, Shouguang was a poor county in Weifang.
In the five years of his tenure, Wang Boxiang focused on doing three things with the hearts of the people: one is to promote the industrialization of vegetables; the other is to develop the saline beach in the north; the third is to lay the foundation for the industry to turn over, so that the Shouguang people have raised their pockets and raised their waistboards from now on.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of planting vegetables, and there are lessons of planting vegetables.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers could not sell their harvest and rotted in the ground.
Wang Boxiang research found that the key to grasping vegetables is to do a good job of circulation.
Shouguang took the lead in building a wholesale vegetable market, which opened the prelude to the development of a market economy.
Party members and cadres should take the lead, screw up, and bear all the losses in the county.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Boxiang, Sanyuan Zhucun Wang Leyi and other 17 party members started 17 winter warm vegetable greenhouses, when the village emerged 17 "20,000 households".
Subsequently, the county set up a promotion group, under the mobilization of Wang Boxiang, Wang Leyi toured and guided in various townships; in the first year, more than 5,000 vegetable greenhouses were promoted, and then the trend of vegetable greenhouses was pushed to the whole county and even the whole country.
For thousands of years, in addition to the saline beach, 1.6 million acres of land in the north have been painted on shallow beaches.
Life in the local area is very difficult.
Shounan has a vegetable greenhouse, what to do in the north?
Wang Boxiang organized hundreds of thousands of people to engage in the conference war, encamped on the deserted alkali beach, a job is 40 or 50 days.
Wang Boxiang and the county's leading cadres eat and live on the site, with migrant workers like the cart pick-up, wind and dining, the people see them all stretching their thumbs, heart-to-heart admiration ... ... At that time, Shoubei developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, in the salt and alkali beach coated to develop a "concentrated pot".
In July 1986, Wang Boxiang participated in the Weifang City Industrial Conference for the first time as the secretary of the county party committee.
During the meeting, a "Weifang City 12 counties of urban industrial economy digital comparison table", at first glance, the total industrial output value, Shouguang is not bad, ranked fourth.
However, if the original salt is removed, the pure industrial output value of Shouguang is only 119 million yuan, ranking third to the bottom.
Wang Boxiang with more than 70 people to learn the group, ran to the field "change the brain."
Less than a year after returning, the county invested 150 million yuan and put on 77 projects.
Since then, every year to organize the "learned group", to Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai and other places to learn.
There is a lack of business and a shortage of entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang presided over the special meeting: in the county's open selection of factory manager, 40 "career-minded people" stood out and were pushed to the front line of the industry.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the top 100 counties in the country, and Wang was transferred to the vice mayor of Weifang City.
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable greenhouses, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, is 4854 enterprises, is more than 100,000 "million households", is the people's recognition of cadres. Shouguang people still affectionately call him "our Boxiang secretary".
On September 26, local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presided over the Foreign Ministers' Meeting of China and the African Member States of the Security Council at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
Foreign Minister Tano of Côte d'Ivoire, Foreign Minister of Equatorial Guinea Oyono, South African Foreign Minister Pandor and Foreign Minister Kara of Niger, and Tunisian Foreign Minister Jesinavi attended the meeting.
Wang Yi put forward four suggestions on strengthening cooperation between China and Africa in the Security Council.
First, by uniting strength.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, the direct consequence of which is that the basic norms governing international relations are being challenged and the role of the United Nations is being undermined, which harms the interests of the vast number of developing countries and small and medium-sized countries, including African countries.
To meet this challenge, it is necessary for China and Africa to be hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder, so that unity can only be strong.
In the Security Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, focusing not just on three votes, but on the entire African continent.
Standing with China and Africa is not just four votes, but will lead other countries to follow suit, influence and shape the agenda of the Security Council.
Since 2018, China and the African members of the Security Council have established a "3+1" coordination mechanism, which should be fully utilized.
Second, solve the dispute through consultation.
China has always advocated the political settlement of hotspot issues, and Africa has a good tradition of consultation and the experience of successful mediation by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex problems on the Council's agenda, particularly in Africa, have been largely the root causes of colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.
We must make good use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and give full play to the role of the United Nations in good offices and mediation.
Third, self-reliance.
African countries and people know Africa's problems best, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve their own problems.
When dealing with hot-spot issues in Africa, the Security Council should focus on listening to and respecting the will of Africa, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is willing to strengthen coordination with the African side and firmly promote capacity-building for Africa's autonomous peace operations.
Fourth, it is fundamental to develop.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries, and we must put economic and social development first and support each other's development path.
China is willing to closely align the Belt and Road Initiative with the African Union's Agenda 2063, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the development strategies of African countries, so as to help African countries enhance their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflict.
We must jointly promote the United Nations to increase its investment in Africa's development.
The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has made and will continue to make every effort to provide human and material assistance to the best of its ability, and is willing to coordinate actions with African countries, mobilize the United Nations, WHO and other countries to increase assistance, and give full play to the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

This time, the Trudeau tripped out of the "big hole", it is Trudeau himself dug out a little bit.
Recently, the Canadian media has exposed a number of old photos of the current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which Trudeau disguised himself as a black image.
This is considered to be an obvious act of racial discrimination, which has caused an uproar in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
Canadians, however, are not buying much.
Trudeau threw stones at his feet.
As political commentators Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the "anti-blackface movement" in the United States, Trudeau and the federal Liberal Party have been high-profile accusations that the opposition party or those who disagree with the party have "lost a lot" in this regard, and repeatedly threatened that "whoever makes this mistake should be immediately dismissed."
Simply put, this time Trudeau tripped out of a "big hole", it is Trudeau himself dug out a little bit.
Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, is young and handsome, and when he first came out, he had a whirlwind of “political idols”.
Originally a "political amateur", he took over as the head of the federal Liberal Party, fought an unexpected and beautiful battle in the 2015 federal legislative election in Canada - the federal Liberal Party won more than half of the seats in the lower house of the federal government, and won the valuable individual cabinet.
At that time, Trudeau put forward many deafening political platforms and concepts, such as "ethnicity and gender equality", "ecological environmental protection", "economic revitalization", emphasizing the elimination of corruption and "injustice".
However, in the past five years of power, he has been in power in almost all aspects of the above, "high and low."
Take the "ethnicity and gender equality" issue, let's leave aside the "blackface" incident, after he "voicing and not" on a series of indigenous issues, so that aboriginal groups and leaders moved the protest tent to the door of the Capitol Hill on the 150th anniversary of Canada's founding.
In terms of eliminating corruption, at the end of last year, Trudeau was involved in the "Lan Wanling Incident", which was in full swing.
It was exposed that the major illegal and fraudulent cases of "Lan Wanling", a construction engineering company in his hometown, put pressure on the departments and officials responsible for investigation and punishment, and asked the latter to "raise their noble hands".
Moreover, Trudeau, after the big news, was angered by the officials who disclosed the abuses - Wang Zhoudi, mentioned above, who was the first to disclose the case and directly handled the case.
Although the case itself is still suspicious, its suspicion is difficult to wash away.
Many observers pointed out that Trudeau's five-year-old man's collapse was mainly due to his own "pitch", and the biggest "pit" was "tiger head", "self-inflicted fruit" and "wider than self-discipline, strict with the law".
According to Canada’s most authoritative Angus-Red poll, since 2015, pro-Truth respondents have slid from more than 60% to more than 30%, while opponents have soared from less than 30% to more than 60%.
Although other opposition parties and their leaders have also performed poorly, even a significant number of voters who are willing to vote for the federal Liberal Party are now disapproving of the federal prime minister and the leader of the ruling party.
On October 21, the new Canadian federal legislative election is about to begin, can Trudeau repeat the drama that won the big victory five years ago?
The answer may be in one word: difficult.
Whether it is from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or from the regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration level, has a profound impact and positive significance.
On September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially opened.
The Beijing News reporter learned from the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission that the capital airport has been in a state of super-saturated operation, and the opening of Daxing International Airport will enhance the capital's air service capabilities.
After Shanghai, Beijing has become the second city in China with two airports, and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport mainly serves domestic aviation affairs, Pudong Airport is similar to international shipping and aviation, and the future capital airport and Daxing Airport will also serve the differentiated positioning of domestic and international aviation business, providing more segmented services.
Daxing Airport, from the perspective of business development, is more of a positive impact on the capital airport.
Capital Airport's passenger throughput exceeded 100 million in 2018, ranking first in the country, but compared with the fast-growing business demand, there is still a significant difference in capacity, especially the demand for international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passengers for travel and travel, and to adapt to the urban development trend of Beijing's increasingly open and international standards, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large-scale international hub airport, and plans to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million passengers and 4 million tons of cargo and mail throughput in the future.
Therefore, the two airports do not overlap, respectively, for different customer groups, also have enough market space.
From the economic accounting point of view, the opening of Daxing International Airport will obviously form a win-win effect, alleviate the tension of Beijing Airlines, accelerate the growth rate of passenger and cargo throughput, and create an incremental cake for the dual nuclear operation of Capital Airlines.
From the user's point of view, with the opening of Daxing International Airport, it is not necessary to focus on the capital airport in the future, but also to reduce a series of problems caused by the excessive concentration of routes, such as the longer the security time of the station, the slow boarding speed of passengers, indirectly increase the time of the aircraft and passengers at the airport, increase the burden of airport operation, and reduce the burden of shipping through the capital airport, in fact, it also improves the travel experience of passengers.
According to the media to go to the large international airport a variety of traffic route time and cost estimates, such as from the south of the fifth ring to take the Beijing high-speed directly on the Daxing airport high-speed, 50 minutes to drive, oil money back and forth 40 yuan, high-speed fee of 15 yuan; and choose the rail transit subway Daxing airport line, the distance according to the distance of 20 kilometers, 30 kilometers as a limit, the fare is divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan three gear; citizens can also take the Beijing Xiong intercity, from Beijing West Station to Daxing Airport station.
In general, the public to Daxing airport have a variety of transportation options, the cost and time is also within a reasonable range.
From the perspective of trend development: Daxing Airport is positioned as a Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei transportation hub, so it is a little farther away from Beijing, but it has strengthened the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, which has facilitated more people's travel and is of great significance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, passengers in Hebei and Tianjin can enjoy more international air route services provided by Daxing International Airport, which can be seen from the transportation planning of Daxing Airport.
Daxing Airport's supporting transportation facilities are very perfect, in addition to the new airport line directly to Daxing Airport in Beijing, there are many highways connecting Daxing Airport and surrounding areas.
Just as Guangdong Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other urban passengers can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport through Guangfo, Guangshen and other highways, residents of Langfang, Xiongan New Area and other places around Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport to obtain convenient and efficient air services.
It can be seen that the navigation of Daxing International Airport not only adds several runways and several aircraft, whether it is from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience level, or from the regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration level, has far-reaching impact and positive significance, not only related to the long-term layout and development of Beijing's shipping industry, but also provides diversified choices for the travel of the vast number of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei residents, and further enhances the quality of Beijing's shipping industry.
Therefore, for the navigation of Daxing Airport, we should not only calculate the small account of individuals in the economy, but also the big account of overall development.

2019 Vietnam Economic and Social Issues Forum Held in Chengtian Hue Province
Nguyen De Cian, deputy director of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, said that at the beginning of this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new improvements and continued to grow.
The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first few months of 2019, and proposed measures for economic and social development at the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the forum, the participants exchanged in-depth views on four topics: economic development in 2019 and the impact of some free trade agreements, some outstanding issues in Vietnam's economy in 2019, outstanding issues in Vietnamese society and culture in 2019, and the forecast and recommendations for Vietnam's economic and social development in 2020.
Delegates generally believe that in the first few months of 2019, global economic growth slowed down and increased risks and challenges.
Trade frictions between major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) determined that despite the global economic uncertainty, 70% of the world's economies have been stagnant, Vietnam's economic development has made many gratifying achievements, with the stable macroeconomic operation and the effective control of inflation. In the first half of 2019, the consumer price index increased by an average of 2.64%, the lowest growth rate in nearly three years.
GDP grew by 6.76% in the first half of 2019, although lower than 7.05 percent in the same period last year, but the increase is still high compared with the same period in 2011-2017.
In making a forecast for Vietnam's economic development trend in 2019-2020, Deng Deying, deputy director of the Vietnam National Economic and Social Forecast Center, said that in the context of the turmoil in the world economy, Vietnam's economy showed a high growth momentum in 2019.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macro economy will continue to remain basically stable, the implementation of various free trade agreements will promote trade development, and the adjustment of economic restructuring and the improvement of the business environment will be further strengthened.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring and forecasting early warning mechanism, take the initiative to find trade relief measures for Vietnam's export commodities, find opportunities to expand new export markets, and create convenience for the export of various commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, the inflation rate is kept at a reasonable level to promote the development of auxiliary industries and support the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and ecological agriculture.
Liu Zhijie, director of the Consular Office of the Chinese Embassy in Siem Reap, held a reception in Siem Reap on the 26th to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Liu Zhijie said that since the founding of New China 70 years ago, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributed more Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to improving global economic governance and promoting global common development, made important contributions to world peace and development, and brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and people's livelihood.
Liu Zhijie said that as the world's second largest economy, China's contribution to world economic growth is more than 30%, especially China's "Belt and Road" initiative, and the cooperation between China's local provinces and cities and Siem Reap and Territorial provinces continues to deepen.
He said that this year is the beginning of the 61st anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia, the two countries have fraternal friendship, and China-Cambodia mutually beneficial cooperation will become the driving force for local economic and social development.
Siem Reap Governor Diseha highly praised the great achievements of New China in the past 70 years and congratulated the two countries on the achievements of friendly cooperation.
Dissegha expects the two sides to continue to work together to promote China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit, and continuously improve people's living standards.
Diasaiha said that the friendly exchanges between Siem Reap Province and the provinces and cities of China are remarkable, so far with 28 provinces and cities in China to conclude friendly city relations, large-scale cultural and performing arts projects "Angkor Smile" and "Angkor Dynasty" landed, Siem Reap-Guangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park, Siem Reap New International Airport project, Siem Reap Provincial Government Officials Special Training Course, Siem Reap students to study in China, rural clinics, and the revision of urban roads, catarism..

Witness the "cloud rise" of digital China in Yunqi Town - Xinhua
If the local website forum in 2009 is the original point, the 2019 Yunqi Conference held in Hangzhou from 25 to 27 has gone through a full decade.
From the concept of "cloud in the fog" to the practice of "up cloud", big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies supporting China's economic development, social management and public services in the past 10 years.
In the Zhengtai new energy photovoltaic cell workshop in Haining, Zhejiang Province, there are more new "colleagues" loaded with Aliyun artificial intelligence next to the recent quality inspectors.
It is 24 hours, the recognition speed is more than twice that of manual, and the accuracy rate of quality inspection is stable at more than 95%.
According to the person in charge of the company, the "quality inspector" with a camera has focused on learning more than 40,000 flaw samples, with the cloud computing power behind it, it can quickly convert infrared images into binary language, and will have flawless battery cells.
This company is just a microcosm of today’s cloud computing powering the transformation of the manufacturing industry.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the "Guidelines for Promoting the Implementation of the Cloud for Enterprises (2018-2020)", and proposed that by 2020, we will strive to achieve a significant increase in the awareness and enthusiasm of enterprises on the cloud, and significantly increase the proportion and application depth of the cloud.
Wang Jian, founder of Alibaba Cloud, said that today, data-centric cloud computing has built a bridge for data as a key element of the digital economy and opened up a road.
At the same time, in the past 10 years, the scale of China's cloud computing industry has also continued to expand.
China Academy of Information and Communications Technology in July this year released the "cloud computing development white paper (2019)" shows that in 2018 China's overall cloud computing market size of 96.28 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2% over 2017.
In addition to becoming a key technology to support industrial transformation and digital economy development, the invisible "cloud" has also unknowingly changed urban management and social life.
At this year's Yunqi Conference, the "city brain" that debuted for three consecutive years is still of concern.
At present, the city brain has become the center of urban management from a means of transportation management, and the relevant cooperation applications have been expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the city brain through a strong computing power, so that "stop first and pay after payment", "the number of visits in real time", "tourist line design" and other new urban management services can be realized.
In the field of government services, with "one cloud" docking "one thing", the "hands-on office", "hands-on" collaborative promotion, cloud computing for the supply of government services at both ends to bring convenience.
At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform for the province through government affairs.
As of September 11, the platform has covered more than 57 million resident residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province, and has a collection of 190.8 billion data in the 3066 category of governance.
Zhejiang provincial government departments on average monthly call, sharing data has reached 12 million times, data on the "cloud" call flow, may mean that the masses do less errands.
Make tea with plastic tea bags!
According to the Central News Agency, a new study in Canada recently found that a bag of plastic tea bags may release billions or even tens of billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than the amount of microplastics that a person is estimated to consume throughout the year, but so far there is no evidence that ingesting plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
According to reports, researchers at the University of Magill in Canada found that by dimmering a plastic tea bag into a cup of almost boiled hot water (95 degrees Celsius), the tea bag would release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than the amount of microplastics an estimated person consumes throughout the year.
According to research published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 microplastics a year and inhales the same amount of microplastics.
It is reported that the study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, and the researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montreal stores and cafes, opened the tea bags, immersed the tea bags in almost boiling water for 5 minutes after cleaning, and then analyzed them with electron microscopes and spectrometers.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, "several times higher than the plastic load of other food before."
Most tea bags are made of natural fibers, but many brands that use natural fibers still use plastic to seal up.
Some branded tea bags have been made of paper and used plastic, and these plastic tea bags are the subject of the researchers.
Plastic particles are tiny fragments of plastics, and researchers have defined these microplastics to be between 100 nanometers and 5 mm, mainly due to the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in the air, soil, rivers and deepest trenches around the world, and these microplastics can also be found in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
In October 2018, researchers first found plastic particles in human stool samples in several countries in different regions of the world.
To test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released by tea bags, the Canadian research team put water flea into contaminated water and found that microplastics affected the behavior of these water fleas and caused them to develop deformities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence that ingesting plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO notes that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and what impact they have on humans.
The researchers speculate that the reason why these tea bags release a large amount of plastic particles may be that these plastic tea bags come into contact with boiling water, and even when the "edible grade" plastic is heated to more than 40 degrees Celsius, it may decompose or exud toxic substances.
Guterres said the climate emergency is the biggest threat to the survival of small island states.
There, a natural disaster can erode the development gains of a generation.
The devastation in the hurricanes of this year’s hurricanes in Baquda, Dominica and the Bahamas have illustrated this point.
About one quarter of the population of small island developing States lives at an altitude of 5 metres or below.
Relocations can seriously affect their social and lifestyle and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At the Climate Action Summit on Monday, small island nations committed to achieving carbon-neutral and 100 percent renewable energy by 2030, once again leading the world in the right direction.
“The climate crisis is piling up new injustices on old ones.
Although the contribution of small island developing States to global warming is small, it has paid the highest price.
As these countries are in a middle-income status, many countries are also trapped in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disaster and debt.
The world must act, and it is time to make big decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States.”
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for help from small island developing States to manage disaster risks, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and ways to transition to renewable energy; and urged international institutions to help small island developing States, especially debt-laden middle-income countries, access to finance.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the planet's lifeline, the oceans.
The latest special report released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have suffered the “blown” severe consequences of the climate crisis.
By mid-century, many regions could experience extreme sea-level rise every year, once in a century.
The report warns that some island nations are likely to become uninhabitable without investing heavily in adaptation.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused enormous losses.
In the last 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, and plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the last 40 years.
Demand from industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a decline in resources, including the maintenance of fishing grounds in many island communities.
Small island States also face high costs for transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, making them subject to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also grappling with the security implications of illicit trafficking in human beings, weapons and drugs.
“By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, this problem can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with the tools, lessons and examples that the world can learn from.”
He stressed that small island developing States were a special case of sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
India’s finance ministry said the financial system was sufficiently mobile.
India's Finance Minister Sitharaman said on the 26th that the current financial system is fully mobile, driven by holiday consumer demand, India's economic growth is expected to recover in the second half of the current fiscal year.
Sitharaman made the remarks after a meeting with representatives of private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks and other institutions in India.
Sitharaman did not specify the specificity of the remarks.
Some Indian media and overseas media have blamed the continued slowdown in India’s current economic slowdown on the liquidity constraints of non-bank financial institutions.
Sitharaman cited the example of a decline in car sales, denying that liquidity constraints were the main reason for the decline in sales.
Sitharaman pointed out that the decline in car sales is mainly caused by cyclical factors.
Sitharaman expects India’s economic growth to resume in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday spending.
India’s annual shopping season begins in September and will run until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping consumption will greatly boost India's economic growth.
The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education recently issued a notice prohibiting primary and secondary schools in the province from making illegal remedial classes during the National Day holiday, and organizing personnel to conduct random and unannounced visits.

We will do a good job in the implementation of the sow production, earnestly implement the subsidy policy for breeding sows, encourage breeding pig enterprises to expand the scale of breeding pigs, and systematically select excellent sows from the group of commercial pigs.
Make good use of investment promotion, and take the domestic well-known large-scale aquaculture enterprises that have not yet entered our province as the top priority of investment attraction.
We will do a good job in implementing the market circulation system, accelerate the construction of cold chain logistics facilities for pigs, and comprehensively promote the transformation from "pig" to "meat-to-meat".
To do a good job in the implementation of the modern epidemic prevention system, all localities should be equipped with grass-roots epidemic prevention and quarantine personnel who are compatible with the scale of breeding and work tasks, and build the first line of defense for epidemic prevention and control.
Sui loyalism requires that the supply of meat market be fully guaranteed, ensuring that there is no large-scale shortage and large-scale supply cuts, and ensuring the stable supply of pork market on major holidays.
The meeting also deployed the prevention and control of the African swine fever epidemic, the prohibition and withdrawal of fishing in important waters of the river basin of our provincial governor, and the acquisition of middle and late rice in the province.

“Overage migrant workers on some sites are estimated to account for more than half.
Where do we find young workers?
There is no way to use so many "old people" on the construction site.
Recently, for the existence of a lot of over-age migrant workers (exceeding the retirement age) on the construction site, Zou Kui, who has been working as an engineering contractor in the construction industry for a long time, lamented.
Recently, the author's university to carry out rain and sewage diversion project, there are many migrant workers on campus, if you pay attention to observation, you will find that there are a lot of over-age migrant workers.
Over-age migrant workers are not "idle", but because of "cannot idle", with "have to be so" helplessness and hardship - whether it is to save money to solve their own old-age and medical problems, or to help their children, they should be "free" old people continue to work hard.
Over-aged migrant workers "old and dependent", not as easy as we think.
Raising children, support the elderly, for children to read, help children build a building to buy a car, help children to start a family, raise grandchildren, when these migrant workers have completed the "life task", the money bag has been hollowed out and even a lot of debt, most of them lack of wealth accumulation.
In order not to drag their children and to save themselves more wealth, many migrant workers insist on "doing until they can't do it."
Many of the "post-80s", "post-90s" and even "post-00s" of the new generation of migrant workers are not willing to engage in difficult conditions, high labor intensity of the secondary industry or low-end service industry, resulting in a structural "labor shortage", these unattractive work, to provide opportunities for overage migrant workers.
Due to the lack of a skill, physical function and labor ability have declined, and many over-age migrant workers are doing jobs with high intensity, low income, high risk and less protection.
A capable day is a day, can earn a little more is a little, "can not idle" behind the survival of the elderly migrant workers, can not be ignored and ignored.
To solve the problem of unpaid wages and wage collection, improve labor protection, reduce security risks, increase labor income, and improve the living conditions of over-age migrant workers, in addition to their "self-redemption", it is also inseparable from the public sector's institutional protection and humanistic care.
Some scholars pointed out that over-age migrant workers are no longer likely to rely on returning home to the land to solve their own problems of old-age care and medical care, and they must support their families through other methods.
Reading the helplessness and strength of over-age migrant workers "cannot be idle" helps us better understand the love and pain of overage migrant workers.
Seeing the back of over-age migrant workers, hearing their sighs, and trying to make them truly "old and dependent" when they return to the countryside, they need the public sector, the market and society to share responsibility in a benign interaction, and need multi-party efforts.
Chemezov said that Russia will not export such a system in the next five years, because "the supply of its own army first, and only after that export production will be carried out."
This practice is in full compliance with international practice.
Major producers of weapons and military equipment always first secure their own defense needs before processing export orders.
Earlier, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Air and Space Forces, General Yuri Grekhov, said that the development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by "Diamond-Aetna" air and space defense Kangtsen.
This is a new generation of air defense systems that take the working principle of destroying ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main role of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles with a range of less than 3,500 kilometers.
In addition, according to some data, the S-500 can also destroy hypersonic cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles more than 5 times the speed of sound, and even targets in near space.
This weapon can also be integrated with other air defense systems to a unified network, especially the S-400 system, which is very important from a defense point of view.
Sergey Chemezov expressed particular concern about the S-400.
The system is currently in great demand in the world, but the Russian military needs it, including in the Arctic, he said.
The S-400 air defense system is in service with the Arctic Air Defense Regiment.
According to the news on September 15, the conversion of the S-400 air defense missile system by the Arctic Air Defense Mission of New World Island has been completed.
This is not Russia’s militarization of the Arctic.
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, this is entirely a process within the transition plan for more advanced defense tools in the strategic direction of the north.
"With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controllable airspace in the Arctic has increased significantly," said the press service of the Russian Northern Fleet.
It is very important that the military assesses that the system has been used successfully in the Far North and the Arctic.
The air defense regiments trained on the new system and were ready to enter combat duty.
Previously equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system, it still retains part of it.
When it comes to air defense systems, they must have weapons capable of destroying a variety of air targets, whether they are targets flying at high speeds at an outer altitude or close to the "leaky fish" of protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by Gold Diamond-Aetna Air Defense Kontien, is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other aerial attack weapons.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 km and shoots down ballistic targets flying at 4.8 km/s at a distance of 60 km.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defenses in the Far North to ensure the safety of airspace over the Northern Sea Route.
Not long ago, the first 12 Tor-M2DT air defense missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, which is enough to form an air defense battalion to strengthen the air defense system in the Arctic.
The Russian Defense Ministry said at that time that the Arctic "Tor" forces will be expanded to a complete brigade-level establishment in the future.
Coupled with the newly deployed S-400 long-range system on the island and the Kola Peninsula and the Pantsir-SA short-range system deployed in the Far North, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons forcefully defend Russia’s polar skies.
Enemies aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles will be difficult to break through this defense.
According to the Russian government's idea, the flagship store will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complicated and long process of opening their own stores.
As the operator of Russian stores, Russo Multi-company focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
China's largest trading platforms such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, Hand Q (ShouQ), and WeChat, have their own online platform, and have their own online platform, Epinduo.com, and the Russian retail chain of goods.
The Russian export center will work with Russia to develop store marketing strategies and participation standards, and screen virtual shelf companies.
The store is scheduled to open and list products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers by the end of this year.
According to the data of the Russian export center, the total number of visits by Chinese e-commerce platforms is as high as 1 billion per month.
At the same time, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, exceeding $1 billion in 2018.
Alibaba Group will also open a pilot store within the framework of the global import strategy to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.
According to Alexei Kozhevnikov, the new store will display the goods of enterprises with sales of at least 500 million rubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and sales of 500 million rubles are not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers are quite positive about Russian goods, and regard our products as high-quality and green products."
Kozhevnikov said that the competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and increasing.
“Our goal is ambitious, with 500 businesses coming through this store in three years,” he said.
At the same time, the platform will also be listed on the products of enterprises in the Russian Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor in the Department of Trade Policy Foundations at Plekhanov Economic University in Russia, said: “This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export center is a state-owned rather than a private institution.”
"I don't see a lot of very competitive Russian goods in the market."
He believes that the project is likely not to be implemented, but it will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
Andrey Slepnev, president of the Russian Export Center, said during the Eastern Economic Forum that product information for more than 170 Russian companies has been published on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform, and can be purchased in China and other countries.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, that is, the training program of experts from Taobao University for Russian enterprises, whose first seminar was held in July this year.
At the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November this year, the Russian Export Center will also serve as the organizing party of Russian enterprises to participate in industry exhibitions and commercial projects.
A large-scale exhibition will be held in the 1,000-square-meter exhibition hall, which will also be the center for commercial project activities, the signing ceremony of the agreement, the promotion meeting and the talks with Chinese business representatives.
About 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The press service of the Russian Export Center said: “In addition to the agricultural booth, we will certainly hold business meetings, that is, to arrange direct contacts between entrepreneurs.”
“This is another direction of our efforts to support businesses and ensure that dozens of dedicated meetings are scheduled for them.”
In addition, the exhibition will also host masterclasses, cooking competitions and Russian food tastings for famous Russian chefs in the “Exploring the Shanghai Station of Russian Cuisine”.

New China Times Review: Unswervingly Take Our Own Path
The white paper "China and the World in the New Era" released on the 27th answers: In the past 70 years, the fundamental reason for China's development success is that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the correct development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and followed this path unswervingly.
China's development path is the choice of history and the choice of the people.
Since modern times, in the environment of poverty and weakness, internal and external troubles, generations of benevolent people have sought up and down the road to save the country and the people.
However, "constitutional monarchy, restoration of the monarchy, parliamentarism, multi-party system, presidential system have thought and tried, and the result will not work."
It was not until the Communist Party of China and the new China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The road that China has embarked on is the road to the happiness of the Chinese people and the road of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the road of common development between China and all countries in the world.
It is precisely because it is on the right path that China can do its own thing well, become the world's second largest economy and the country that contributes the most to global economic growth, and can continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As pointed out in the white paper, China's development path, in line with China's national conditions, in line with the requirements of the times, will show more and more bright development prospects with the advancement of the times.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how easy it is to find the right path; looking around the world, the Chinese people cherish this right path more.
Chinese people understand the truth of the southern orange maple, understand that suitable for others is not necessarily suitable for themselves, only suitable for their own is the best.
It is with this road self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created a miracle that has attracted the attention of the world.
In the process of human progress, the "final conclusion of history" has been famous.
Today, the success of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics has announced the end of the "end of history", the collapse of the "China collapse theory", and the failure of the "socialist failure theory".
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries to achieve national wealth and strength, expanded the way for developing countries to modernize, and provided experience and reference for those countries and peoples in the world who both want to accelerate development and maintain their own independence, and take the road that suits their national conditions.
The world is rich.
China has always respected the right of all countries to choose a development path suited to their national conditions.
China does not "import" the foreign model, nor does it "export" the Chinese model, but will unswervingly follow its own path, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen the governance and exchanges with other countries, and make due contributions to the common realization of good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that the owner of a Foodworks supermarket had slammed the "shame" for firing a 66-year-old female worker by text message because he preferred to hire employees from an Asian background.
The commission said the way Jianbin Wang, the owner of Ms. Gail Ayton, who has worked at the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, treated employees in a "extremely unfair" way and may have violated anti-discrimination laws.
Ms Ayton told the committee that Mr. Wang had taken over the store in 2016 and that he had been “wanting to fire me” because she was not Chinese.
In this case, Peter Sams, vice chairman of the committee, conducted a search on the Internet and found that "Mr. Wang has posted some job advertisements on various Chinese-Australian employment forums in the past".
Of the job requirements listed for these positions, one said "first-choice Asian lady" and the other said "Asia employee preferred".
The third post said he was "more inclined to be overseas."
Mr Wang fired Ms Ayton via text message in April, later saying it was due to her absence and a small cash deficit from $5.10 to $30 at the cash register.
But Mr. Sams said Mr. Wang’s reasons for firing Ms Ayton were weak and there was a lack of evidence.
In the past three years, she has been absent from one shift, and the "missing amount" totals several Australian dollars.
He said Ms Ayton's firing "hasn't actually anything to do with her actions or actions".
"In my opinion, supported by the evidence of Mr. Wang's job advertisement, the real motive for the abhorrees' dismissal was that he would rather hire employees with Asian backgrounds," he said.
Under section 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's conduct ostensibly constitutes a violation of the Anti-Discrimination Act and/or an unlawful act of dismissal against the applicant.
Mr. Sams said it would be inappropriate for Wang to consider reinstating her position in view of the “horrible” treatment of Ms Ayton.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton, a temporary worker who earns $26 an hour.
In light of possible violations of anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation, Sams said he would refer his ruling and documents to the committee’s director to consider whether Mr. Wang’s actions should be referred to other bodies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
He said Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged grounds for firing her.
"I believe that the apologist has taken an incorrigible unfair and biased process to dismiss the applicant, and Mr. Wang 'waits' for this opportunity, which he believes will 'justify' the termination of the applicant's employment," he said.
“He was wrong ... to dismiss the applicant in a total disregard for any natural and just treatment given to her, and it is shocking that he acted impertinently and grossly unjustly perfunctorily.”
Mr. Sams said that while Foodworks is a small business, “it must be frank that no decent employer will fire an employee in the manner admitted in this case to the extreme unfairness and perfunctory manner.”
He said, "It's shameful and it's grossly unfair."

Six people denied that they were involved in the sale of fake Maca newspaper paper to the High Court for trial.
Six men suspected of falsifying and selling passports, paper and identity cards in China, including an assistant director of the State Name Registration Bureau and a Datuk-level businessman, passed the case on Thursday, and the court judge approved the charges against anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking in immigrants and transferred them to the High Court for trial.
Among them, the defense lawyer who originally represented Datuk Chinese defendant Li Zhenhua and also the member of the Sundong District Congress, Rael, applied to the judge to withdraw from the trial on behalf of the case, that is, no longer became the defendant's representative lawyer, and was approved in court.
He said that he himself had attracted criticism from political opponents on behalf of the accused, and his party of action was implicated.

The six defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (SOSMA) and therefore the judge did not grant bail.

Overall, I think Vietnam’s future is bright in the context of high growth, strong economic development path and rapid development of talent base.

World's oldest barber dies at 108, haircuts 96 years
Anthony Mancinelli, the world's oldest barber certified by the world's Guinness Book of World Records, is a 108-year-old who never retired to pay a daily barber for a guest, but on the 19th Mancinelli died of complications from jaw cancer, saying goodbye to his 96-year-long haircut.
According to CNN, Mansinelli immigrated to the United States when he was 8 years old, and soon helped clean the floor at a barbershop, and at the age of 12, he began to pick up scissors to serve guests, thereby reducing the economic pressure on the family.
Mancinelli attended elementary school at the time, but did not graduate.
Mancinelli's son, Robert, revealed that his father loved work and people from all over the world loved him, but although his father was always healthy, he was diagnosed with cancer in February this year, and finally could not work due to physical factors six weeks before his death, but this was not retirement, because he planned to come back to cut his hair when he was better.
Robert, 82, said he now had to find a new barber after his father died because he had asked him to help him cut his hair all his life.
Listed companies repurchase scale of more than 100 billion yuan reached a record high - Xinhua
In order to stabilize the company's stock price and maintain the company's image, listed companies have begun to frequently repurchase shares in the past two years, and hope to pass the information on the company's undervalued value to the market through targeted repurchases and collective bidding transactions, so as to stabilize the stock price and enhance investor confidence.
Oriental Fortune Choice data show that in 2017, listed companies to repurchase shares of the funds for 7.9 billion yuan, soared to 51 billion yuan in 2018, since 2019, the total amount of A-share listed companies repurchase implementation has exceeded 100 billion yuan, setting a new high in the amount of A-shares have been repurchased, and far exceeded the previous year.
From the perspective of the purpose of repurchase, the company's repurchase of shares and the increase of major shareholders seem to be the same, but there are great differences in terms of implementation, source of funds, repurchase use, and equity of the shares themselves.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Mei Kerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said in an interview with the "Securities Daily" reporter that in November 2018, the "Opinions on Supporting the Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies" was revised for the problems of the current system such as the narrow scope of share repurchase, complicated decision-making procedures and inadequate inventory system.
In January this year, the SSE and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange officially released the "implementation rules for repurchasing shares of listed companies", the introduction of these policies, broadened the listed companies to buy back the source of funds, appropriate simplification of the implementation procedures, guidance and improvement of governance arrangements, to encourage all kinds of listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee stock ownership plans.
After the introduction of the opinion, the operation of the stock repurchase of listed companies has more applicable circumstances, the repurchase process is simpler, and the enthusiasm for share repurchase is greater.
Repurchasing shares in a relatively low position is also conducive to listed companies to improve the efficiency of the use of funds, thereby increasing the level of earnings per share, increasing the return on net assets, and reducing the pressure on the company's profit indicators.
Compared with the increase of major shareholders, the repurchase of shares by listed companies is of greater significance, and it also reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage market value and abundant cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that the stock price is undervalued as the main factor for the repurchase of listed companies, and the company's share price has not reflected the company's future development prospects, so such companies deserve the attention of investors, but they cannot blindly invest, and they need to pay attention to the financial reports of such listed companies and the specific business situation.
Listed companies with large-scale repurchases have at least shown the company's development confidence and financial strength.
The enthusiasm for repurchases of A-share listed companies has gradually heated up, which has also normalized the repurchase behavior, and the data shows that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented share repurchases this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the main force in the repurchase market.
China Ping An recently disclosed repurchase progress that the company has repurchased 57.59 million shares of A shares through centralized bidding transactions, accounting for 0.315% of the company's total share capital, and the total amount of funds paid has been 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction fees), and the repurchased shares will be used for employee stock ownership plans, including but not limited to the long-term service plan that has been considered at the company's shareholders meeting.
Yili shares have paid 5.792 billion yuan for share repurchase, and in the recent adjustment of the use of repurchased shares, from the original plan "repurchase shares will be used as a source of stock for the later implementation of equity incentives" to "accumumulated repurchase of 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares for the implementation of equity incentive stock source, the remaining 30.49 million shares will be used to cancel to reduce the registered capital."
Yili said that the cancellation of some of the repurchased shares is conducive to further improving the level of earnings per share and effectively improving the return on investment of the company's shareholders.
TCL Group issued a repurchase progress announcement on September 25, showing that TCL Group repurchased 3.59% of the company's shares, costing a total of 1.65 billion yuan.
The office of the board of directors of TCL Group told the Securities Daily reporter that the repurchased shares will be used for employee stock ownership plans, equity incentives or corporate bonds that can be converted into stocks issued by listed companies.
TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy, continuously improves competitiveness and continues to develop healthily.
Based on the confidence in the company's future development and the protection of investors' interests, combined with the performance of the company's stock in the secondary market for nearly a year, and taking into account the company's operating situation and financial situation and other factors, the company plans to use its own funds, self-financing and other financing methods to buy back the company's shares.
Yang Delong, chief economist of Qianhai Open Source Fund, said that the operation of listed companies to buy back shares, on the one hand, can reduce the number of shares circulating in the market, increase the earnings per share of listed companies, which is an important benefit for the share price of the secondary market; in addition, listed companies are willing to take the initiative to take out real gold and silver, and buy back shares from the stock market.
The repurchase of domestic listed companies has gradually increased in recent years, especially the performance of high-performing stocks, and it is a very good way to boost investor confidence through share repurchases, and it is also a practice worthy of recognition and encouragement.

Construction machinery Xiangjun "four major Kong", is the leader of the Changsha construction machinery industry cluster, but also the head of the global construction machinery industry.
In the global industry, who lives down and lives well is the hard breath to speak.
In the early years, the global construction machinery industry suffered a cold winter, many internationally renowned construction machinery manufacturing enterprises have fallen down, but Changsha's construction machinery manufacturing enterprises will "cat winter" as "winter swimming", self-pressure, self-breakthrough, through the transformation of industrial structure, from manufacturing to intelligent transformation, not only through the past, but also stronger bones.
It is because of the stars that hold the moon's government and give strength.
The development of advantageous industries requires both enterprises to be aggressive and the government to actively act.
The reason why Changsha has the reputation of "construction machinery capital" is that it brings together the entire industrial chain from upstream to downstream, creates many related industrial clusters, and has greatly reduced the R&D, manufacturing and sales costs of enterprises through decentralization and service measures such as optimizing the business environment, improving supporting services, and simplifying the approval process.
Good business ecology, so that construction machinery manufacturing enterprises come.
History has pushed Changsha to the front desk to build the leading level of global construction machinery, and it is not to be left behind.
Whether it is the government, or enterprises, and even related to the industry, university and research and other links, should seize the opportunity, follow the trend, set the goal, continue to make efforts, and contribute to the construction and manufacturing of a strong country in Hunan.

Gansu Qingyang: Lake sheep to "poverty alleviation."
The autumn of September renders the Loess Plateau.
In the Yimin Breeding Professional Cooperative in Yima Town, 58-year-old villager Shavili filled the trough in the sheep fold with the last tarpade, kept it on the edge of the trough, and watched the white lake sheep chew.
"Eat well, wait for the autumn and winter to be full, out of the box to sell a good price."
Shaveli said that he fed the sheep a "special nutritious meal" every day, regularly cleaned, sterilized and disinfected, and carefully served the fear of slackening.
Chaveli raised sheep for more than 20 years, until he came to the cooperative to work, he knew how extensive sheep had been in the past.
Shawili is a villager in Xia Shuikechi, Yima Town, Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His neighbors on the left and right are sheep farmers, but they adhere to the traditional way of free-range, the quality of the sheep is poor, and the amount of the market is small.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative, and everything began to change.
Shaveli spent all day working on farming, because he always had a breath in his heart.
The people who share in the shares are all poor households, they all host the sheep to the cooperative, and whether they can pay dividends and sell the price at the end of the year, they all count on him.
Fortunately, with the guidance of technical personnel, he slowly learned to engage in epidemic prevention, mastered scientific feeding, and became one of the few farming "good" in the village.
Yimin Breeding Professional Cooperative is a standardized cooperative with a total of 16 Aries sheds and nearly 1,400 lake sheep.
Zou Tao, the head of the cooperative, said that the inside and outside of the standardized sheep shed are very doorways.
"wool thick, easy to breed bacteria, lake sheep in the hot and wet place can not be, the shed must be built in the three sides of the ditch, but also have to install a fan to ventilate heat."
Zou Tao said that in order to prevent the epidemic, it is also necessary to spray the sheep sheds on a regular basis and give the sheep three to four epidemics in the first quarter.
In addition to living well, "little fat sheep" must also eat grass mixed with silage corn, wheatgrass, alfalfa, etc., and have a wide enough "firefield" to stretch the bones.
Cooperatives adopt the method of trusteeship and breeding, and guide local farmers to put good seeded lake sheep here, unified breeding, management and sales, and realize good breeding, scientificization, standardization, and intensive breeding.
At present, 140 poor households with sheep shareholding, each household dividends of more than 6000 yuan per year, there are 4 file-based poverty alleviation objects working in cooperatives.
From "mountain grazing" to "accurate feeding", from "local mating" to "artificial insemination", from "seeing the body type, touching the belly" to "doing B super one by one"... In Qingyang, Gansu, mutton farming is not only the change of feeding mode, "leading enterprises + cooperatives + farmers" model is to change the scene of "lays on the hillside, selling sheep in the market", overcome the traditional agricultural and animal husbandry.
Zou Tao said that if the market price is weak, the local leading enterprise Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd. will be guaranteed at a market protection price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers disperse market risks.
Xu Jianfeng, general counsel of Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd., said that enterprises have driven more and more poor households to read the "Sheep Sutra" by providing loan guarantees, sheep planting, order breeding, quotation acquisition, unified processing and sales services for poor households.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have achieved stable income growth through "joining" grass-fed farming, breeding, large-scale breeding, slaughtering and segmentation, and market sales.
Qingyang City is located in the northern agricultural and animal husbandry staggered belt, and the forage resources are rich.
At present, there are 913 large-scale farms and cooperatives in the city, with more than 5 million sheep, and two processing production lines of 1.3 million sheep slaughter scale have been built.
French finance minister says he will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros next year and calls on Germany to follow suit
PARIS, Sept 26 (Reuters) - France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday, and that Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revive its sluggish economy.
Introducing France’s 2020 budget, Le Maire said the ECB’s latest monetary easing initiative has created an opportunity for member governments that can afford them to invest.
The European Central Bank cut interest rates to a record low on September 12 and plans to restart bond purchases in hopes of incentivizing economic recovery and pushing up inflation.
“Low interest rates will not allow Europe to prosper again, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough,” Le Maire told reporters.
"Germany needs to invest, it needs to be, the sooner the better. Don't wait until the situation gets worse before it acts," he added.
He has made this call to Germany on several occasions.
France has already implemented more than 10 billion euros in tax cuts this year, which has given a big boost to France's economic growth.
The global economy has lost momentum, and the German economy, which relies on exports, has borne the brunt.
Le Maire pointed out that the tax burden of French families will be reduced by 9.3 billion euros next year, including 5 billion euros in income tax relief.
In addition, with the gradual reduction of the corporate tax rate from 33.3% to 25% over the five-year period, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly 1 billion euros.

Study: U.S. National Healthy Eating Index Increases Slightly, but Still Challenging
Recently, a new study in the United States shows that in the past 16 years, the US government's healthy diet index has increased moderately, from 56 to 58.
But with a score of 100, it’s not worth celebrating.
U.S. citizens still face “significant challenges” in their diet.
One of the study’s authors, Dr. Fang Fang Zhang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said Americans still consume too much food that can cause heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other diseases, which are the most common diseases in the United States.
The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on the 24th.
The study is based on the findings of a U.S. government health survey of 44,000 adults conducted between 1999 and 2016.
The authors write that "significant dietary challenges remain despite considerable improvements."
These challenges include allowing U.S. citizens to reduce their intake of snacks, hot dogs, fat cows, butter and other foods containing saturated fat.
The study found that people's daily dietary intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended upper limit of 10%.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. diet is that sugar intake has been reduced from 16% to about 14%, but the intake is still too high.
The official opinion that the intake of added sugar should be less than 10% in the daily diet.
For the reasons for the reduction in sugar intake, the researchers believe that it is related to the reduction of people drinking sweet soda, but Zhang Fangfang stressed that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
U.S. adults have a small increase in their intake of fruits, nuts, oats, and other whole grain categories.
However, data from 2016 shows that these foods still account for less than 5% of the daily diet.
Although people's intake of salt has decreased slightly, and the reduction in drinking fruit juice has led to low-quality carbohydrate intake, Zhang Fangfang said that they still account for up to 42% of daily calories, many of which come from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study was based on a biennial personal health survey that allowed adults to recall the food they had eaten in the past 24 hours.
These health surveys have asked this question twice every few days since 2003.
The government's dietary guidelines for U.S. residents recommend adopting a "healthy eating pattern" to reduce the likelihood of chronic disease.
The guidelines state that people should consume more nutrient-dense foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, lean meats, poultry meats, eggs, and seed foods that can provide protein.
The number of people with diabetes in the U.S. nearly doubled, more than 7 percent, during the study period, and obesity rates increased over many years of the studyâ€”more than 70 percent of U.S. adults are now overweight or obese.
Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States.

The country's first joint-stock bank financial subsidiary was established to use science and technology to empower asset management business
On the 26th, Everbright Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary Everbright Financial Co., Ltd. was officially established in Qingdao, which is the first joint-stock bank financial subsidiary established in China.
Experts said that asset management is an important area for the development of financial technology, and the establishment of a financial management subsidiary by the bank is conducive to its use of scientific and technological means to enhance the asset management business.
In April this year, Everbright Bank and China Merchants Bank respectively announced that they had been approved by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission to build a financial management subsidiary.
On September 24, Everbright Bank announced that Everbright Financial Management had been officially approved to open.
Just two days later, Everbright Bank led many joint-stock banks and took the lead in establishing Everbright Financial Management in Qingdao.
Li Xiaopeng, chairman of Everbright Group, said that Everbright Group will accelerate the pace of innovation, use modern scientific and technological thinking and means, relying on big data, Internet of Things, and cloud computing to improve the coverage, utilization rate and penetration of financial capital, and improve customers' sense of gain, happiness and security.
By 2021, establish and improve the "four beams and eight pillars" of China's financial technology development, further enhance the ability of financial industry science and technology applications, achieve deep integration and coordinated development of finance and technology, and significantly enhance the people's satisfaction with digital, networked and intelligent financial products and services.
Zhang Xuyang, chairman of Everbright Financial Management, introduced that the asset management platform of Everbright Financial will use intelligent investment, intelligent investment research, big data and other technologies to help Everbright Financial to better judge the macroeconomic situation.
In the future, new technologies such as blockchain will also be applied to grasp the direction and trend of from traditional assets to alternative assets to digital alternative assets.
Dong Ximing, a special researcher of the National Finance and Development Laboratory, said that in the face of a new competitive situation in the asset management industry, financial technology companies and asset management institutions will jointly explore new growth paths with asset management technology.
The financial technology enables the asset management industry, which is not only the need for the transformation and development of financial technology itself, but also injects new vitality and vitality into the development of asset management business.
At the beginning of this year, Jingdong Digital Technology launched a new asset management technology system to enhance the product development and risk control capabilities of asset management with the help of technology and digital means.
The new system starts from the four capabilities of product design, sales transactions, asset management and risk assessment to improve the overall intelligent operation level of the asset management industry.
Experts believe that while improving customer service capabilities and innovating rich products, asset management technology can also enhance risk prevention capabilities and improve asset management efficiency.
Zhang Xuyang said that in the past, the risk appetite of customers through questionnaires was prone to deviations, and now the use of artificial intelligence for user portraits helps to better target customers, and launches corresponding products according to customer investment preferences, which helps to resolve risks.
"E-commerce, space-time data and other alternative big data can help us better carve a region, an industry activity, prosperity."
Zhang Xuyang said that while resolving risks, big data technology will also help improve risk control capabilities.
China's deepest record for railway tunnel shafts has been set
China-Singapore Social Security Mountain September 27th (Zhang Weiming Xu Zhou Jingbo) After more than 1200 days of day and night construction, in the construction of the University (Li) Rui (Li) Railway Gaoligongshan Tunnel No. 1 shaft completed excavation on the 27th, the well depth reached 762.59 meters below the ground, breaking the record of the deepest shaft in China's railway tunnel, and this record was created in a large number of water surges.
The 34.5-kilometer-long Darui Railway Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel is located in Yunnan, and the tunnel runs through the Gaoligong Mountain Mountains from the west bank of the Fury River, and is the longest tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel passes through 19 fracture zones and is buried at a maximum depth of 1,155 meters, as it covers almost all the bad geology and major risks that may be encountered in tunnel construction, and the Gaoligongshan Tunnel is known as the "geological museum" of tunnel construction.
The shaft is the most important auxiliary tunnel of the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel, and it is shouldering the important task of increasing the working surface to achieve "long tunnel short play" and the ventilation of railway operation in the later period.
The first shaft was successfully dug to the bottom of the well, marking the Gaoligongshan Tunnel officially entered the horizontal tunnel construction, and after the excavation and equipment replacement of the bottom of the well yard, the underground can increase 4 working surfaces to speed up the excavation speed of the tunnel.
"The shaft is all in the granite formation, because the granite formation cracks more, can not stop the water, from the top to the bottom of the flow, basically how deep the well how much deep water pressure."
China Railway Tunnel Bureau Da Rui Railway Project Department chief engineer Shi Jingzhao told reporters that in the construction of the shaft, there have been many times in the danger of sudden mud surge, collapse, etc. The construction party invited experts to put the pulse on the spot, more than 20 times to discuss the treatment plan.
"The maximum water surge in the shaft, up to more than 300 cubic meters per hour, more than 700 meters deep at the bottom of the well, the water pressure is equivalent to 700 meters deep seabed."
"If you don't pump and drain in time, it will flood the well 10 meters in an hour, we are almost 85% of the time for water treatment, and 15% of the time is spent digging."
In order to overcome the geological problems such as longitudinal development, sudden mud surge water, and water-rich granite, the tunnel construction adopts systematic water treatment measures combined with "exploration, injection and excavation" to reduce the construction risk.
After many improvements, the construction of the No. 1 shaft has formed a mechanized pipeline such as excavation system, rut system, suspension system, and winch lifting system, which has realized the whole process of mechanized operations such as eye-catching, blasting, out-of-cell, template installation, and concrete pouring, and accelerated the construction progress.
Finally, after more than 1,200 days of day and night construction, the shaft successfully completed the excavation at a depth of 762.59 meters.
With a total length of 330 kilometers, it is an important part of the China-Myanmar international channel and an important transportation infrastructure for the implementation of the “Belt and Road” construction.
After the completion of the opening of the train, the driving time from Dali to Ruili will be shortened from the current highway to 2 hours, which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in the western region and promote economic and trade cooperation and people-to-people exchanges between China and Southeast Asian countries.

Pilot notification commitment system in the field of low-risk variety food production license, and delegate authority to the free trade zone for the handling of foreign enterprises' representative offices
On the 27th, the Shanghai Municipal Market Supervision Bureau and the Pudong New Area Government signed a working memorandum to launch 20 market supervision and reform measures, some of which are the first pilot in the country.
According to reports, the notification commitment refers to the administrative organ in writing to inform the applicant of the conditions and requirements stipulated by laws and regulations in writing when handling the relevant licensing registration matters.
After the applicant signs the commitment, the administrative organ can directly handle it.
According to the memorandum, the Shanghai market supervision department will support the registration of the Pudong New Area and the Shanghai Free Trade Pilot Zone in the enterprise name registration, handle the simple process and low-risk variety food production license, and partially approve the type of measuring instruments and other three areas of pilot notification commitment system, so that enterprises can enter more easily.
Shanghai Shaoweng Food Co., Ltd. obtained the "Food Production License" on the spot by informing the commitment on the 27th, becoming the first enterprise to enjoy the pilot dividend.
The person in charge of the enterprise said that the food license can also be obtained on the spot, but also took the "lack of acceptance" approach, that is, allowing enterprises to submit some materials in accordance with the time limit agreed in the letter of notification, "really feel the convenience of reform."
The Shanghai market supervision department said that the implementation of the notification commitment system for food production licenses is the first pilot in the country.
After the reform, the approval link was reduced from the previous six links of "registration, acceptance, on-site verification, sample inspection, material review, approval and certification" to 3 links of "registration, acceptance, and approval of documents", and the completion time was shortened from 20 working days before the reform to the on-the-spot completion.
Taking into account the high degree of extrovertibility of Pudong's economy, the Shanghai market supervision department will delegate the registration authority of the permanent representative office of foreign (regional) enterprises to the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, which is convenient for enterprises to handle it nearby.
Statistics show that the delegation of authority involves a total of 1,592 permanent offices in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, of which 99 have been handled in accordance with the new regulations.

In the afternoon, I began to be lonely, and I did not want to go out, and I had not yet adjusted the state of the children not around.
Start the spirit and say to the dog, “Mom takes you out the door.”
Write a few things to do when you go out, the personality characteristics of type A blood are getting stronger and stronger, and they all feel very awkward.
Take a suit, buy nutrient grains, pay, buy sashinoflames, and nanas snacks.
Here are the reasons to go out.
On the phone, I just lost my sister's love of nana, otherwise there was no excuse for buying a small snack.
I laughed a little there and said that the child came to the phone and hung up.
Nana car familiar with the road jumped on the assistant's seat, honestly lying down, she knew that she was sick, scared, and not willing to accompany me.
My husband, Beau, came back early.
Even admire the delicious salad made by the salmon avocado, and then went to the bedroom to lie in bed and watch TV.
A glance at the harp on the wall, just seven o'clock, the sunrise country sunset is also early, the sky has been dark.
The circle of friends is in the invention month, it turns out that today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.
Wash a bunch of grapes sent by friends, leave half of them to Boao, and put the rest in your favorite small flower bowl, and go out to see the moon.
And Nana sat on the ground, and she ate the grapes, and she ate the skin, and I spit the seeds of the grapes far away again.
The moon is hiding in the clouds, so that the clouds are walking, the moon suddenly appeared, and the dark is a little dazzling.
There are various poems about the moon, but only clearly like this sentence: every three or five days to reunite / full of clear light guardrail / a round of heaven to hold out / the human name to look up.
Perhaps we give the moon too much emotion, for now I come to the bottom, in fact, that God's word to God, Caesar's return to Caesar is the best.
The moon is the moon, and the mood is your own.
After eating the grapes, this group of cold moons is cold.
Nana had a slight snoring at his feet, and got up and laid Nana's little blanket on the edge of her little house, and Nana lay happily on it.
Open the door and yell: Is the bath water burning?
From the bathroom window is not to see the moon, can only feel the moon color, turn off the bathroom lights, huh to pull the glass.
I didn’t eat moon cakes or drink.

Is MWa in the by-election for the National Assembly seat in Tanjung Pirao, Johor?
Datuk Seri Wei Jiaxiang, President of MCA: "Discussion by the Supreme Council of the Barisan Nasional!"
The by-election of the Danjong Biai National Seat is imminent, and whether the MCA of the member party of the BN is in this traditional national table is of concern.
However, after the meeting of the CMA CEC, it was announced that it would be handed over to the Supreme Council of the Barisan Nasional to decide whether the traditional maltice seat would continue to be handed over to the imagray or to the other member parties to replace it.
Wei Jiaxiang, after presiding over the meeting of the MIC Central Committee on Thursday afternoon, told the media that any by-elections will be carried out by the Barisan Nasional in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), that is, after the meeting of the BN Supreme Council, before the case can be finalized.
He said that since the Election Commission will meet next Monday (1st) to finalize the by-election for the Tanjung Biai, the meeting of the BN Supreme Council is expected to be held in early October.
"Yesterday morning, I also met with BN President Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid, and we all agreed that we must regain this seat from Pakatan Harapan."
"We have finalized a meeting of the leaders of the Special Barisan Nasional in early October, and the leaders of the three parties of the Barisan Nasional will determine which party will be in the line."
Asked whether MCA would insist on taking up the traditional seat to the Barisan Nasional Supreme Council, Wei reiterated that as MCA president, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures, so any decision must be reached by the Barisan Nasional consensus.
"In any by-election, some people are willing to go out, there are political parties, there is a way to think that they should come out, this is a common thing."
“The most important thing is what kind of organization and political alliance we come from?”
"This is a big test of our political alliance for many years, and we believe that Barisan Nasional has come all the way and holds some valuable value."
"Someone may say something in the process, and that's not surprising."
"However, once the BN Supreme Council has made a decision, we must be fully prepared for the war, that is the most valuable."
In any case, Wei Jiaxiang said that imahua will make all-out efforts to prepare for the upcoming Tanjung Biai by-election at three levels, namely, the District Council, the State Board and the Central Committee.
"The District Council will be led by Datuk Seri Huang Risheng, Chairman of the (Tanjong Piai) District Council; the State Board will be led by Datuk Lin Peixing, Deputy Chairman of the Joint Commission of Johor; as for the Central Committee, Datuk Ma Hanshun, Chief Secretary, and Datuk Zhang Shengwen, Chief Secretary, will personally deploy."

A villager hunted wild animals in Baokang County, Hubei Province, was ordered to "obligate to patrol the mountain"
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province, was sentenced for hunting wild animals and ordered to compensate 15,420 yuan (RMB, the same below) for the restoration of ecological resources and environmental damage.
Due to the poverty of the defendant's family, the procuratorial organ activated the cost of ecological restoration of alternative labor compensation, and realized the organic unification of legal and social effects.
Wang Zhongliang, deputy procurator of the Baokang County Procuratorate, introduced on the 27th that through three months of alternative labor such as "obligatory mountain patrol", the defendant Zhou has established a deep feeling with wild macaque monkeys, and deeply blames himself for hunting animals before.
On June 21 this year, a criminal incidental civil public interest lawsuit in the field of ecological resources filed by the Baokang County Procuratorate was publicly heard in the county court and pronounced in court.
The defendant Zhou was sentenced to three years in prison, suspended for four years, and fined 3,000 yuan, and ordered to compensate ecological resources and environmental damage repair costs of 15,420 yuan.
After investigation, Zhou began to set up a power grid on the cliffs in late January 2014, and has hunted more than 20 wild animals, including wildebeest, small, and crown deer.
It belongs to the national second-class endangered wild protected animals, and small and crowned deer are listed in the National Terrestrial Wildlife Conservation List.
During the trial, Zhou confessed to his illegal facts and actions, and was willing to bear incidental civil liability.
However, considering the poor economic situation in Zhou's home, under the coordination of the Baokang County Procuratorate, the local village committee, the forest station, and Zhou reached an agreement on the cost of alternative labor compensation for ecological restoration: that is, Zhou has provided public welfare services to offset the ecological restoration costs by carrying out macaque monkey domestication and care work in the village macaque protection area, compulsory mountain patrol and forest protection for one year.
For the prosecutor's recommendation, the court agreed to Zhou's execution of probation and actively fulfilled the obligation of "alternative labor compensation for ecological restoration costs".
At present, Zhou has been working in the macaque protection area for 3 months, and has been actively patrolling the mountain and performing well.
In recent years, the Baokang County Procuratorate has organically integrated procuratorial functions and social governance behaviors in practice, scientifically used procuratorial recommendations, investigation supervision, litigation supervision and other supervision methods, and used judicial means to minimize the damage caused by criminal acts to the ecological environment.
UN awards ‘Defender of the Earth’ award for Ant Forest
In the warm applause and grand music, Xu Di, head of the "Animal Forest" project, and Shen Junliang, a user representative, took the podium and took the trophy of the 2019 United Nations Champions of the Earth Award from the host.
The 2019 "Defender of the Earth Award" ceremony was held in New York, United States, on the 26th, and the "Animal Forest" project, which has driven hundreds of millions of people to participate in environmental protection actions, won the "Inspire and Action Award" award.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced the winners at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but those attending the ceremony on the same day were still excited.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Ying Er Anosen, said that Ant Forest is an exciting innovation that has enabled hundreds of millions of people to take action to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what it can do for the environment.
It uses technology to connect people and the environment so that each individual can participate in the action to protect the planet, which will have a huge impact.
"Animal Forest" by China Ant Financial Services Group (referred to as Ant Financial Services) in August 2016 in Alipay platform launched, users in the "ant forest" in their daily life of green travel, online payment of electricity and other low-carbon actions to save "green energy", in the mobile phone "tree".
Every time a user develops a virtual tree, the Ant Forest and the public welfare partners plant a real tree in the desertified area.
As of August this year, 500 million "ant forest" users have reduced carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in desertification areas.
In the "Defender of the Earth Award" on the same day, Costa Rica won the award for the national environmental protection efforts, and the Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado, who came to receive the award, praised the contribution of the "ant forest" at the scene, "to inspire so many people to participate in green action, which is impressive."

While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how to make farmers' income more from green mountains and waters.
In addition to providing employment opportunities through planting trees, it is also hoped to help farmers increase their income through agricultural product development projects and e-commerce platforms.
The public welfare and environmental protection model based on digital technology created by "ant forest" has also been successfully launched to sea and has been used by other countries.
In June this year, the Philippines' largest "e-wallet" GCASH launched the Philippine version of "ant forest", encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon life.
According to reports, GCASH will work with the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources and environmental welfare organizations to plant 335,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the project launch.

Economic and trade frictions affect the "report card" of the US economy.
The U.S. economic "report card" for the second quarter of this year showed that the growth rate of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) slowed down significantly compared with the previous quarter, driven by a sharp decline in private-sector investment and exports.
Analysts pointed out that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they bring are the main reasons for the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data released by the US Department of Commerce on the 26th shows that the US GDP increased by 2% year-on-year in the second quarter, which is the same as the revised data previously released, but significantly lower than the 3.1% in the first quarter.
The data shows that consumption growth has become the main factor supporting the US economic growth in the second quarter.
Personal consumption expenditure, which accounts for about 70% of the total US economy, increased by 4.6% month-on-quarter, boosting economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumption expenditure and investment boosted economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment in the second quarter fell by 6.3% from the previous quarter, dragging down 1.16 percentage points of economic growth in the quarter; exports fell by 5.7% from the previous quarter, and net exports dragged down the economic growth of 0.68 percentage points in the quarter.
Barry Knapp, managing partner of Eindez macroeconomic consulting firm in the United States, said that private sector investment not only failed to maintain the momentum of growth last year, but fell sharply, because economic and trade frictions and rising uncertainty hit business confidence.
Knapp believes that under the influence of policy uncertainty, US corporate capital expenditure is expected to remain in a downward trend next year.
Analysts believe that although consumption growth has formed a strong support for the US economy in the second quarter, there are more and more signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty it brings have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected the US consumption outlook.
Richard Curtin, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan and the head of the survey, said that in the most recent survey, 38% of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the US economy, which is a new high in a year and a half.
For the future trend of the US economy, analysts generally believe that the US economy will continue to slow down.
But some experts said that if the economic and trade frictions are eased, the performance of the US industrial sector and financial markets will improve.
Karin Birch, a global economist at the British Economist Intelligence Unit, expects that the future US economy will continue its gradual downward trend since this year, and the growth rate will fall to a lower level than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, predicts that under the premise that economic and trade frictions will not continue to escalate, the US economy will grow by 2.3% this year and further slow to 1.6% next year.
Ellen Hatzen, investment manager of Putnam Investment Company, pointed out that the biggest concern of the current business is the economic and trade dispute and the uncertainty it brings, if the economic and trade disputes can be resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced, and the performance of the industrial sector will be much better than now.
Matt Meley, equity strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said that economic and trade frictions are still the "first problem" and the main cause of the sharp fluctuations in the US capital market this year. Whether economic and trade frictions can be properly resolved will be the key to the direction of the US capital market in the rest of this year.
Ningxia's first joint parental leave for parents of children aged 0 to 3 years can take 10 days a year
Protecting women's legitimate rights and interests is the embodiment of respecting and protecting human rights, and it is also an important symbol of the progress of social civilization.
On September 27, at the 15th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the Regulations on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were passed with high votes.
This is the first provincial-level formulation and promulgation of a comprehensive system to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of women's local regulations, which will be formally implemented on November 1, 2019.
It is understood that the "Regulations" adopted this time are revised on the basis of the implementation of the "Measures for the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in Ningxia" in 2007, which are divided into 9 chapters and 65 articles, including general principles, political rights, cultural and educational rights and interests, labor and social security rights and interests, property rights and interests, personal rights, marriage and family rights, legal responsibilities, and by-laws.
In the Regulations, Ningxia encourages the exploration and implementation of joint parental leave for couples, which is still the first in the country.
In April this year, the "Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Development of Care Services for Infants and Young Children Under 3" issued by the General Office of the State Council has a relevant description of the common parenting of husband and wife.
In the process of revising the Regulations, Ningxia proposed to "encourage employers to give joint parental leave to couples who have children in accordance with laws and regulations, and each year between the child's zero to three years of age and ten days of common parental leave each year."
At the same time, the Ordinance highlights the anti-sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative achievements in China's current civil code personality rights, and details the constituent elements of sexual harassment, the main body and mechanism of anti-sexual harassment.
Article 44 of the Ordinance explicitly prohibits the frequent sexual abuse of girls, and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and prevention work, which has become a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
Article 35 of the Ordinance clearly stipulates women's rights to information about the common property of the common property and the obligations of property registration agencies and related subjects, and provides solid institutional support for women's rights.
In addition, in response to social hot-spot issues - gender discrimination in employment, Article 26 of the Ordinance not only prohibits direct discrimination, but also prohibits indirect discrimination, and absorbs the latest joint interviews with practical experience, strengthens the punishment for gender discrimination violations, and more effectively safeguards the legitimate rights and interests of women.
In recent years, the Ningxia Women's Federation, together with the Public Inspection and Law Department and the Civil Affairs Department, have promoted and introduced social and professional forces to participate in the mediation of marriage and family conflicts and disputes and anti-domestic violence, with remarkable results.
The Regulations summarize and improve this, and in many laws, encourage the mobilization of social forces and the accumulation of social resources to jointly safeguard the rights and interests of women, and require people's governments at or above the county level to provide stable and institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services.
Inner Mongolia Xing UNITA Yuan Longping academician workstation salt-tolerant rice mu rice production of rice broke thousands of pounds
The reporter learned from the administrative office of Xing UNITA in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on the 27th that the "Hing UNITA Yuan Longping Academician Workstation of Academician Yuan Longping's on-site test and acceptance council for salt-tolerant rice" uploaded good news, and the average yield of salt-tolerant rice per mu exceeded 1,000 pounds.
The expert group of six experts from the Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yangzhou University and Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs conducted sampling and harvesting of the "salt series" rice on the spot.
After expert evaluation, in the PH value of 8.8 to 9.6, the salinity content of 5‰ to 6‰ of the land, the average yield of salt-tolerant rice per mu reached 508.8 kg.
Wang Shigang, executive director of academician Yuan Longping's workstation, said: "We plan to innovate on the basis of this year's experiment, but also reform, and re-cultivate and optimize salt-tolerant rice varieties, so that the quality is better and the yield is higher."
The leader of the expert group, vice president and researcher of the Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said: "Under the premise of unchanged production factors, I believe that we will continue to strengthen scientific and technological research, and salt-tolerant rice will continue to produce miracles on the salinity and alkali land."
Hing UNITA belongs to the special hardship area concentrated in the southern foothills of Daxing Anling.
In October 2018, Academician Yuan Longping's work station was unveiled at Hing UNITA.
Academician Yuan Longping led the expert team to accelerate the introduction and promotion of the latest cultivation of "salt-based hybrid rice" varieties and advanced technology, the construction of 960 acres of salt-tolerant rice base in the right-wing flag of Korqin, the use of side test demonstration, while promoting the technical route, to promote the local poor to increase production and income, get rid of poverty and get rich.

After a marathon debate and weeks of protests, New Australia passed a legalisation bill on September 26 local time.
The bill has sparked political debate over the past eight weeks, with serious divisions within the Liberal Party since independent MP Greenwich announced its introduction.
After nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Australian New South African Senate passed the abortion legalization bill by a vote of 26 to 14 on the evening of the 25th, making it the third longest bill in the New South African Senate.
On the morning of the 26th, after the final vote in the New South State House of Representatives, the New South African abortion was legalized.
The bill allows a woman to terminate her pregnancy at 22 weeks of pregnancy and, if two doctors agree, also allow a woman to have an abortion later in the pregnancy.
The Senate passed an amendment on the evening of the 25th, that doctors can seek advice from the multidisciplinary panel of the hospital's advisory committee before performing an abortion procedure for a woman after 22 weeks of pregnancy.
In addition, the Senate-passed amendment also includes that doctors must provide appropriate care for babies who survive after terminating their pregnancy.
New South Carolina Gov. Berejiklian has faced public criticism from conservatives on the bill, and Berejikilian has intervened several times to gain more debate time for the bill, but she did not attend the final vote.
"I need to spend time running the entire NSW state," Berijiklen defended her absence vote.
Davis, a Liberal MP who was the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, threatened to withdraw from the NSW government because of the bill, and said the bill triggered a "government crisis".
But then Davis made a concession.
"The content of the amendment to the abortion legalization bill submitted to the House of Representatives on the morning of the 26th actually provides more protection for women and doctors," Davis said.
Meanwhile, Australian NSW National Party leader Bariraro said he was proud to be part of a government that legalized abortion.
"What we achieved last night is historic in New York, which legalizes abortion, is no longer a crime, and women who have abortions are not treated as criminals."

Liu Kun, Minister of Finance: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred 861 billion yuan of state-owned funds to enrich the Social Security Fund.
Liu Kun, Minister of Finance, said on the 27th that as of now, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, with a total transfer of about 86.1 billion yuan of state-owned capital.
Liu Kun made the above statement at the deployment meeting of the national transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the work of the Social Security Fund jointly convened by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the SASAC on the same day.
"The transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund is an important measure to reform and improve the basic pension insurance system, and it is a full manifestation of the generational fairness of the development results of state-owned enterprises and the intergenerational fairness of the basic pension insurance system, and is a policy measure based on the current and long-term."
In 2017, the State Council issued the "Implementation Plan for Transferring Some State-owned Capital to Enrichment Social Security Fund", requiring the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to carry out pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, the preliminary work of the transfer has achieved positive results.
At the central level, three batches of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been transferred, with a total transfer of about 86.1 billion yuan of state-owned capital.
Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions by the Ministry of Finance to perform the duties of investors has been basically completed.
The transfer of central enterprises already has a certain scale.
At the local level, the pre-project of enterprise transfer has been carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had been basically completed, with 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan of state-owned capital respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also carried out the preparatory work for the transfer, laying the foundation for the next step of the transfer.
According to the joint notice issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the SASAC, the State Administration of Taxation and the Securities Regulatory Commission, the work of the central and local governments to enrich the social security fund with some state-owned capital was fully launched in 2019 and basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on the same day made specific arrangements for the comprehensive promotion and transfer of work.
The meeting stressed the need to complete the transfer work pragmatically and efficiently.
According to the schedule, the transfer work should be basically completed by the end of 2020.
Transfer the working time is tight, the task is heavy."
Liu Kun said that all regions and departments should carefully organize and carefully arrange to ensure that the transfer work is completed as required; solidly promote the work, accurately grasp the content of the transfer policy; strengthen communication and coordination, and solve difficult problems in a timely manner.
State-owned capital transfer to enrich the social security fund - starting from the starting point of "enriching the social security fund money bag", the destination is to provide strong support for pension security.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple equity "physical displacement", but opened the "mathematical addition".
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the SASAC, the State Administration of Taxation, and the Securities Regulatory Commission jointly issued the "Notice on Comprehensively Promoting the Transfer of Some State-owned Capital to Strengthen the Work of the Social Security Fund", clarifying the timetable for the transfer of state-owned capital to the Social Security Fund, that is, the work of the central and local governments to enrich the Social Security Fund was fully promoted in 2019.
After the publication of the document, the Ministry of Finance and other departments have also implemented it quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10% of the shares held by the Industrial and Commercial Bank and the Agricultural Bank to the Social Security Fund, and the total value of the two shares transferred exceeded 115 billion yuan.
According to the regulations, the Social Security Foundation and other undertakers, as financial investors, enjoy the right to income, dispose of and know the rights to be transferred to the state-owned equity.
The ICBC and the Agricultural Bank said in the announcement that this change in equity will not lead to changes in the controlling shareholders and actual controllers of the Bank.
In this regard, the author believes that similar state-owned enterprise equity transfer is not a simple change of equity ownership, but can stimulate a series of effects of "addition operations".
The first step of some state-owned capital transfer social security "admission results", naturally can reflect the state-owned enterprises for all, development results shared by all.
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in China's economy, and the overall profitability is strong and stable.
Among them, leading enterprises continue to achieve better and bigger and stronger.
On July 10, the executive meeting of the State Council decided to fully promote the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the work of the Social Security Fund this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately said that it will work with relevant departments, according to the deployment of the executive meeting of the State Council, to comprehensively promote the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, fully reflect the intergenerational fairness of the basic pension insurance system and the sharing of the development results of state-owned enterprises.
The second step of the transfer of "addition results" is to enhance the sustainability of China's social security fund and further consolidate the foundation of the pension social security system.
With the aging of the population, China's social security funds are under pressure, and most of the state-owned capital, which has been transferred to the main body, has sustained profitability and dividend ability, which can not only effectively supplement the social security fund, but also provide the source of living water for the social security fund.
Some estimates show that for every transfer of state-owned capital of 3.8 percentage points, the proportion of contributions to basic pension insurance can be reduced by 1 percentage point.
The third step of the transfer, the "adhesion result", is to add a stabilizer to the capital market.
The transfer of the main body to obtain income is " dividend-based, auxiliary operation".
The Social Security Fund, as a financial investor of state-owned capital, does obtain equity dividend income.
However, as a value investor in the capital market, the Social Security Fund has a strong capital operation ability.
For the listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of the social security fund in the shareholding will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed companies, which is conducive to improving the operating level of enterprises and has a positive impact on listed companies and the capital market.
At the same time, as an investment vane, the improvement of the shareholding weight is conducive to further enhancing its influence in the market and playing a "stabilizer" role in the market.
In addition, it is also conducive to giving full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors and guiding investors to rational investment and value investment.
Karl Hartmann was admitted to the Leipzig Conservatory at the age of 18, after studying with Webern.

In 1935, the symphony premiered in Prague, but was harassed by the Nazi bureaucracy.
Afterward, Hartman decided not to play any of his works under the Nazis.
Hartmann's Funeral Concerto, a violin and string concerto, was stolen from Germany and premiered in Switzerland.

The vote was 53 in favor and 44 against, with no Democrats voting in favor of Scalia.

According to the procedure, Gayner's nomination must also be approved by the Senate.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (D) is part of the Department of Homeland Security and coordinates the federal government’s resources to address emergencies such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other emergencies in the United States.

Iran confirmed to develop advanced centrifuges to further suspend compliance with Iran nuclear deal
According to the Central News Agency, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on the 26th that Iran has once again violated the Iranian nuclear agreement by using advanced centrifuges to manufacture enriched uranium.
According to reports, Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the Iranian nuclear agreement in response to US President Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement in May 2018, and restoring and strengthening sanctions against Iran.
Iran suspended two other commitments in July to keep the stockpile of enriched uranium below 300 kilograms and the purity of enriched uranium to no more than 3.67 percent.
Under the nuclear deal, Iran could only set up about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to enrich uranium, and only allowed Iran to use a small number of more advanced models for research, but not to produce enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for the use of nuclear bombs.
According to the report, the IAEA report said: "On September 25, the agency confirmed that Iran's advanced centrifuges of model 2 and 3 ... are accumulating or are ready to accumulate enriched uranium."
The U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented the report to Member States on the 26th, and a diplomat responded by saying, “They are busy at the (Natanza enrichment) facility.”

Italy’s education minister has proposed a sugar tax to protect people’s health.
Lorenzo Fioramonti, Italy’s new government’s minister of education and a member of the Five Star Movement, has introduced a motion to parliament recommending that the Italian government implement a new tax policy on sugar-highly high-sugar drinks, snacks and airline tickets.

Fioramonti said that through this seemingly small series of tax measures, the Italian government is expected to receive 3 billion euros in tax revenue.
The proceeds will be available in the areas of education, health and environmental protection.
In response, Italian Prime Minister Conte said that he believes this is a feasible solution; Italian MP, European Parliamentarian, League leader Salvini tweeted sarcastically that everyone should quickly hide desserts, biscuits, bread and candy, because the new government will start to impose a snack tax.
The report pointed out that the snack tax refers to a special tax on sugary drinks and high-calorie foods.
The tax collection helps to bring benefits to public health.

China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
(New China 70 years) White paper: China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The white paper pointed out that China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
The white paper said that with the rapid improvement of China's comprehensive national strength and international influence, some people in the world are worried that China will take the road of "national power must dominate", and some people put forward the so-called "China threat theory".
This is both a cognitive misreading, a deep-seated bias, a psychological imbalance brought about by the growth of strength, and a deliberate distortion of its vested interests.
The realization of national prosperity, national rejuvenation and people's happiness is both the dream of the Chinese people and the common dream of the people of all countries.
"China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world."
The white paper pointed out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, China's scientific and technological innovation injects new momentum into world economic growth, and the role of the stabilizer and power source of China's economy in the future is more prominent.
At present, the momentum of world economic growth is insufficient, and a stable Chinese economy is becoming more and more important to the world.
China's economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development, new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization are accelerating, the economic structure is deeply adjusted, industrial optimization continues to be upgraded, and new economic growth points are constantly emerging.
According to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute, by 2040, the integration of China and the rest of the world with each other is expected to create $22 trillion to $37 trillion in economic value, equivalent to 15%-26% of the global economy, and the cooperation between the rest of the world and China will create huge economic value.
The white paper emphasizes that China's economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and are deeply integrated.
China, with a more stable economy, higher quality of growth and promising growth prospects, is a long-term positive for world economic development.
It is neither feasible nor harmful to view China's economic development as a "threat" and a "challenge" to squeeze China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain, and value chain, so that China can "decouple" from the world economy.
The white paper pointed out that all-round opening up creates more opportunities for all countries to share the "China dividend".
China unswervingly pursues a mutually beneficial and win-win opening-up strategy to achieve greater and higher levels of opening-up, China has the world's most potential consumer market, China is the most attractive investment destination, and a larger "going out" to benefit more countries.
“Openness should be two-way and mutually beneficial, not one-way and one-sided benefits.
Mutually beneficial two ways can be long-term lasting.”
The white paper said that China is committed to continuously expand imports, relax market access, improve the business environment, and strengthen intellectual property protection, and other countries should also expand opening up and take corresponding measures to strive to improve their business environment.
Only when all parties meet each other can we create an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment, and jointly make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger, and form a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests.
The white paper pointed out that China provides more public goods to the international community.
This includes promoting high-quality co-construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, building a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively carrying out foreign assistance.
"China's development has benefited from the international community, and it has never forgotten to give back to the international community to provide more and better public goods for the international community."
Andrei Slepensov, general manager of the Russian Export Center, said in a written interview with Xinhua News Agency that Russia is willing to strengthen cooperation with China in the economic and trade fields, further optimize the export structure, and promote the diversification of Russian exports to China.

Protests bombard the president's resignation in Egypt's mountains and rains, the authorities show strong repression
Twitter hashtags and social media are trumpeting Egyptians taking to the streets today to peacefully demand the ouster of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
But the authorities have signaled their intention to use force to suppress it.
Since then-military chief Sisi seized power in a military coup in 2013, the expression of dissent has almost disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest is in extreme danger.
The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a non-governmental organization in Cairo, said more than 1,900 people had been arrested since a rare outburst of protests calling for Sisi to step down last weekend.
Accusations of corruption surrounding Sisi and his family’s profligacy in pursuit of vanity led thousands of people to take to the streets on the 20th.
The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior firmly stated yesterday that it will resolutely fight against any attempt to undermine the stability of the country.
Downtown Cairo is already heavily guarded, with riot police, security agency vehicles and plainclothes police officers visible on the streets around Tahrir Square, the tipping point of the Egyptian revolution in 2011.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of important scholars and social sages on the 25th, including Nafa, a political science professor at Cairo University and a well-known columnist.
He tweeted on the 24th: "I have no doubt that continued Sisi's absolute rule will be disastrous."
“It is in Egypt’s interest that he should step down immediately.”
Prior to Nafa’s arrest, Hosney, a spokesman for Egypt’s former military chief of staff, Annan, was detained.
Anan was arrested last year after trying to run for president with Sisi.
The president of the Constitutional Party, Davout, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians argue that the fight against dissent reflects the government’s instability and fragility at a time when the economic woes of the poor and middle class are intensifying.
Ayman Nour, an opposition leader who once ran for president, said: “The act of taking over the catch underscores how much the regime is ignoring the Egyptian people and how fearful it is.”
“Because the economy has been ruined by him, and with widespread political repression, Sisi is trying to send a clear message to the important generals and politicians who may be replaced.”
Noel pointed out that in the context of the continuous deterioration of the socio-economic situation, the government's high-pressure approach will only increase the anger of the people.
Now that the barrier of fear has been breached, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor currently in exile in Spain, who was a contractor for Egyptian military construction, began uploading a series of videos earlier this month, bearing the benefits of government corruption, triggering a wave of small demonstrations in different cities over the weekend.
Ali said his company, Amlak General, could get lucrative contracts without going through a statutory bidding process, underscoring the corruption of the military and Sisi’s loved ones, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply repentant of his involvement.
Ali claims that he helped Sisiguet’s palatial palaces and luxury hotels in stark contrast to the current destitution life of the Egyptians, and that the other party has not yet paid.
On Twitter, hashtags such as "Stand Up You Are Not Alone", "Sisi You're Finished", "Sisi's Fuck", "The Next Friday" and other hashtags have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and backlashes, calling on people to take to the streets in a peaceful manner to demand Sisi's ouster.
Hollywood's Egyptian star Amarwick has nearly 7 million followers on Twitter.
He tweeted in Arabic yesterday: "Sisi is doomed... He's done, and those who support him are now making a big mistake."

Is it hard to move?
According to the Russian satellite network, a study of athletes shows that after high-intensity exercise, the brain will also show signs of fatigue.
The study, led by Mathias Pésigrigler, an expert at the Pitier-Salpetriel Hospital in France, shows that there is an unobtvious link between mental and physical labor: both require cognitive control of activity.
"You need to control the process of autonomy that can force yourself to stop when you have muscle and joint pain," explains Pésigler.
The study was initiated by the French National Institute of Sport and Physical Education (INSEP).
The school’s experts guide athletes in preparing for the Olympics.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from overtraining syndrome, that is, they have an irrepressible feeling of fatigue after high-load exercise, their physical inability to recover, and their performance has declined.
INSEP raises the question: Could part of this condition be neurological fatigue, the type of neurological fatigue caused by excessive mental labor?
The study was published in the journal Current Biology.

Wherever you go, your country is behind you.
On the 25th, the first public service short film on consular protection of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was launched, and the sentence at the end of the short film aroused the resonance of the majority of netizens.
Cui Aimin, director of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency that the short film aims to further make the people feel the feelings and temperature of "diplomacy for the people", so that Chinese citizens feel that no matter where they are in any corner of the world, Chinese diplomats will lend a hand to them, give help, strength and hope.
There is no small matter of overseas peace, a leaf is a general relationship.
Cui Aimin said that in the past 70 years, the number of Chinese citizens "going out" has increased dramatically, from "less than one million per year" before the reform and opening up to more than 100 million per year today; at the same time, the safety of Chinese citizens' overseas travel is more secure, and the work object of consular protection and assistance has also expanded from overseas Chinese to overseas Chinese, tourists, students, migrant workers and other groups.

For business people who often go abroad, the APEC Business Travel Card, which is inbound and convenient customs clearance, is a good choice.
According to Cui Aimin, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining a five-year multiple visa for 16 economies around the Asia-Pacific region, which is of great significance to the "going out" of business personnel, especially private enterprises.

"One turn has been" two major UHV projects put into operation
On the 26th, the ±1100 kV high-voltage direct current transmission project from the east to the south and the Sutong 1000 kV AC UHV GIL comprehensive pipe corridor project were put into operation.
These two projects occupy the commanding heights of the current world transmission technology in their respective fields, and after commissioning, China's energy optimization will be greatly improved.
Guo Zhi, chief economist of the National Energy Board, said that the project from the east to the south is the world's largest power transmission capacity and the farthest transmission distance.
Its operation is of great significance to promote the development of Xinjiang's energy base and ensure the power supply in East China.
GIL, that is, gas-insulated metal closed transmission lines.
Sutong pipe corridor project has created a record of the highest voltage level and the strongest conveying capacity in the world of the GIL project, and realized the operation of the 'AC double loop' of the highest voltage level of the East China backbone grid.
According to the State Grid Corporation, the transmission distance from the quasi-east to the south project is as long as 3,324 kilometers.
If conventional technology is used, more than 15% of the electricity will be lost on the way, and the project has been researched and developed, greatly increasing the economic transmission distance to more than 3,000 kilometers.
After the project is put into operation, it can deliver 100 million degrees of electricity every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which can help solve the problem of the consumption of existing new energy in Xinjiang.
According to the full load estimate, the annual power transmission of this single line will reach 60 to 85 billion kWh, which can meet more than half of Shanghai's electricity consumption in the whole year.
Sutong GIL integrated corridor project is a control project of the UHV AC ring network across the Yangtze River.
If you use a conventional overhead line across the river, you need to build two giant towers with more than 450 meters on the Yangtze River, and build an artificial island of more than four football fields for each tower.
In this regard, the national grid bold innovation, the development of compact UHV AC GIL transmission technology, through the tunnel from the water across the river, to avoid the impact on the golden channel.
The two projects have promoted China's electrical equipment manufacturing capacity to achieve a new leap.
At present, the national power grid has built a total of "10 to 11 straight" UHV project, and "4 to 3 straight" is under construction.

Taiwan scholars suggest: "uncertain years" Taiwanese businesses need to keep up with the mainland's development of mainstream industries
The "2019 Taiwan Business Innovation Business Model Forum" was held in Taipei for two days on the 26th and 27th.
The event invited a number of Taiwanese business representatives and scholars to share experiences on enterprise transformation, innovation, succession and market development.
The forum was organized by the Taipei Institute of Management and co-organized by Qunyi Jinding Securities and outstanding mainland Taiwan Business Association.
The two-day meeting was divided into a number of seminars such as transformation and upgrading mode and business strategy, and more than 100 people attended.
Chen Mingzhang, president of the Taipei Institute of Management, said that the Sino-US trade friction continues, and Taiwanese businesses face an "uncertain era."
He believes that Taiwanese businesses need to keep pace with the times and keep up with the mainstream industries developed in the mainland, paying special attention to innovative products related to science and technology, culture, tourism and health.
"In the past, Taiwanese companies valued quality, effectiveness and delivery."
Chen Mingzhang believes that the above conditions are no longer enough for Taiwanese businessmen at present.
He pointed out that Taiwanese-funded enterprises should combine speed and service, speed up the supply chain, and attach importance to extension services and life product services.
In addition, "service value-added" is also a new area where Taiwanese businesses can vigorously develop.
In the speech of Taiwan Business, Xu Wentang, chairman of Taiwan Business Yamei Electronics Co., Ltd. from Guangdong, said that Yamei Electronics had made operations difficult due to the sharp decline in orders, and the group began to improve its operating conditions from various aspects such as restructuring and revitalizing assets.

Bai Hongzhang, general manager of Heshen (Zhuhai) Electronics Co., Ltd., proposed that if it is difficult to develop new customers, it is better to focus on the "one-stop" service provided by the original customers.
Customers to replace the supplier is nothing more than poor service, high price, low quality, slow delivery speed, less variety, integrity problems six factors, as long as the solution of these six points, coupled with the timely transformation of production lines, expand the product categories, the enterprise will become customers can not replace the supplier.

Measures for the Administration of the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights for Public Comment Proposed Supervision of the Transfer of Social Capital Transfers of Industrial and Commercial Enterprises to Obtain Land Management Rights
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued a notice on the "Administrative Measures for the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights (Revised Draft)" (hereinafter referred to as the "Draft for Comment"), which increased the supervision and risk prevention of social capital transfer to obtain land management rights by industrial and commercial enterprises.
The draft opinion is now open to public consultation.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, in order to implement the newly revised Law on Rural Land Contracting, further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system, and implement the "separation of powers" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has revised the Measures for the Administration of the Transfer of Rural Land Contractual Management Rights and formed the "Draft Opinions".
Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned that the first release of the "Draft of Opinions" has many important changes.
The newly revised "Rural Land Contracting Law" clarifies the scope of land transfer, implements the concept of "separating the three rights", and sets up "land contract management right" and "land management right" respectively, making a clear distinction between the transfer of land contract management rights, swapping and the transfer of land management rights (leasing, subcontracting, equity or other means).
In the "Draft of Opinions", in order to implement the concept of "sequence separation of powers", effectively respond to the "rural land contracting law" amendment to the main thrust of the law, and take into account the large differences between the transfer of land management rights and the exchange of land contract management rights, transfer in the parties, procedures, supervision and other aspects, this revised draft defines the scope of transfer, focuses on the transfer of land management rights, including leasing, shareholding, etc., and revises the name of the regulations from the "Rural land management management rights management management approach".
The transfer and exchange of land contractual management rights will be stipulated in separate management measures.
The "Draft Opinion" pointed out that in the context of the "separation of powers", farmers only have the right to land management for a certain period of time.
In theory, even in the event of bankruptcy liquidation, farmers only have the risk of losing the right to operate for a certain period of time, so it is no longer necessary to provide for the return of the original contractor to the original contractor, and there is a conflict with the Bankruptcy Law.
In response to the problem of preventing farmers' land loss risks, in practice, preferred stocks, rent stocks first, buybacks and other methods have been produced.
Considering that preferred stocks have a more mature theoretical discussion in the company law, it is recommended to use them as an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of loss of equity.
