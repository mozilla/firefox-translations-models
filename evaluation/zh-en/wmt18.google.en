Civil rights groups issue travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) is issuing a travel warning to people of color planning to travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
“The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, effective August 28, 2017, calls on all African American travelers, tourists, and Missourians to be advised when traveling in Missouri due to the recent series of suspicious racial incidents in Missouri. Special attention and an attitude of extreme caution are hereby advised,” the group’s statement declared.
The NAACP cited a recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits and state enforcement that has disproportionately targeted minorities, prompting the organization to issue the travel warning.
Civil rights violations are happening to people.
They were pulled over, beaten or killed because of the color of their skin,&quot; Missouri NAACP President Rod Chappell told The Kansas City Star.
&quot;We&#39;ve received an unprecedented number of complaints.&quot;
This is the first such warning issued by the group for a state in the United States.
The group cited racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year. He ran out of gas while traveling in Missouri and was detained by Missouri State Police without being charged with a crime.
The advisory also points to a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General&#39;s Office showing that &quot;black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped and searched compared to white drivers.&quot;
&quot;This advisory is to raise awareness and warn their family, friends and co-workers of what may be happening in Missouri,&quot; Chappell said.
&quot;People need to be prepared, whether traveling to Missouri with bail money or letting relatives know they are traveling within the state.&quot;
According to the latest data from the FBI&#39;s Hate Crime Reporting Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; ranking the state 16th in the nation based on the number of crimes.
The travel warning is also in response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue businesses for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, U.S. states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain immigration violators. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the move would increase the number of racial lawsuits and issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona. .
Travel warnings are typically issued by the U.S. government for other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have adopted this approach in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
After experiencing the &quot;golden era&quot; of soaring box office in 2015, the overall film market has entered a cooling-off period in 2016. Whether it can exceed last year&#39;s total box office of 44.069 billion yuan has become a suspense.
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, in October, the prices of new and second-hand houses in Beijing both cooled down, rising by only 0.6% and 1.1% month-on-month.

BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city: it makes foreigners feel like they are &quot;living in a new era&quot;
Reference News Network reported on January 18 that the British media said that Beijing may have a long history of three thousand years, but it is also rapidly transforming into the modern and charming city it is today.
With blazingly fast internet, cutting-edge technology such as facial recognition software, huge investments in artificial intelligence and unparalleled international energy, the Chinese capital is a great destination for exploratory foreigners. One of the most exciting cities.
According to a report on the BBC website on January 16, German expatriate Clemens Sethi said: &quot;If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere in the future.&quot; He was quoting singer Frank Sinat Lyrics that celebrate New York City.
&quot;If Sinatra were alive today, he would probably be singing about a city like Beijing,&quot; said Sethi, who serves as creative director at Traveler Archives magazine. Living in the city, he said, makes you feel like &quot;life In the new era”, always keeping up with the trends.
Simon Norton, who is originally from England but lives in Beijing recently, published an article on his personal blog website 4Corners7Seas: &quot;People generally have a feeling of being at the center of something grand. This feeling is difficult to explain clearly, but it makes many foreigners feel that they are at the center of something grand.&quot; People stay there for a long time. They want to see what it will become and they want to see it with their own eyes.&quot;
The city’s high-quality, high-speed internet and tech-friendly environment make daily life easier than ever.
Andy Peñafuerte, who is from Manila and currently serves as deputy editor-in-chief of the &quot;Beijing Children&quot; website, said: &quot;Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society. The Internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones. Making it easier for everyone to conduct many transactions.&quot;
But smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing&#39;s technological ambitions, the report said. Facial recognition software is already widespread, with many mobile apps using the technology to make bank transfers and payments, let people into apartments and offices, and even use it to verify online ride-hailing services. The identity of the driver.
Beijing also recently announced plans to spend 13.8 billion yuan to build an artificial intelligence technology park. Once completed, more than 400 companies will settle there and focus on developing various artificial intelligence technologies from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food is also the core of many major festivals in China over the years. Participating in these celebrations is highly praised by foreigners. The Spring Festival is the most important social and economic festival and one of the festivals easiest for foreigners to participate.
Sethi said: &quot;I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year. Cleaning the apartment is as important as putting red Spring Festival couplets with New Year&#39;s greetings on the door of the home. On New Year&#39;s Eve, all family members should gather together to have a sumptuous meal. A big meal, and then stay up until midnight to welcome the New Year with bright and loud fireworks. For foreigners, spending this night with friends and family is indeed an opportunity to integrate.”
According to reports, the number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but China&#39;s language barriers and the ease of communication among expats can easily become excuses for them not to fully integrate into the local culture.
Sethi said: &quot;Some foreigners have lived in China for many years but have little experience with their host country. If your initial attempts to contact Chinese people are not successful, it will be easier for you to get along with other foreigners. Feel.
&quot;In these so-called &quot;foreigner bubbles&quot; (&quot;foreigner bubbles&quot; refers to foreigners who only mix among foreigners without contact with local people and local culture - translator&#39;s note), foreigners are in their own communities. Hang out in a group, eat in Western restaurants, and have only foreigners among your friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin - it&#39;s easier than one might think.
&quot;Taking one or two hours of private Chinese lessons per week or learning an entry-level radio drama should fit into everyone&#39;s busy schedule,&quot; Sethi said.
Learning even a few classic phrases can be helpful when shopping, ordering food at a restaurant, or chatting in a taxi.
Stubborn air pollution is also a fact of daily life, but government efforts in recent years have curbed some of the problem.
Residents stress the importance of getting outdoors during the warmer months when pollution tends to be less, and treating those blue-sky days as opportunities to wander the historic hutongs or explore the popular Ritan Park.
Norton said: &quot;Beijing is the Chinese city where you can find the most things below the surface. You can find great art and music events, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and ancient hutong areas.&quot;
The report believes that the hindering effect of aging on the growth of human capital is increasingly obvious, especially in the Northeast region, where the average annual contribution rate of aging to the growth of human capital is -1.28%.
Pan Gongsheng pointed out that the current risk of cross-border capital flows is controllable, and the fundamental factors supporting the balance of international payments still exist for a long time.
China News Service, Beijing, December 17 (Reporter Gao Kai) The world is dazzling because of heritage - the 2016 International Summit Forum on the Appraisal, Restoration and Protection of Ancient Chinese Paintings and Calligraphy opened on December 17 at Renmin University of China.
In April this year, the European Commission accused Google of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre-install software such as Google search and Chrome browsers, otherwise they would not be allowed to use other Google applications.
The European Commission believes that this move is harmful to the interests of consumers and hinders competition.
EU regulators initially gave Google until July 27 to respond.
If convicted of antitrust charges, Google would face a fine of up to 10% of its global revenue, which is approximately US$7.4 billion.
Google did not immediately comment.
Google also faces an EU investigation for favoring its own shopping service in search results.
Zhang Yuning&#39;s study abroad is a real deal. It can be said that his &quot;jumping&quot; from the National Youth to the National Olympics is not accidental, and the extent of his rapid growth is still surprising.
One picture to understand: Bitcoin’s legal status around the world
Abstract: In addition to the price correction naturally caused by speculative attributes, this round of digital currency’s sharp decline is also related to the “old enemy”—regulatory risk.
Judging from the visual map, Eastern countries have a more conservative attitude toward Bitcoin than the West. Countries that account for the majority of the world are still waiting to see the legality of digital currencies, which means that &quot;black swan risks&quot; are still very high.

As regulatory storms arise in major Bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union, global digital currencies led by Bitcoin have suffered a bloodbath this week. The price of Bitcoin fell below the psychological round number of US$10,000 on Tuesday, reaching its highest level in three years. Biggest one-day drop.
In addition to price corrections naturally caused by speculative attributes, this round of sharp decline in digital currencies is also related to regulatory risks, which have always been the &quot;old enemy&quot;.
At this important juncture, the visual big data website HowMuch.net produced a map showing the legal status and degree of regulation of Bitcoin in countries around the world.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legal market for Bitcoin; orange represents the neutral market, although the status of Bitcoin has not been publicly legalized, but there are no major usage restrictions; light pink represents the restricted market, that is, the local government attempts to pass Red lines of policy or regulation address the use of digital currencies; dark pink represents countries where Bitcoin is defined as illegal; gray represents countries that have not yet commented.
(The above picture is from the HowMuch.Net visualization team drawing on January 15th)
The article pointed out that from the distribution of non-green color blocks in the picture, it can be seen that Eastern countries in the traditional sense have a more conservative attitude towards Bitcoin than the West.
Russia is currently the largest country that has defined Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries that has not yet commented on Bitcoin and has not yet introduced relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of Bitcoin, i.e. the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
Countries in the Middle East and Latin America have clearly divided views on Bitcoin, and the distribution of color blocks in the above regions is more mixed.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Brazil are all legal Bitcoin markets. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, etc. have certain restrictions on their transactions and use. More Latin American countries have not yet spoken out about Bitcoin.
Based on the above data, it can be seen that among the 246 countries in the world that are counted, a total of 99 countries (or 40%) impose no restrictions on the transaction and use of Bitcoin, that is, green and orange areas.
There are 7 countries (or 3%) that are restricted markets (light pink), 10 countries (or 4%) that define Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53%). %) There is no further information on digital currencies (gray).
This shows that the countries that account for the majority of the world (53%, more than half) are still waiting to see the legality of digital currencies led by Bitcoin in the country. It also means that the &quot;black swan risk&quot; of Bitcoin is still very high, because some of these countries Legislative decisions to restrict digital currencies may eventually be made.
The article believes that global regulatory agencies have not fully understood the emerging category of digital currency, which may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made a statement.
Although Bitcoin&#39;s &quot;popularity&quot; has grown exponentially since last year, it does not mean that all countries are interested. Some countries may be worried that their local legal currencies will be threatened, or they may be worried that digital currencies are being used by criminal organizations.
The Wall Street Journal once wrote a detailed summary of the international regulatory news on Bitcoin since last week, including China&#39;s crackdown on centralized service online platforms and mobile apps of over-the-counter exchanges, South Korea is still considering closing digital currency exchanges, and the European Union believes that Bitcoin It has not yet been widely accepted and warns investors of the risks of &quot;losing all their money&quot;, etc.
Selected by the editor-in-chief of Wall Street News, &quot;Reading News | 2018: Will central banks around the world usher in the first year of digital currency?&quot; ” once mentioned that from any perspective of supervision, acceptance/criticism, and adoption, 2018 will be the first year of digital currency for global central banks.
Russia and other major countries’ criticism of Bitcoin’s legal status is actually to make way for the official issuance of digital currencies.
Xinhua News Agency, Madrid, January 8 (Reporter Xie Yuzhi) Barcelona’s new aid Coutinho made his debut wearing a Barcelona jersey at Camp Nou on the 8th.
Coutinho passed Barcelona&#39;s physical examination that morning and signed a contract with Barcelona Chairman Bartomeu that will expire in the summer of 2023.
Then he appeared as a Barcelona player in front of nearly 7,000 fans at Camp Nou.
According to Spanish media, Coutinho&#39;s total transfer fee may reach 160 million euros (1 euro is approximately 7.77 yuan), making him the most valuable player in the history of Barcelona and La Liga.
Since Coutinho is still injured, he still needs to rest for nearly 20 days before he can make his debut in a Barcelona jersey.

Now the Trump White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans agree with this as much as anyone. Thus, in 2003, Saddam Hussein was toppled in Baghdad&#39;s Paradise Square in an orchestrated manner.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration&#39;s key think tanks, was in a heated exchange with CNN&#39;s Jim Acosta over the president&#39;s proposal to severely limit legal immigration During the argument, he must have known what would happen if he took a symbolic ax to the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller didn&#39;t attack the statue itself.
If he did, a bunch of cruise ship owners and liberal wannabes would eat him alive.
But he did attack the statue&#39;s significance, especially its significance when Emma Lazarus&#39;s famous poem was inscribed on the pedestal in 1903 (17 years after the monument was completed).
As Miller chides Acosta: “I don’t want to get into the full facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that lights up the world….
The poem you&#39;re referring to, that was added later and was not part of the original Statue of Liberty. &quot;
In fact, Miller is right, but as he himself says, it&#39;s not really about history.
This involves a modern echo of the startling words of Lazarus, the only country that seems to invite not just any old immigrant, but the poorest of the poor: “Your weariness, your poverty, or your huddle The populace yearns to breathe free, / The suffering people reject your crowded beaches.”
There is no such thing as &quot;suffering people rejecting&quot; the moment our screens become more glaring.
Miller, who has no background in literary criticism, makes it clear that these people would not be welcome in Trump’s America.
This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: one that is, in effect, at odds with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends who staged events after her death to have her verses inscribed on pedestals, were well aware that they were engaging in an act of a highly political nature.
The purpose of the sculpture was to express the connection between French and American republicanism through the age-old classic trope of the female embodiment of Lady Liberty.
Lazarus changes this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
She gave herself a very different name: Mother of Exile.
The combination of the poem and the painting was a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to American nativism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right has always wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker Rush Limbaugh, one of the baptizers of Trump’s arrival, argued in 2010 that liberalism wasn’t inviting anyone, and he’s now an early New Conservatives bring the flame of American wisdom to the ignorant world: &quot;The Statue of Liberty is courageous.
She was meant to carry the torch of freedom from America to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light America&#39;s path. &quot;
Unusually, Limbaugh was actually moved by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive perspective.
What Lazarus did so imaginatively was to be able to see it. It can be seen on the deck of a ship when weary, poor but hopeful people after a long and often terrible journey.
On the surface, this is about the perspective of those seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives, as they view the world.
Her statue spoke to them and needed them to hear the message of hope and welcome they intended.
Of course, this is not a view that Miller and Trump ever wanted to admit.
They torch not to light the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of strength.

World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scotland players in GB squad
Eilidh Doyle recalls that there were only two Scots in the English national team.
British Athletics executive director Neil Black said the world championships squad of 16 strong Scots would make a &quot;huge contribution to the national team&quot;.
A record number of Scottish track and field athletes have been selected to compete at the 2017 World Athletics Championships in London, which kick off on Friday.
Black believes there are &quot;extraordinary developments happening in Scotland&quot; and that British athletics must learn from them.
&quot;We accept that and try to understand that, and we&#39;re going to keep at it until we&#39;re successful,&quot; Black said.
&quot;I spoke to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport. They thought it had something to do with what they were doing.
Scottish athletics believe it has something to do with what they do.
British Athletics believes this has something to do with their actions.
Even people on the street think so.
Whatever the case, it&#39;s absolutely brilliant. &quot;
Several Scottish athletics athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will challenge Mo Farah in the 5,000m. Reed? Doyle (Eilidh Doyle) was elected as the team captain.
“Aled is a little humble.
Her captaincy speech was incredible,” Black said.
“Many athletics athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, or wherever they live or train, walk out of the door feeling proud and motivated.
Aired’s natural passion and genuine emotion is great. &quot;
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at his fifth world championships, said it was &quot;incredible&quot; that there were 16 Scots in the GB squad.
The previous highest number of Scottish track and field athletes competing at the World Series was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle runner Muir is the leader. In the past year she has set five British records and two European records.
She will compete in the 1500m and 5000m events.
Chris O&#39;Hare, who competes in the 1500m event, is another Scottish athlete worth paying attention to. She has achieved very good results in the previous season, winning the British National Team Qualifiers and the Olympic Anniversary Games respectively.
Doyle recalled attending her first world championships when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was deeply proud that so many of her compatriots were not only on the team but, in some cases, challenging for medals and competing to reach the finals.
&quot;The special thing about being captain of the national team is that it is voted on by the rest of the national team. So knowing that your teammates voted for you to achieve something extremely unusual, for me anyway, is It’s a great honor,” she added.
“Of course I’m very proud of all the Scotland players.
It just goes to show how far we&#39;ve come.
And they are all veteran track and field athletes here, track and field athletes who are about to move towards the goal of winning the podium.
How about my captain&#39;s speech?
Well, I think it&#39;s pretty cool.
I just made reference to the fact that in this case we are very lucky because we have the World Championships at home.
So it&#39;s really important that we have the home support and the strength that comes from being back at the Stadio Olimpico.
I&#39;m going to get a second chance to compete and the atmosphere there is going to be amazing. &quot;

Block critics on Facebook: Don’t run for office if you can’t stand rebuke from voters
Our Founding Fathers knew the ways of a bad press.
Americans loved Washington, but it wasn&#39;t long before newspapers began savaging him on everything from his domestic policies to his political principles.
He was annoyed by the criticism, no doubt.
But he did not silence these critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, “Deprived of free speech, we shall be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance.”
This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan&#39;s staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people for expressing their views on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor&#39;s staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and online reports were filled with their backlash: &quot;Who cares?&quot;
A lot of people say “it’s just Facebook.”
But, this is important.
This is especially important when facing someone like Hogan.
This was a Republican governor of a majority-Democratic state, and he was surprisingly popular.
Among the 50 governors in the country, he ranks second in praise.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He ran Maryland smoothly and followed the rules.
He is also very good at using Facebook as his main way to connect emotionally with voters, jokingly showing off his bald head after chemotherapy for the first time on his homepage.
So blocking people who come to the governor’s page to comment is completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous. This page is a public forum, officially managed by a staff supported by public tax dollars.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan&#39;s spokesperson Amelia Shas defended the governor&#39;s actions, saying she believed blocking their comments was simply an attempt to show restraint.
But they are too hasty to describe them as scourges or cynics sweeping the web.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with people blocked by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their elected leaders: they are teachers, small business owners, and pastors, not monsters.
They all said their comments were in-depth, respectful and not obscene.
The pastor quoted Scripture in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Barrister Lakshmi Salma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland, wasn&#39;t cynical, but she asked about hate crimes.
&quot;I politely commented that I was disappointed that he had not responded to hate crimes and other recent news incidents,&quot; she wrote in the comments section of the Washington Post news story.
I also don&#39;t like a bunch of people commenting on the same topic, because these people will be directly ignored by some people, thinking that they have a so-called herd mentality, instead of treating them as a group of citizens who care about the country and the people. &quot;
What the governor&#39;s staff calls an &quot;intense bombardment of spam&quot; may appear to others as &quot;assertiveness.&quot;
The age of Facebook makes it easy to modify a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
And it was far cleaner than in the past, when achieving the same effect would have required sending staff out to collect and burn critical newspapers or arresting or silencing protesters.
But that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening now, but on a digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for silencing others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
A landmark ruling came out last week in Virginia on just such an issue.
The chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment when she blocked a voter from her Facebook page, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Katsaris of Alexandria.
Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) has also been patronized by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn&#39;t be this hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet had a similar impact.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters fiercely criticized his leadership.
And even then, there were anonymous scourges targeting him in Washington.
People wrote letters to newspapers using pseudonyms such as Eureka, Valerius, Belisarius, and Pogius, severely criticizing Washington&#39;s decision-making.
His office was inundated with petitions criticizing his stance on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation between His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Newspapers Online Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of dissent and freedom of speech are the foundation of this country.
And true leaders need to accept this.
Every disturbance in the property market affects people&#39;s sensitive nerves.
Purchase restrictions are a tough line in many cities’ real estate control policies.
In May 2017, Jinan issued regulations that allow undergraduates who have paid social security for half a year to enjoy the same housing purchase policies as local permanent residents;
In June, Wuhan issued a policy that stipulates that college students can settle in the city within three years of graduation with their graduation certificate and employment certificate.
Subsequently, the policy was tightened, and officials stated that “college students can buy a house at a price 20% lower than the market price”;
In July, Chengdu issued regulations that young talents with a bachelor&#39;s degree or above from other places can apply to settle in Chengdu with their graduation certificates.
In addition, Kunshan, Shanghai Lingang and other cities or regions have also introduced policies related to &quot;talent introduction&quot; to lower the threshold for talents to purchase houses and settle down.
Zhang Hongwei believes that this is actually a competition between major cities for population, especially talents. Only by retaining the population, especially talents, can cities be competitive. This is the most important significance of these real estate policies.
Some people even think that this means that the time has come to lift the &quot;purchase restrictions&quot; in the property market.

Ronan Rafferty looks forward to feeling like home at Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty will be enjoying a homecoming over the next three days as East Lothian Renaissance Club hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman guided next door Archerfield Links to the final last year but lost out to Paul Eales. He now works for the new venue, serving as tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Salvati.

Athletes will see the course at its best and in the best condition.
Jerry built this place like no other.
He is a keen supporter of the competition and very proud of his achievements here.
This is the perfect stage to showcase this course. &quot;
England&#39;s Eales is looking to defend his title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
The Southport athlete said: “It’s really special.
I didn&#39;t defend the Extremadura Open because the tournament was canceled the year after I won.
Coming to this place feels magical,
Golfing here is wonderful.
Memories of last year come back and for my wife, Sharon, and I, last year’s win has special meaning to us.
It was truly a special memory that we will remember forever. &quot;
Returning to his hometown competition is Gary Orr, who turned 50 earlier this year and then competed on the European Senior Tour.
This is his first time participating in a Scottish tournament since the 2013 Scottish Golf Open.
&quot;It always means more to play back home,&quot; said Helensburgh native Orr.
You want to do well; but you feel that extra pressure.
I&#39;m really enjoying being able to play again and I&#39;ve been playing golf.
I&#39;m happy with the current situation. &quot;
Joining the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
There were six Scottish athletes on the field, two of whom were Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrens. The other four were Andrew Oldkorn, Stephen McAllister and Bill Langmire. and Ross Drummond.

Zou Shoumin, director of the Environmental Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, introduced in Beijing on the 22nd that in August, a total of 57 cases of consecutive daily penalties were implemented nationwide. The newly revised &quot;Environmental Protection Law&quot; implemented at the beginning of this year has significantly increased China&#39;s environmental law enforcement.
At present, environmental protection agencies across China can use punishment methods such as continuous daily penalties, seizures, production restrictions and suspensions, and transfers to administrative detention to investigate and deal with environmental violations, and cooperate with judicial agencies to punish environmental crimes.
According to Zou Shoumin, in August, a total of 335 cases were sealed and detained across China; a total of 177 cases were restricted or suspended; a total of 189 cases were transferred to administrative detention; and a total of 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution crimes were transferred.
Among them, Henan has implemented 7 consecutive penalties on a daily basis. Currently, China is comprehensively stepping up environmental pollution control from end-to-end control to full-process embedding.
Although the downward pressure on the economy is emerging, China&#39;s Ministry of Environmental Protection has made it clear before that China should correctly handle the positioning of environmental protection in economic development and strengthen its &quot;green determination.&quot; The more economic growth slows down, the less it can relax environmental protection and play a good role. The optimization effect of environmental protection on the economy.
There is no highest, only higher. Kweichow Moutai&#39;s stock price cannot stop on the road to new highs.

Zhejiang Province vigorously promotes the Red Boat Spirit and takes determined actions to keep its work at the forefront of the times.
As soon as the new batch of water samples were collected, Liu Rui and his colleagues immediately got busy.
While daily monitoring
This year they are working hard to solve the problem of intelligent management of rural sewage
How to manage it well is actually a very serious challenge.
The Institute of Ecology and Environment of the Yangtze River Delta Research Institute of Tsinghua University in Zhejiang is located in Jiaxing, the birthplace of the Red Boat Spirit.
From nothing more than ten years ago to now
Zhejiang Tsinghua Yangtze River Delta Research Institute has developed into a regional innovation gathering force with three national-level key innovation platforms and nearly 400 overseas students settled in Zhejiang.
The Red Boat Spirit is a force that we must follow and understand. Innovation is actually very difficult.
Every innovation here
To the extent that you feel it is impossible to solve, then you have to persevere at this stage and keep moving forward.

Do practical things for the people

They went deep into grassroots art museums, local academies and some universities in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Gansu and other places to understand the new cultural mission borne by literary and art workers in the spirit of the 19th National Congress.
I feel deeply proud and happy. I am willing to sink again and again and write more about the fate of small people in the great era.
Do you have any good suggestions or ideas for the development of grassroots literature and art?
Nowadays, mass literature and art is very lively, and there is a certain point in popularizing it.
Continuously launch high-quality masterpieces that are worthy of the times.
It should be rooted in the grassroots, go deep into life, and then produce works that have a certain cultural depth, are positive, and have lasting artistic charm.

The first satellite in my country’s space science satellite series, and also the world’s first dark matter particle detection satellite Wukong
In the past two years of operation in orbit, it has scanned the entire sky four times, detected more than 3.5 billion high-energy particles, and obtained the most accurate data in the world.
This result was recently published in the international academic journal &quot;Nature&quot;
In space, we have observed something new that has not been observed before. This cannot be explained and explained using existing theories.

Relying on your nose to find the toilet is what many people remember about Chinese toilets in the last century.
It also incorporates more and more humanized designs

Public toilets in Nanjing, Sucheng and other places in Jiangsu
If you swipe your face for three seconds, you can get a free toilet paper, but if you want to get a double copy, you need to wait ten more minutes.
Avoid misuse of public resources
Habits, some tourists may really want to put the paper back, but on the other hand, we must also reflect on it
Is there no paper in the next toilet that our tourists will enter? So this is what we particularly emphasize in the new three-year plan.
We need to resolve this imbalance and inadequacy.
To push the toilet revolution further, we need to think more about what the masses think.
A third bathroom must be provided to facilitate family members to accompany the elderly and children to the toilet.
We are bringing a baby, and we are too embarrassed to accompany us into the men&#39;s restroom.
The children in the women&#39;s restroom seem to understand a little bit of embarrassment at such a young age. The board is very comfortable and very convenient for us to take care of our children.
While people experience civilization, they also become builders of civilization. In the countryside, villagers in Hechi, Guangxi are building new flush toilets in their homes
Great results have been achieved. Actively promoting the toilet revolution can not only help people stay away from diseases, but also drive economic development and narrow regional development gaps.
This toilet issue is a general issue and a node in the development of social issues.
It is a national civilization project that is guided and laid out from a national perspective, and then all aspects of the project are involved in varying degrees to solve minor social problems.
This will make up for all our shortcomings.

Poverty and death in Indonesia&#39;s Golden Island
Badina Deij doesn&#39;t use a stove when she cooks.
She rarely even uses the pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai district in Indonesia&#39;s Papua province, the housewife usually just puts a sweet potato - known locally as a &quot;nota&quot; - directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the burnt sweet potato was eagerly taken out by a pair of unwashed hands and devoured.
Daijie sat on the dirt floor - she had no furniture - and this was where she did daily household chores, such as washing clothes in murky water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room is the outhouse.
She was the youngest of her husband&#39;s four wives, so she was not assigned fields to tend.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, many are drunk, and there are a lot of soldiers here.
&quot;No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.,&quot; she said.
It&#39;s a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia following a controversial 1969 referendum in which just 1,026 elders were forced to vote in front of occupying troops. Hands vote.
The current movement for independence and opposition to Dutch rule quickly turned its back on Jakarta&#39;s government, which has imposed a repressive rule on the region and cut off foreign journalists and rights activists.
In 2003, the province officially split into Papua and West Papua provinces, with Papua New Guinea independently controlling the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is remote and uninhabited; to get here you need to take a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, then rent a car and drive for 5 hours, making your stomach churn all the way.
There is no public transportation here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, wooden houses are surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated iron roofs are various shades of tawny rust.
Few Indonesians come here, let alone journalists, and almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here, too.
“We can’t get used to wearing these clothes,” Daijie said, referring to her brightly colored handwoven headscarf, dark blouse and bright skirt.
&quot;We used to just cover ourselves with leaves.&quot;
Papua is Indonesia&#39;s poorest province, with 28% of people living below the poverty line. It also has the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also the golden island of Indonesia.
Paniai County is located in the highlands, is about the same size as New Jersey, and has a population of 153,000 people. Just 60 miles away is Grasberg, the world&#39;s largest and most profitable gold mine, owned by Phoenix-based Philip McMoRan Copper and Gold.
In 2015 alone, Felipe mined approximately $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua is rich in timber resources, estimated to be worth US$78 billion.
However, these rich resources are also the source of tragedy for the Papuans. This is why Indonesia&#39;s powerful military power has been able to suppress them.
A 2005 New York Times investigative report revealed that Phillip paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, including as much as $150,000 to a single official.
The Papuans&#39; growing demands for independence threatened the benefactor, and they were subjected to brutal treatment.
According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by Indonesian troops.
Mass killings in Papua&#39;s tribal highlands in the 1970s escalated into genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report from the Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane, &quot;We Have Everything to Lose,&quot; included evidence of the previous year&#39;s egregious crimes, such as extrajudicial killings and torture - another report said rape and electrocution were particularly common. — and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
&quot;Violence occurs every day, making it difficult to count the number of victims,&quot; said Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Oppression began when Papua&#39;s resources attracted large numbers of immigrants from outside Indonesia.
83% of the province&#39;s 3.5 million people are Christians, but its demographic structure has changed since Muslim economic immigrants arrived here from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese food stalls sell gado gado mixed with fried chicken and vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
Locals fought hard.
&quot;The immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans,&quot; explains Apos Yu, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura to find work.
This deprived the local Papuans - Papuan women (mama-mama) - of their market. &quot;
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, often known as Jokowi, vowed during his 2014 election campaign to tackle inequality and abuse of power in Papua.
The former carpenter&#39;s path to the presidential palace in Jakarta was supported by 27 out of 29 regions - including Paniai.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and today locals feel betrayed.
&quot;We are heartbroken and we voted for Jokowi in 2014 in the hope that he would fulfill our wishes and restore fairness,&quot; You said.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai encountered his worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotali were singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire outside when two Indonesian soldiers suddenly rushed over on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavit Tebai.
Victims and witnesses said the drunken soldiers chased the children and beat them with the butts of their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers opened fire on the group of children.
Julianus Yemo, 16, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
Hours later, a raging fire broke out at the Electoral Commission building, a nearby government agency, and the incident escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
Carrying ceremonial hunting bows, they danced the waita dance of Papua&#39;s Mee Pago tribe - running in circles and imitating bird song.
Some protesters began throwing stones at regular military posts.
As emotions continued to escalate, soldiers received orders via internal radio: &quot;If the crowd resists more than three times, they will be shot immediately,&quot; according to an official document seen by TIME. The document was not released to local media.
Sensing imminent danger, 56-year-old Yeremias Kayamu, chief of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, called on the crowd to calm down and implored them to go home.
But no one was in the mood to listen to him.
&quot;When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist,&quot; he told TIME while standing on the porch of his brightly painted log house.
Kayamu still doesn&#39;t know who fired the shot, but he said the bullet came from among the gathered soldiers.
He added, &quot;It was very crowded and they fired a lot of shots.&quot;
According to the cousin of local Orfuyus Yule, he witnessed the shooting and saw Orfuyus Yuhl was shot three times.
&quot;I ran over to check on him to see if it was him,&quot; Yohanes sadly told Time magazine.
I found him dead...I kissed him. &quot;
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yogi Mende told reporters that his subordinates were only &quot;protecting&quot; the police station because it was under attack.
In 2015, Papua police spokesman Police Chief Pugio Sulistio said “When someone threatens to kill us, we must defend ourselves.
This is a matter of life and death. &quot;
Five young protesters were killed and many more were injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
News of the killing spread only slowly in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, expressing deep sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address Papua&#39;s legacy of abuses.
&quot;I hope this case can be resolved as soon as possible so that something like this doesn&#39;t happen again in the future,&quot; he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wirando stated that he would establish a non-judicial mechanism to resolve the historical issue of human rights violations.
But the excuses came out almost immediately.
&quot;Most of the violations happened a long time ago,&quot; he said.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but this is a process. &quot;
Then on June 5 in Jakarta, Wilando went back on his words in a conversation with Time magazine, saying he had no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said &quot;everything will be resolved in accordance with the law.&quot;
The United Nations has charged Wilando with &quot;crimes against human rights&quot; over the deaths of more than 1,000 people during East Timor&#39;s bloody 1999 independence vote, but he said 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua have been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Relatives of the victims of the Paniai incident scoffed at these remarks.
&quot;I&#39;ve been interviewed four times in the last three years and things haven&#39;t progressed at all,&quot; Yohanes said.
Years later he said &quot;I&#39;m tired.&quot;
He still lives in fear.
&quot;I&#39;m scared,&quot; he said.
I was afraid of being arrested by the military, of being shot. &quot;
His brother Yukabus also believes that the people of Paniai are afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping bury four victims.
&quot;After burying the body, the military came to see me,&quot; he said.
The shooting didn&#39;t stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deyai district, a neighboring county in Paniai.
A construction company manager refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital, resulting in a clash that left one person dead and 17 others injured, including children.
Lavianus Dove, a 24-year-old man, drowned while fishing in a nearby river and died on the way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company&#39;s field office.
Police said villagers threw rocks at police, so officers fired warning shots.
But the Riot Mobile Unit (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting into the crowd, and one person was killed.
“We all panicked and now we’re afraid they will retaliate,” Domingo Badi, 29, who lives near the hospital and watched the wounded being rushed into the hospital, told Time magazine.
&quot;I hid at home for two days.&quot;
The Deyayi parliament has called for the police officers involved to be brought to justice and for the anti-riot mobile unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a place of contention for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has fostered dissatisfaction among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribal people, who are scattered across Paniai&#39;s lush central highlands.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans through scattered attacks and raids to kidnap Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Paniai, including Tadeus Yogi and Daniel Yodas Kogoa.
As a result, thousands of Paniai people have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military in recent years under the guise of &quot;maintaining national sovereignty.&quot;
Some were never seen again.
In the eyes of Papuans, Paniai is a &quot;forgotten tragic place&quot;.
Poverty breeds dissatisfaction.
There is so little rice for sale in Enarotali that locals cannot afford it.
Bread was simply out of reach.
People here grow everything they can eat: mostly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming was women&#39;s work, and each woman tended four or five sweet potato plots.
They usually keep most of their harvest for home use and sell the remainder in local markets.
Ten pieces of sweet potato cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 US cents).
Over time, economic inequality has widened between local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased significantly since the new route to Nabire Airport opened.
The few jobs that existed generally went to better-educated and wealthier immigrants.
Few Papuans have the capital or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
&quot;Young people don&#39;t want to stay in this village... because there are no jobs and no money here,&quot; said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Papua is isolated.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basel Longchamp were expelled from Papua because they &quot;failed to cooperate with the relevant authorities&quot; even though they had received rare authorization to film.
Jokowi&#39;s election vow to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not been fulfilled, according to Felim Kane, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch.
&quot;If foreign journalists try to cover Indonesia&#39;s disaffected easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua, they face new risks: visa denial and blacklisting,&quot; he said in a statement.
The lack of media scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua&#39;s neighbors.
In March, six Pacific countries - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate &quot;widespread human rights violations&quot; in Papua, including the Paniai shooting case.
These countries also supported the Free Papua Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Armanata Nasir was dismissive of the group&#39;s accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta that &quot;Indonesia still operates a democratic system and has a free media, so it is difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations.&quot; .”
Locals want more foreign governments to take notice.
When Dutch human rights ambassador Keith Van Baar led a delegation of officials to Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence and begged, “We want freedom,” according to a person familiar with the matter who also attended. attended the meeting but requested anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
Tribal Council Chairman Gobai said &quot;Jokowi has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who were involved in the Paniai shooting.&quot;
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai not only live under threat from a greedy military, but also have nothing, a region with little education and little public health care.
Gobai said the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, view their vote for Jokowi as a debt he must repay.
&quot;They don&#39;t want money, they want justice,&quot; he said.
Even in the face of threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims still made their last symbolic act of resistance: burying a victim&#39;s body opposite the military police post.
They know justice may never come, but at least they won&#39;t let those responsible forget their crimes.
Yukabus lowered his head and said, &quot;My family was killed;
What else can we do? &quot;

Fire engulfs Dubai&#39;s &quot;Torch&quot; skyscraper again
A fire broke out in one of the world&#39;s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-tall, 79-storey supertall.
This is the second fire to sweep through a high-rise building in just two years, and it happened to be the skyscraper known as the &quot;Torch&quot;.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and the cause of the blaze has not yet been discovered.
“We were sleeping and then we were woken up by the fire alarm and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor,&quot; a resident named George told Reuters.
Firefighters extinguished the blaze at around 4:00 local time (0000 GMT) and were working to cool the building, Dubai&#39;s civil defense authorities said.
The government said it was working to provide shelter to those affected.
The incident is likely to rekindle concerns around the world about the safety of exterior materials used in high-rise buildings.
An investigation by the management of the Torch skyscraper after its 2015 fire found that much of the damage was to decorative and insulating cladding panels.
British police have said they believe problems with the insulation and cladding systems at London&#39;s Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June that killed about 80 people.
Williams also hinted that Massa could return, despite having announced his retirement.
There is only one month left before the opening of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea on January 9. As the Olympic flame is passed from south to north, warm-up and preparations are in full swing, the atmosphere of the Winter Olympics in South Korea is getting stronger.
South Korean public opinion expects this long-awaited inter-Korean meeting to bring an &quot;Easter egg&quot; to the one-month countdown to the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.
On November 1 last year, the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics flame arrived in South Korea.
The craze created by the flame was directly reflected in ticket sales for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the ticket sales rate for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics was only hovering at 32%, and the ticket sales rate for the Winter Paralympics was only 4.3%. The sluggish ticket sales rate once caused the outside world to doubt the Pyeongchang Winter Games. The popularity of the Olympics is worrying.
But as Lee Hee-beom, chairman of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Organizing Committee, predicted to reporters not long ago, &quot;As the Winter Olympics torch is passed throughout South Korea, the popularity of the Winter Olympics is increasing day by day. I believe that ticket sales will improve soon.&quot; .
According to Korean media reports, as of January 3, ticket sales for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics have reached 64%, and the ticket sales rate for the Winter Paralympics has also exceeded 50%.
In order to encourage foreigners to go to South Korea to watch the games, South Korea’s Ministry of Justice also announced on the 8th that it will extend the stay in South Korea for foreigners visiting South Korea to watch the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, up to a maximum of 120 days.
Survey finds more than one in five U.S. travelers bring prohibited items on board
A survey of airplane passengers found that more than 20% of passengers have intentionally or unintentionally carried illegal items through the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, and at least 6% of them have unintentionally carried prohibited knives or other bladed objects. machine.
Less than 1% of passengers claimed they discovered later that they had mistakenly traveled with a firearm, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people, conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also found that younger travelers were more likely to blatantly flout the rules.
Millennials accounted for 19.7% of respondents who admitted to intentionally trying to bring TSA-banned items onto a plane, compared to less than 15% of Gen Xers.
The most common items intentionally slipped past TSA screeners are food and beverages.
More than 3% admitted to intentionally carrying bladed objects through security, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also reported intentionally carrying prohibited drugs on board.
The company said it was surveying travelers across the country to understand the number of people who accidentally and intentionally bring contraband items through aircraft security checkpoints.
Not surprisingly, the people most likely to carry contraband through security — intentionally or not — are those who fly the most.
However, the company noted that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated to understand.
People are often unsure of what and how much liquid they can carry.
So it&#39;s no surprise that the TSA seizes the most banned liquids.
It was once thought that the TSA might treat books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights.
EPA chief Pruitt changes mind on Obama-era emissions reduction rules
One day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog air pollutants.
Pruitt proposed the change because the Environmental Protection Agency would be able to respond more quickly to the needs of state agencies that oversee environmental regulations than under previous administrations.
He made no mention of the legal challenges to his former position in federal appeals courts.
At issue is the Oct. 1 deadline set for states to begin meeting 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced he would delay compliance for a year to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid &quot;interfering with local decision-making or impeding economic growth.&quot;
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma attorney general before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long opposed tougher environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly turned to blocking or delaying regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday&#39;s sudden reversal is the latest legal hurdle in Pruitt&#39;s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped his authority by trying to delay enforcement of Obama administration rules requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt outlined his U-turn on ozone standards, saying he would strengthen the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s commitment to work with states and undertake a complex process to reach new standards.
&quot;Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet designated deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to sue before agreeing to an agreement to establish a designated timeline,&quot; said Pruitt, who in his previous job was an environmental advisor. The Conservation Service launched more than a dozen prosecutions.
“We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously. &quot;
Still, the EPA statement said Pruitt may again use his &quot;extension of authority and all other legally available authorities&quot; to ensure regulations comply with &quot;good policy and the best information available.&quot;
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broad rewrite of ozone regulations.
The House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has yet to come to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is leading a coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
&quot;EPA&#39;s reversal - following our lawsuit - is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans whose communities are directly impacted by smog emissions,&quot; Schneiderman said. .”
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and Columbia The District has joined New York State in participating in this case.
Ground-level ozone is formed when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources react with sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause severe respiratory problems in sensitive people and cause thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt&#39;s surprising about-face.
&quot;It is troubling that this common-sense measure is being met with intense pressure from the heads of agencies who protect the air we need to breathe,&quot; said Lori Ann Byrd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must fight to the bitter end the Trump administration’s ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests.”
In addition to the external factors of steel price recovery, companies are also struggling to reduce costs.

Shi Haiyong, deputy director of the Xiaoshan District Forestry Bureau, said that with the good sales situation, the production of flowers and trees in Xiaoshan has also achieved rapid development.
In the past two years, Xiaoshan&#39;s flower and tree planting area has expanded by 30,000 acres, with the total area reaching 180,000 acres. At the same time, it has actively developed outside the region. Xiaoshan&#39;s seedling farmers have established flower and tree bases across the country to reach 80,000 acres, an increase of 30,000 acres from 2008. .
While the planting area has expanded, the quality of seedlings has also continued to improve, and the stock value of nurseries has continued to increase. There are more large-sized, high-quality seedlings retained, and some seedlings are reluctant to sell.
Shi Haiyong also reminded that in the face of the current prosperity of both production and sales, producers should face it calmly and analyze objectively. They must not only realize that the social demand for flowers and trees will be long-term and constantly increasing, but also realize that market competition will become more intense. fierce.
On the morning of July 13th, Beijing time, the US company Somaltus filed a lawsuit with the East Texas District Court, accusing Apple of infringing on a battery technology patent it applied for in 2010.
The company has previously sued Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba over the same patent.
The lawsuit claims that the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,657,386, titled &quot;Integrated Battery Service System.&quot;
The plaintiffs hope to receive cash damages or royalties for infringing devices after the verdict is announced.
Judging from the indictment, the plaintiff seems to believe that the iPhone’s fast charging function infringes the company’s patents.
An iPhone with fast charging function will quickly charge the battery to 80%, and then trickle charge.
Somaltus is actually a so-called &quot;patent troll&quot; because the company does not provide obvious products and services, and relevant information is difficult to find online.
However, they have successfully reached out-of-court settlements with automakers such as Ford and Nissan over the patent.
The meeting believed that accelerating the development of informatization, promoting the interconnection, integration and efficient utilization of resources, and improving the level of industrial digitalization and intelligence are of great significance to promoting &quot;Made in China 2025&quot; and mass entrepreneurship and innovation, cultivating new momentum, and improving the quality of people&#39;s lives.

Trump pressured Mexico to pay for border wall, leaked phone records show
The Washington Post has leaked transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on January 27, Trump urged him to stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The US president reportedly expressed displeasure with his public criticism of the wall, with Trump allegedly telling him: &quot;You don&#39;t tell the press.&quot;
During his presidential campaign, Trump promised to build a wall on the U.S. southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his phone calls with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, showing tense exchanges between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal for the United States to undertake refugee deportations to Australia was &quot;ridiculous,&quot; &quot;obnoxious&quot; and &quot;stupid,&quot; having suggested the United States ban refugee resettlement and now insisting on a deal brokered by the Obama administration deal that would make him look like a &quot;fool.&quot;
Trump hung up the phone after telling Turnbull &quot;this was the most unpleasant call of the day.&quot;

Moore Beach massacre: Activists recreate racist lynching, demand justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury rumbles past a crowd of onlookers in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, toward the tiny Moore Ford Bridge.
Before the car reached the bridge, carrying four black passengers and a white driver, a group of white men with guns stepped forward and blocked the car&#39;s path.
The leader of the gang - a middle-aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a deep drag on his cigar and glanced through the windshield.
The passengers in the car were filled with fear.
&quot;We want - Roger!&quot; the man shouted.
&quot;Get him out of the car!&quot;
Screams pierced the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene on July 22 was just a repeat.
However, when the noose was placed around &quot;Roger&#39;s&quot; neck, almost all the spectators let out a real gasp.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore Ford Bridge to reenact the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mery Dorsey - were lynched and hanged by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .
No one has ever been charged with murder.
&quot;Even though we know who they are, even though we see them in the community, it&#39;s incredible that none of them have been arrested over the years,&quot; said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the reenactment.
&quot;This is a stain on history and a burden on our souls.&quot;
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia congressman and lifelong rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a compelling call to action, an annual reminder to those in the Monroe community of injustices that are never righted.
&quot;We want to prosecute, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first,&quot; he said.
&quot;Unless we get justice, we won&#39;t get healing and reconciliation.&quot;
The coroner covers the body of a Moore Beach lynching victim with a sheet on July 27, 1946.
More than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of participating in the lynching, according to FBI files obtained by NBC News.
But none of them were ever prosecuted.
While the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were known throughout town: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed Georgia&#39;s black citizens to vote in primary elections for the first time later that summer.
Around the same time, black sharecropper Roger Malcolm assassinated white landowner Barnett Hearst during a fight — seemingly over a woman, according to the FBI.
Brooks said the rumor around town was that Hester slept with Malcolm&#39;s wife, Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband&#39;s.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Roy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcolm out of jail.
Dorothy and cousins Mai Murray and George Dorsey accompanied him to the prison.
But as they returned from prison and approached Moore&#39;s Beach Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
&quot;As it turned out, it was Harrison who organized and ordered the murder,&quot; an FBI report concluded.
&quot;It is clear that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement who not only participated in the murders, destroyed evidence, and concealed the identities of witnesses.&quot;
Brooks is very succinct.
“This is a voting rights tragedy,” he said.
&quot;Their brutal murders sent a message to black people in this community: &#39;If you register and vote, the same thing will happen to you.&#39;&quot;
Cassandra Greene has been leading the annual reenactment of the Moore Beach Bridge lynching for nearly a decade.
Her expression is vivid and gripping, with a deeply racist background. Many people wish this type of racism no longer existed in America.
It&#39;s hard to watch, and even harder not to watch, but Green says that&#39;s the point.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to talk about lynching because lynching makes us face the ugly side of everyone,&quot; she said.
&quot;But I can&#39;t have a relationship with you if you don&#39;t listen to me or hear me tell my story.&quot;
This year&#39;s show began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Green delivered an overview of the rehearsed show.
Wade Marble serves as Green&#39;s co-director.
He&#39;s played the role of a Klansman for years, but he says the role has never been easy.
&quot;I feel dirty because that&#39;s not who I am,&quot; Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s important to keep this history alive because we don’t want to go back to that era.”
In the room, actors Darios Bradshaw and Nick Lascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hearst, rehearse their lines.
The scene begins with Malcolm yelling and pushing Hester away, furious that he slept with his wife, Dorothy.
&quot;I said, get out of my territory!&quot;
Lascona shot back.
Then they started fighting.
Then everyone (at least all the black actors) burst out laughing.
Green laughed the hardest.
&quot;What happened?!,&quot; Lascona asked.
He was panicked and confused.
Have I overacted?
&quot;No,&quot; Green said with a smile.
&quot;I just don&#39;t think white people say &#39;ugh&#39; when they say that back.&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; another black actor quipped.
&quot;You have to sound strong.&quot;
Just like that, the energy in the room shifted; the feeling of camaraderie drove away the discomfort.
Everyone strives to do so not only to perform the scene but also to honor the four victims.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Lascona said the word &quot;Ah,&quot; his tone was sharp and forceful.
No one laughed.
The reenactment ended powerfully and quickly.
There were screams, gunfire, and then, silence.
A woman in funeral black stood next to the actor&#39;s body and sang Billie Holiday&#39;s eulogy &quot;Strange Fruit.&quot;
Her voice spoke above all other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators were wiping away sweat and tears.
The audience was almost evenly split between blacks and whites.
A couple traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the show, and many others lived just down the road.
Brooks took them to visit Malcolm and Dorothy&#39;s gravesite, a nearly eight-hour journey, all enduring the uncomfortable humidity of Georgia.
To this day, the murderer remains a mystery. But now, standing on the same ground where the lynching took place, anxiety is in the air.
As the final notes of the song faded, Green asked people to come closer and examine the actor&#39;s corpse.
The children hunched over the fake blood and corpses, whispering to each other.
&quot;They&#39;re not really dead,&quot; a little boy muttered, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes, Green thanked the crowd and the show ended.
The actor shook off the lynching rope and wiped away tears.
Bradshaw hugged Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Lascona hugged two of his colleagues and cried in their arms; the emotion of the performance eventually got to him.
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; one of the women whispered.
&quot;We know that&#39;s not what&#39;s going on in your heart.
You do this for a reason. &quot;
Afterwards, the audience sat down to dine with the actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted intimately about reenactments with a black couple they had just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words to describe how she felt after watching it.
&quot;It&#39;s hard to imagine that those horrific words and actions ... could be said and done by someone like you because they look so much like you,&quot; she said.
&quot;That, to me, really makes me think that lynchings are still going on,&quot; she added, &quot;and now it&#39;s just called police shootings.&quot;
Inside the room, Tyrone Brooks sat at the table watching, savoring and reminiscing about civil rights.
He said he&#39;s already starting to plan next year&#39;s show.
“The reenactment is inspiring because it describes the horrors we experienced, but it’s also very educational,” he said.
“If you don’t learn from this, it could happen again.
Those who do not study and understand their own history are doomed to repeat the same mistakes. &quot;

US media: Scientists from China&#39;s Air Force Engineering University study laser satellites to remove space debris
Reference News Network reported on January 18 that US media said that Chinese scientists have put forward a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up the cluttered Earth orbit and destroy old satellites and their sky debris.
According to a report on the US Newsweek website on January 15, researchers from the Air Force Engineering University of China wrote a paper titled &quot;Research on Orbital Change Model for Space-Based Laser Clearance of Small-Scale Space Debris&quot;. The paper describes how to use space-based laser to remove small-scale space debris. Based on platform lasers, how space debris can be irradiated by lasers into smaller, less harmful debris.
According to reports, space debris has been a concern for international space agencies for many years, and NASA has considered a variety of options to track, detect and remove man-made debris.
Ways to remove large-scale space debris include giant nets to sweep and collect waste, and magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies and came to the conclusion that this would be an effective way to clean up the Earth&#39;s orbit.
The abstract of the paper states: &quot;(Simulation research) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of laser space debris removal technology on space-based platforms.&quot;
A 2014 study by U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin found that there are approximately 200 threats to satellites in orbit every day.
High-speed debris moving along the Earth&#39;s orbit is regarded as a serious threat to future space missions and has been described by experts from the European Space Agency as a &quot;deadly chain of threats.&quot; High-velocity debris continues to increase with every passing year.
According to a report on the website of the American monthly magazine Popular Mechanics on January 17, space is basically empty, but the space next to the earth is becoming more and more crowded. Every satellite we send into space ends up being just another piece of debris orbiting the Earth, and over time, the debris accumulates.
The more debris there is, the higher the chance that a functioning satellite will be hit by debris, damaging or destroying a multi-million dollar investment.
According to reports, all space agencies have formulated plans to remove space debris in the future.
NASA is considering using jet gas to slow down the debris and deorbit it. Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net to capture the debris and bring it back to Earth. Japan&#39;s idea is to use an electric chain to capture the debris.
At present, China has also proposed a solution to space junk, which is to use a large laser to break floating space junk into small, less harmful fragments.
Installing such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean up space, at least according to simulations, according to a paper published in the German monthly Optics by a group of researchers from China&#39;s Air Force Engineering University.
According to reports, the only way to confirm effectiveness is to conduct tests. There are currently no such missions planned, but perhaps sooner or later someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space.
Once we do that, we can finally begin to eliminate the space junk problem once and for all.

Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72% as it embarked on another restructuring project to deal with business pressures.
CEO John Fallon said most of the job cuts will occur in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, and that 4,000 jobs have been reduced in previous restructurings.
Pearson announced in May plans to cut costs by a further 300 million pounds ($394 million) in its third cost-cutting program to revive a business hit by the rapid development of digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann and reported a 1% increase in underlying sales to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half, but said its outlook for this year was unchanged.
A few days ago, the Chinese Athletics Association issued a serious notice to crack down on the phenomenon of substitute running, and is preparing to impose heavy penalties on violators with life-long bans.
NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing attack on convoy in Kabul
A military convoy was attacked by a suicide bomber in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, official sources said.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded.
Unconfirmed local reports said three civilians also died in the incident in the city&#39;s Karabagh area.
It is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan - Tuesday&#39;s bombing of a Herat mosque killed more than 30 people.
A suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul on Monday.
According to a NATO statement, the bombing occurred late Thursday when a joint patrol of Afghan and NATO forces was attacked by an &quot;improvised explosive device carried by an individual.&quot;
The statement said that all injured personnel are currently in stable condition and are receiving treatment at the US military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
The growing presence of the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State (IS) group in Karabakh is causing serious concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram, journalists reported.
According to United Nations statistics, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, with the capital accounting for about 20% of the deaths.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb attack in a predominantly Shia area of Kabul killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban claimed they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a huge explosion occurred in the center of Kabul, killing more than 150 people. It was the deadliest militant attack in the country since the US-led multinational force overthrew the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlighted the country&#39;s precarious security situation as President Donald Trump weighs whether to send more troops to Afghanistan to support his army and police.
Suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the government and its policies, particularly President Ashraf Ghani&#39;s reputation, journalists reported.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reverses decision to delay smog regulations after lawsuit
Fifteen states sued the Environmental Protection Agency over a rule that required states to curb the types of emissions that cause smog when Obama was in office. One day after the lawsuit, the EPA overturned the rule.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday its decision to move forward with the so-called 2015 Ozone Attainment Areas and pledged that the agency would work with states.
&quot;We are confident in our dialogue with our national partners and committed to responding to them,&quot; EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June that the Environmental Protection Agency planned to delay implementation of ozone compliance zone standards - in which existing smog pollution is measured in some areas to determine which areas - by one year until October 2018. Emissions that cause smog pollution should be reduced to comply with air quality standards.
Fifteen mostly Democratic states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit Tuesday claiming the action is illegal.
As part of a broader agenda, President Donald Trump&#39;s administration has been working to reinstate various environmental regulations pushed by former President Barack Obama to spur economic growth.
But those efforts have sparked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups. They worry that more emissions will affect public health.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s website states that breathing air containing ozone “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.

Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for first time to discuss possible future showdown
The most high-profile sub-147-pound boxing match is set to take place soon, with Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, currently in the midst of a possible clash, meeting for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles, and Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, was the first to walk down the aisle to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
At Saturday&#39;s Showtime boxing match, the judges unanimously awarded Garcia victory over four-division world champion Adrien Broner. At this point, both boxers have become the top five fighters in their weight class. .
Garcia extended his right hand and said: &quot;Champion, how are you?
Good luck. &quot;
Lomachenko retains his status with a win over Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7pm on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko&#39;s manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the two fighters hinged on &quot;perfect size.&quot;
“I was a lightweight,” Garcia mentioned.
“I moved up a class to fight Broner (140 pounds), but I wasn’t that big.
At 140 pounds, I&#39;m still a little underweight.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he has to move up to lightweight (135 pounds) before we can fight.
This is what fans want too.
Then we will satisfy them. &quot;
Lomachenko agreed.
“The boxing world needs this fight.”
Klimas asked if he should pay-per-view, and part of his strategy is to have Lomachenko make his debut against a 135-pounder later this year, setting up a fight with Garcia (37-0, 30 KOs) next summer. Agree on a date. Garcia is also interested in fighting the winner of the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell fight after the Forum lightweight title fight on September 23.
&quot;This fight could be on pay-per-view because of all the fans asking about it,&quot; Garcia said. He has since expressed an openness to competing on networks that offer the best financial options.
“We are the main characters.
No one else could generate such a level of attention.
Whenever they&#39;re ready...&quot;
Garcia praises Lomachenko as &quot;a great fighter&quot; and may watch him live in Saturday&#39;s boxing match.
But Lomachenko hesitated to praise Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked &quot;very slow. Sorry, McGee... you&#39;re going to get knocked out.&quot;
Garcia said the point is to show the power of the punches and then the boxing.
They both said they could feel the momentum of their boxing matches.
&quot;This is a battle that must be fought,
The attention and buzz are unmatched by other boxing matches.
I’m very happy to compete,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I’ve been waiting for a top fighter and this time it’s McGee’s turn.
This will be a great matchup. &quot;

Officials from the China National Development and Reform Commission stated that the 11th Five-Year Plan emission reduction targets will be met ahead of schedule, giving the steel industry, which has been suppressed by electricity and production restrictions, strong expectations for resumption of production.
Although the steel mills have not yet received a clear notice from the local government announcing that the energy conservation and emission reduction work has ended, the industry estimates that around December 15, 2010, steel mills in various places that were originally restricted from production will gradually resume production, and steel prices may Will start to get stressed.
We have not yet received notice of the end of power and production restrictions, but in fact the pressure on various companies has been much less than in September and October, a source from a private steel company in Hebei Province told reporters.
Some places in Hebei have repeatedly issued documents on power and production rationing, and at one time imposed forced shutdowns to restrict enterprise production.
The reporter learned from local companies that steel mills in most areas of Hebei have resumed work, and the pressure to limit production has eased.
My steel network analyst Zhang Tieshan predicts that as winter has entered in the north, the terminal demand for construction steel will gradually turn from strong to weak.
Coupled with the gradual end of energy conservation and emission reduction, most steel plants will basically resume production by around December 15, and products will gradually arrive in various markets before New Year&#39;s Day.
The increase in resource supply will put some pressure on steel prices, which are currently rising.

Latest results of age assessment test for Swedish asylum seekers released
The latest results from Swedish tests of asylum seekers using the latest method to medically assess their age show that more than 80% of the subjects were judged to be over 18 years old, but not everyone is convinced of its accuracy.
Sweden&#39;s National Center for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed by the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) to provide a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process, after being accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some refugees claiming to be minors.
So far, the Swedish Immigration Service has sent 6,880 test takers, and the Forensic Medicine Center has now published the results of a total of 2,481 test takers between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
80% (2,002 people) were judged to be 18 years or older, but in another 25 cases, the Swedish National Center for Forensic Medicine determined that the subjects &quot;may be 18 years or older.&quot;
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was &quot;probably under 18 years of age.&quot;
The test is only for people whose age is in question.
According to John Grantson of the Center for Forensic Science, these results are consistent with those from previous months.
&quot;The figures are not that different from previous months, the numbers are very consistent,&quot; he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases where people are judged to be over 18 years old does not necessarily mean that these asylum seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the center released test results from 581 cases, saying 442 &quot;indicated the subject was 18 years of age or older.&quot;
Newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of 581 tests published this time and found that 243 of the subjects had publicly stated that they would turn 18 this year.
X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of joints, with the results analyzed by dentists and radiologists, are also being questioned in some quarters.
One of those skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing people&#39;s biological maturity to determine whether they are going through puberty earlier or later than normal.
He told news paper Metro: &quot;I have reason to think that and I don&#39;t think the measurement used should be that way.
Determining biological age in this way is highly inaccurate.
If we can&#39;t guarantee accuracy, we shouldn&#39;t pretend that we can. &quot;
Yet Grantson of the Center for Forensic Medicine defends the accuracy of the tests: &quot;In general it can be said that the risk of uncertainty in declaring a child an adult is small.&quot;
The greatest risk is that the person is under 18, which occurs about 10% of the time.
West Virginia governor announces party switch
West Virginia Democratic Gov. Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a rally for President Trump that he would be switching parties.
&quot;Like it or not, the Democratic Party has left me,&quot; the governor said.
&quot;Today, after a lot of prayer and a lot of thought, I&#39;m telling you...I&#39;m telling you today as a West Virginian that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor. .”
The rally erupted in cheers.
&quot;So, tomorrow, I&#39;m going to change my membership to Republican,&quot; Justice added.
&quot;As a coach, I&#39;m telling you it&#39;s time to start another game.&quot;
Trump earlier promised a big announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 percent of the vote, and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was named the state&#39;s only billionaire in 2016, according to Forbes.
&quot;Forbes&quot; pointed out that he inherited his father&#39;s coal industry and owned coal mines in five states.
Currently, he is worth approximately $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying: “Governor Justice’s change of party is another blow to the Democratic Party that, far from preventing our country from becoming great again, will make our country The country is great again.&quot;
&quot;Democrats currently have only 15 governors and control the lowest number of statehouses in history. Governor Justice&#39;s announcement is the latest rejection of a party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unifying slogan.&quot; Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement to CBS News.
Fang Wenshan admitted that it is his dream to tell a complete story through music.
With a song lasting four to five minutes, it’s difficult to tell a complete story.
When I write songs, I only have emotions and no storyline, which I always feel is a pity.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia&#39;s &#39;frank&#39; apology over doping scandal
International Association of Athletics Federations President Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised Russia&#39;s apology over the doping scandal, which he called &quot;candid&quot;, but reiterated that now was not the time for Russia to reenter the sport.
Russian Athletics Federation president Mitry Shiraktin told an IAAF congress on the eve of the world championships that his country was right to be banned from the sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he regretted that &quot;all the athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were deprived of their medals.&quot;
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban. The ban was implemented in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
&quot;I thought the response today was a very candid, very candid presentation,&quot; IAAF president Coe told reporters.
&quot;The entire Council and the Athletics Congress are pleased... that the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has been through a very anxious period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can return to competition.&quot;
Coe said he was also &quot;pleased&quot; that Russia had accepted the criteria for re-entry.
&quot;I think it was a very constructive day and I think we have made some progress, but the Athletics Congress supports the task force&#39;s recommendations and it is not the time to reinstate Russia&#39;s qualifications,&quot; Coe said.
“We need to do everything we can over the next few months to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle has always been the desire to separate clean athletes from contaminated systems,&quot; he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes have met the IAAF&#39;s strict standards and will compete as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
Rune Anderson, head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia had not yet met several criteria to resume competition.
He told reporters after a speech to the IAAF Council in London that drug testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still coaching.

What impact will football&#39;s financial rules have on Neymar&#39;s move to Paris Saint-Germain?
Rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending by Europe&#39;s top football clubs will not hinder Neymar&#39;s record-breaking move from Spain&#39;s FC Barcelona to France&#39;s Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).
The consequence was that the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) further downgraded the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club. The Union of European Football Associations, the governing body of European football competitions, has the power to ban teams from participating in the widely watched Champions League.
The introduction of Financial Fair Play (FFP) by UEFA in 2011 meant that PSG would eventually have to prove that Neymar&#39;s transfer was funded without incurring a huge loss.
FC Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to cover the Brazilian player&#39;s release fee, and Neymar&#39;s salary will be tens of millions of dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Neymar&#39;s move to France.
Given that the team is funded by Qatar&#39;s deep-pocketed ruling family, PSG could certainly use the cash to sign Neymar and add him to its other star-studded squad.
Clubs can spend huge sums of money to buy players, but they must use legitimate revenue sources to make up for the huge sums spent, allowing them to break even on football-related operations.
The Financial Fair Play Rules were an idea proposed by Michel Platini after he was elected as UEFA president in 2007.
The former France player believes that for clubs that have racked up debt in their pursuit of success, they are effectively cheating and risking their destruction if banks or owners withdraw support.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from club debt issues to the monitoring of club losses.
The change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich when he bought Chelsea in 2003 was to buy a club with potential, then spend huge sums to improve the team and build it into a global Brands are now facing a more demanding situation.
Over the three-year Code review period ending in 2018, clubs could lose €30 million.
Although Abramovich was disparaged by his then-president in 2015, UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin remains committed to stemming excessive spending.
&quot;Of course the Code has not expired and we will definitely strengthen the regulations in the future,&quot; UEFA&#39;s Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the Code, told The Associated Press last week.
While PSG will pay Neymar&#39;s buyout clause in a lump sum, it can also distribute the amount for accounting purposes over the life of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee will likely show up as a fee of €44.4 million in annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of Code sanctions, imposed in 2014, saw Paris Saint-Germain, as well as Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the toughest sanctions.
Paris Saint-Germain was fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the time of exchange), later reduced to 20 million euros, and ordered to reduce its roster to 21 players in the 2014-15 Champions League. Instead of the normal 25 players.
UEFA is eyeing clubs trying to deceive financial regulators by tying themselves to owners to boost revenue.
While Qatari companies can sponsor Paris Saint-Germain, UEFA will not consider it legitimate income if the amount is deemed to exceed standard market value.
This is what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount paid by Qatar Tourism Authority to sponsor Paris Saint-Germain was inflated.
According to reports, part of Neymar&#39;s earnings at Paris Saint-Germain could come from payments from the organizing committee for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
However, PSG and the organizing committee have both denied that Neymar will serve as a World Cup ambassador, and it would be easy for UEFA&#39;s governing body to make such a move.
The recent sanctions imposed on Paris Saint-Germain mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant about any attempts to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not held pre-discussions with Paris Saint-Germain over a transfer for Neymar, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation at PSG.
The last published accounts showed that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club had operating income of 542.4 million euros in 2015-16 and a profit of more than 10 million euros.
Accounts for the previous financial year have not yet been published.
Paris Saint-Germain expects Neymar&#39;s arrival to be a boon for sponsorships, franchises and jersey sales.
The club expects revenue to increase by at least 30% after signing Neymar.
Clearly outraged to see its most famous player leave, the Spanish league sought to block Neymar&#39;s move, claiming PSG had breached the Rules.
&quot;This is a clear example of &#39;financial doping&#39;, both for the club and the country,&quot; La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Paris Saint-Germain&#39;s final possession Ownership of Qatar.
Arsene Wenger, the manager of Arsenal (the club is owned by an American sports tycoon), has reservations about state-funded clubs and La Liga.
&quot;This is a consequence of ownership, which has completely changed the whole ecology of football in the last 15 years,&quot; Wenger said on Thursday.
&quot;Once the country owns the club, anything can happen.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the Rules because there are many different ways or various interests for a country to ask big-name players to represent a country. &quot;

The 3D family animated film &quot;The Legend of Doufu&quot; held its premiere in Wuhan on the 25th. Director of &quot;The Legend of Doufu&quot; Zou Yi, &quot;The Legend of Doufu&quot; animation director Meng Zhihui, and the film&#39;s soundtrack producer and Emmy Award winner Tom Disher all made appearances. Share the behind-the-scenes stories of film creation live.
&quot;The Legend of Dou Fu&quot; is based on the story of Liu An, King of Huainan in the Han Dynasty in traditional Chinese culture. It is derived from the traditional allusion of &quot;Liu An made tofu by mistake&quot;. It tells the story of the protagonist &quot;Dou Fu&quot; who transformed from a bean into a human form and overcame the difficulties. A story about persisting in the dream of cultivating immortality despite many difficulties. This animated film about cute animals cultivating immortality has deep roots in Hubei’s local culture.
Wudang Mountain in Shiyan City, Hubei Province is one of the world cultural heritage sites announced by the United Nations. It is also the birthplace of Taoist culture and Wudang martial arts. It is known as &quot;an unparalleled scenic spot in ancient times and the best fairy mountain in the world.&quot;
Director Zou Yi revealed that in the early stages of film creation, he and the creative team went to Wudang Mountain to collect stories.
He said that the story of &quot;The Legend of Dou Fu&quot; took place during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Western Han Dynasty, when Liu An, the king of Huainan, was refining elixirs and cultivating immortality. The protagonist of the film, &quot;Dou Fu&quot;, was a bean that accidentally transformed into a human form while Liu An was refining elixirs.
In addition to Wudang Mountain, the birthplace of Taoist culture, Hubei also has a deep connection with chimes, a traditional Chinese musical instrument with a long history.

Nostalgic appeal takes the market by storm - &quot;Summer Camp&quot; and &quot;The Detectives&quot;
The retelling of this story is a nostalgic reference to the actors&#39; 80s glory days and the 90s grunge era (around the time David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy Country for MTV); but also to nostalgia itself. , a throwback to 2001, a year before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd were making their mark.
As a cultural artifact, it is a parody and embodiment of lasting memories in our age of Facebook.
But as a series, it feels like there’s just not enough time.
&quot;First Day at Camp&quot; was a hit upon its release, but not just because of its absurdist humor (the plot was an original story about a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
The plot doubles down on the central gag - middle-aged actors playing children at the age of causing trouble - which makes the inability to go back to the past part of the fun.
In &quot;Ten Years Later,&quot; adults actually play adults, the emotions are less grounded and the imitations are more loose, including riffs on &#39;90s stalker films like &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.&quot;
At one point, a character is stuck with an Apple laptop, some inline skates, and &quot;some other stuff from 1991.&quot;
Much of the core story is the same.
Mr. Sweetheart (played by Mr. Showalter) has now become a novelist, but he still has not forgotten Katie (played by Margaret Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
There&#39;s another sinister plot involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Showalter), instigated by George H.W. Bush (an impressive Michael Ian Black) .
As always, the best part of this series is the interjections.
It&#39;s especially fun to see the ever-young Mr. Rudd, who showed off Matt Dillon&#39;s soul patch in &quot;Bachelor&quot; and the previous &quot;Giant on Campus&quot; Andy now feeling like a giant.
It&#39;s the random moments of madness that might provide the impetus for this film, like a recursive &quot;Seven Years in the Life&quot; series, until it reaches what I think is its logical conclusion: &quot;Hot Camp: Twenty Years Later,&quot; its final One scene involved sending the cast to watch the movie premiere of &quot;Camp.&quot;
Meanwhile, Amazon&#39;s &quot;The Twosome&quot; speaks to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of &quot;The Hustle,&quot; the movie &quot;Butterfield,&quot; even the East-West wrestling imagery of &quot;GLOW&quot; 》.
This comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka was brought to the TV screen by director Rhys Thomas: This is a comedy about brothers and sisters, set in Romania in the 1980s, telling the story of two people. The story of a Bucharest official who fought for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist line.
The main characters - the hard-boiled Gregor and the idealistic Essef - are played by Florin Pierschi Jr. and Corneliu Ulic, respectively, with dialogue by Channing Tatum (who also executive produces Filmmaker) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt provide the English dubbing.
This is a brilliant idea.
But it&#39;s not just an idea.
There are some good sight gags (the cops watch chess on TV to kill time because Americans like to play football).
And a host of celebrity voice actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Hashabaz Ali and Chloë Sevigny - create a spectacular soundscape.
But &quot;The Twosome&quot; is so committed to being a raucous propaganda comedy - complete with a killer in a Reagan mask - that it often plays that role.
The six-episode piece of television drags a bit, and the comedy doesn&#39;t come out quickly or often enough.
The film&#39;s length is more tightly edited and provides greater provocative satire during Gregor and Essef&#39;s repeated visits to the U.S. Embassy, where two fat men are always present in the lobby. Gobbling down a bunch of burgers.
To the imagined communist audience, this message meant that Western culture could turn anything into fodder for carnival.
The creators of this Romanian-themed fictional story are not wrong, and we even use our own recent history and theirs to tell the story.
The reporter learned from recent interviews that the efficiency of steel, rail transit, shipbuilding, machinery manufacturing and other industries in Northeast China has generally declined, and even suffered losses.
Some experts believe that under the current situation, the new round of revitalization of Northeast industry is not only related to the current economic recovery of the country, but will also have an impact on the long-term development and international competitiveness of my country&#39;s manufacturing industry. Therefore, adjustment and transformation are urgently needed.
Enterprise efficiency has generally declined, and traditional industries are now experiencing losses. The raw materials industry and heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing industry have experienced serious declines in efficiency or even losses. This is the primary manifestation of the Northeastern industry in this round of economic downturn.
In the past, during economic downturns, low-end and primary products were mainly affected. However, in this economic fluctuation, both high-end and low-end industrial products of Northeast traditional industries have been affected.
In the past few years, Ansteel Group (Weibo) started by adjusting its product structure, focusing on the development of high-end plates such as container plates, rails, ship plates and household appliance plates. However, this year the sales of these types have dropped significantly, especially the sales of ship plates. Sales fell by 50% compared with the same period last year.
Hao Qingshun, director of the Metallurgical Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. (Liaoning Provincial Commission of Industry and Information Technology) said that metallurgy is the third pillar industry in Liaoning, and its annual steel production capacity of 60 million tons ranks third in the country.
From January to May this year, Liaoning Province&#39;s crude steel output was 21.54 million tons. The production and sales of products required for projects encouraged by national policies and strong local government construction efforts were good. Products with more fierce market competition have experienced a larger decline. This is the performance of the Northeast manufacturing industry. Another characteristic.

Yang Yang said that he needed to mobilize his whole body&#39;s emotions to convey the character&#39;s hidden sadness to the audience. &quot;This is a new challenge for my performance. During the acting process, I was really holding back my internal injuries.&quot;
Liu Yifei revealed that she &quot;cryed so hard&quot; while acting in this movie that she cried to the point of collapse at one point.
The Japanese Olympic Committee recently stated that the Japanese delegation’s goal for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics is to win 30 gold medals and advance to the top three in the gold medal list.

The Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England will announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and loose inflation have dashed hopes of an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot;weak&quot; as it tightens the squeeze on household incomes while keeping interest rates in check.
Policymakers on the bank&#39;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, while a handful of members this month called for higher rates even as weak economic growth has dampened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England scaled back its growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7% and 1.6% respectively, warning that the squeeze on household incomes would continue while inflation would surge to nearly 3% in the autumn.
But it said interest rates would need to rise over the next few years to curb inflation from Brexit, while borrowing costs may need to rise more sharply than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw a massive economic stimulus package implemented a year ago due to Brexit.
The Bank of England will announce the suspension of its term financing scheme, which will provide banks with cheap funds from February next year, although the bank said that under the scheme, it currently needs an additional 15 billion pounds on top of 115 billion pounds.
In the minutes of the interest rate decision meeting, the Bank of England said: &quot;In the MPC&#39;s core forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term, as a contraction in real household incomes will continue to suppress consumption.&quot;
On interest rates, the bank reiterated that &quot;some monetary policy tightening&quot; is needed to tamp down inflation, and that it needs to be &quot;to a greater extent&quot; than markets expect.
The market is currently expecting the first growth to occur in the third quarter of next year and the second in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any increase would be &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;restrained.&quot;
The bank&#39;s growth forecasts for this year and next are trending downward, compared with forecasts in May of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank maintained its forecast for 2018 growth of 1.8%.
The pound fell against the dollar, with the euro not far behind.
Sterling fell 0.5% against the dollar to hit 1.31 and fell 0.4% against the euro to hit 1.11.
The no-change decision came after growing expectations for an upgrade were dashed by recent dismal growth data. GDP increased to 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with 0.2% in the first three months.
The bank said growth in the third quarter was likely to remain at 0.3%, although it would rise slightly by the end of the year.
Ordinary households have been hit by soaring inflation and negligible wage growth, and the Bank of England&#39;s latest inflation report did not bring good news as it said austerity will get worse before it gets better.
It said monetary policy &quot;cannot prevent&quot; the hit to incomes in the next few years, but wages were expected to recover &quot;significantly&quot; by the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, because of the depreciation of the pound, demand for British goods has increased significantly, and the economy will be stimulated, offsetting part of the impact of low consumption.
The decision comes a year after a shock EU referendum sent sterling plummeting and interest rates cut to 0.25% in August.
The Bank of England estimates it could take four years to fully have an impact on prices and the UK economy.
Even before the bank announced its latest interest rate ruling, there had been calls for a rate hike as inflation worsened for already-stressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation eased to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank of England said this was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess over its 2% target was already the bottom line for a weak pound.
Andrew Montelake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become more competitive again as lenders clamor for more business and look to start the year on a positive note. A perfect ending.
Such a market looks particularly good for those who may be approaching the end of an existing deal, as remortgages (many with no fees and low interest rates) are becoming increasingly popular.

NHS gives green light to controversial HIV drug
Patients will be able to access &quot;transformative&quot; HIV prevention treatments from September after the High Court settled a decision on NHS funding of the drug.
NHS England has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sex, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk groups by around 86%. The health service will now offer the drug to an estimated 10,000 people in an initial three-year trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year. The ruling said the NHS has the power to pay for PrEP, despite claims that local authorities should fund the drug.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a &quot;significant new intervention&quot; by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a &quot;critical moment&quot;.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people. More clinics will join in October, before full rollout across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medication taken before sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
Trials have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means your body has enough of the specific medicine to prevent HIV infection.
This medication can be taken daily or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay, bisexual men, transgender people and HIV-positive people who have not successfully received treatment.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who agree to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and people whose sex partners’ HIV status is unknown and whether they are receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and are registered with a GP can also sign up at their local participating sexual health clinic.
The scheme will cost £10m and NHS England signed a contract this week to procure the drugs following an international competitive procurement process.
The trial aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, uptake and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and enhance the broad and increasingly successful approach to HIV prevention.
This is another milestone in more than 30 years of worthy action making progress in solving humanity&#39;s major health challenges. &quot;
Deborah King, chief executive of the British AIDS Trust (NAT), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
If it does target those in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offers the potential to transform the UK&#39;s HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to a licensed new tool through an NHS-funded trial in England that can be administered independently without consultation with a sexual partner. Improvements in the lives of many, many people.
We applaud this announcement. &quot;
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: &quot;The priority now is to ensure trials are rolled out quickly across the country and no one living with HIV is left behind.
Now that we have purchased the PrEP trial drug, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk for HIV. &quot;
Shadow Public Health Secretary Sharon Hodgson said: &quot;After months of delays and government foot-dragging, the start of the PrEP trial is welcome and should have come sooner.
Evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the spread of this deadly infection.
This trial will bring us closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is important now to roll out this trial across the country as quickly as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and help us move closer to ending the spread of HIV in society. &quot;

Quality living: Use lofts and clever design to transform a small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Rae, a former banker with a passion for renovating homes, moved from her large house in Knightsbridge to a small apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - a testament to the new design that Joanne didn&#39;t pack it up and sell it.
&quot;Before this, I lived with my ex-boyfriend in a bigger house in Knightsbridge,&quot; Joanne said.
“I was looking for a house that matched the offer.
I saw this apartment in Earls Court and it also had very high ceilings.
I was so taken with it that I made an offer the same day. &quot;
Since the first viewing, the 1,000 sq. ft. apartment has now undergone a complete overhaul.
The apartment was originally a studio with a complicated layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - and Joanne wanted to add storage space and a loft to take advantage of the ample ceiling height.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That’s what I ask for,” she said.
To do this, she hired Erfan Azadi of Duck &amp; Shed architecture and design studio in Notting Hill to craft a home that took advantage of the 12.5-foot-high ceilings. This home is not just a development, it is a place where Joanne lives.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two upper and lower spaces, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine high enough for a person to stand.
Erfan had to think creatively so he could solve this problem.
“Steel structures are quite complex,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the space so that it was displayed up and down without having to hunch your shoulders.
It&#39;s not just as simple as building a simple platform, but starting the steel so that it&#39;s at about the right height for the function. &quot;
With this arrangement, Erfan was able to obtain two full-height rooms in the space - which could add a lot of interesting elements.
The loft features vintage copper windows by Retrouvius that overlook the charming living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver small furniture and Serge Mouille retro lighting establish the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in adding ambience, space and light.
Add mirrors to either end of a short hallway to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, a mirrored splashback acts like a window to another room.
In the entryway, a mirrored cubby provides Joanne with storage space for cutlery and glassware.
A beautiful living room has an inviting sense of space and the ability to stow away the kitchen when not in use.
Folding kitchens are not new.
But what’s unique about this fold-down kitchen is a garage-style lift door.
“There is a bit of engineering involved,” Erfan explains of the steel-reinforced veneered MDF doors.
&quot;It&#39;s balanced so when you push the door, it slides easily.&quot;
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an extra 16 square meters, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
&quot;At the end of the day, what you&#39;re selling is the square footage of the house -- or your property valuation is based on the square footage of the house,&quot; Erfan said.
&quot;Basically, the real estate agent will go into the room and make calculations based on floor size.&quot;
They will try to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials, thus giving the space a luxurious feel.
“The materials are hand-picked by you, so they help create an emotional bond in your home,” says Erfan.
“You don’t fall in love with wall power.
These things are important, but they won&#39;t grab your heartstrings. &quot;
It turns out that with good design and the addition of extra square footage, a standard apartment can transform into something that will wow you.
In fact, you might, like Joanne, choose to stay.

Two brothers battle for $500 million real estate empire
Forty years after their Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers are locked in a battle for one of Victoria&#39;s largest property empires worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a mansion in Tukara, three doors away from his brother Paul. The latter took him to the Supreme Court over the division of their real and business assets.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the brothers have been locked in a fierce Supreme Court battle over the division of assets.
Together, the brothers and their mother own 38 properties worth more than $500 million, which they have accumulated since the family purchased Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it to a chain of 160 retail stores.
In 1999, the company was sold for $85 million.
That money was then invested in real estate. The De Rutis family&#39;s current portfolio includes city offices, developments in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mount Buller, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin, described by his brother Paul as the &quot;primary mover and dominant figure&quot; in the De Lutis family, owns about two-thirds of the company&#39;s assets, while Paul owns about one third.
Documents submitted to the court stated that Colin&#39;s property was worth $316 million after conversion, while Paul&#39;s property was worth $176 million.
Paul came to believe that the division of real estate and cash proved to be a sticking point in the negotiations.
&quot;Colin&#39;s proposed property division leaves him, in my opinion, with what I consider to be the best property,&quot; he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several failed attempts at mediation.
Now the two brothers are still fighting for control of the existing business, with Paul saying Colin has kicked him out.
Colin denied this and accused Paul of poor management of certain real estate properties.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he said he wanted to resolve the dispute.
&quot;My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important option. My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important option,&quot; he wrote.
The cost of the case continues to mount and there are hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and submissions from firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, top law firms such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers retained by both parties Report.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were both Italian immigrants. They have been operating a restaurant and deli since the late 1950s and bought a store in Braunschweig in the early 1970s.
They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family&#39;s first jeans store.
&quot;When I was a senior in high school,&quot; where he started Westco, &quot;Paul was very young (about 10 years old),&quot; Colin said.
Anna de Lutis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to pass their fortune peacefully to their son
&quot;Luigi often told me that he never wanted his brothers to end up in court,&quot; she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group of Companies, with Colin saying Mark paid him $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Paul said both Luke and Mark were &quot;dissatisfied with the terms of the division of their property.&quot;
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member, according to a 2015 biography by a close friend of TV star Eddie McGuire.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul, as well as their lawyers, on Friday.
However, only Colin responded via text message. He said because the case is before the courts &quot;I can&#39;t really say much.&quot;
&quot;It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and take our family matter to court,&quot; he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he tried to accommodate his brother&#39;s demands.
&quot;Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in a dispute like the one we are having,&quot; he said, adding that he &quot;remains hopeful that the dispute will be resolved.&quot;
On Friday, that hope seemed dashed.
&quot;Our issues will be resolved through the courts in the near future,&quot; Colin wrote.

Trump&#39;s new chief of staff plans to limit president&#39;s media time
Others have tried and failed.
John F. Kelly might actually be able to do it.
If that&#39;s the case, then he&#39;s the first.
The new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reporting - in an effort to keep the big boss on a more even keel, according to US political news site Politico.
Here’s an excerpt from journalist Josh Dawsey:
“As new White House chief of staff John F. Kelly began his first day on the job with senior officials, he noted that he wanted to address one of President Trump’s major problems in the White House: the flow of bad information into the president’s hands.”
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the president make better decisions, which is why the information needs to be in his hands — whether in writing or in a briefing.
While Kelly&#39;s diagnosis seems plausible, others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media time.
President Trump has a long-standing TV addiction — and now in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still growing.
“If candidate Trump is frustrated by unfair coverage, it would be helpful to let him know that he’s also getting positive coverage from credible outlets,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico&#39;s Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that &quot;the key to reining in Trump&#39;s Twitter habits, according to the experience of six former campaign officials, is to ensure that the media messages he personally receives always include a certain amount of praise.&quot;
That&#39;s totally fine.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habits were ever “under control” is laughable.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don’t—that Trump’s tweets would have been even more heated had it not been for their intervention.
We may never have known about the tweets Trump didn’t send.
If his staff can save him from trouble, even just a few times, their efforts will be worth it.
But no one can keep Trump from stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing groups, people promote their worldviews and advance their causes by sending Trump material that may or may not be reliable.
Politico -- all about this story -- reported in May on the advisers&#39; penchant for strategically feeding the president questionable information.
Here&#39;s an example described by journalist Shane Goodmancher:
“Current and former Trump officials say Trump has a volcanic reaction to negative news clips, especially damaging leaks, as he frantically seeks to find out their source.
In late February, someone maliciously copied to the president an article from Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson’s website GotNews.com, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being “the source of numerous leaks” from the White House. , this was how Trump behaved at that time.
Even though Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, he has not provided any concrete evidence, and he has made numerous false accusations and later publicly denied them.
Trump read the article and then began asking officials about Walsh. &quot;
Goodmancher also said that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House secretary Rob Porter &quot;tried to set up a system to manage and document the documents Trump received.&quot;
The results of it?
Kelly plans to do the same thing in three months.
Maybe he can prove to be a more effective administrator than Priebus, but Trump is still the same impulsive Trump, and his aides still compete with each other for influence.
These eternal influences will make Kelly&#39;s task even more difficult.
Tourist style town: how the style intoxicates tourists
[Abstract] The potential of small towns in Zhejiang is gradually awakened.
Nowadays, these small towns have become important destinations for tourists visiting Zhejiang to appreciate Zhejiang’s landscape, taste Zhejiang culture, and feel Zhejiang nostalgia. They will also provide important support for our province’s efforts to build “Poetic Zhejiang” as the most beautiful tourist destination in China.
Better than style
&quot;The gongs and drums of the social opera accompany the rising moon, and the scent of sausages floats in the wind.
&quot;Walking around the ancient town of Anchang, Shaoxing, you can see traditional handicrafts such as barrel hoops, bamboo weaving, blacksmithing, shoemaking, lace picking, and cotton spinning everywhere, which fully demonstrate the intangible cultural heritage of the ancient town of Anchang. Tourists from all over the world are intoxicated in watching and experiencing the folk customs of Shaoxing. , appreciate the atmosphere of Shaoxing’s historical and cultural accumulation.
It is reported that during the three-day New Year&#39;s Day holiday this year, Anchang Ancient Town received more than 65,000 tourists.
In Zhejiang, small towns with unique styles like Anchang Ancient Town are dotted here and there: the shimmering light of Xitang in Jiaxing reflects the warmth and elegance of the Jiangnan water town; the white walls and black tiles of Quzhou&#39;s 28th Capital tell the vicissitudes of the thousand-year-old town; Taizhou Stone The fishermen&#39;s paintings in Tang Town outline the fishermen&#39;s life that is both traditional and modern... These small towns are the &quot;treasures&quot; of Zhejiang tourism and the &quot;heart favorites&quot; of tourists from all over the world.
In recent years, with the advancement of tourism construction in our province, the potential of small towns in Zhejiang has been gradually awakened.
In 2016, the General Office of the Provincial Government officially issued the &quot;Implementation Measures for the Creation of Tourist Towns in Zhejiang Province&quot;, proposing that in about 5 years, about 100 towns with honest folk customs, beautiful ecological environment, and tourism industry will be named after acceptance in the province. A rich provincial tourist town.
Nowadays, these small towns have become important destinations for tourists visiting Zhejiang to appreciate Zhejiang’s landscape, taste Zhejiang culture, and feel Zhejiang nostalgia. They will also provide important support for our province’s efforts to build “Poetic Zhejiang” as the most beautiful tourist destination in China.
The relevant person in charge of the Provincial Tourism Bureau said that under the upsurge of creating tourist towns, towns and villages across the province are now paying more attention to the creation of personalized tourism industry. New tourism projects and business formats are emerging one after another, bringing rich experiences to tourists and winning Good reputation.
Focus on promotion
Recently, hosted by the Zhejiang Provincial Tourism Bureau and Zhejiang Daily Newspaper Group, and hosted by the Zhejiang Daily News Group Tourism All-Media Center, the &quot;Town × Future Artists&quot; Sharing Session and &quot;Poetry and Painting Zhejiang? The Town Has Style&quot; 2017 Zhejiang Tourism Style Town Promotion The closing ceremony of the season was held at the Zhejiang Provincial Exhibition Hall.
“The charming town has the beauty of art and the warmth of life.
The style of the town lies in its originality, flavor, and hometown, a kind of original purity.
&quot;Xie Hanfeng, a teacher of the Film and Television Department of the School of Film and Television Animation Art of the China Academy of Art and a domestic first-line film and television advertising director, and Professor Xu Xianghong, Dean of the School of Art and Communication of China Jiliang University, talked about small towns such as &quot;The Small Town in the Lens&quot; and &quot;The Reconstruction of a Small Village&quot; Crossover story.
Many charming tourist towns in Zhejiang have profound cultural resources. Dong Xinjian, a representative of the town from Nanxun, Huzhou City, explained the traditional Chinese painting Nanxun at the scene.
The Jiangnan water town style has been popular among calligraphers and painters since ancient times. Nowadays, Nanxun Ancient Town has carried out in-depth cooperation with art academies such as the China Academy of Art.
A tourist-style town must have style elements, tourism elements, service elements and environmental elements.
Among them, tourism service facilities and environment are also very important.
If you are handed a timely umbrella on a rainy day, tourists can better experience the style of the town.
In this era of sharing, the Tourism Omnimedia Center of Zhejiang Newspaper Group has teamed up with the hottest shared umbrella company to customize a batch of &quot;Poetic Zhejiang&quot; version shared umbrellas, hoping to advocate the concept of &quot;sharing? Green&quot; and enhance the quality of tourists and the town. Residents’ awareness of civilized tourism and public morality create and share a beautiful tourism environment.
This has become a highlight in the 2017 Zhejiang Tourism Style Town Promotion Season activity &quot;Poetry and Painting Zhejiang? The Town Has Style&quot;.
Looking forward to wonderful
Up to now, Zhejiang Province has released the first batch of 21 provincial-level tourist-style towns to create a list and a list of 115 provincial-level tourist-style towns to cultivate and create.
As a key area for priority development of rural tourism during the &quot;13th Five-Year Plan&quot; period, the style town will eventually be built into a 3A-level or above tourist attraction, becoming a new model of diverse tourism products, outstanding tourism benefits, and win-win industrial integration.
The key to the attraction of a tourist-style town lies in its authenticity.
The beauty of a tourist-style town not only comes from the misty bridges and flowing water, but also from the long cultural tradition; rural revitalization comes from cultural confidence.
Throughout the world, the small town of Lise in the Netherlands, the small town of Hallstatt in Austria, and the French Pumpkin Town use tulips, &quot;salt&quot; and pumpkins as their core attractions respectively. They attract a large number of tourists from all over the world every year and realize tourism promotion. The town&#39;s economy took off.
For a charming town, the focus of &quot;highlighting characteristics and retaining nostalgia&quot; gives the town a distinct personality and soul. It also provides cultural infiltration, carries local cultural context, and highlights local civilization.
The tourist town uses culture and nostalgia as the link, humanities and scenery as the carrier, connecting tourists from all over the world, allowing traditional customs and culture to be inherited and innovated in the process of co-construction and sharing.
In essence, a tourist town is a complex open tourist attraction, and it should be a living space shared by local residents, foreign tourists and even travelers.
As the main battlefield for future tourism growth, tourism-style towns may not only change the rural ecological outlook, economic and social development methods, and the flow direction of industrial factors, but also be an important force in bridging the urban-rural infrastructure gap and awakening the revival of rural culture.
In the tide of accelerating rural revitalization, Zhejiang tourist towns will interpret more exciting stories.

RVers negotiate ditch, return to &#39;Rich Row&#39;
Some of the West Midlands&#39; wealthiest homeowners are at war again with determined caravanners who are demanding the return of land beyond their mansions as they negotiate a government-dug ditch.
The caravanners parked their 20 trailers in an open space off the busy Solihull Street, nicknamed &quot;Rich Street&quot;.
RVers with horses, babies in their arms and motorhome convoys are returning after being evicted in May, and the moat dug by the city has not stopped them from entering.
The slick and sophisticated group found a gap in the defensive line and squeezed their vehicles through the gap, although there was a section of the road that was not barricaded and suitable for passage.
Furious residents have lashed out at Solihull Council, saying it has &quot;poorly handled the issue&quot;.
One resident, who did not want to be named, said: “They got there on Monday night after coming to Bentley Heath and throwing stones at passers-by.
The committee should be ashamed of themselves as they are absolutely useless at dealing with the problem.
RVers arrived in May, were evicted, and now they&#39;re back.
There were quite a few here last night, and probably more today. &quot;
She added: “Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with this by imposing long-term bans to protect its parks.
I live in Streetsbrook Road and I&#39;m not willing to keep paying council tax if the council can&#39;t stop this.
One local resident, who asked not to be named, said: “It’s ridiculous, we’ve just seen the last group of RVers leave, only for another group to come and destroy it.
This time the number has increased again, and some people even saw horses grazing on the park lawn. &quot;
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: &quot;We are aware of unauthorized camping on an open field on Studsbrook Road and we are working with Solihull Police to take any necessary legal action. , let them move out as soon as possible.
To support our evidence gathering it is important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps us paint a picture of the situation for the court to review when we present the case to the court. &quot;

Italy takes tough stance on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue carrying out rescues unless they sign up to new operational regulations.
&quot;If NGOs do not sign up to the new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they will survive,&quot; Interior Minister Marco Minniti told Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti&#39;s warning came a day after Italian officials detained the crew of a ship belonging to the German aid group Youth Aid on suspicion that they were actually colluding with human traffickers to facilitate illegal immigration.
The aid group has only been in operation for a year and declined to comment on the specific subjects of the charges against Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
&quot;Saving lives is and will always be the most important thing to us, so we regret that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area,&quot; the organization said in a statement on social media.
&quot;After all the information has been gathered, we can only assess all the allegations and the situation at this time.&quot;
Italian officials have been monitoring the Youth Rescue ship Iuventa since October.
Its crews are suspected of carrying migrants brought directly from small boats by human smugglers and allowing the smugglers to make hasty escapes and reuse the ship.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place at sea 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to prosecutors&#39; documents. The contents of the document were published by Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of flagrant disregard for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area out of humanitarian fervor rather than any other motivation.
Ships such as the Iuventa apparently require an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities, as stipulated in the code of conduct.
Currently, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the code of conduct: Save the Children, the Malta-based Migrant Sea Aid Station and Spain&#39;s Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday that it believed the new regulations were unnecessary but acceptable because they would not bring any &quot;significant changes or obstacles&quot; to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti said the number of migrants arriving in Italy had dropped sharply in recent weeks, a sign that efforts to beef up Libya&#39;s coast guard and unite local mayors were beginning to bear fruit.
&quot;In recent days, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel,&quot; the minister said.
He unveiled plans for in-depth talks this month: with Libyan mayors to discuss economic development activities and with Chad, Niger and Mali on how to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries for Europe.
Lian Ping, chief economist of the Bank of Communications, said that since the industrial added value in the first three quarters of 2017 showed a quarter-end upward trend, it is expected that the growth of industrial added value in December may accelerate to 6.6%.
The cumulative growth rate of fixed asset investment in December is expected to be 7.2%, the same as last month and lower than last year.
Although industrial production will be weaker than October, it will be basically the same as November.
In December, my country&#39;s manufacturing investment was at a low level, but infrastructure investment improved slightly. Therefore, fixed asset investment in that month is expected to be the same as in November.

Beijing’s new “university decentralization” initiative: Tens of thousands of teachers and students from Beijing Chemical Industry will move to Changping New Campus
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Beijing University of Chemical Technology was held on the 2nd in Changping District, Beijing. The green campus covering an area of 1,800 acres was officially put into use.
The reporter learned from the ceremony that in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and control &quot;big city diseases&quot;, in recent years, under the background of coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei and the alleviation of non-capital functions, Beijing has accelerated the transfer of universities from the central city to the suburbs. Some universities have Teachers and students are moving in batches to new suburban campuses such as Shunyi, Daxing, and Fangshan.
The new campus of Beijing Chemical Industry is located in Nankou Town, Changping, covering an area of 1,800 acres and 40 kilometers away from the urban area. It is one of Beijing’s key projects to relieve non-capital functions.
The new campus is being constructed in three phases. The first phase has been completed and the second phase is expected to be fully launched at the end of this year. Once completed, it is planned to meet the learning and living needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduates, graduate students and faculty.

As of press time, fire officers and soldiers were working intensively on the rescue, and the city&#39;s health, safety supervision, environmental protection, public security, transportation and other departments have rushed to the scene one after another. No casualties were found.
Michelle Carter sentenced for text messages encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months in prison, which can be converted to probation after expiration. Additionally suspended for 5 years.
Carter was found guilty in June of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy&#39;s father told Thursday&#39;s hearing: &quot;My family is heartbroken.
My son is my best friend. &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.
She faces up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers believe both she and Mr Roy are mentally ill.
During the sentencing, Carter stood, wearing red trousers and a beige smock, with his hands clasped and his eyes looking downward through tears.
&quot;Her actions killed Conrad Roy,&quot; the prosecutor told the court.
“She took his life in order to live a better life for herself.
She failed to accept responsibility,&quot; prosecutors said.
&quot;She shows no remorse.&quot;
But Carter&#39;s lawyer said it was &quot;a horrific consequence that she deeply regrets.&quot;
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her &quot;age or maturity, or even her mental illness, would have had any significant influence on her conduct.&quot;
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy&#39;s mother, Lynn Roy, who said, &quot;Not a day goes by that I don&#39;t grieve the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and everything I do. I am trying to stand with his sisters in all of my pain that will be with us forever,&quot; the statement said.
Mr. Roy&#39;s sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was &quot;devastated&quot; by the realization that she would never be able to attend her brother&#39;s wedding or be an aunt to his children.
&quot;Losing someone who has been with me since birth is a pain that I will live with for the rest of my life,&quot; she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent because Massachusetts law does not criminalize encouraging another person to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his car; Carter was 17 years old that year.
The case drew national attention after Carter&#39;s text messages revealed she encouraged him to commit suicide.
&quot;Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, there are many ways,&quot; she said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
&quot;You need to do this, Conrad,&quot; she wrote in the period before his suicide, &quot;all you have to do is start the generator and you will be free and happy.&quot;
Judge Moniz said Carter used Mr Roy&#39;s death to gain attention and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There is a difference of legal opinion in this case.
One of Carter&#39;s few defenders was Amanda Knox, who was accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and was acquitted two years later.
&quot;Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail time,&quot; Ms. Knox, 30, said in an op-ed published in the Los Angeles Times.

The communication between players and other teams is also more comprehensive, and there are more and easier exchanges on and off the field.
After the game, captain Jiang Cuo said he hoped to gain experience by participating in the game and do his best for Tibet&#39;s basketball career.
It is understood that during the competition in Beijing, the players overcame factors such as low altitude and oxygen intoxication to show the image of Tibet.
Although track and field is a big winner of gold medals in the Olympic Games, and those who win the track and field win the world, the famous track and field athletes are at a disadvantage in competing for gold medals.
Audi to retrofit up to 850,000 diesel cars as carmakers face impact
Audi&#39;s announcement comes a day after BMW said it would provide software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW believes in &quot;more intelligent options for driving rather than restrictions,&quot; its chairman said, pointing to cities across Europe - including Munich, where BMW is headquartered - considering bans or restrictions on diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would retrofit 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies declared the move a recall.
European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
But nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and may cause asthma.
The cost for car companies to install equipment to offset emissions from diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep diesel vehicles price competitive.
As German automakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s government has been accused of letting the powerful companies go too far and ignoring signs of the problem.
The car companies are trying to avoid a repeat of Volkswagen&#39;s mistake of covering up its use of so-called defeat devices, which adjust emissions to comply with regulations when cars are tested and then return to normal under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation in countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi&#39;s engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zacchero Giovanni Palmio is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was embroiled in a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, with the German government accusing Audi of installing systems to evade European emissions requirements, broadening the scope of an investigation that had previously been limited to the United States.
The investigation into Audi could have major consequences for Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker takes a disproportionate share of Volkswagen&#39;s profits.
It is common for a movie to take one, two or even several years from preparation to release.
The animated film &quot;Big Fish and Begonia&quot; recently announced that it will be released on July 8. This film took 12 years from preparation to release!
Liang Xuan, the original author of &quot;Big Fish and Begonia&quot;, graduated from Tsinghua University majoring in thermal power at the age of 21. He founded Biantian with his friend Zhang Chun. In 2008, he received a million US dollars in venture capital from Lianchuang Ceyuan and launched his debut animated film &quot; &quot;Big Fish and Begonia&quot;.
The film has won many awards at home and abroad during the creative sample stage, and was even included by the Pompidou Center for Contemporary Art in France and praised as &quot;one of the most outstanding works of art.&quot;
Because it took six years from idea to production, the film was dubbed &quot;The Pitfall&quot; by millions of fans who were eagerly anticipating its release.
&quot;Big Fish and Begonia&quot; tells a fantasy story belonging to the Chinese. With the release of this finalized trailer, it has brought new expectations to all audiences.
Liang Xuan said: &quot;I have only done this one thing in the past 12 years, and now it has turned from a dream into a reality. I am both nervous and excited.&quot;
Zhang Chun said: &quot;I always think about using one-fiftieth of other people&#39;s budget to produce the same visual effect as others, and I drive the team crazy.&quot;
Dongguan, the &quot;world&#39;s factory&quot; that once relied on processing supplied materials and a large number of general workers, is setting its sights on high-level talents who can lead the city&#39;s repositioning.
During the high-level talent activity week held by the Dongguan Municipal Government recently, reporters from China Business News saw that some powerful local companies participated in talent fairs.
On the billboards that are particularly bright against the orange background wall, they each have a hefty price tag.
Therefore, the China TV Drama Production Industry Association decided to unite the national TV drama production industry to sign a self-discipline convention.

Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there&#39;s bad news: it&#39;s under threat from climate change.
Lavender is declining due to persistent drought and the emergence of virus-carrying insects, causing headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute (CRIEPPAM) in Provence, said: &quot;Lavender in Provence is facing a huge threat because the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years and spring rainfall has been significantly reduced. , while autumn is cloudy and rainy.
This affects the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a smaller species of cicada, a leafhopper that spreads tiny bacteria, and they appear in large numbers in very dry weather. &quot;
The key is the sheer volume.
As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is also sought after by the perfume and cosmetics industries.
Eric Chase said: &quot;In contrast to plants that can produce many large flowers and have very long ears, ours is smaller, stunted, missing or weak.
So we have less essential oils. &quot;
Solutions being investigated include better irrigation techniques and slowing evaporation of soil water, spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and developing more drought-tolerant varieties.
Compared with the sci-fi elements in the movie, the two leading actors said that what attracted them more was the story in the movie.
On the afternoon of September 5, a reporter from West China Metropolis Daily interviewed many well-known figures in the cross talk industry, as well as two cross talk performing artists. Surprisingly, they almost remained silent.
One is a Berlin actor and the other is a rising young actor. &quot;Psychological Crime&quot; is also the first collaboration between Liao Fan and Li Yifeng.
Mexico is in danger, journalist killed
The entire staff of the Riodoce weekly newspaper would normally gather on Wednesday to review their plans for coverage of the unrest in Sinaloa caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and the endless war on drugs.
But today, with the shadow of tragedy hanging over them all, they gathered to discuss safety.
They were told it was important to change their daily habits.
Two veteran journalists discuss whether they feel safer: bringing their children to the office, which was attacked by a grenade in 2009, or keeping them at home.
The security expert wrote three words on the blackboard at the front of the room: enemy, neutral, and ally.
They asked the reporters to list names under each column—no evidence required, observation and intuition were enough.
There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on government lists, or cartels, and this gang of villains makes reporting in Mexico dangerous.
The violence never stops, and the country is littered with corpses, including more and more journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012, according to records by the Committee to Protect Journalists. Journalists have died; 589 journalists are under federal protection after being attacked and threatened; at least seven journalists have died in seven states so far this year.
The last to die was their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
&quot;The biggest mistake was living in Mexico and becoming a journalist,&quot; Valdez wrote in one of his many books about drug violence.
Everyone can deeply feel that he is gone, although he is everywhere - a huge photo hangs on the facade of the &quot;Riodoce&quot; office building, Valdez raised his middle finger, with the words &quot;Justice&quot;; Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, two reporters in their 30s, wore T-shirts that also showed his smile, wearing glasses or his signature Panama hat.
The symposium took place less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor&#39;s office was established in 2010 to handle cases against journalists, it has only prosecuted two people, according to CPJ records.
With most of the thousands of crimes committed each year involving drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists&#39; killers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they continue to report on the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken and the land is riddled with holes.
Ibarra said that without information about the killers and without justice being served, holding security discussions would be of little use.
He said “it’s foolish to waste time attending a seminar like this.
As long as we don&#39;t know why, you don&#39;t trust anyone. &quot;
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the capital.
He had only made it a few blocks in his red Toyota Corolla before two men stopped him; they forced him out of the car and fired 12 shots, presumably because of the newspaper&#39;s name, which translates to &quot;The Twelve Rivers.&quot;
The gangster drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
He leaves behind his wife and two adult children.
Rumors abound in Culiacan.
But on the topic of Valdez, there was literally nothing but silence.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become the country&#39;s bloodiest battlefield, with rival forces fighting furiously.
It has become commonplace that one or more people are shot dead on the streets of Sinaloa every day and that cemeteries are filled with ornate two-story mausoleums of drug lords.
Forget for a moment that the &quot;calm&quot; state was when just one cartel controlled the seaside state and its ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, and even though Valdez was well aware of the dangers of the job, Riodoce co-founder and director Ismael Bohoque, 60, felt guilty for not protecting his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to the tragedy.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a cartel fighting several of Guzmán’s sons.
The report may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought the paper as soon as it hit newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper reporting the same story was confiscated.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death has significant implications for violence against journalists in Mexico.
His spirit lives on and his friends and colleagues believe he is always with us.
In 2003, he was still a senior reporter at &quot;Noroeste&quot;. That year he founded &quot;Riodoce&quot; with five colleagues and sold shares for $50.
In Sinaloa, &quot;it&#39;s impossible to go into journalism without dealing with the drug problem,&quot; Pohoque said.
Over time, the paper gained a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Journalists like being able to publish hard-hitting investigative stories without fear of censorship, and readers like newspapers to publish stories that others are afraid to report.
Five years after its founding, Riodoce won the Latin American María Moscarpo Journalism Award.
That same year, the Society to Protect Journalists awarded Valdez the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing the most truthful reporting on drugs in Mexico.
He admitted that he was also scared.
&quot;I want to keep living,&quot; he said when presented with the award by the Society to Protect Journalists.
Later in late October, he told local Rompeviento TV in an interview that &quot;drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
You must take on the tasks that fall on your shoulders as a journalist—either that or remain deaf and dumb.
I don&#39;t want to be asked &#39;What did you do in the face of so much death... Why didn&#39;t you speak out about what was going on? &#39;&quot;
The entire Riodoce staff misses Valdez, who cursed like a longshoreman, who was a friend who never spared a hug or advice, who was a teacher who knew how to survive.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat all the time.
I often go to the El Guayabo bar across from the office and always sit at the same table.
Now, they ask: Were his daily habits responsible for his downfall?
His death also forced them to think about how to do a good job and live well.
&quot;They don&#39;t like you getting their women and children into trouble, and they don&#39;t like you influencing their legitimate businesses and clandestine airports used to transport drugs,&quot; Bohokwe said.
These have crossed their bottom line. &quot;
The result is a heightened level of self-censorship and self-protection even in the safest of times.
Trust your instincts.
If you smell danger, stay away quickly.
The problem, says Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that &quot;breath is a sense that can be deceived... and then something like Javier happens.&quot;
He and others say the previous rules no longer apply in Sinaloa — just as they no longer apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where Smuggling routes are lucrative, institutions are weak, and government officials are corrupt and chaotic.
The situation is constantly changing.
Cell phones were suddenly not allowed in the room where Riodoce employees were attending security training, days after it emerged that spyware sold only to the government was said to be being used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers took refuge in the shade of a tree from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat.
They were sent by the state government to protect Riodoce&#39;s offices in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood in Culiacan.
Some reporters half-jokingly joked that they wondered whether these police officers were among the 50% that the governor himself said he could not believe.
Journalists have been traveling to the mountains for months, where drug cartels are in physical control.
This week&#39;s &quot;Riodoce&quot; mainly reports on three major events.
Among them was the murder of the brother of the great former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa;
There is also disclosure of government funding in the governor’s hometown,
and a kidnapping at an expensive restaurant in Culiacan, just a block from the prosecutor&#39;s office.
Officials have not released information about who was abducted or how they were kidnapped, so be cautious in writing about what the city knows: that the restaurant is a popular hangout for drug dealers and officials alike.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered to a politician from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated the political spectrum for almost the entire last century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in several high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous events at the site, including an incident in which a son of Mexico&#39;s top drug lord Guzman fled a military attack.
A few months ago, readers would have looked to Valdez&#39;s column for the most compelling information about the kidnapping.
&quot;We already knew what was going on,&quot; said Villarreal, 46, known as &quot;Skinny&quot; because of his thin stature.
Now all our communication channels to information sources have been cut off.
Valdez’s office is now used to stockpile signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, as employees have become something they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a handful of signs and walked out of the room, heading to the local prosecutor&#39;s office for a parade related to another reporter.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
Officials discovered a charred body and said DNA testing suggested it was his.
Across the country, journalists have become more outspoken, organizing protests and painting &quot;Save the Press&quot; on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, director Bohoqua was not in Washington, where he was working hard to gain international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez was killed, in a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
She also asked to resign from her position covering government affairs, given that her anger had affected her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that journalists in Mexico are &quot;surrounded&quot; by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that journalists were not only being victimized by drug cartels, but were also on the list of politicians and security forces who were complicit in organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 blamed police and public officials for more than half of attacks on journalists last year.
&quot;In Mexico, they make you die just to shut you up,&quot; Ramirez said.
Obviously, these murders are chilling.
No one has forgotten that six years ago, blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Next to her body was a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: &quot;I&#39;m here for my reporting.&quot;
Her head was severed and a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to it.
, after Miroslava Blechi was killed in March, some newspapers chose to close, such as the &quot;El Norte&quot; newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua state.
Others have continued, and in 2014 the director of &quot;El Manana of Nuevo Laredo&quot; was killed, but they continue.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a front-page story headlined &quot;What do you want from us?&quot;
Some journalists fled their hometowns or even left the country.
It&#39;s a tough choice.
It was difficult to find work in exile, and they still had to be cautious and alert to dangers on the streets.
Sometimes they are arrested, as in 2015 when photographer Ruben Espinosa was said to have been killed in a Mexican city along with four women, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind the scenes and continue to work, this is the daily dance of high-stakes decision-making.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that reporting on the drug trade terrified him.
&quot;Mexico was turning into hell, so I became a journalist,&quot; he said.
In the middle of the night on a recent Friday, as the latest issue of the newspaper went to press, Riodoce editors were sitting on the walkway outside their offices, drinking beers, when suddenly their cellphones rang.
Nineteen people have been confirmed dead in a series of gun battles between rival gangs and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan.
The fighting is still escalating, as foreshadowed by a series of cartel revelations in the area.
They uploaded the news to the &quot;Riodoce&quot; website on their mobile phones from the side of the road.
The headlines had to be changed the next day.
Sirens blared nearby - another life-or-death shootout in the area.
Bohoque glanced at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.
If they were afraid at all, they didn&#39;t show it.
On a large portrait of the newspaper&#39;s founder, who had been killed in action, his middle finger points to the point of view across the state of Sinaloa, and the entire Riodoce staff follows his lead.
&quot;How can you even want closure? The same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to put her out on the street to cover,&quot; Pohoque said.
China&#39;s self-driving tourism market size may exceed one trillion yuan in 2020
[Abstract] Against the backdrop of consumption upgrades and the prevalence of independent travel, self-driving travel is encouraged by national policies and favored by more and more consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving travel market, which is expected to exceed one trillion in scale, is also facing dual challenges.
Against the background of consumption upgrades and the prevalence of independent travel, self-driving travel is encouraged by national policies and favored by more and more consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving travel market, which is expected to exceed one trillion yuan, is also facing dual challenges. On the one hand, the development of the self-driving travel industry is not proportional to market demand. Self-driving travel organizers such as self-driving travel clubs and travel agencies are facing the dilemma of meager profits. On the other hand, the infrastructure and services faced by self-driving tours are still in their infancy.
Accounting for 60% of the total number of domestic tourists, the market size is expected to exceed one trillion
In 2016, there were 4.44 billion domestic tourists, and self-driving tours accounted for about 60% of the total domestic tourists. By 2020, the size of the self-driving tour market is expected to exceed one trillion.
According to statistics from the China Tourist Vehicle and Boat Association on the number of self-driving travelers, the number of self-driving travelers has continued to grow in the past five years, and the number of self-driving travelers has stabilized at more than half of the domestic tourist population.
At the same time, various regions and national levels have shown more attention and support to the emerging field of self-driving travel. From 2016 to 2017, policies and regulations related to self-driving, RV and camping tourism were intensively promulgated.
In July 2017, eight departments including the National Tourism Administration and the State Sports General Administration jointly issued the &quot;Development Plan for Self-Driving Sports Camps&quot;; in the same month, 14 departments including the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance jointly issued the &quot;Action Plan to Promote the Development of Rural Tourism and Improve Quality and Upgrading&quot; (2017)&quot;, self-driving travel was highlighted.
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self-driving tourism.
Self-driving travel clubs have meager profits, but a complete industrial chain is the key
Although the domestic self-driving travel market has huge potential and is actively guided by national policies, the self-driving travel industry is still in its infancy.
According to the &quot;2016-2017 China Self-Driving Travel Annual Development Report&quot;, there are thousands of domestic self-driving travel clubs, car clubs, car clubs, etc., but the majority of tourists arrange self-driving trips on their own. Tourists from various institutions such as travel clubs account for only about 15%.
At the same time, there are only a handful of online travel companies and traditional travel agencies that independently develop self-driving travel products. Many online travel platforms only sell self-driving travel products provided by some suppliers, and some self-driving travel clubs are also important suppliers.
In terms of organizing self-driving tour activities, it covers multiple aspects of &quot;food, accommodation, transportation, travel, shopping, and entertainment&quot;. It is highly fragmented, has a heavy upstream supply chain, and is highly random in tourist consumption.
Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of Beijing Xingtianxia Automobile Club, believes that self-driving travel clubs are essentially similar to travel agencies. The main profit model in the early days was mainly offline activities, with the core points being self-driving travel route products and group leadership services.
However, in the field of self-driving tours, the route products are now highly homogeneous and the service levels of tour leaders are uneven. Self-driving tour clubs are facing the need to transform again.
It can be seen that self-driving travel itself is not an independent industry. Instead, the displacement characteristics of self-driving travel have formed a cross-regional and industry ecosystem. It is very important to form a complete industrial chain.
Experts point out that in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important consumption element.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving travel industry, the experience characteristics should be enhanced, and the theme of &quot;self-driving travel +&quot; and the IP of self-driving travel products should be developed.
Scenic roads are not just roads, car campsites should not only satisfy food and accommodation
Facing the rise of self-driving travel, the development of basic supporting facilities for self-driving travel is also still relatively rudimentary.
Li Guanjie pointed out that the tourist scenic route is not just a road, but needs to integrate transportation and tourism elements. However, road construction and tourism itself are the responsibility of two departments. The transportation department still remains at the same level when adding tourism elements. The construction of toilets, information centers, publicity boards and other facilities is not well integrated with tourism.
Compared with the well-known self-driving tour route &quot;U.S. Highway 66&quot;, the construction experience is worth learning from.
The design of scenic byways is no longer the most direct and fastest path between the departure point and the destination, but follows the design concept of &quot;experience the joy of driving&quot; to provide self-driving tourists with the best enjoyment of the beautiful scenery along the road; scenic byways can combine point-shaped, The connection of the planar tourist landscapes not only retains the historical and cultural value of the eco-tourism resources along the route, but also can hold various themed activities to enhance tourists&#39; participation and recreational experience, and create economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to scenic routes, campsites are also important supporting facilities for self-driving tours.
However, among the self-driving tourists that the Beijing News reporter knows, not many choose to stay in campsites.
They believe that many campsites tend to be in infrastructure and can only meet the needs of food and accommodation. They are not high-grade and have a single product, which cannot meet the needs of self-driving tours, which include many elements.
Industry insiders who did not want to be named said that in the past few years, many companies that set up camps were to acquire land. After acquiring the land, the subsequent supporting infrastructure construction and services did not keep up. Many operating conditions were losses, and there was no With later capital injection, it will be difficult to make some corresponding supporting products.
Consumers
According to data released by the China Tourist Vehicle and Vessel Association in 2017, in terms of age, self-driving travel groups are concentrated between the ages of 21 and 40, especially those between 31 and 40 years old. This group of people has a certain economic foundation and is interested in personalization. The demand for travel is high, and most of them are family travel customers.
According to the accommodation survey, self-driving tourists prefer non-standard accommodation.
From the perspective of self-driving travel types, self-driving in peripheral areas is the most important type of self-driving travel, accounting for 84.32%.
Self-driving abroad is a dream of many people, but the proportion is still relatively small.
At the same time, with the increase in consumer demand, tourists who used to like to &quot;visit scenic spots&quot; by self-driving have begun to change their concept. They no longer &quot;get off the car to take pictures and get in the car to sleep&quot; during self-driving travel, but pay more attention to the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs used camouflage to hide from enemies
At first glance, it looks scary, but it looks like a statue.
Researchers have released the first study of the incredible fossil of a rhinoceros-sized creature discovered by Canadian miners, saying the fossil is so well preserved that experts have dubbed it the &quot;Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.&quot;
This fossil is so well preserved that the color of its scaly skin can even be determined to be reddish brown. This shows that it has had some &quot;troublesome experiences.&quot;
A report in the journal Current Biology describes it as &quot;the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever discovered and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.&quot;
The fossil is a newly discovered nodosaur species that lived during the mid-Cretaceous period 110 million to 112 million years ago.
Its extremely well-preserved state stunned researchers, who described it as &quot;truly breathtaking.&quot;
According to National Geographic Magazine, this herbivorous armored dinosaur fossil is the best-preserved dinosaur fossil of its kind ever discovered.
Shawn Funk discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while mining at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
At that time, he came across something that seemed different from the surrounding rocks, so he decided to take a closer look.
Afterwards, the fossils he found were sent to Canada&#39;s Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
It took researchers six years to reveal the beast hidden inside the 2,500-pound (1,100-kilogram) clod of earth.
After all this hard work, the final results can now be announced.
&quot;If you looked at it, you would almost believe it was sleeping,&quot; said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum. The creature is on display in the exhibition hall
&quot;It will become one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.&quot;
By studying its skin, researchers found that the herbivorous creature, although armored like a walking tank, would have been under significant threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators and employed a concealment technique known as &quot;countershading&quot; that is also used by many modern animals.
In this way, it was better able to blend in with its surroundings and avoid enemies, suggesting it was preyed upon by larger dinosaurs, experts say.
The 110-million-year-old creature, a member of the nodosaur family, first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
After museum technician Mark Mitchell, who was part of the team, spent 7,000 hours painstakingly unveiling the beast, researchers are now studying it and naming it Borealopelta markmitchelli &quot;.
The specimens were so well preserved that Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to record the pattern and shape of the scales and armor on the body.
They discovered &quot;countershading,&quot; a common form of defense in the animal kingdom, which means the creature&#39;s back is darker than its sides.
Although countershading is common, the findings were surprising because the dinosaur was much larger than existing animals that used countershading.
This dinosaur faced the pressure of being hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs and evolved in a favorable direction, allowing it to hide from the confrontation as a means of survival.
But most living animals that use countershading, such as deer, zebras or armadillos, are prey-like small and fragile, suggesting the creatures face real pressures to survive.
&quot;The rampant predation of large, heavily armored dinosaurs shows just how dangerous the Cretaceous carnivorous dinosaurs were,&quot; Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also showed the dinosaur&#39;s skin was reddish-brown in color.
Scientists are continuing to study clues to the creature&#39;s life, including the stomach contents it retained to find out what was last eaten.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river when it died, was then washed into the sea, and finally sank to the bottom of the sea on its back.
At the time, Alberta&#39;s climate was as warm as southern Florida&#39;s today, and rivers and oceans were probably farther inland than they are today.
&quot;This nodosaur is truly amazing because it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin and is preserved in two dimensions, preserving its original shape,&quot; Brown said.
&quot;So the shape of this creature now is almost the same as it was in the Cretaceous.
You don&#39;t have to use much imagination to recreate it; if you glance at it, you&#39;ll almost believe it&#39;s sleeping. &quot;
The Cretaceous period was a time when large, bipedal theropod dinosaurs roamed the Earth.
Although Tyrannosaurus rex is the king of dinosaurs, it did not appear until millions of years after the armored dinosaurs. The armored dinosaur may have been hunted by some of T. rex&#39;s ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a behemoth that weighed 6 tons and was 38 feet (11.5 meters) long.
Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that the nodosaur was washed out to sea after it died and then mummified in the mud.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink excavated the creature at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, with skin and armor intact from the nose to the buttocks.
The creatures average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch-long spikes protruding from the shoulders.
Researchers believe the herbivorous, armored dinosaur roamed what is now western Canada before being swept out to sea by flooded rivers.
However, this dinosaur was buried at the bottom of the sea and its armor was completely preserved.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates on the dinosaur&#39;s skull.
As Michael Greshko writes in National Geographic, this level of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it the more incredible it becomes.
Remaining fossilized skin still covers the mottled armor on the dinosaur&#39;s skull.
Its right forefoot is on its side, with its five toes splayed upward.
I can count its armor pieces. &quot;
The reporter learned that adding natural or plant-derived alginic acid, humic acid and amino acid synergistic carriers to the urea production process can modify and synergize traditional urea, forming alginic acid urea, zinc humic acid urea, The urea nitrogen utilization rate of cereal grains is 5 to 10 percentage points higher than that of ordinary urea.
It is environmentally friendly and has obvious potential to increase crop yields. In particular, large particle value-added urea is a high-quality raw material for BB fertilizer.
This total number of security personnel is double that of the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest security linkage plan in history.
Previously, the Brazilian government stated that a total of 85,000 people from the army and police would work together, including 20,000 soldiers and 65,000 police.
Most of the soldiers will be responsible for guarding Olympic venues, while the additional 3,000 soldiers will be responsible for security at international airports, subway stations and streets.
Police patrolled other parts of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is reported that 6,000 soldiers have arrived in Rio to provide security services for the Olympics.
In addition to being responsible for the four competition areas of the Rio Olympics, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport and the main roads connecting the airport to the Olympic venues.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service industry is nothing new. If we want the evaluation mechanism to be effective, it is important to make supervision more effective and not just a formality.
How can activists learn to answer the question: “Whose streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was filled with confusion.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis native was sitting on his bed in his Airbnb rental, browsing Facebook on his phone.
She stumbled across a post from a high school student.
It read, &quot;Police just killed an 18-year-old kid who was still lying in the street.&quot;
She was confused to see that no one else on the feed had posted the message. She closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
One user, @TheePharoah, kept tweeting her the Times.
St. Louis-area rapper live-tweeted Michael Brown&#39;s death. Michael Brown was an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted an image of Brown&#39;s lifeless body lying in the street for four hours.
&quot;Crazy,&quot; Ferrell thought to himself.
But death is nothing new to her and her community.
She put down her phone and didn’t open Twitter again until that evening, when she read the tweet about the crowd on Canfield Avenue.
There is police video and photos of people yelling, as well as a photo of a man claiming to be Brown&#39;s father with the words: &quot;Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!&quot;
She saw a live feed of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another officer raises his rifle and screams: &quot;I&#39;m going to kill you all... the beasts.&quot;
&quot;This is not normal,&quot; Ferrell recalled saying.
&quot;This is not what we are accustomed to calling a typical murder.&quot;
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was so angry that I cried. &quot;
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father&#39;s house and decided that the two would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, &quot;Whose Streets?,&quot; opening in theaters Aug. 11.
This is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, told from the perspective of the people who live in this community and fill the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter (dressed in a floral dress and tiara), the two revisited a topic they had discussed countless times before that morning - &quot;about the black experience and the black condition.&quot;
&quot;Do you remember what I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?&quot; she recalled.
&quot;We&#39;re going to Ferguson now because police killed an 18-year-old boy and that&#39;s not right.
I had to take her,&quot; Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is the... culmination of everything that has gone before.
She was to know, see and rise from this.
She needs to be well developed not only in activism and organizing, but also in understanding the different layers of the black experience and the black condition, and understanding what we must do to be free and liberated.
Even if I&#39;m lucky enough to provide her with experiences with racism that she hasn&#39;t personally experienced, she&#39;s no different than any other black girl.
I feel like I&#39;m doing her a disservice if I protect her in this matter. &quot;
Their first stop in Ferguson was at a field across from the police station on South Florissant Road. The site became a camp for activists as they awaited the outcome of Officer Darren Wilson&#39;s eventual dismissal of charges.
Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made bagged lunches.
They prepared bags and were responsible for passing them to protesters.
Slowly, Ferrell began to develop a new kind of activism.
“My activism completely changed after August 9,” she says. As an undergraduate at Missouri State University in St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Nursing Students Association and focused on food justice and health disparities in the Black community.
“I had no organizational experience.
This is how it all came about. &quot;
A few weeks later, Ferrell met the film&#39;s co-director Sabah Folayan at a night parade.
Folayan said she and her director of photography, Lucas Alvarado Farrar, &quot;just wanted to document&quot; what happened.
A question came to Ferrell&#39;s mind: &quot;Are you trying to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?&quot;
This suspicion stems from the many cases in which people - often white - enter a community to profit from its pain and resilience.
As Foleyan explained in a recent interview, &quot;We heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson were not centering their voices, and we wanted to do that differently.&quot;
Folayang has been linked with co-director Damon Davis. Damon Davis is a regional artist known for his activism on death row.
His involvement led Ferrell, along with six other locals, to join the Whose Streets? project team and stick with him in the years after Brown was shot.
&quot;This documentary is not about someone speaking for us or talking to us, it&#39;s about us speaking,&quot; Davis said.
“My main focus is on how these characters are represented, because that’s how I’m represented.”
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrell&#39;s experience – but rather to show that the movement was &quot;less about messianic leaders and more about community cohesion,&quot; Folayan says – she proved to be the most open of the film&#39;s participants.
As a result, &quot;Whose Streets?&quot; surprisingly chronicles Ferrell&#39;s personal life, falling in love and getting married.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell laughed when he first saw the finished product.
“But I understand that there has to be a level of vulnerability that goes into doing this work and humanizing Black people.”
Additionally, Ferrell’s story reaffirms and repositions the role of black queer women within the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement&#39;s three founders -- who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 shooting of black teen Trayvon Martin -- identify as queer.
“Black queer women in leadership generally sustain this movement,” Ferrell said, “and that’s because we’re constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black queer women have to endure it all. &quot;
Folayan agreed, noting that &quot;this movement is really supported by black women and a lot of black queer women.&quot;
Ferrell was chosen to be the centerpiece of the film because of who she is. However, she insisted &quot;this is not affirmative action&quot;.
“She’s the one who inspires that energy,” she said.
&quot;Even though she&#39;s on the front lines, that&#39;s not a coincidence. Because you have so much going on as a black queer woman in these intersections of life.
You can feel her energy through the screen. &quot;
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone, but tense racial relations between the community and police remain.
Ferrer was sentenced to more than two and a half years of probation for trying to block a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the sociopolitical climate in the area she calls home: &quot;It&#39;s a mess.&quot;
Still, she has stuck to the chants she strives to remember since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“We have a responsibility to fight for our freedom.
It is our responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our shackles. &quot;
In fact, online translation services have been provided on the Internet ten years ago. In fact, the argument that &quot;machines will soon replace humans for translation&quot; has been heard a long time ago.
Similarity: Artist uses Chelsea Manning&#39;s DNA to create portrait
In the center of the exhibition at New York&#39;s Friedman Museum are multiple faces: white, black and brown, each with an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another, suspended by strings from the ceiling. Tie.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg using cheek swabs and hair scraps sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning mailed hair scraps from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years for leaking confidential diplomatic cables via the WikiLeaks website.
The exhibition opens on August 2 and is titled &quot;Similarities.&quot;
It was the culmination of two years of correspondence between Dewey Hagberg, who combined his discipline with his own in technology, computer science, and the arts, and Manning, a noted dissident who had served in Prison and completed gender reassignment surgery in prison. Former US President Obama pardoned the remainder of her sentence three days before the end of his term.
Algorithmic analysis was performed from Manning&#39;s DNA and 30 portraits of &quot;likely appearances&quot; were created. Heather Dewey Harbaugh made a biting and slightly heartless comment. His comments were as much about the multiplicity of DNA as about the concept of identity itself.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, has openly admitted that she identified as a woman in adolescence. He was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image is suppressed except for one photo, a grainy black-and-white selfie looking visibly disturbed, sitting in the driver&#39;s seat and wearing a platinum blond wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Harborg achieved great success with her 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In that work, she used DNA extracted from scraps of forensic evidence, such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, to create 3D portraits of people who may have similar looks.
That&#39;s when she happened to receive an email from Paper magazine.
“They wanted to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and they wanted a portrait,” Heather Dewey Harbaugh told media at the exhibition’s opening.
Chelsea Manning couldn&#39;t visit or take photos at the time, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in having a DNA portrait made.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, &quot;Depressed Avatar,&quot; drawn by Shoili Kanungo. The comic book envisions the president granting special privileges to Manning in the future, allowing her to see exhibits in prison.
And Obama demanded her release just days after the book was published. It may have been a coincidence that Manning was in his seventh year at a Kansas military prison.
In addition, this exhibition also has another profound meaning. Because in contemporary America, the Trump administration continues to declare war on government leakers and transgender service members, while finding new, Twitter-worthy ways to openly stoke divisions that this exhibition seeks to bridge.
When asked about the special timing of it all, Heather Dewey Harbaugh said, &quot;Everything happens for a reason.&quot;
An artist&#39;s statement written on the gallery wall, with Manning&#39;s oversized signature underneath (the &quot;i&quot; in her name drawn out with a heart), calls for an end to &quot;partisanship based on gender, sexuality and culture.&quot; Conflict over the image.”
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, with Cs, Gs and As symbols scrawled in pencil.
By encompassing 200 letters (or nucleotides, each artist&#39;s complex scientific lexicon), Heather Dewey Harborg hopes that by painting these eerily similar portraits, she hopes to convey that, at least physiologically, everyone is the same of.
&quot;I want people to get over this, that our genome doesn&#39;t care who we are, how publicly available genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is,&quot; says Heather Dewey Harbaugh of his 2007 video The work &quot;False Memories&quot; is also on display.
&quot;DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so here are 30 of them.&quot;
The final work in the exhibition, In a Room , is a page from the previously illustrated novella.
It shows a flamboyant, King Kong-like Manning with a bullhorn in hand by an American soldier.
“When they bring your speech to a halt, they win,” reads the wall.
&quot;So don&#39;t shut up.&quot;
“It comes directly from a letter she wrote to me,” said the Philadelphia-based artist.
&quot;No matter how scared I am, I will still say it.&quot;
Manning has yet to see the exhibit in person, as is so foreseen in the comics, but when she does, she&#39;ll be masked by her own DNA portrait and be cheered on by a group of protesters in the center of the exhibit.
It&#39;s purposeful, too, as all the objects in the exhibit are built to the height (5.2 feet, Manning&#39;s height) of her genetic haplogroup information written in pencil.
&quot;In the past, I&#39;ve hung them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a group of people,&quot; Dewey Hagberg said of the portraits.
&quot;But I wanted them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting for her release.&quot;
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted in connection with homicide
A nationwide search is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted after a man was found fatally stabbed in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
Windham Latham, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were charged Monday with first-degree murder in connection with the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranlo, Cook County court records show. Bail on a murder warrant.
Cornell Duranlo, 26, died from multiple stab wounds, according to documents.
The body was discovered on July 27, according to a community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department.
Officers arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments after receiving the call and found the victim suffering from multiple lacerations.
Cornell Duranlo died at the scene, police said, and detectives are investigating the incident as a homicide while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Corbage, associate dean for campus relations, said in an emailed statement that Latham has now been terminated and has been banned from the Northwestern campus.
&quot;This is now a criminal matter and is being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation,&quot; Corbage said.
Warren is a senior financial associate at the University of Oxford.
A spokesperson for Somerville College, Oxford University, said in an emailed statement: &quot;We are in constant contact with UK police and stand ready to assist US investigative agencies as needed.&quot;
The statement added that Warren&#39;s colleagues were shocked and hoped he would surrender.
Chicago Police Department Chief Liaison Officer Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages suspects to surrender to authorities.
&quot;Police have a general idea of their whereabouts and we are working to locate possible locations,&quot; Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were assisting in the search for the suspect.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza Apartments, who had just received a confidential tip that something was going on in apartment 1008.
Police said the situation was horrific.
Guglielmi said it was still unclear whether the incident also occurred on July 27.
He said security cameras confirmed Latham and Warren were in the building at the time.
&quot;We believe Professor Latham had a relationship with the victim,&quot; Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza&#39;s management team released a statement to residents saying: &quot;Police are currently researching the victim&#39;s timeline and circumstances of the incident and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident.&quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said, &quot;We will complete the World Anti-Doping Agency road map in the near future.&quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take too long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the restoration of the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“Implementation of the Roadmap Standards has progressed to a certain stage and RUSADA has been given the right to work with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping) on planning and testing.
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard,” Mutko said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko made the statement while commenting on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency’s roadmap, Compliance. This section sets out the criteria for restoring RUSADA&#39;s rights and was recently published on the organization&#39;s website.
According to Mutko, the standards do not contain anything that might cause concern in Russia.
He added, “Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future. &quot;
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency must publicly accept the findings of a WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into Russian state-sponsored doping in the country&#39;s sport. .
Speaking about the matter, Mutko said: &quot;We are investigating and there is no doubt that our anti-doping system failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind this and we will not admit to something that does not exist. &quot;
Mutko&#39;s words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of Russia&#39;s Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged past problems with Russia&#39;s anti-doping agency, but added: &quot;We have said many times and on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally,&quot; Smirnov said.
After the doping scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended RUSADA&#39;s right to conduct doping tests in Russia.
But in June, RUSADA was given permission to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
During a visit to the organization&#39;s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivia Negli said RUSADA was &quot;moving in the right direction&quot; in its efforts to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it is checkers or chess, beating humans was no longer a problem a few decades ago.
Croatian Football Association Chairman Davor Suker said in an interview that participating in the China Cup is very meaningful for Croatian football. The prize money of the China Cup is very large.
No more looking for purchasing agents! These more than 8,000 products have zero tariffs
At a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Gao Feng said that as of now, my country has 15 free trade agreements that have come into effect, involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 products. Imported products with zero tariff.
At the same time, imported cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean red wine, ASEAN tropical fruits...you no longer need to spend a lot of money to purchase these products.
At present, my country has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, 15 of which have come into effect, covering more than 8,000 types of zero-tariff imported products.
Taking agricultural products as an example, with the implementation of the free trade agreement, consumers can taste high-quality and low-price agricultural products from different origins all year round.
For example, import tariffs on ASEAN’s durian, lychee, dragon fruit and other tropical fruits have been reduced from 15% to 30% to zero tariffs.
Import tariffs on Icelandic salmon are reduced from 10% to 12% to zero tariffs;
Import tariffs on red wine from Georgia and Chile have been reduced from 14% to 30% to zero tariffs;
There are also significant tax reductions on specialty agricultural products such as New Zealand beef and milk powder.
Taking industrial products as an example, for example, import tariffs on some cosmetics in Switzerland have been reduced to zero;
Import tariffs on some watches have been reduced by 50% and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years;
Import tariffs on Korean refrigerators, rice cookers, massagers, beauty devices and other products have been reduced by 40%, and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years;
There are also significant tax reductions for consumer electronics products.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the free trade zone also include many intermediate products and raw materials required for the manufacturing of domestic end-use consumer goods, which has also promoted the structural upgrade of domestic consumer goods to a certain extent.
Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Gao Feng said that nearly one-third of my country&#39;s total imported products can enjoy preferential tariff treatment under the free trade agreement, and most of them are end-consumer goods, which have brought tangible benefits to consumers.
Further reduce import tariffs on consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, my country has adjusted import tariffs on some consumer goods and further reduced import tariffs on consumer goods, covering food, health care products, medicines, daily chemicals, clothing, shoes and hats, household equipment, culture and entertainment, and daily miscellaneous department stores. and other types of consumer goods, involving a total of 187 8-digit tax numbers.
The average tax rate for this batch of consumer goods will drop from 17.3% to 7.7%, almost cutting it in half!
Starting from January 1, 2018, my country has also made partial adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
Import tariffs on some cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shadow, and perfume will be reduced from 10% to 5%;
After lowering tariffs, it means that consumers no longer need to purchase products on behalf of others, nor do they need to travel all the way abroad to buy their favorite foreign products.
2018 Yiwu Imported Goods Shopping Festival: Imported red wine, snacks, fruits...all are cheaper!
Foreign reports: U.S. shopping malls have huge differences in regulations at the end of the year, so you need to be cautious when shopping and returning goods.
China News Service, December 29
According to the US &quot;World Journal&quot; report, just after Christmas, there was a wave of returns.
According to the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), more than half of the goods sold last Christmas were returned or exchanged.
In addition, some readers have repeatedly reported that online shopping has been defrauded, and consumers need to be more careful when shopping on informal websites.
Generally speaking, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but if you buy gifts from some small stores or shop online, you must be careful.
Ms. Hou from Roland Gang spent more than 60 yuan (US dollars, the same below) on a coat at an online store specializing in printed coats on December 1, local time, but it has not been delivered yet.
She sent an email to customer service, but received no reply.
Another netizen revealed that he traveled to the United States last year and purchased a mobile phone from a third-party seller. When it was mailed, he found that it contained a box of plasticine.
After knowing that I had been scammed, I applied for a refund from the website and luckily received a full refund.
However, some customers believe that the website&#39;s refund service is not 100% perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident of Northern California, said that he had twice purchased the expedited delivery service from a certain website, and each expedited service cost four yuan, but both times it was not delivered on time.
I applied for a refund later and got no reply.
Large shopping malls or shopping malls have better return policies.
Macy&#39;s offers full refunds on most items within 180 days.
However, the goods must remain in &quot;original&quot; condition and must have proof of purchase such as receipts or bank purchase records.
Without a voucher, customers can also earn mall points that can be used to purchase other items.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for general merchandise, and 15 days for electronic items.
However, the return period for electronic and entertainment products purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017 has been extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day refund period starts from December 25, which means returns must be made before January 25, 2018.
The ultimate shopping experience, a new era of shopping development in business districts is coming
More than ten years ago, our country was generally still in a seller&#39;s market, with people&#39;s choices limited and demand limited.
But after ten years of development, the market has already transformed from a seller&#39;s market to a buyer&#39;s market. Today&#39;s consumers have become more sophisticated, and they are no longer satisfied with the simple shopping behavior of &quot;paying one hand and delivering the goods.&quot; .
Therefore, how to provide consumers with an ultimate shopping experience has become the next point of competition for real estate developers.
Among the many factors that affect consumers’ shopping experience, shopping malls in business districts have the most significant impact.
See how city builders everywhere focus on shopping experience.
No two leaves in the world are exactly the same, and no two shopping malls are exactly the same. A famous shopping mall must have its own characteristics.
For example, the world-famous Kanyon Shopping Center in Turkey has its unique wave-shaped architectural design inspired by the Grand Canyon, hence the homophonic name Kanyon. Walking on the 200-meter long trail in the middle of Kanyon feels like you are in the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon-like design, there is also a large, inward-shaped oval performance venue in the center of the shopping mall. It has a unique shape and often hosts special performances.
Because of the open platform design, visitors walking on each floor can overlook the activities in the &quot;canyon&quot; and have the effect of changing scenery as they move.
In China, Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, known as China&#39;s first forest-style strolling shopping mall, perfectly combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
A 7,000-square-meter green square and a 3,000-square-meter rooftop water platform. The project consists of 9 single buildings. Each building is connected by air corridors. The overall sunken courtyard design uses the French plane trees above the ground as the building skin, and the roof water terrace. , creating a forest-like feeling.
Walking into Forest Moore is like accidentally falling into the rabbit hole in Alice&#39;s Adventures. The climbing tree trunks surround the building, and the grass and clear springs complement each other, bringing people into a forest full of vitality and vitality.
Also in Chongqing, the Lijia waterfront business district built by Longfor plans to introduce hundreds of commercial areas. It plans to introduce more than 50 top international flagship stores, more than 100 top international brands and more than 500 famous domestic and foreign brands in the future, creating a service industry. A business center with clusters and distinctive themes.
Not only that, Lijia Waterfront Business District also integrates ecology into the architecture, is oriented by TOD public transportation, and integrates fashion shopping, life services, catering, entertainment, education, and sports. It not only brings consumers the ultimate shopping experience, but also leads the way. They enjoy Chongqing&#39;s unique &quot;waterfront culture&quot; that perfectly integrates shopping with water entertainment and leisure.
In summary, it can be found that at present, some real estate companies have gained insight into the discovery trajectory of this new urban business, and industry insiders say that this consumption model that centers on consumer experience and how to combine shopping and experience will also It is the mainstream of future urban development.
Today&#39;s business districts are not only distribution centers for goods, but also comprehensive places that integrate art, culture, and creative themes. They also bear people&#39;s responsibility for urban living.
Therefore, while satisfying consumers&#39; one-stop material needs for food, drink, entertainment and Tesco, maximizing the multi-level spiritual needs of culture and art, and giving full play to livable living needs, it must be the commanding heights of the future development of the business district.
In Chongqing, Guoxing&#39;s North Bank Jiangshan is located in the north of the Yangtze River, close to Guanyin Bridge. It gathers the essence of world business, is surrounded by international giants, and first-class brands gather to closely connect with international fashion.
This place is prosperous and gathers the essence of the world;
Dongyuan Jinyue has a better shopping environment. Dongyuan Jinyue is close to the Nanping business district and enjoys exclusive access to the leading four-layer three-dimensional transportation system in the west and even the country, which improves shopping comfort.
In addition, the landscaping and landscape paving of the two pedestrian streets of Huigong Road and Wanda Plaza have been upgraded. About 300 trees have been planted and 40,000 square meters of paving have been renovated, which has improved the image of Nanping business district;
Longhu Yuhu No. 1 is close to Chongqing&#39;s first low-density waterfront business district - Lijia Waterfront Business District. It is surrounded by nine parks. The commercial district has low density and high openness, making people more willing to stay, stop, and shop when shopping. Enjoy the fun of shopping slowly, instead of being hurried forward by the flow of people behind you, truly realizing &quot;walking shopping&quot;.
Today&#39;s business competition will only become more and more intense. How to carve out a path in a highly homogenized market and win the reputation of a &quot;shopping mecca&quot; in the minds of future consumers is worthy of serious consideration by all real estate developers.
Differentiation strategies alone are far from enough. Only those developers who truly put consumers in their hearts, care about what consumers want, think about what consumers want, and provide consumers with the ultimate and simple shopping experience Only business people can be proud of themselves in the stormy market.
Of course, in the end, I think the happiest people are the people of Chongqing. With such a good shopping experience and business district, no one could have imagined today&#39;s prosperity 10 years ago.
Festival of Things: Carnival of consumerism masks real environmental prices
168.2 billion yuan, which is the transaction volume of Tmall users within 24 hours of the &quot;Tmall Double Eleven Global Carnival&quot; on November 11, 2017.
Specifically, after the start of &quot;Double 11&quot;, Tmall&#39;s transaction volume exceeded 10 billion yuan in just 3 minutes, exceeded 20 billion yuan in 6 minutes and 5 seconds, and exceeded 100 billion yuan in 9 hours.
On this day, the total number of payments completed by global consumers through Alipay reached 1.48 billion, an increase of 41% over last year.
These consumption will bring 812 million logistics orders.
Whether it is the Tmall online shopping platform or the Alipay payment platform, they all belong to Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that the &quot;Singles&#39; Day&quot; subculture created by single young people out of self-mockery on November 11 would be co-opted by e-commerce and become the phenomenal &quot;Double 11&quot; shopping carnival today.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used the &quot;Singles&#39; Day Promotion&quot; marketing gimmick for the first time: No one is dating you, so singles, come and shop online.
The result was surprising. On this day, the transaction volume of Taobao Mall (the predecessor of &quot;Tmall&quot;) exceeded 52 million yuan, which was 10 times the daily transaction volume at that time.
Since then, &quot;Double 11&quot; has become a shopping carnival created by Alibaba. From the beginning, domestic buyers and sellers entertained themselves, to the influx of global merchants. Nine years later, Tmall&#39;s &quot;Double 11&quot; has thousands of The transaction volume of 100 million has been more than 3,200 times that of that year, making it beyond the reach of &quot;Black Friday&quot;.
There are also many e-commerce companies following Tmall’s “Double Eleven” promotions, among which “JD.com” is the most powerful.
&quot;JD.com&quot; has its own shopping festival &quot;6.18&quot;, but it is not as influential as &quot;Double 11&quot;. This year it lasted from November 1st to 11th, and &quot;JD.com&#39;s&quot; cumulative sales reached 127.1 billion yuan.
After &quot;Double 11&quot;, there will be a similar &quot;Double 12&quot; discount carnival, Christmas and New Year shopping period.
After the New Year, Chinese consumers are still waiting for the New Year’s shopping period before the Spring Festival and the Valentine’s Day shopping period. There will be no holiday for consumption.
The environmental problems caused by instantaneous mass consumption have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to the Xinhua Daily Telegraph, based on a conservative estimate of the industry’s usual standard of 0.2 kilograms per box, at least more than 300,000 tons of garbage will be generated during this year’s Double 11 shopping spree.
Liu Hua, director of pollution prevention and control projects at Greenpeace East Asia, told chinadialogue that orders from Tmall alone during this year’s Double 11 will generate 160,000 tons of packaging waste.
The State Post Bureau issued a report in 2016, stating that during the &quot;Double 11&quot; period in 2015 (November 11 to 16), the volume of express mail was about 780 million pieces, using more than 3 billion woven bags, 9.922 billion packaging boxes, 16.985 100 million meters of tape, the length of the tape can circle the earth&#39;s equator 425 times.
This year, the State Post Bureau predicts that the express business volume of &quot;Double 11&quot; is expected to exceed 1.5 billion pieces.
Wang Shi, manager of a waste incineration center in Beijing, told Xinhua News Agency that after the &quot;Double 11&quot; event, the amount of waste entering the site every day exceeded 2,000 tons, which also exceeded the processing capacity of the incineration station.
Express delivery companies have realized that the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry cannot be underestimated.
Some e-commerce logistics companies, including Suning, launched recyclable and reusable plastic express boxes, recyclable packaging bags that can be reused as shopping bags and garbage bags before &quot;Double 11&quot;, but the acceptance by consumers who found it troublesome was not yet not tall.
Jack Ma also called on the logistics industry to support &quot;green packaging&quot; and &quot;green logistics&quot; on Weibo.
This Weibo received more than 68,000 &quot;likes&quot;.
What kind of mobile payment do Germans want?
Zhang Dongfang: The mobile payment war in Germany is not promising.
WeChat Pay and Alipay have just moved the battlefield to Europe. The competitors have not changed, and the competition for positions has not changed. Chinese people, can this be considered globalization?
Where there is Alipay, there must be WeChat Pay.
In accordance with the agreement with the German electronic payment service provider Wirecard, WeChat Pay officially launched in Germany in November this year, and gradually deployed at merchants across Europe.
This foreign reunion of the two &quot;comrades&quot; took place in Europe.
Alipay and WeChat Pay have been singing along the road to globalization.
As for the globalization of China&#39;s mobile payment, iResearch&#39;s &quot;China Third-Party Mobile Payment Industry Research Report 2017&quot; summarizes it into two types: one is through strategic investment, experience export, equity participation and support for foreign local mobile payment companies.
The second is to promote mobile payment services to foreign merchants through the consumption behavior of Chinese tourists abroad, thereby changing foreign locals’ awareness and acceptance of Chinese mobile payments.
Indeed, if you win the Chinese people, you will win the world.
China&#39;s economy is developing rapidly, coupled with its large population base, the spending of Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure.
But this is also doomed. The Chinese mobile payment war that started in Germany this time is not expected.
WeChat Pay and Alipay have just moved the battlefield to Europe. The competitors have not changed, and the battleground remains the same - they are still Chinese. Is this considered globalization?
A more pioneering discussion is, can China&#39;s mobile payment expand its territory in Europe?
Take Germany for example.
The enchanted “new retail”
Chen Xinlei and Yang Kaihan: Amazon announced its entry into bookstores and grocery stores when it was squeezing into the world&#39;s top ten retailers. Both the timing and motivation are worth pondering.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two more in Portland and San Diego.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened a store in New York and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced the trial operation of its unmanned supermarket (Amazon Go). Customers do not need to queue or check out when entering the store. They can just scan the code when entering, take the desired products and leave, and the shopping amount will be automatically deducted from the customer&#39;s account. Debited from Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, it is very unexpected that it has suddenly made frequent moves in physical stores in recent years.
Because as early as 2007, in the &quot;Open Letter to Shareholders&quot;, CEO Jeff Bezos emphasized that Amazon will not easily open physical stores unless the following four conditions are met at the same time:
1. We must be convinced that this new opportunity can provide shareholders with a return on their investment;
2. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great significance to the entire company;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
4. We must make sure that we have enough resources to make customer-oriented differentiation in this market.
Bookstores and grocery stores are the two most shaky categories in physical retail, and they were also the first competitors to fall after the rise of Amazon.
Amazon announced its entry into these two physical markets when it squeezed into the top ten retailers in the world. Both the timing and motivation are worth pondering.
Are Amazon’s actions contrary to the assurances in the shareholder letter?
Similar sounds were heard on the other side of the world. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Computing Conference, Jack Ma, Chairman of Alibaba’s Board of Directors, delivered a keynote speech.
He said: &quot;Starting next year, Alibaba will no longer mention the term &#39;e-commerce&#39;.
The era of pure e-commerce will soon end. In the next ten or twenty years, there will be no e-commerce and will be replaced by &#39;new retail&#39;.
Only when online, offline and logistics are combined can new retail be created. &quot;
For a time, the word &quot;new retail&quot; seemed to be cast by magic and was frequently mentioned by people in the industry.
But what exactly does “new retail” mean?
If it just refers to the combination of online and offline, then this concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked the 180 largest e-commerce companies and estimated that total e-commerce sales were approximately US$200 billion, with the largest 25 accounting for more than US$159 billion.
Among these 25, 18 are traditional retailers that have only started operating online in the past five years (such as Macy&#39;s, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
Alibaba Group’s 28.3 billion yuan investment in Suning Cloud Commerce is still fresh in our minds.
Globally, retailers and e-commerce are shifting from a single channel to an omni-channel retail system covering physical stores, e-commerce, mobile terminals and social media.
Could it be that Jack Ma’s mention of “new retail” is more of a summary than a prospect for the future?
If not, what is the difference between the concept of omni-channel and “new retail”?
Perhaps the key to the problem is not whether online and offline will be integrated, but how.
Looking back on the past 20 years in the retail industry, the rise of e-commerce is like the rise of discount retailers in the early years, both focusing on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, e-commerce companies have moved highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, from offline to online.
With the development of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, e-commerce has extended its reach to other categories and begun to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, “Using Internet ideas and technology to comprehensively reform and upgrade the existing total of about 30 trillion social retailers, so that the increasingly upgraded consumption needs of Chinese consumers can be effectively met, making The entire process of commodity production, circulation, and services has become more efficient due to the widespread use of the Internet and big data.&quot;
Therefore, the path of e-commerce is one that is asset-light on the surface but asset-heavy in reality.
&quot;Light&quot; refers to the fact that the burdens of fixed assets, staffing, management processes, etc. are not as large as those of traditional retail; &quot;heavy&quot; refers to the huge investment required in logistics, warehousing, etc.
Changes in logistics methods have ensured the high efficiency of e-commerce.
According to the Chinese government website, Premier Li Keqiang chaired an executive meeting of the State Council on April 28. The meeting held that expanding domestic consumer demand is an important measure to stabilize growth and adjust structure.
The meeting determined that relevant departments should promptly come up with specific plans based on scientific assessment.
For some foreign daily consumer goods with high demand from domestic consumers, pilot projects to reduce import tariffs will be launched before the end of June this year, and the scope of tax-reduced products will be gradually expanded;
In conjunction with the tax system reform, we will improve the consumption tax policy on clothing, cosmetics and other mass consumer goods, and coordinate the adjustment of tax scope, tax rates and collection links;

BlackBerry mobile phones have never been successful with hardware. However, in the face of being squeezed out by peers, they have to have a decent model, so this is the Passport released in September last year.
SONY often launches various black technology products. For example, this flagship 4K reflective ultra-short focus camera released at the beginning of the year is one of them.
Of course, such high-end and high-end products are naturally priced at a high price. 5 million yen is equivalent to about 250,000 yuan, which is enough to buy a car.
Large-size luxury TVs have always represented the technical strength of major manufacturers. The 77-inch curved 4K OLED TV brought by LG, which won the award this time, is a typical example of this type of product.
This is not just a simple fixed-angle curved TV, but a complex device that allows users to adjust the curvature according to their location!
Relying on the 9mm ultra-thin display panel, LG has made the deformation of the entire tablet difficult to detect with the naked eye, thereby achieving the maximum variable curvature of 4000R.
Users only need to comfortably press the remote control to adjust the optimal viewing angle of the 77-inch screen to suit any viewing scene.
Needless to say, Leica’s position in the camera field is undeniable. This Leica T mirrorless camera was released last year and uses a new T mount as the lens mount for Leica mirrorless cameras.
In addition to the two T-mount 23mm fixed focus and 18-56mm zoom lenses released at the same time, Leica M series lenses can also be used through the M-Adapter T adapter ring.
Triumph has accurately grasped the crux of this problem and developed the new Magic Wire underwear.
Due to the use of silicone resin material with good support as the underwear ring support, the wearer not only enjoys the comfort of non-wired underwear, but also obtains all-round support like underwired underwear.
Supplemented by the built-in mesh stabilization net that provides more support, the bra can achieve a perfect fit and create a plump breast line.

MB&amp;F, an independent watchmaking concept laboratory, has gathered a large group of watch experts and people in the art circle, with the mission of designing and creating various mechanical timepieces that break through traditional concepts.
On January 18, Alibaba held an e-commerce poverty alleviation summit dialogue in Chongqing, announcing that it would promote targeted poverty alleviation and rural revitalization by exploring a new model of &quot;Internet + Poverty Alleviation&quot;.
This is Alibaba’s next step in poverty alleviation after proposing a rural strategy, launching a rural Taobao project, launching a rural poverty alleviation platform, and establishing the Alibaba Poverty Alleviation Fund.
Poverty alleviation is one of China&#39;s most important national strategies at the moment.
Comprehensive poverty alleviation has never been achieved in China in the past thousands of years.
“E-commerce poverty alleviation is an innovative measure for a new round of poverty alleviation and development, and an important starting point for achieving targeted poverty alleviation and targeted poverty alleviation.
The central government attaches great importance to and pointed out that the role of the Internet can be used in promoting poverty alleviation, promoting targeted poverty alleviation and targeted poverty alleviation, and allowing agricultural products to go out of the countryside through the Internet. &quot;
Therefore, Alibaba proposed a rural strategy as early as 2014, which together with big data, cloud computing and globalization are its three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Alibaba launched the Rural Taobao (Village Taobao) project, recruiting &quot;village waiters&quot; in rural areas to lead farmers out of poverty and become rich through e-commerce.
In 2017, Alibaba cooperated with the commerce department to create a channel for rural development and poverty alleviation, which has now been connected to 13 provinces and 120 national-level poverty-stricken counties across the country.
There are already 2,118 Taobao villages spawned by the Alibaba platform.
Among them, nearly 400 appeared in provincial poverty-stricken counties, and 33 appeared in 13 national poverty-stricken counties.
In 2017, on Alibaba’s China retail platform, sales in Taobao villages across the country reached 120 billion yuan.
Zhang Yong said that in the face of the national strategy of poverty alleviation, Alibaba has been thinking about how to make good use of the Alibaba economy&#39;s innovation capabilities such as technology, big data, and cloud computing to find a new path for poverty alleviation.
Among them, Cuntao is the main platform for Alibaba&#39;s e-commerce poverty alleviation, and has opened up a new Internet link for poverty alleviation through direct supply and direct sales.
In the planting process, Cuntao and Ant Financial jointly provide agricultural supplies and tools and small loan support.
In 2017, Ant Financial served 795 of the 832 national-level poverty-stricken counties, providing them with convenient payment, credit and other services.
Cainiao handles warehousing and logistics, Tmall is responsible for sales, and Alibaba Cloud&#39;s big data feeds back and guides agricultural production, further improving the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of e-commerce to alleviate poverty requires not only products, sales channels, and industrial planning, but also talent.
Alibaba offers e-commerce courses through Taobao University to teach farmers standardized, quality and large-scale planting methods, achieving a combination of &quot;poverty alleviation + mental support&quot; to help farmers sustainably escape poverty.
These courses have covered approximately 92% of national-level poverty-stricken counties.
The poverty alleviation idea of &quot;public welfare mentality and commercial means&quot; can also ensure that Ali can achieve &quot;real poverty alleviation&quot; when it comes to poverty alleviation.
Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba’s board of directors, once said that poverty eradication should be divided into three stages: poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation and getting rich.
Poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish, poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish, and getting rich is to create a &quot;fish pond&quot; for farmers so that they can raise fish.
Industrial poverty alleviation driven by e-commerce is to build fish ponds.
In terms of industrial poverty alleviation, the Luochuan apple industry poverty alleviation model jointly created by Alibaba and Shaanxi Luochuan has been used by relevant departments as a model to be replicated and promoted across the country.
Alibaba’s e-commerce poverty alleviation work has also been recognized by decision-makers.
E-commerce companies represented by Alibaba have been urged to ensure farmers increase production and income through online and offline channels.
Some village waiters and Ant Financial employees were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experience in poverty alleviation through e-commerce.
Currently, the China Office of the United Nations World Food Program has worked with Cuntao to carry out e-commerce industry poverty alleviation in Anhui and other places.
Sina Financial News The &quot;Third New Economic Think Tank Conference&quot; co-organized by Alibaba Research Institute and China Visionary Think Tank Luntan was held on January 16. Zhang Li, Director of the E-Commerce Research Institute of the Ministry of Commerce Research Institute, attended and spoke.
She believes that our globalization has actually ignored the most important issues, which are the issues of the substance and application of globalization, as well as the stages of globalization.
Many people think that globalization has stagnated, and many developed and developing countries have different attitudes towards globalization in the new stage, which means they have different models.
The second concept is the issue of the mid-term stage of globalization. What are the constraints on the mid-term stage of globalization?
Restricted by the economic environment, it is precisely because the economic foundation has changed that globalization has been restricted.
Zhang Li believes that the global economic adjustment will basically end at the end of 2017 and will enter a new round of growth after 2018. The next round of growth must be driven by production products.
7FRESH, JD.com’s first fresh food supermarket, officially opened recently and plans to open more than 1,000 stores across the country in the next three to five years.
In addition to Alibaba&#39;s Hema Fresh, Yonghui&#39;s Super Species, Suning&#39;s Su Xiansheng, Meituan&#39;s Zhangyu Fresh, etc., &quot;new retail stores&quot; began to appear together, and &quot;challenged&quot; each other in terms of innovative models and even prices.
The competition for fresh food supermarkets has escalated and has become a phenomenon-level topic in the new retail field. What is new in new retail?
&quot;In 2018, we will quickly enter the country and open a lot of stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival.&quot;
Hou Yi, CEO of Hema Fresh, revealed the “new strategy” for 2018 at the second New Retail Summit on the 10th.
“Starting from 2018, Hema is not just a fresh food e-commerce company, but a lifestyle e-commerce company that meets consumers’ immediate needs.
The core model is offline to attract traffic and experience, while online is real sales. &quot;
Different from traditional hypermarkets and supermarkets, Hema Xiansheng is a fun and delicious &quot;Internet celebrity store&quot; in the eyes of many consumers. Some intermediaries have even developed the concept of &quot;box area housing&quot;.
Online e-commerce platforms and offline retailers each have their own advantages and disadvantages, but consumers appear in multiple channels, so both parties are trying an omni-channel model.
The industry believes that under the background of consumption upgrading, there will be more and more &quot;Hema-like&quot; stores in 2018.
Hema has continued to explore more consumer fields from its original fresh food business, which indicates that there will be more innovations in the retail market in the new year.
&quot;For example, the business model that combines online and offline services has attracted the attention of consumers, and the fresh food supermarkets opened in various places have become popular and popular.&quot;
&quot;But no matter how much you talk about these relationships, it&#39;s useless no matter how showy they are. In the end, it comes down to whether you bring a wonderful experience to consumers. Only after I experience it will I be willing to pay.&quot;
According to Yuan Bin, co-CEO of RT-Mart Feiniu.com, in the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed and purchasing needs have also changed.
It used to be that purely online and offline were separated. Offline had to defeat online, and online had to counterattack offline. Now they are holding hands together, because consumers no longer distinguish between online and offline.
The rush of capital to enter the market has made the current new retail market, represented by fresh food supermarkets, full of excitement.
Analysts believe that the current competition of new retail in first-tier cities is far from reaching the red ocean pattern, and there are still a large number of second-tier cities that have yet to be explored, and the market still has great opportunities and space.
The layout of new retail in different types of industries will bring the development of new retail into a diversified development state.
CCTV Financial Channel, in conjunction with the Institute of Financial Strategy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, has sorted out a piece of useful information for everyone, which is this heavy annual development report of China’s e-commerce.
What kind of report card has China&#39;s e-commerce produced over the past year?
What are the development trends of global e-commerce?
Let’s reveal it to you one by one.
Total sales volume breaks record again, growth returns to accelerating track
Since 2006, my country’s online retail sales have been growing at a very high speed. It is probably because at that time, online shopping was very new and it was so cool to be able to buy things without going out!
But starting in 2013, the growth rate of online retail began to drop below 50%. In 2015, the growth rate was lower than 40% for the first time. In 2016, the growth rate actually became 26.2%.
But this year the situation is different. Online retail sales have accelerated again. From January to September this year, the growth rate rebounded to 34.2%.
Much higher than the growth rate in 2015 and 2016.
Maybe after you go shopping for a while, you may find that shopping makes you more physically and mentally happy.
Among them, online retail sales of physical goods were nearly 5.08 trillion yuan, and online retail sales of services were nearly 1.49 trillion yuan.
It accounted for 13.6% of the total retail sales of social goods, an increase of nearly 3 percentage points year-on-year.
Students, don’t doze off. Focus on the key points. Serving online retail sales is definitely a big contributor!
Secondly, French netizens who love shopping have an average online shopping volume of US$1,925 per capita, and the most popular product they buy online is clothing. It is indeed a country that loves fashion.
Are young people necessarily the ones who love online shopping the most?
Startups that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett once wanted to survey employees at her e-commerce startup about their happiness, but the surveys didn&#39;t do much.
The responses you get are often unclear, unhelpful, or even worse, deceptive.
Even with her promise of anonymity, some employees remain distrustful of the process.
Errett, who oversees Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce hair care company in San Francisco, said there was a &quot;lack of consistency and objectivity in the responses.&quot;
So she called for help.
A new crop of HR startups are popping up to help companies understand how their employees are feeling.
They build and license software specifically designed to measure employee engagement, allowing companies to quickly poll specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass executives Reports directly to the Board of Directors.
&quot;Right now, you can track your fitness with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where&#39;s the corporate Fitbit?&quot; said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint. Glint software analytics tool is used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Eret says that within three years, she&#39;s used Glint to gain more insights into her employees&#39; thoughts and feelings.
In addition to quick surveys and polls on specific teams, Glint provides company heat maps that show at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores – allowing her to drill down to understand why.
Companies are starting to realize that they must master their workplace culture to avoid becoming the next Uber. Uber has been embroiled in scandal after former employees published a blog post describing an environment of harassment, and those speakers were punished by the company.
For startups like Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to financial technology analysis website Let&#39;s Talk Payments, the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry is likely to be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a Denver, Colorado-based startup that helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity during Uber&#39;s reputational damage earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed on as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized &quot;diagnostic&quot; surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also offers an anonymous text hotline for employees to report bad behavior.
If the chairman is implicated, the complaint will go directly to the board.
&quot;The court of public opinion has usurped the power of regulators,&quot; said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to have treated its employees poorly or acted unethically, even if regulators don&#39;t step in, the company could face costly consumer boycotts, employee turnover and involvement in lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across more than 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees understand work guidelines and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate headquarters.
Previously, if employees wanted to report a problem, they had to find a company headquarters phone number or email, file a formal complaint, and hope headquarters would take it seriously.
It&#39;s often a daunting and uncomfortable experience, said James Vetrano, Ruby Tuesday&#39;s general counsel, who doesn&#39;t think there&#39;s a good way to track employee complaints.
But now the company is using Convercent to more quickly identify and address issues that executives in distant offices, cities or states were previously unaware of - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices.
“I get a closer, 360-degree view of the work experience,” said Vetrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management team.
&quot;We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation.&quot;
Quinlan said companies began to place a greater emphasis on ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after Andorra accounting firm collapsed due to ethical violations in the Enron scandal.
But it wasn’t until “social media came into its own” that companies realized they couldn’t stop their revelations from going viral online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people looked at hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge companies a recurring fee for use of the products.
This business model and business opportunity is backed by venture investors who are already backing both startups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from the likes of Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million in funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness between companies, culture and venture capital, these investments come as little surprise.
A growing body of research shows that today’s employees have higher expectations of the workplace than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just table stakes.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued, and that their time is being spent with a company that has a positive mission.
“When people enjoy joining a company, feel their voices are heard, and the work they do is beneficial, they are more committed to making the company successful,” Nina McCartney, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn express. LinkedIn uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors realize returns when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well when their employees are loyal and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it’s no wonder they’re looking for financial support.
Workplace culture experts say it’s important to have data on employee engagement.
However, this data is useless unless the company&#39;s administrators take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, you can expect that the company is undergoing change.
If change doesn&#39;t happen fast enough, or at all, it can lead to disappointment and lead to employees disengaging from the company.
&quot;If you&#39;re asking for 4,000 pieces of advice, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations,&quot; said Russell Rath, head of consulting at business management firm Cort International, who has seen companies rely too much on data collection. mistake.
“Because if you don’t follow through, employees are going to think, ‘Did you really hear what I said?
Do you care?
If you don&#39;t care, why should I care? &#39;&quot;
Errett said Madison Reed now conducts monthly employee surveys and has been able to take action the same day Glint reports an issue.
After gathering feedback from employees about their frustrations with the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, she was able to fix the problem by restructuring the team within the company and adding communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its workforce and, in the long term, hopes to make a shift to better retain employees in an industry known for high attrition rates.
“If you’re not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you’re going to lose talent,” Vetrano said.
“If you lose talent, you lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose the company. &quot;

NCAA cancels twice-daily practices, extending daytime practices for Bruins
It&#39;s nearly 11 p.m., and members of the UCLA football team are hanging around the team&#39;s new on-campus practice field chatting.
Some players have taken off their sweatshirts, revealing bodies drenched in sweat from the hard work on the first day of training camp.
For a large portion of the team, these few spare minutes are rest time.
Players participating in summer sessions will return to their dormitories after three hours of practice to study for final exams, then return to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting at 6:30 the next morning.
“The next three days are a grind for these guys,” Bears coach Jim Mora said as Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA canceled two daily practices (intended to ease the burden on players) but actually extended their daytime practice hours - at least until the end of Friday.
That&#39;s why UCLA&#39;s first three practices are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players&#39; already jam-packed schedules.
The Bears went from eliminating two-a-day practices to more of one-a-day practices almost a week before last season, when Mora practiced in summer school for the first time in six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to hold 18 practices starting on August 20 before starting preparations for the official game against Texas A&amp;M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA&#39;s rule adjustment, even though it will add another item to players&#39; busy schedules.
“We put a huge amount of training on them over three or four days, which is very challenging,” Mora said.
&quot;They just came through, too. They&#39;re grinding, they&#39;re great kids.
I thought about Saturday, when we would have more time, it would be really nice. &quot;
Once training camp is over, UCLA will stop practicing. This was no easy task given the adjacent parking lot and clear line of sight to the Luskin Center. The upscale Luskin Center hotel has been pockmarked by footballs thrown through the protective netting behind the goal posts.
Bears players will be staying in hotels starting this weekend. But Mora acknowledged that problems could arise once those rooms become vacant during the season.
&quot;We will have security measures in place,&quot; Mora said.
&quot;It&#39;s a real concern. It&#39;s not far-fetched to think that someone might rent a room, sit in the room and record training scenes.
If you have training tapes, that&#39;s pretty good too.
But we will have security measures in place there, and we will have security measures in place in parking lot 8.
We will do our best with the resources we have.
I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about that.
We already have a plan. &quot;
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data shows that in the second quarter of this year, house values across Australia rose by an average of 1.5% to 2%, an annual increase of 3.5%, the lowest annual growth rate since March 2013.

IT House reported in the morning that the Wall Street Journal reported that AT&amp;T has canceled its plan to sell Huawei&#39;s new flagship smartphone in the United States.
Huawei originally planned to announce the partnership at CES this week, but AT&amp;T canceled the partnership at the last minute.
In response to this situation, Huawei responded to reporters from The Paper on January 9, saying that on January 9, local time in the United States, Huawei will release new products and specific launch information to the US market.
Huawei said that in the past five years, Huawei has proven its strength by launching high-end products in the global and US markets.
According to previous reports from IT House, Huawei will release a &quot;best mobile phone you have never heard of&quot; at the CES show in Las Vegas on the afternoon of January 9, and the battery life of this mobile phone will be Supports two days of use.
The industry generally believes that Huawei’s upcoming flagship phone will be the Huawei Mate 10 Pro equipped with Android Oreo system.
Yangcheng Evening News reporter Wang Li&#39;s movie &quot;I&#39;m Not Pan Jinlian&quot;, led by Fan Bingbing and starring Guo Tao, Dapeng, Zhang Jiayi, etc., will be released nationwide on September 30.
Yesterday, the film held a seminar on the theme of &quot;The Sadness of Comedy&quot; in Beijing. Three guests, Feng Xiaogang, Ning Hao, and Dapeng, attended the event.
The composition alternates between squares and circles, and the director is willful. The special feature of &quot;I&#39;m Not Pan Jinlian&quot; is the alternation between squares and circles in the composition, especially the circular images shot with masked lenses, which are very fresh.
Feng Xiaogang explained: &quot;This subject matter is very similar to &quot;Qiu Ju&#39;s Lawsuit&quot; directed by Zhang Yimou. It is easy for everyone to associate it with each other, so I thought about how to shoot it in a way that no one has used before. In fact, I don&#39;t have any special ideas, I just feel that It’s fun, I want to do something out of the ordinary.”

Facebook launches fact-checking feature to combat fake news
Facebook announced on Thursday that it would send more potentially hoax articles to third-party testing agencies and display the results below the original posts. Facebook, the world&#39;s largest online social network, is trying to combat so-called fake news.
Facebook will begin using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact-checkers, potentially displaying fact-check results below the original post, the company said in a statement on its website.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main dissemination points of so-called fake news, and many believe that Facebook influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political talking point in Europe, with voters facing a deluge of false stories ahead of France&#39;s presidential election in May and Germany leading the way by backing plans to fine social media networks if they fail to remove them promptly ahead of September elections. Hateful posts will be fined.
Facebook said in a separate statement in Germany on Thursday that it was launching a test of a new fact-checking feature in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
&quot;In addition to seeing which stories are challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to help them make sense of the content they read and share,&quot; Facebook News Feed product manager Sarah Su said in a blog post. Make informed decisions.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its &quot;Related Articles&quot; feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a Graphic Novel: The Story of an English Castle
More recently, diminutive Scotney Castle has been featured in a condensed music video and was a refuge for Margaret Thatcher during the Seventies and Eighties.
But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from the comfort of Kent&#39;s Belle River Gorge, now the home of Jamie Rhodes, a conservationist with a penchant for historical documents. The inspiration for the graphic novel written by the mop-headed Yorkshireman.
&quot;I find it really beautiful to be able to see the handwriting of ancient people from 300 years ago,&quot; he said with longing eyes.
&quot;What kind of interpersonal fate is this that allows this letter to fall into my hands.&quot;
Spanning the Middle Ages and into the Edwardian era, A Castle in England chronicles the various families living in Scotney, each story told by a different, up-and-coming British artist such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, and Becky Palmer. , and by Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes’ first book using archives as source material: he also wrote Dead Man’s Teeth and Other Stories 2014, a book inspired by the British Library’s archives, a book he was inspired by Works completed with uncontrollable creative passion.
He said: “I could not resist the urge to write from the moment I saw the thumb mark on the side of the letter, written by an 18th-century double agent working for the Jacobites.”
&quot;Those are his fingerprints!
And the letters always smelled like smoke, because back then, you needed a fire to get the light.
To us 300 years from now, this smell makes it feel like they are with us too.
Oh, I love archival documents! &quot;
For those impressed by the old paper, it seemed fantastic to be able to live in the castle for almost four months (&quot;I stayed a bit too long, to be honest&quot;) with support from the National Trust and Arts Council England. I just can&#39;t believe it&#39;s true.
Rhodes spent several days touring Victoria&#39;s &quot;new&quot; castle, looking through the archives and studying the estate&#39;s many treasures and curios, such as a hyena head hanging on the wall and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat. .
He wandered the grounds and ruins of the old castle, chatting with wanderers, gardeners, and sometimes the artists who illustrated his books.
Then at night, he would &quot;drink some whiskey and write.&quot;
Scotney&#39;s hidden history is not entirely clear, as the National Trust only fully gained access after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, staff began working on the archives, which he described as &quot;nobles from hundreds of years ago going: &#39;Oh, put it in the attic&#39;.&quot; &quot;
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps charting the boundaries of various countries: “You would think land disputes would be boring,” says Rhodes, “but what happens is two families fight over a birch tree.
Let it go, guys! &quot;
Some of the stories in the work use the castle as a starting point for broader studies of British history, including The Laborer, which follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to take part in the Peasants&#39; Revolt of 1381.
&quot;The story in the book, &#39;Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,&#39; records a riot at the castle in 1380,&quot; Rhodes said.
“The peasant uprising started in that area, and I thought that was a good place to start an uprising.
Maybe the two are related? &quot;
Other stories are deeply rooted in the castle&#39;s history, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Durrell family who hid a Jesuit priest for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, about the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Durrell, who is thought to have performed his own funeral by filling his coffin with rocks (his coffin was revealed years later The ground, people discovered).
The Darrells were Rhodes’ favorite Scotney Castle family: “These gentlemen seemed to be rogues, always borrowing money and spending money on things they couldn’t afford.
Generations of Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women, and I imagine they are a bunch of handsome young men who know how to woo women. &quot;
As his assignment in the castle ended, Rhodes began to seek out other bizarre writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness completing a graphic novel about El?¤m?¤nm?¤ki, an early 20th-century sanatorium that was slowly abandoned.
But Scotney holds a special place for him.
&quot;I&#39;m sad to leave,&quot; he said.
&quot;It&#39;s like: &#39;Oh, I have to deal with real life shit.&#39;&quot;

All large energy companies are &quot;as rich as the country.&quot; So among the many energy companies in the world, who is taking advantage of the most money?
Yesterday, the famous PFC Energy Company announced the ranking of the top 50 listed energy companies in 2011. ExxonMobil, an American oil and gas producer, retained the title with a market value of US$406.3 billion, followed closely by PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell.
In PFC&#39;s list, PetroChina claimed the top spot twice in 2007 and 2009, and the top spot in other years was all occupied by Exxon Mobil.
In the 2011 top 50 list, a total of three companies from mainland China were shortlisted. In addition to PetroChina, which ranked second, there were also Sinopec, which ranked ninth, and China National Offshore Oil Corporation, which ranked fifteenth.
According to PFC statistics, although the current oil price is much higher than four years ago, the CEO of PFC Energy pointed out that there are many reasons for the low total market value, including the decline in natural gas prices in North America and the decline in global stock markets. Activity is low.

U.S. changes green card rules
The media quoted President Donald Trump&#39;s speech as saying that the United States will launch a new immigration plan and modify the green card regulations.
The plan would reduce legal immigration to 50,000 a year, with tighter rules on temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications.
The new rules were proposed by Republicans and backed by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
U.S. media quoted Trump as saying, “This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars, and achieve these benefits by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law would replace the current scheme and reduce chain migration.
This new application process favors applicants who speak English, have financial support, and have skills that are beneficial to economic development. &quot;

Sex robots are indeed on the rise, but we should be cautious
Just when you thought 2017 couldn&#39;t get any weirder, the sex robot field releases a new report on technological developments.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking ahead to the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the robot&#39;s eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
&quot;People are laughing behind their backs, but companies are launching a lot of sex robots, and we&#39;re going to see more,&quot; Sharkey said when the new report was released.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls into robots. They have silicone skins that are warm to the touch and are designed to have human-like sexual responses using artificial intelligence.
Users can also &quot;customize&quot; their robots to suit their preferences, choosing from eye color and nipple shape to nail type or color.
But even more troubling is the fact that many robots have &quot;personalities&quot; that would make the Clone Wife look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skins.
For example, the RealBotix bot can be customized based on characteristics that the user finds attractive, such as shyness.
There is also the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion, which can have pre-set personality characteristics, including the slightly shy &quot;Cool Farah&quot; and the &quot;adventurous&quot; &quot;Wild Wendy&quot;.
“The Roxxxy Gold robot has a personality that matches you as much as possible,” enthuses the True Companion website.
So she loves what you love and hates what you hate.
She also had a little mood during those days just like normal people!
She can be lazy, talkative, and &#39;sexually active&#39;! &quot;
The rise of sex robots brings with it a lot of unease—not just the replacement of real human relationships—but the groveling femininity and rape implications that twitch on the icy (read: resistant) Farrah are the most concerning.
On its website, True Companion compares the Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
The website states &quot;If women have vibrators, why can&#39;t men have Roxxxy?&quot;
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish, nor are they just a sex toy.
Their emergence and growing sophistication points to a darker, deeper part of our culture: the flight from perfect gender equality toward sex where surrender is an optional extra.
Of course, most men won&#39;t own sex robots, and while FRR notes that sex robots are becoming increasingly popular, they currently remain on the fringes of consumer culture.
But what seeps in from the margins allows us to see clearly the course of the era in which we live.
Many people aren&#39;t weird or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to be.
It’s no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when the rights of women around the world are under threat and that there’s a president in the White House who brags about sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the TV series &quot;The Handmaid&#39;s Tale&quot; is not the realistic images, the hanging corpses, or the gouged eyes, but the overly realistic imagination.
The Republic of Gilead was a jump, but it doesn&#39;t look that far away now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create bodies that most closely resemble those of real women (albeit in porn star proportions) as technologically possible.
The creators of these robots want them to have a human touch and mimic real human movements.
But to put it bluntly, their “personalities” are not representative of real women.
They cannot break up or run away.
They have no agency to turn to and no follow-up story, no independence at all, no possibility of breaking out of the fantasy of outright servitude.
In other words, they are pleasure slaves.
Or in popular parlance in 2017: Handmaiden.

Trump’s great achievement?
Make Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
Political divisions polarize the American electorate and, from a micro perspective, undermine the harmony of American families. This is nothing new in the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, America’s major newspapers filled their opinion columns with how to deal with the fears of relatives who voted for Trump.
It is often thought that we are doing everything we can to puncture our “filter bubbles.”
Less vocal is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has a long-standing feud with the Republicans in our family, is visiting me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
As a result of working with Trump in the White House, everyone she knew, even Republican relatives with whom she had feuded politically for decades, was suddenly and strangely on the same page.
That&#39;s certainly a good thing if it&#39;s all at the dinner table. But what strikes me is that from a broader perspective, this poses significant risks.
While figures on the left have been egged on by Trump, the warping effect of his presidency has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we’re referring to the fearful possibility that his erratic behavior might one day cease.
However, there is a more worrying long-term scenario in which Trump &quot;normalizes&quot; relations with right-wing Republicans who have previously opposed the president&#39;s standards and now suddenly seem rational. symbol of.
I&#39;ve found myself nostalgic lately for Mitt Romney&#39;s version of nutty eccentricity: dogs in cars, 14% income taxes (but at least we know his tax returns), both of which compare to Trump. The crime of this act does seem too minor.
With the Trump era behind us, the next Republican nominee will just have to be intellectually qualified to make immeasurable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town we took the kids to the New York Park Carousel, it was the largest carousel run by the Central Park Conservancy in New York and if you didn&#39;t need coffee the three dollar admission was You have the most consumption value in this city.
The sound of the Trojan is thundering and huge, with its fiberglass central column, and all the clowns and animals turning their heads and looking over their shoulders in horror and menacing, while tinkling music plays strangely.
Too many kitschy cities disappoint: views from high-rise buildings become clichéd, skylines become too familiar and no longer offer much excitement, and urban realities fail to sustain the dreams.
35 years later, I still haven’t completely forgotten the day I discovered that the “Swiss Cottage” was not actually a Swiss Cottage, but a themed bar called “Ye Olde Swiss Cottage”. I can’t remember exactly, but near a junction in north London.
However, the Central Park Carousel is still a magical experience, an activity that two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and two girls in their 40s can participate in, and there is something for everyone. Have a great time.
If I could rate the carousel I would give it full marks, but luckily no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before swiping my credit card, I was asked to rate my transaction &quot;experience&quot; from one to five stars.
Same thing at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, plus there&#39;s the option to tip 15% towards the end, which is for buying something at the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral transaction, but it also puts pressure on the waiter and adds a personal element to the situation that is not needed.
The poor woman in the department store smiled apologetically while I, exhausted, gave her five stars for my credit card transaction experience.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has left prison and been transferred to hospital.
Last year he was taken to the hospital for treatment of a cut to his wrist, which prison officials said was caused by a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the initial manslaughter verdict.
He fatally shot Steenkamp multiple times through a toilet cubicle door in his Pretoria home in the early hours of Valentine&#39;s Day 2013.
Pistorius claimed he mistook his girlfriend for an intruder who was hiding in a cubicle at night.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius&#39;s six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to South Africa&#39;s Supreme Court, which could be heard this year.
If prosecutors prevail, Pistorius faces an increase in prison term to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

Two Bulgarians detained for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained in Greece for illegal camping, bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying.

On May 18, the Ministry of Finance announced the &quot;Measures for the Management of Special Rewards and Subsidy Funds for Industrial Enterprise Structural Adjustment&quot;, which will allocate special rewards and subsidy funds to promote the resolution of overcapacity in the coal and steel industries, with a total amount of 100 billion yuan.
Recently, many local governments including Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Heilongjiang have successively put forward reform opinions on resolving excess production capacity.
Among them, many provinces have even proposed to actively seek financial support from the central government to reduce overcapacity in their provinces.
One piece of evidence is that the coal overcapacity reduction targets announced by only eight provinces account for 90% of the national coal production reduction plan.
In an interview with reporters, Lin Boqiang, dean of the China Energy Policy Research Institute at Xiamen University, believed that relying solely on the central government’s 100 billion yuan to reduce overcapacity in the steel and coal industries is far from enough. More funds need to be solved by local governments and enterprises themselves. How to deal with it?
The recently announced implementation details of coal overcapacity reduction in Shanxi Province proposed to reorganize Shanxi Coking Coal Group into a state-owned capital investment company, reorganize and integrate the company&#39;s assets and business, and build a new business model.
The actual funding gap may be three times that of subsidies. Previously, Yin Weimin, Minister of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, said that preliminary statistics indicate that 1.3 million employees in the coal industry and 500,000 in the steel industry will be diverted to &quot;cut overcapacity&quot;.
Nanfang Daily (Reporter/Xie Qingyu) The reporter learned today from the Provincial Environmental Protection Department that the 2012 environmental protection credit rating results of key pollution sources in Guangdong Province are being announced.
After evaluation, 134 of the 1,251 companies included in the environmental credit management list were temporarily not rated due to suspension of production, failure to accept acceptance, closure and other reasons.
Among the enterprises to be rated as red-carded, there are mainly electroplating, printing and dyeing, prevention and control and other heavy-polluting enterprises, and some sewage treatment plants are also on the list.
The Provincial Environmental Protection Department stated that in order to reflect the principles of openness, fairness and impartiality and accept public supervision, the rating results are now published on the Environmental Protection Department website.
During the publicity period, the Environmental Protection Department will accept calls, letters, visits and other forms from the public to report problems, and the Environmental Protection Department will investigate, verify and handle the problems reported.

In 2017, the e-commerce giant Amazon made frequent moves around the world. It not only successfully launched artificial intelligence terminals, but also ventured into offline stores, opening a new chapter in retail.
Although China is the world&#39;s second-largest pharmaceutical market after the United States, some of the most effective modern medicines are not commercially available.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, joint monitoring data from China, the United States, Russia and other countries in 1998 showed that there were only 4 to 6 wild Siberian tigers and 3 to 5 Siberian leopards in Jilin Province.
Could eating less meat, dairy and chocolate help relieve inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
Meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study suggests just the opposite: A diet rich in meat protein and dairy products can help relieve symptoms in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease affects the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and 300,000 Britons, causing stomach cramps and bloating, frequent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
Researchers at the University of Washington typically advise patients to avoid meat and dairy to relieve symptoms, but researchers found that protein&#39;s key amino acid tryptophan helps promote the growth of immune cells that promote tolerance in the gut. force.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microorganisms hidden in food do not sneak into the body.
Maintaining a balance between cells that trigger inflammation and cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging various sensitive and fragile tissues.
When the balance shifts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
In experiments, a type of immune-promoting cells was found in mice carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need tryptophan, one of the building blocks of proteins, to give their cells their appearance.
Professor Colonna said: &quot;We established a link between a bacterial population (Lactobacillus reuteri, which is a normal part of the gut microbiota) and the development of a cell population that promotes tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice consumed in their diet, the more immune cells they had.
He suggested that if the same approach were used in humans, combining L. reuteri with a tryptophan-rich diet might result in a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas was studying a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of research mice had such cells, but another group did not. strains when reared separately.
She suspects the difference is related to the mice&#39;s gut microbial communities (the bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract).
DNA sequencing of the mice&#39;s cholesterol revealed six bacterial species that were present in mice with immune cells but not in mice without immune cells.
Mice are raised in a sterile environment, so they lack gut microbes and cannot develop the immune cells that are produced in the presence of Lactobacillus reuteri.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew Lactobacillus reuteri in fluid and then transferred small amounts of the bacteria-free fluid to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells develop into tolerant cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it was shown that the active ingredient was a by-product of tryptophan metabolism called indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice&#39;s diet, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not yet known whether humans can use the tryptophan byproduct from Lactobacillus reuteri to induce cell development in the same way as in mice, but tryptophan-related gene defects have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
&quot;The development of these cells may be exactly what we want because these cells control the inflammatory response on the lining of the gut,&quot; she said.
It is not certain that the high levels of tryptophan present in L. reuteri may lead to an increase in the number of this species.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed &#39;genius&#39; Nemanja Matic
Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a &quot;genius&quot; midfielder after Nemanja Matic made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, a £40m signing from Chelsea, started 2-1 in the league&#39;s final pre-season game ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid in Dublin on Tuesday, winning against Paul Pogba and Andrea S. Pereira&#39;s favor.
However, Matic was severely lacking in match fitness during Blues&#39; pre-season tour of Asia, completing only 45 minutes, with Mourinho admitting that improvement is needed before the start of the Premier League season.
&quot;He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence and a genius way of thinking - he thinks about football,&quot; Mourinho said.
&quot;We&#39;ll get him ready as quickly as possible.&quot;
Mourinho started the season with his starting lineup. Like Matic, new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still hopes to bring in three more signings but insists the club are &quot;doing a great job&quot; and he has four first-choice signings in mind, three of whom he has already signed.
&quot;I&#39;m very grateful to the club for bringing in three of these signings,&quot; he added.
&quot;I would be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they have done a great job for me.&quot;
The world is witnessing an upsurge in frigates. Will China fall behind if it does not build this type of warship?
As the major naval powers in the world have recently announced the construction plans of new frigates, it seems that overnight frigates have become the focus of the navies of major powers. First, Japan decided to purchase two new frigates in its 2018 defense budget, making Japan The DEX frigate program finally made a substantial breakthrough, and then Lockheed Martin of the United States recently announced the latest plan for the U.S. FFG frigate program. So where should China&#39;s new frigates go?
With the launch of the latest Type 054A frigate at the end of 2017, it means that as many as 29 Type 054A frigates have been built, approaching the total number of 053H series frigates. Since the first Type 054A was launched in 2006, the construction of 054A has The process has lasted 12 years. Even in the world, except for China, only the &quot;Perry&quot; class frigates built by the United States in the 1970s and 1980s can build such a large number of high-performance general-purpose frigates. Comparable.
The reason why so many 054As are built is also very simple, that is, they are affordable, easy to use, and can supplement the navy&#39;s debts over the years.
The 054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese Navy for many years due to its high cost performance and good combat effectiveness. Its displacement of about 4,000 tons is equipped with a 76mm main gun, and the 32-unit Haihongqi-16 and Yu-8 anti-submarine missiles are launched together. The vertical launch system, 8 YJ-83s and a Z-9 helicopter. Although it was built in 2006 and the design time is very early, its combat effectiveness is not too bad even today. Looking at it, It can also reach the upper-middle level among frigates in the world.
But after all, this is a ship designed in the early 21st century. Putting aside its weapon configuration, its power system and electronic radar equipment are far behind compared with the current mainstream frigates in the world. The same type of frigates in Europe are already equipped with all-electric propulsion. , small multi-functional phased array radar, and large-size helicopter deck, it is time to develop new models.
So how should China&#39;s new frigates be developed? This is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic policy of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will definitely become a blue-water navy, and it will also go to the ocean in the future, with the ability to quickly deploy in areas closely related to China&#39;s vital interests, demonstrate the presence of force, and have strong combat effectiveness to protect China when necessary. If the vital interests in this area are not damaged, it seems that the new Hu Weijiang will definitely develop towards large-scale and ocean-going development.
Let’s look at the positioning of new frigates in the future sequence of the Chinese Navy. The future Chinese Navy should be similar to the U.S. Navy. In addition to the necessary offshore defense ships, other main ships will form aircraft carrier battle groups or amphibious assaults as needed. Ship strike group.
The role of the new frigate in the future aircraft carrier battle group should be to serve as the main anti-submarine force and positioning for air clearance in the mid-to-near area. In the amphibious assault ship strike group, it should serve as a frigate. Therefore, according to such needs, the new frigate must be powerful. Anti-submarine capability and good mid-range area release capability.
Based on the above positioning, we can boldly imagine what the future domestic frigates will look like.
First of all, the displacement will be significantly increased compared to the current Type 054A frigate. It is estimated that the displacement of the new frigate will reach about 5,000-6,000 tons; the power system will use a comprehensive QC280 improved gas turbine and two diesel engines. With the electric propulsion system, the maximum speed is expected to reach about 30 knots, and the endurance will also be greatly increased; as for the weapon configuration, the 76mm main gun and 1130 close-in defense gun should be retained, but a Hongqi 10 launch system will be added, and there should be a red flag behind the main gun. A 32-48 unit Hongqi 16 improved vertical launch system that is co-mounted with the Yu-8, and a large 8-16 unit vertical launch system should be installed in the middle and rear of the ship for launching YJ-18 and new cruise missiles; The hangar and parking platform will also be enlarged to accommodate the parking and storage of two 10-ton helicopters; as for the electronic radar system, if it is a high-end configuration, it should be equipped with a small four-sided fixed phased array radar based on the development of 346A. If it is a low-end configuration, it can be used Similar to the multifunctional rotating phased array radar on European frigates.
In this way, the overall level of the new frigate will reach the current first-class level in the world, even if it is compared with the American FFG.
Of course, the above concepts are just the author&#39;s conjectures about the new domestically produced frigates. We can only find out the details when the new frigates are launched. Let us look forward to it together.

In recent years, our city has encouraged enterprises to actively participate in the construction of national, industry standards and regional group standards, awarding 300,000 yuan to enterprises that lead or participate in the formulation of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards, and 500,000 yuan to enterprises that have passed Zhejiang manufacturing brand certification. , is the highest amount of this award in the province, stimulating the enthusiasm of enterprises to participate in benchmarking.
A few days ago, in the production workshop of Wangli Group, the group&#39;s system leader Gao Jian and his employees were sealing and packaging an anti-theft safety door as a sample for participating in the Zhejiang manufacturing group&#39;s standard benchmarking work, preparing to be sent to the Shaoxing Quality Inspection Center.
Just two days ago, Wang Li passed the on-site audit by the &quot;Made in Zhejiang&quot; certification expert group.
Gao Jian said that a professional team composed of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations praised the group&#39;s achievements in core aspects such as excellent quality and independent innovation, and unanimously believed that it fully complied with the standards. As long as the products pass the inspection, Wang Li will become One of the first companies to pass this standard.
Wangli Group is just a microcosm of how standards can drive industrial transformation and upgrading.
Other companies in our city that simultaneously carry out benchmarking and compliance work for Zhejiang manufacturing group standards are Buyang and Qunsheng Group.
Since the formulation of Zhejiang manufacturing team standards last year by the city’s anti-theft safety door industry, companies such as Xingyue and Xinduo have also been actively applying for docking and benchmarking work.
In recent years, a large amount of capital has poured into the film and television market, and the popularity and remuneration of star actors have increased. Producer He Jing once broke the news that two actors in a popular drama were paid nearly 100 million yuan, but in the end they only acted together for two days, and basically all other scenes were done by stand-ins.
Nowadays, it is common for actors to travel around to play. The male and female protagonists are in different crews at the same time. As a result, they cannot appear on the set at the same time. The crew is forced to use stand-ins to ensure the cycle.
It is understood that after returning to Beijing from the away game in Chengdu, Morris continued to go to the hospital for acupuncture treatment to ensure that the injury would not continue to worsen.
Samsung said in a statement earlier this week that 93% of its Note 7 smartphones sold in the U.S. have been recalled.
Finally, Robin Li also said that China does not lack good stories, but there is no &quot;IP that can cross cultures and have ecological effects&quot; like Harry Potter, and this &quot;ecological thinking&quot; is what we should learn from Hollywood.
China&#39;s household debt ratio is close to that of the United States. What&#39;s more terrifying than not being able to buy a house is not being able to repay the debt?
Recently, everyone has been discussing the recent changes in real estate policy. Is the real estate policy going to be loosened again? Will the diversification of land policy supply entities lead to a decline in housing prices?
However, when we are worried about real estate prices, macroeconomic regulation, and the future trend of the real estate market, the &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; has written an article again. Last time we specifically discussed the &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; commentary on setting the tone for real estate regulation, and now &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; The People&#39;s Daily article discusses a more serious topic than whether you can afford a house. This is, even if you can afford a house, can you still afford the debt?
Today, let’s talk about a more serious problem than buying a house: loan repayment.
1. China’s increasingly serious housing debt crisis
The overseas edition of &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; published a commentary article &quot;Awards and Loans: Joys and Worries of Struggling Youth&quot; on January 17. According to the data in the article, in November 2017, the National Finance and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, The &quot;Report on China&#39;s Deleveraging Process in the Third Quarter&quot; released by the National Balance Sheet Research Center pointed out that the household sector&#39;s leverage ratio continued its upward trend, rising from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, an increase of 1.3 percentage points. It rose by 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The proportion of debt of the residential sector in the entire real economy has increased, and the leverage ratio has increased rapidly.
Relevant research shows that the liabilities of Chinese households in financial institutions are mainly consumer loans, accounting for about two-thirds of residents&#39; liabilities, which is about twice that of operating loans.
Among them, medium- and long-term loans, mainly housing loans, account for about 80% of consumer loans. However, in terms of incremental growth, short-term consumer loans are growing faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition, China&#39;s household debt rate only counts the total amount of credit obtained by the household sector from financial institutions. However, Chinese households also have many private loans, including borrowing money from relatives and friends, and there is a large amount of hidden debt.
Seeing such data, people can&#39;t help but be a little stunned. According to statistics from Suning Financial Research Institute, China&#39;s residents&#39; leverage ratio was only 3% in 1996 and only 18% in 2008. However, since 2008, the residents&#39; leverage ratio has begun to show Rapid growth, doubling in just six years to 36.4%. By the third quarter of 2017, the household leverage ratio had reached 48.6%.
Let’s compare another data. In May last year, HSBC released a survey report spanning nine countries with nearly tens of thousands of respondents.
This report interviewed &quot;millennial&quot; young people (born between 1980 and 2000) in nine countries.
The report pointed out that the home ownership rate of young people born in the 1980s and 1990s in China is as high as 70%, far ahead of the second-placed Mexico (46%), and twice the level of the United States (35%).
These data tell us a very likely problem, that is, compared with being unable to afford a house, the biggest potential &quot;grey rhinoceros&quot; for Chinese residents at this stage is probably the inability to repay their debts.
2. Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As in our previous analysis, although we have been saying that China&#39;s housing prices are relatively high, compared to other countries in the world, China&#39;s home ownership rate is actually quite high. So rather than saying that housing prices are high and people cannot afford to buy a house, I&#39;m afraid The question I want to ask many of my friends now is, can you afford the loan?
We look at the real estate market around the world. Due to its late start, China&#39;s real estate market has not yet experienced a major real estate crisis except Hainan, which we mentioned before. However, just ten years ago in 2008, the origin of the global financial tsunami It’s America’s housing crisis.
The cause of the U.S. real estate crisis is blamed on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
In the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold houses to low-income people in the United States with extremely low down payments in order to expand sales. When the U.S. economy was improving, the real estate market was also booming. However, the good times did not last long. The growth of the U.S. economy has stagnated, causing home buyers&#39; incomes to fall, and a large number of household consumption expenditures have begun to decline.
However, the current situation in the United States at that time was that American household assets were composed of financial assets and real estate assets. Almost all household assets of low-income groups in the United States were real estate, while most of the assets of the top 20% of high-income groups were financial assets. As a result, the poorer the households in the United States, the higher their real estate debt ratio.
A serious fact is that these people bought their houses when the economy was better, so the money to pay the mortgage is also calculated based on their better income. When the income declines, the pressure on the mortgage is not reduced or even reduced. Because some subprime mortgage plans became more volatile, the real estate problems of these American families gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
As a result, some people could not afford to pay their mortgages because their incomes were too low, so banks began to repossess properties. When banks repossessed properties from home buyers who defaulted on their loans, they sold them at extremely low prices, which led to a step-by-step increase in housing prices in the area. decline, this process triggered a further decline in housing prices, forming a vicious cycle. When housing prices fell to a certain level, more and more home buyers found that the value of their houses was even lower than their loans, so As a result, more people stopped paying off their mortgages, resulting in more bad debts.
As a result, a huge vicious circle was formed:
&quot;The economy is in recession - incomes are falling - some people can&#39;t repay their mortgages - banks sell the houses of debtors at low prices - house prices fall - more people stop paying mortgages - banks sell again - house prices fall again …”
And the problem is not just that, because house prices continue to fall, people stop repaying loans and give the house to the bank. It does not mean that you will have no debt. If the money obtained by the bank from auctioning the house can repay the loan you owe the bank, then you still need to Then repay the money. To put it simply, suppose you bought a house worth 3 million with a down payment of 600,000 and a loan of 2.4 million. When the house price dropped to the point where the house was only worth 2 million, you stopped paying back the loan and gave the house away. Bank, after the bank auctions the house, you not only lose your down payment of 600,000, but also owe the bank a debt of 400,000, and you still have to pay back the money.
As a result, under such vicious cycles one after another, the U.S. economy gradually collapsed, eventually triggering the 2008 financial crisis in the United States.
Therefore, the current level of China&#39;s household debt ratio has reached a high of 46.8%, which is an issue that requires great vigilance. This data is still lower than the level of developed countries at present, but signs of the problem have begun to appear. The country started last year The repeated emphasis on deleveraging is a very prescient judgment. If the household debt ratio is allowed to continue to rise, it will inevitably cause huge risks, so we must strictly guard against the emergence of financial risks.
Therefore, with the positioning that houses are for living in and not for speculation, the country has quickly established multiple measures such as multi-subject supply, multi-channel guarantee, and simultaneous rental and purchase to further resolve potential risks.
For our individual families, we must abandon the speculative thinking in real estate and act according to our ability when buying a house to prevent our family from falling into a huge burden. Only by rationally evaluating our own income and debt levels can we develop a healthy family wealth. .

British inventor implants a chip in his body and can enter his house and car with a wave of his hand
A British inventor has become the first person in the country to install a chip that allows him to open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and is now offering the service, which is provided by his company BioTeq, to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives. Achieved through technology.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, senior consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure the implantation process meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to microchipping cats and dogs and only takes 30 seconds.
Mr Northam&#39;s company will also replace locks on rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, at a cost of £300 per lock.
The married father-of-one now has the technology installed in both his home and his BMW Z4, which he can start by simply putting his hands on the steering wheel.

White House props cost thousands
According to military records released by Time magazine, the White House decided last month to transport a Marine Corps helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of American manufacturing, at a cost of up to $24,000.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as Marine One when the president is aboard) was an important exhibit at the White House event on July 17 highlighting American construction projects.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
Exhibits include a Connecticut-made helicopter, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
According to records from Marine Helicopter Flight Group 1 (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House Military Office requested that the helicopter be present under routine orders (FRAGO), which is when the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the &quot; Only 36 hours before the special” event.
&quot;I just wanted to make sure you were aware, as this event is taken very seriously,&quot; the HMX-1 commander said in an email to his superior, the Marine Corps&#39; deputy commandant of flight, the day before the event.
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and will not leave until the lawn is cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. that evening.
The information also stated that in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to duty time constraints.
The original crew was on standby at the helicopter during the event, while security force personnel were nearby while the aircraft was on the ground.
Records obtained by TIME did not make it clear whether a second crew was ultimately needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records state that HMX-1 asked whether the event violated the Act.
&quot;One question we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act and were told it was not,&quot; the commander wrote.
&quot;Sounds like you&#39;re locked up,&quot; the deputy commander replied.
The White House defines the Made in America event as an official event and therefore not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president pushed for what was then a Senate issue: health care reform and touted controls on government regulations.
Using Marine One or Air Force One for political propaganda purposes is nothing new.
Successive presidents have been required to travel on these planes.
But requisitioning them solely for photographic purposes is uncommon.
Trump came into the spotlight in February, as his presidential plane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with criticism of his predecessor&#39;s use of the plane. complaint information.
&quot;The White House is excited about this &#39;Made in America&#39; exhibit, which showcases products from all 50 states and made by American workers using American materials,&quot; said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights near the Washington area and on the South Lawn, practicing accurately placing the President of the United States at the White House.
HMX-1 practiced 58 landings at the White House while Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit in early July.
An official said the Made in America event flight counts toward crew training requirements this month.
The helicopter unit also flew an additional 11 hours of &quot;non-presidential support missions&quot; that day.
The White House said taxpayers were not footing the bill for any other props at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging the South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 did not keep budget records for presidential flights, so determining the exact costs incurred by the event is difficult.
But according to DOD hourly rate records for fiscal year 2017, the DOD reimbursable cost for the VH-3D was $24,380 per flight hour.
Troop records record each flight taking 30 minutes from the aircraft&#39;s base at Marine Corps Air Station Quantico, Virginia.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was far less than that.
&quot;Estimates of taxpayer costs based on reimbursement are very misleading,&quot; Walters said.
These estimated costs include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs included in the annual appropriation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that DoD reimbursement does not include personnel costs, but it does include fuel, maintenance and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event,
&quot;The idea is to showcase something made in America this week,&quot; he said.
And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are proud of the fact that they both contribute to our national security, and I&#39;m guessing hundreds, if not thousands, of people&#39;s jobs depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we&#39;re all very proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which are the result of the hard work of countless Americans.
So it&#39;s certainly not out of place to highlight this. &quot;
It&#39;s unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn at the event, but he did get into the driver&#39;s seat of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives and joked with the media about his own planes from the company.
&quot;I know Sikorsky aircraft very well. I have three of them,&quot; he said.
Xi Jinping’s wonderful metaphor on comprehensively and strictly governing the party
On January 11, at the second plenary session of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered an important speech, emphasizing that “with perseverance that is always on the road, we will lead the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party to in-depth and create a comprehensive New Situation in Strictly Governing the Party&quot;.
Regarding comprehensive and strict governance of the party, General Secretary Xi Jinping has made many vivid metaphors. Let’s review them together!
Hit the &quot;tigers&quot; if they show up, and swat the &quot;flies&quot; as they fly around. It is necessary to promote the extension of comprehensive and strict party governance to the grassroots level, and severely rectify corruption problems that occur around the people.
——On January 11, 2018, Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the second plenary session of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China.
The majority of disciplinary inspection and supervision cadres must be loyal and firm, take on responsibilities, abide by disciplines and laws, be honest and honest, ensure that the power given by the party and the people is not abused, and that the sword used to punish evil and promote good will never be covered with dust.
——On January 11, 2018, Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the second plenary session of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China.
Implementation must not be carried out in vain. Just shouting slogans without taking action is not enough. Merely holding meetings and issuing documents is not enough. It must be implemented.
——From December 25 to 26, 2017, Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the Democratic Life Conference held by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee
Comrades in the Political Bureau of the Central Committee should be aware of history and reason, and should not confuse public and private affairs, confuse right and wrong, blur justice and interests, or indulge family affection. They should take the lead in establishing a &quot;vane&quot; of integrity and self-discipline and promote the formation of a clean and honest party style.
——From December 25 to 26, 2017, Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the Democratic Life Conference held by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee
If you use one wise person, all the wise people will come together, and when you see the wise people, they will think about each other and it will become a common practice. Whoever you choose will be the vane, which will determine what kind of cadre style you will have, and even what kind of party style you will have.
——Xi Jinping’s speech at the National Organizational Work Conference on June 28, 2013
The blacksmith must be hard himself. To unite and lead the people in carrying out great struggles, advancing great causes, and realizing great dreams, the party must unswervingly uphold and improve the party&#39;s leadership, and unswervingly build the party to be stronger and more powerful.
——On October 18, 2017, Xi Jinping pointed out in his report at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
At present, the anti-corruption struggle remains grim and complex, and our determination to consolidate the overwhelming momentum and win an overwhelming victory must be rock-solid.
——On October 18, 2017, Xi Jinping pointed out in his report at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China

According to Market Star, from 2005 to 2011, our province’s GDP rose from tied for “bottom” in central China to second in one fell swoop.
However, our province&#39;s economic growth still faces difficulties such as low investment efficiency and lack of core competitiveness in the industrial economy. To this end, the latest issue of the Provincial Economic Information Center&#39;s &quot;Economic Blue Pages&quot; recommends improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
Based on some representative indicators of our province&#39;s economy in 2005 and 2011, we compare them with those of the country and the central region.
In terms of industrial economic benefits, in 2011, high energy-consuming industries such as industrial energy and raw materials, which accounted for a considerable proportion of our province, were greatly affected by market fluctuations and the &quot;double pressure&quot; of overcapacity. At the same time, leading industries such as home appliances and automobiles lacked innovation. , resulting in meager profits.
The large amount of investment has not brought corresponding economic benefits, which is an important reason for the low quality and low efficiency of our province&#39;s economic growth.
In this regard, experts suggest that effective measures should be taken to encourage enterprise innovation, and scientific and technological achievements from universities and research institutes should also be &quot;transferred&quot; to enterprises in a timely manner.
Regarding the low economic benefits of industry, experts say that we must also actively promote industrial mergers and reorganizations, optimize industrial layout, and extend the industrial chain.

La Liga may regret offer of Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on signing Neymar after making a £189m bid to get him to exercise his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago that they were about to launch an attack on the world-record striker?

&quot;I&#39;m not worried because they know that if they contact any of our players, we will go toe-to-toe with them and we will contact their players,&quot; Al-Khelaifi said.
