According to the British media, the United States Vice-Minister of Naval Operations, General William Moran, said that the United States continued to focus on the Asia-Pacific region — the Pentagon — to extend the area to include the Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific — even as the United States Navy was re-energized to deal with increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic.
According to the United Kingdom's Jane's Defense Weekly website, on 24 September, the United States listed Russia and China as strategic competitors in its new defence strategy, which was announced at the beginning of the year.
Since then, the United States Navy has resumed its second fleet in order to confront Russian activities more directly.
Reports suggest that these moves raise some questions and concerns among allies and analysts who fear that the United States Navy may be far away from the “Asia-Pacific rebalancing” strategy that marks the Obama administration.
However, General Moran said that the focus of the United States Navy remained the Western Pacific Ocean.
On 24 January 2018, at a round-table discussion entitled “Addressing the challenges of the high seas”, hosted by the National Asian Research Office in Washington, D.C., he said: “There has been no major change for us.”
Milan said, “The focus remains rebalancing, shifting focus or whatever you want to describe it.”
He acknowledged, however, that the United States was close to Europe.
He said, “We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do.”
Although Moran states that the overall policy regarding Russia falls within the purview of the United States Secretary of Defense, he warns that “Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has shown that if we clash with them, they will be very tough.”
Admiral Moran said that, as part of America’s renewed campaign against Russia, China and other competitors, the United States Navy was dynamically deploying its forces into a “new mode of operation”, which would help to surprise opponents as to where American carriers or other assets would be deployed at any given time or place.
He said, "We, the Navy and the Marines, support it -- -- the concept of unpredictability of operations, not to appear in the same place again and again, almost like a hairline -- -- that's how we do it."
It was reported that this new approach was first attempted by the Harry Truman carrier combat group, whose early deployment included working visits to ports and patrolling areas that were usually only passing through.
Moran said that the United States Navy was currently working to ensure that allies were aware that these warships would continue to patrol the traditional areas and were also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment procedures.
Lieutenant General Michael Nunan, Commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also addressed the event, stating that the Australian army could work seamlessly with United States carriers.
He said that the situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy planned to procure an additional nine frigates equipped with the Zeus Shield operational system.
A few airlines have raised or restored fuel surcharges since October 5.
Yesterday, airlines such as Xiang Poon Air and Okai Air announced that, as of 5 October 2018 (the date of the tickets), each passenger would be charged a fuel surcharge of $20 per passenger on the domestic route below 800 km, and a fuel surcharge of $30 per passenger on the more than 800 km route.
The company Xiang Poon Aviation, Okai Aviation and others announced that the rate of surcharges for fuel on domestic routes up to 800 km (including) has increased from 10 to 20 km/person from 0 o'clock on 5 October 2018 to 30 yuan/person/person per passenger.
Children and members of the military/police have been disabled for 10 yuan per person; infants continue to be exempted.
According to the person in charge of the airfares, the airline had indicated in the notification that the fuel surcharge was charged on the date of the original ticket and that the fuel surcharge was not refunded when the tickets were exchanged.
This means that domestic airline tickets issued prior to 5 October will not be subject to the new fuel surcharge if they are to be changed after 5 October.
Since 5 June 2018, a number of airlines, such as Air State, East China, Naval Navigation, Shanghai Aviation, Spring and Fall Aviation, Shenzhen Aviation, Western Aviation and Okai Aviation, have resumed charging fuel surcharges on domestic routes, which have been cancelled for three years, to the standard of $10 per person.
This time, the first increases in fuel surcharges were announced by Xiang Poon Aviation and Okai Aviation, and as far as journalists are concerned, no information has been received from the four major airlines in the country to follow up on the adjustments.
It is also understood that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department provides that airlines will be free to decide whether to charge a surcharge for fuel in November.
At the earliest, on 27 September, it was announced that the fuel surcharge would be recharged as of 2 November.
According to the Thai-Thai air website, all air tickets issued or reissued on or after 2 November will include fuel surcharges, long-distance flights to Hong Kong and the South-West Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, and to Africa, with fuel surcharges of $652 and short-distance flights of $146.
Costs apply to all types of tickets, are based on each segment and include quotations for air tickets from all direct distribution channels in Thailand.

The Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi attended the event.
On Friday, Ito Ito, Japan, recognized $1.3 billion in impairment losses on investment in China's Sino-Kin shares, and its largest business investment transaction was written off because of the effects of trade restrictions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man walked through the HQ.
According to Maru Hong, the United States grain sector, under the banner of the trade war, has suspended its financial transactions in agriculture.
Earlier, some Japanese manufacturers of heavy equipment, telecommunications companies, etc., had issued warnings about the impact of trade friction between the United States and China, and now these Japanese traders have joined the ranks.
The United States and China imposed customs duties on each other's hundreds of billions of dollars of commodities, and United States President Trump threatened to extend the tax to more than $500 billion in total Chinese-American merchandise if the dispute could not be resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Director of Commercial Finance of Ito, said that the impact of the trade dispute on the Chinese economy might be even greater next year.
Ito Trung and the Thai Bing Group invested $10 billion in Nakashin in 2015 to gain 20 per cent of their equity.
Hachimura alleges that Ito's shareholding stock was awarded a loss of 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) because it was assumed that the Chinese share price would not return in the near future.
Itokawa Commercial maintained a projection of profits for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2019 at 500 billion yen.
In July, China imposed a 25 per cent import tariff on soybeans from the United States to counter China's trade friction initiatives.
"Our grain business has been hit by trade friction between the US and China," says Maru Hung Finance Minister Yao Hiro.
He stated that he had stopped financial transactions in his own account since September.
In his statement on Friday, Gaeong spokesman Pat Burke stated that the company’s move was “in accordance with internal policy constraints and due to a lack of market opportunities”.
He also indicated that the suspension of financial transactions would not lead to a reduction in employment.
The estimated annual profitability of the two hundred and thirty billion yen remains unchanged and is supported by pulp and paper and power generation operations.
Friends Business announced a 16% increase in profits between April and September, emphasizing that “trade problems between the United States and China have led to uncertain prospects.”
On Friday, Mitsubishi Commercial moved the annual profit forecast up to record levels owing to increased coal coke production and higher prices for commodities such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Commercial has also announced a new business plan to increase the profitability of the fiscal year up to 31 March 2022 from the 640 billion yen estimated this year to 900 billion yen ($7.98 billion).
On November 5th, China-News Network reported that the mid-term election poll in the United States is in the countdown.
On 4 November, President Trump and his Democratic rivals actively “circumstanced” to their core constituents.
Both parties stated that voter turnout would be the key to shaping the election.
It was reported that in the 48 hours prior to the popular vote in the United States, Trump was busy attending a Republican campaign, while former President Obama went to Indiana to stand for the impending Democratic Federal Senate candidate, Joe Donnelly, and to shout out the final demands before the election.
On 4 November, Trump went to Megang, Georgia, to stand for Republican governorship candidate Brian Kemp, and said, “Tuesday you must be at the polling station, you must vote.”
“The contrast between this election cannot be made clearer.”
Voter political enthusiasm has risen to a rare peak, and early voting in some states has gone far beyond normal.
Successive Presidents of the United States faced the first midterm elections, and the number of parliamentary seats in his party tended to decrease.
According to a new poll published by the Washington Post and the American Broadcasting Corporation News Network (ABC News) on 4 September, while the Democratic Party's federal House of Representatives continues to have an advantage, Republicans can benefit from economic assessment and from Trump's strict interest in border security.
According to the polls, registered voters prefer the Democratic House of Representatives to Republicans, with a ratio of 50 per cent to 43 per cent, but there is still a decline from the 14 percentage points ahead in August.
Another poll by the National Broadcasting Corporation of the United States (NBC) and the Wall Street Journal also shows that Democrats still outnumber Republicans by 7 percentage points.
It is known that Obama, on the occasion of Senator Donnelly's campaign, said to the public: “When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, they will have bad consequences.
Democracy cannot work when people can only lie to themselves."
“The only way to stop these Republicans now is you and your vote.”
The Democratic Party faces the most difficult elections in the Senate for decades, and the Republican Party now holds more than half of the 51 seats.
However, the House of Representatives was more favourable, and the Democratic Party needed to win 23 more seats to take control of the House of Representatives, which had 435 seats.
According to the analysts of FiveThirtyEight.com, the Democratic Party’s chances of winning the House of Representatives are as high as 85%.
The National Political Consultative Conference held an important theoretical seminar for the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping on strengthening and improving the work of the Civil Affairs Association, which was attended by and addressed by Wang Yang.
From 29 to 30 June, the National Political Consultative Conference held an important theoretical seminar for the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping on strengthening and improving the work of the Association.
The Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Republic of China and the Chairman of the National Political Consultative Conference, Wang Yang, attended and addressed the meeting.
He stressed that the important ideas of Secretary-General Xi Jinping for strengthening and improving the work of the ACHD provided a clear picture of the role of ACHD, its objectives, its mission and its practical requirements, and that scientific answers to a number of key questions of a directional, holistic and strategic nature were a powerful intellectual weapon guiding the work of ACHD for the New Era.
It is important to follow through on this important idea, to grasp its significance, its content and its spiritual essence, to learn to do what is practical and practical, to promote the quality of the work of the Political Consultative Assembly by means of theoretical studies and intellectual weapons, and to take up the new mission of the New Era Civil Affairs Association.
From 29 to 30 September, the National Political Consultative Conference held a seminar in Beijing on the key conceptual and theoretical aspects of the work of the General Secretary of Xi Jinping to strengthen and improve the work of the Association.
Wang Yang noted that, since the Party's eighteenth birthday, General Secretary Xi Jinping has proposed a new set of ideas and ideas for strengthening and improving the work of the ACHD. For the first time, ACHD has been presented as an important channel and specialized consultative body for the negotiation of socialist democracy. It is an important part of the national governance system. It is the institutional arrangement with Chinese characteristics. For the first time, it has clarified the characteristics and advantages of the new political party system. It has emphasized the proper handling of the relationship between coherence and diversity. It has revealed the essence of the people's democracy in terms of good negotiation and consultation among the public. It has revealed the logical link between the “rule of China” and China's political system. It is the most recent product of the Party's civil affairs co-opportunism.
Wang stressed the need for PACs at all levels to use theoretical studies as an opportunity to further identify weaknesses and shortcomings in the work of the PACs and to work to strengthen and improve them and seek breakthroughs.
There is a need for a comprehensive strengthening of the PCC system to ensure that the deployment of the Party's central decision-making is fully integrated into the work of the PCC.
There is a need to strengthen intellectual and political leadership, to improve the system, procedures and mechanisms for political discourse and consensus-building, and to translate intellectual and political leadership into all aspects and processes of performance.
Focusing on the Centre's mandate to fulfil its responsibilities, to be more subordinated to the Service Party and the State, to improve the quality of governance and effectiveness in the performance of its functions.
It is important to strengthen the Council's capacity-building, to train its commissioners and cadres, to play a fundamental role in the Commission, and to strengthen the basis on which it can carry out its functions.
There is a need to strengthen guidance on the work of local political consultations, to direct, demonstrate and solve problems and to raise the overall level of their work.
In order to further study and implement the spirit of Xi Jinping’s socialist ideas and party XIX speciality of the Xi Jinping era, the National System of Political Consultative Associations began in May with an important intellectual study and discussion exercise by Xi Jinping’s General Secretary on the strengthening and improvement of the work of the Human Civil Affairs Association. Eight regional and seven expert academic seminars were held. Eighteen priority topics and six basic theoretical topics were identified. A total of 79.38 million members of the Political Consultative Committees and 279,000 officials at all levels participated in the study and discussion sessions, resulting in more than 36,000 research papers.
In the light of the current wave of “public entrepreneurship, innovation for all” on November 5th, People's Network Beijing, more and more science and technology companies are focusing on patent R & D and its associated protection, digging deep into the potential value of patents and gaining market dominance.
Similarly, there are a number of technology enterprises that have experienced significant abuses in the areas of proprietary technology licensing and the use of patented technology.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, Ho Changhong and Rabin, from Guangdong Province, applied to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court for patent infringement against the developer of the APP, Beijing Little Orange Technology Ltd. (hereinafter " Little Orange Technology " ), the operator drop-and-drop Technology Ltd. (hereinafter " drop-off " ), and the seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Ltd. (hereinafter " Guangdong Pacific " ).
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately cease the manufacture, sale, promise and use of the plaintiff's patent.
On October 30, 2018, the Chinese Network of Judicial Documents published “Civil decisions of first instance in disputes over patent infringement of inventions, such as Tan Wei, Ho Changhong and Beijing Little Orange Technology Ltd.”, revealing the details of some of the cases in which APP was prosecuted for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs argued that the patent owner and inventor of the “mobile terminal-based carpooling services system and methods” patent, and that the entire operation of the “roll-by-roll” APP application corresponded to the technical programme of patent protection in question, constituting a patent infringement.
However, at the time of the Court's decision, OrangeTech concluded that the Guangdong Pacific was not a proper defendant, that it had provided on the Internet only free downloads of the APP “drop-outs” involved, that the patent method in question had not been applied, that there was no direct or indirect violation and that it should not be classified as the defendant in the present case.
Secondly, the violations in this case were not committed in Guangdong.
In accordance with the law, the infringement of the patent in question was the place where the patent method was applied in its entirety, and the jurisdiction of the court was challenged, requesting that the case be referred to the court of the defendant's domicile, the Beijing Court of Intellectual Property.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, had supplied on its web platform an APP product charged with tort, and that it was not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, as the defendant.
The defendant, Guangdong Pacific, also resides in Guangzhou City and is under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant, Orange Technology, argued that the case should be referred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, on insufficient grounds, dismissing the defendant, Orange Technology Ltd.'s objection to the jurisdiction of the case and bearing the costs of the jurisdiction challenge.
Other proceedings in the case have not yet been made public, and journalists will follow closely the details of the patent infringement case.
Visit to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research: significant results of scientific and technical cooperation in Australia
“China’s science and technology has grown rapidly over the past decades, and the two countries of Australia and China, working together in the field of science, can achieve fruitful results.”
Larry Marshall, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research, in a recent interview with a Chinese News Agency journalist in Beijing, stated that cooperation in the field of science and technology in Australia has shown dynamism from climate change to SkyEye cooperation.
As the largest national scientific research agency in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has produced numerous innovative research findings of world interest in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
“This is a lasting friendship, a friendship that embraces trust in partners and a long tradition of cooperation.” Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-metre spherical radio telescope, China SkyEye, installed the first international 19-beam L-band receiver.
The 19-beam feed receiver, which is currently the most advanced in the world, has been developed jointly by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall indicated that the successful development of the receivers was based on the accumulation of technology by CSIRO over the years and that the speed of the FEST cruises would increase by five to six times as soon as it became operational, and that more scientific observation objectives would be expanded.
"This is a contribution of CSIRO to FAST."
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO is working closely with Chinese scientific institutions in the construction of square kilometres array radio telescopes, in the development of new fuel technologies and in the reduction of energy savings.
“In the past, scientific research has tended to focus on hundreds of years later, and now more scientific research is needed to solve the problems that lie ahead.”
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the area of scientific development, while both countries face a range of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather events are frequent worldwide, droughts and floods have led to reduced food production and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, problems such as population explosion, ageing and chronic diseases are also serious challenges.
“The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused primarily on solving these immediate difficulties.”
Marshall explained that the International Centre for the Study of the Southern Hemisphere, established by CSIRO in conjunction with the Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, focused on observing the El Niño phenomenon and the La Niña phenomenon, studying their relationship to extreme weather and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather; and that the new varieties of cereals to overcome extreme weather, developed by CSIRO in conjunction with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, could also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
“In the current environment, where science, technology and innovation are difficult to accomplish on their own, very costly, and the number of issues to be addressed, cooperation is particularly important today.”
Marshall stated that the closer the cooperation, the greater the likelihood of ground-breaking progress, was also important in the context of the “one-way” cooperation between Australia and China.
“Strengthening bilateral cooperation, mainly in science and technology, for us.”
For example, Marshall, CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide, and many countries hope to find a method of pure gold that is less polluting to the environment because of the environmental hazards of traditional cyanide gold purification.
“We are willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results of our participation in the ‘way-by-way’ cooperation.”
On 29th, in the city of Urumqi, Xinjiang, where Bony Chicken Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Collaboration was held, guests were able to appreciate the development of the Bony and also to appreciate the local cuisine and the weight of the local historical culture.
During the first month of the event, a series of high-density, large-scale tourism promotion campaigns were conducted in eight cities along the Silk Roads of Tian Shui, Cool, Lanzhou, Silverkawa, Sienin, Zhang Jing, Hami, etc., which provided a good basis for the successful launch of the 2018 Chicken Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Partnership Fair.
The mayor of the town of Bao-Chung in Shanxi Province introduced Huixin, who has a long history and a strong industrial base, as the second-largest city in Shaanxi Province and the sub-centre of the Guan Tian-Tian economic zone and the city complex of Guan-Puan, as well as an important node along the “One Way” initiative.
In recent years, the city has continued to upgrade its industrial clusters, logistics hubs, integrated services, open highlands and human cohesion to accelerate catch-up and high-quality development.
At the meeting, the Pony City Tourism Development Council and the Urumqi Tourism Authority signed two agreements on strategic cooperation in tourism.
At the same time, a number of Xinjiang travel agencies have signed agreements for cooperation in tourism with the Bo-Yuan River tourist area, the Famen Temple Buddhist cultural site, the Tai White Mountain tourist area and the Guan Shan savannah site.
“The Great American Xinjiang, where some of the tourism resources are complementary to the BPW, travels all the way to Xinjiang, with a focus on human chickens, delicious chickens, natural wind, etc., selects more than 500 photos to make customers feel the beauty of the BP chicken.”
Focusing on tourism resources, tourism projects, tourism routes, etc., the event featured a comprehensive promotion of the entire Pony Tourism image, a high-quality tourism product and an excellent tourism industry project, the consolidation of the Xinjiang Visitors' Market, a comprehensive singing of the brand “Look at China's Paw” and the promotion of the influence and visibility of the Pony City in the northwest, and the attraction of more Xinjiang visitors to the Pony Tourism Experience.
“In this event, various departments in the city, districts and development districts actively engaged in discussions and coordinated the implementation of a large number of good projects and major projects.
To date, 41 contracted projects have been implemented, involving a total of 26.43 billion yuan. "
In recent years, it has been working around the goal of building internationalized cities along the “one-way” initiative, equipping manufacturing cities, historical and cultural names, and beautiful and happy cities with decent living conditions, continuously upgrading industrial clusters, logistics hubs, integrated services, open highlands, human cohesion, and accelerating catch-up and high-quality development.
In 2017, total regional production amounted to RMB 218 billion, an increase of 8.7 per cent.
More than 20 national-level honours were awarded to civilized cities throughout the country, the National Ecoforestry City and the China Human Settlements Environment Award.
The Urumqi City Council's Standing Committee and Deputy Mayor Yan Namin described Urumqi's special geographical advantage as a major town on the Silk Road in the new North Province. Since ancient times, it has been a link between the north and the south of Tianshan, between Xinjiang and the interior, between China and Central Asia, Western Asia and Europe, and between China and Central Asia and Europe. It is an important window for opening up to the west and for cultural exchanges in the external economy, with a good investment climate.
The event, which focused on the manufacturing of equipment, logistics and commerce, and the tourism industry, was characterized by a great deal of complicity in the development of good opportunities and a great deal of mutual cooperation.
During the discussion, local customers from Xinjiang signed six projects for a total amount of RMB 3.250 billion with the Pony Districts.
On that day, foreign guests, such as representatives of the Kyrgyz visa service in Urumqi, the Russian neo-Siberian Law Company Limited, the Tajik Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Urumqi and the Russian Chamber of Commerce of Tatarstan, attended the discussion.
Some 500 members of the Urumqi Municipal Bureau of Recruitment, Commerce, Agriculture, Tourism, etc. and of enterprises and the media participated in the discussion.
The revitalization of the north-east is a matter of national development.
Industrial enterprises in the north-east are more important and better based, and in the north-east, catching innovation is about catching up and finding the future.
Will it be possible to re-energize the old industrial base, free it and hold the Secretary-General's heart?
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Lee Yong Ho, stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued imposition of sanctions was deepening North Korea's mistrust of the United States and that it was unlikely that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
According to Lee Yong Ho at the United Nations General Assembly, the DPRK has adopted a “very friendly approach” over the past year, including the cessation of missile and nuclear tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and a commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we didn't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
“There is no confidence in our national security if we do not trust the United States, in which case we cannot give up weapons unilaterally.”
Although Lee Yong-ho echoed North Korea's complaints about the United States' opposition to “phased” denuclearization, his statement was of great significance because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization altogether, as it had done in the past.
Lee Yong-ho referred to Kim Jong-un and Trump's joint statement of 12 June, when Kim Jong-un agreed to work towards “denuclearizing the Korean peninsula” and Trump pledged to protect North Korea's security.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has stated that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States also refused to relax its demand for international sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearizing first’ and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its objectives in a high-pressure manner, even refusing to issue the ‘Declaration on the End of War’,” Lee Yong-ho.
“The idea that sanctions can make us beg for forgiveness on our knees is that those who do not understand us are dreaming.
But the problem is that this continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Lee Yong-ho made no mention of the second Special Council plan referred to by the President of the United States earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he highlighted the three meetings between Kim Jong-un and Korean President Wang during the last five months, saying: “If the other side of denuclearization is Korea, not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not become so frozen.”
China announced a reduction in import duties for 1,585 tax purposes as of 1 November 2018.
Since the beginning of the year, China has taken successive initiatives to reduce import tariffs.
On 1 May of this year, there was a general tax reduction on medicines, with a total of 28 tariff items, including all generic and carcinogen anti-cancer drugs, as well as a total of 28 tax items, such as those containing effectively imported Chinese medicines, adjusted to zero.
At the same time, there has been a significant reduction in the value-added tax on the production and import of anti-cancer medicines.
On 1 July, there was a tax deduction for 218 tax purposes on automobiles and their parts and components.
As a result of the tax reduction, China's whole-car rate is below the average in developing countries and is in line with the real situation in the Chinese automobile industry.
This tax reduction will drive industrial restructuring and optimal resource allocation, accelerate success and underachievement, improve the quality of products and services, and are expected to contribute to some extent to the adjustment of automobile prices and increase the benefits to consumers.
On 1 July, there was a daily tax reduction on consumer goods for 1,449 tax purposes.
Tax deductions on consumer goods are closely linked to the needs of the people for a better life.
This tax reduction is not only large but also substantial, with an average of 56 per cent.
Tax cuts in consumer goods are directly benefiting consumers and contributing to the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On 1 November, a tax reduction will be imposed on industrial items such as mechanical and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials for 1585 tax purposes.
Appropriately reducing tariffs on imports of much-needed industrial goods in some parts of the country can attract more foreign investment, contribute to more efficient domestic supply and industrial upgrading, while helping enterprises to allocate resources on a global scale and reduce production costs, as well as reducing domestic pressure on the environment.
The relevant head of the Office of the Customs and Excise Commission of the State Council of China stated that the four above-mentioned autonomous tax reductions, as well as the third step, implemented on 1 July this year as a result of negotiations to expand the scope of the information technology agreement, would reduce China's total tariff level from 9.8 per cent in the previous year to 7.5 per cent.
The overall adjusted tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU and is lower than that of most developing countries and is at a moderate low level, largely in line with China's developing country status and stage of development.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that the overall level of tariffs, as one of the key indicators of China's openness in the area of trade in goods, should be adapted to the stage of China's economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China's trade in goods is the largest in the world and already has an open economic base for further expansion, but the quality and efficiency of trade development are not as good as that of developed economies, and therefore the overall level of tariffs should be reduced as appropriate.
Tariffs are a means of compliance protection, and they should be commensurate with industrial competitiveness, encourage benign competition, and overprotect against industrial development and quality improvement.
Tariff rate adjustments need to be balanced between production needs and consumption needs.
The focus is on reducing the tax rates on commodities that contribute to the upgrading of the industrial transformation, increasing the import of niche products where the needs of the population are more concentrated, increasing the sense of business and public access and meeting the upgrading needs of industrial and consumer structures.
Tax cuts need to balance fiscal revenues with the affordability of industrial development.
The choice of specific tax-reducing commodities and tax-reducing margins should be based on the harmonization of domestic and foreign markets, both upstream and downstream, and production and consumption, in order to maintain the momentum of China's steady and moderate economic growth.
The Officer-in-Charge stressed that this year marks the fortieth anniversary of the reform and opening of the country, and that China has taken the initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs in accordance with the major measures that China needs to achieve its own high-quality development. This is conducive to the integrated use of both international and foreign resources, promoting the improvement of the quality of the domestic supply system and meeting the needs of the population in terms of rising consumption.
These actions and initiatives demonstrate China's firm commitment to pursuing a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, its firm support for economic globalization, its commitment to the principles of free trade and the multilateral trading system, with the WTO as its core, and its continued efforts to draw momentum from openness to the world and to make its development more beneficial to the world.
The President of Serbia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo.
It quoted information from the Office of the President of Serbia that President Vučić of Serbia had ordered the maximum operational readiness of the country's armed forces in view of the occupation by the Kosovo Special Forces of the access to the water storage lake at the Gazivoda hydroelectric power station in northern Kosovo, which was controlled by Belgrade.
On 29 September, the Minister of Defence of Serbia, Wulin, declared that the Serbian army was in full operational readiness.
It was stressed that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as the orders issued by Vucic remained in force, and that the Army would respond regardless of the course of events.
According to TAS, on 29 September, Vucic stated in an interview that he had briefed the parties, including the United States and the European Union, on the current situation and would travel to Moscow on 2 October to meet with Russian President Putin and seek Putin's support on Kosovo.
When asked whether Serbia needed Russian military support like Syria, Vucic replied in the negative: “I do not want a major military conflict on our soil.”
Vucić also stated that the full operational readiness of the RSLA was intended to serve as a deterrent to prevent a conflict, but it was also a clear warning that no violence would be tolerated in Kosovo.
The increased operational readiness of the RSLA is linked to two major Kosovo-based initiatives.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days the ethnic Albanians in the northern part of Kosovo are engaged in mass arrests of Serbs who have been living there for generations and who have not violated any law.
Vucić claims that, since the beating and detention of Marko Juridge, head of the Serbian Government's office in Kosovo and Metohija, on 26 March this year, the Albanian community has escalated the situation in the region, carrying out inhuman arrests and expulsions of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the previously self-proclaimed ROSU Special Forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, armed police and snipers, occupied positions near the water storage lake at the Gazivoda hydroelectric station, entered the ecological and sports centre near the dam in the northern part of Kosovo and blocked all nearby roads, which were otherwise controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucić stated that this military adventure in Kosovo had been instigated by Western countries and that the actions of the Kosovo army had not been notified to the Serbian side in advance, in violation of chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, as well as Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the military-technical agreement between Serbia and Montenegro.
Vucic has already spoken to NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg, criticizing the hypocritical statements of Western countries on the question of Kosovo.
The root cause of the current conflict remains the centuries-old historical feud between the two communities in Kosovo.
With regard to Kosovo's attribution, the Serbian and Albanian communities differ.
Serbia views Kosovo as a national birthplace and a cradle of culture, as it established its most powerful State here in the 12th century, while ethnic Albanians moved in massively only after the Ottoman Empire invasion and the defeat of the Serbian army in the north.
The Albanians, for their part, maintained that the original tribe of Ilya, which lived in Kosovo in the fourth and fifth centuries B.C., was the ancestors of the Albanians and that Kosovo had been an Albanian territory since time immemorial.
Subjective political divisions have led to violent clashes among different ethnic, religious and cultural groups and have created a violent confrontation between the Serb and Albanian communities in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
In the wake of the First World War, a large number of ethnic Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, with a relative increase in the proportion of Serbs, who, in the view of the Serbs, “only take back their own land”, were perceived by the ethnic Albanians as plundered by “Greater Serbianism” and fuelled by bi-communal contradictions.
Kosovo became a “powder bucket” in the Balkans.
In 1999, an armed conflict between the Albanian separatists of the KLA and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro by NATO forces and the outbreak of the war in Kosovo.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its secession from Serbia.
Since then, despite reports that Serbia will normalize its relations with Kosovo and sign global and legally binding agreements, agreements that have been held hostage to various forces, such as the United States and the Russian Federation, have not been concluded owing to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints.
And just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he was advocating the separation of Serbs from Albanians in Kosovo and that he was once again open to contradictions between the two communities.
Electricity is still out of order, and the Indonesian earthquake has been accompanied by a lot of difficulties in responding to the tsunami.
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early hours of 30 September, a strong earthquake and tsunami in Dungara district, Central Sulawesi Province, in the country, resulted in 420 deaths.
According to the head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, Wilem Rampangilei, this figure is only a preliminary count of the city of Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi, about 80 kilometres from the epicentre of the earthquake, where many of the hotel, mall, warehouse, etc. damaged by the collapse of the earthquake have not yet been recovered owing to the lack of large search and rescue machines.
On 29 September 2018, local time, in Balo, Indonesia, a bridge damaged by an earthquake and tsunami collapsed in several sections.
As a result of the severe damage to electricity and communications facilities, the earthquake in Dungara district and the adjacent Sigi region remain unconnected “islands”, unable to account for the number of victims.
In this media report, Vice-President Kara of Indonesia reported the death toll of thousands of people.
Power cuts, communications disruptions, road blockages, airport damage...
As a result of the power cuts, some hospitals and rescue settlements in the city of Palu are dependent on fuel for electricity generation.
Roads into and out of the city were blocked by the landslides and the lack of access for large transport vehicles, including tanker trucks, straining the supply of fuel.
According to the Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs, Agus, emergency relief supplies, such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothing, food and household kits from South Sulawesi and Columbus provinces adjacent to the earthquake zone, have not yet arrived in the affected areas due to road damage.
Disaster relief materials transferred from the capital, Jakarta, are being transported to the affected areas by air transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to the Palu airport command tower and runway during the earthquake, and in order to ensure safety and security of relief, all commercial flights have been suspended for the purpose of landing and landing only military aircraft transporting relief supplies and personnel.
The Indonesian Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs in charge of relief in the earthquake zone, Wiranto, called for the prompt resumption of electricity supply and airport commercial flight services in order to ensure the functioning of relief agencies such as hospitals and to enable more relief workers and volunteers and aid supplies to reach the affected areas.
A series of strong earthquakes in Dungara district, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, triggered by a tsunami at 1702 hours, triggered by a 7.07-scale earthquake, caused major disasters in the cities of Palu, Dungara and Sigi.
In the recent past, Beijing has continued to open the most beautiful blue sky mode, bringing thousands of people to the social platform, showing happiness on the screen, saying, “In the blue sky, ‘intoxicated’ beautiful skyline is the best card in Beijing.”
Since August, Beijing has welcomed the "Blueest Sky".
Within the city, people can be seen and photographed at any time or place with a smart phone or a single anti-camera.
On social platforms like Weibo, Weibo Group of Friends, the palaces, Tiananmen, the nests, the alleys in the webcams are everywhere and the buildings display different beautys under the blue sky.
Some online users say that such a “windlight” is the best urban propaganda film in Beijing; others argue that if such a blue sky were brushed for a long time, people with cervical vertebrae could be cured; and even more, they hope that “the blue will spring through the winter and make the sky of the city blue over the seasons”.
Why does the people of the capital love the sky?
Only because people who lived in this city in the past suffered from the fog, and therefore longed for the blue sky, and after Beijing, when the “Blue Sky Defense War” was launched, the air quality continued to improve, the fog became less, the blue sky became more numerous, and the happiness that people saw in their eyes was particularly important.
On the Fourth of July, the weather was clear in Beijing.
At 8 a.m., the vast majority of the 35 air quality monitoring stations throughout the city were shown to be “first-class” green.
The "Blueest Sky" thematic photography competition on social networking platforms is still going on.
Why is it so blue in Beijing these days?
According to the Officer-in-Charge of the Beijing City Environmental Protection Agency, the average concentration of fine particles (PM2.5) in Beijing in August of this year was 35 ug/m3, the best ever recorded for the last five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 in September was even more frequent in places.
A major factor in the emergence of the “Blueest Sky” is the overall favourable weather conditions in recent times and, more importantly, the persistence of air pollution control in Beijing, the vigorous promotion of clean air action plans over the past five years and the continued release of environmental benefits, which have led to a reduction in the total discharge of pollutants in the region, have laid the foundation for a sustained improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially launched and implemented the Beijing City Action Plan on Clean Air 2013-2017 in 2013.
Under the plan, official efforts are continuously directed at defunctionalizing non-capital functions and promoting energy clean-up and pollution reduction, with a total of 4923 coal-fired boilers phased out.
As a result, Beijing has become the first large city in China to become a net gas-free city.
The data show that between 2013 and 2017 the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased cumulatively by 35.6 per cent; the number of air quality days was increased by 50 days; the number of first-class good days was increased by 25 days; and the number of days of heavy contamination was reduced by 35 days and the incidence of heavy contamination was significantly reduced.
At the same time as air quality continues to improve, Beijing officially released the Beijing Three-Year Plan of Action to Win the Blue Sky Defense in September, based on a new round of PM2.5 sources, focusing on the current phase of governance and pollution features, focusing on such priority areas as diesel trucks, dusting, volatile organic matter management, optimizing transport structures, industrial structures, energy structures and land use structures, strengthening regional alliances, strengthening city-level fine management, promoting green development across the board, and moving the “Blueest Sky” to the capital without being “precious” and turning it back into a background rather than a protagonist.
During the Golden Week of the National Day, the relevant departments, such as the Municipal Tourism Board, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the City Administration and the Public Security Department, will intensify their law enforcement checks on the “one-day” market, focusing on the “six-black” tourism scene, and, once found to be in violation of the law, will be subject to severe and cumulative penalties in accordance with the law.
Yesterday morning, the municipality held a special session on the subject of the illegal one-day tour and deployed a special operation to further the illegal one-day tour.
During the meeting, it was revealed that the focus on black votes, black guides, gangsters, black cars, black shops, black Internet interests were interwoven with “six blacks”, and that since 28 July the city had launched a special campaign against illegal “one-day trips”.
A total of 39 “one-day” complaints have been processed throughout the city, a decrease of 63 per cent over the same period; 270 “one-day” complaints have been processed throughout the city since this year, a decrease of 62 per cent over the same period.
Over the past two months, the city has seized 248 “black cars”, seized 158 cases of violations of tourist passenger operations, closed 29 shopping “black shops” and performance venues, seized 13 “black clubs” and 27 individuals, confiscated 26,000 illegal advertisements, removed 31 illegal “one-day” billboards and 3 public transport placards, investigated 1789 offences involving various travels, opened 181 cases with heavy fines of $4.480,000 and detained 111 persons involved in travel offences.
As a result of the correction, the illegal “one-day” chaos was largely contained, and the “one-day” market order was stable and positive.
In recent years, it has been reported that the city has been increasing its efforts to deal with illegal “one day” trips.
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission received 1612 and 897 complaints for “one day” — 79 per cent and 44 per cent less, respectively — but the illegal “one day” continued to bounce, often rebounding, and created a “six-blank” disorder, interwoven in the chain of interests, such as black ticketing, black-guiding, black-seller, black-seller, black-net, etc.
Specifically, illegal street tourists are “black votes”, illegal websites that publish false tourism information are “black nets”, travel agencies engaged in illegal “one-day trips” or agencies or individuals not qualified to operate travel agencies are “mafia”, “black guides” employed by “mafia” who do not have a licence or practice in violation of the law are “black guides”, vehicles that do not have the qualifications to travel, or vehicles that provide passenger services for illegal “one-day trips”, which are qualified travelers, or “black cars”, who eventually bring tourists into designated tourist shopping shops, or “black shops”.
During this special operation, the city has continued to increase the number of regular inspections and mobile patrols of illegal “one-day” trips. In response to the illegal “one-day” high-frequency and high-impact tourist route locations, the relevant authorities have sent daily undercover teams to carry out unannounced visits, and have found evidence of violations of the law, which are strictly investigated in accordance with the law.
Of these, “black cars” and “black shops” have been the focus of two campaigns.
It was reported that, without black cars, illegal “one-day trips” could not take place, and that black cars were easy to detect, remember and trace, as well as high-value fixed assets.
The authorities use road traffic monitors to increase the supervision of buses that travel on the “one-day” route, which is a priority, so as to detect “black cars” in a timely manner, using technological and intellectual means such as physical defence.
The “black shop” for tourist shopping has also become a strong focus owing to its small number and location.
In order to reinforce the deterrence and suppression of illegal “one-day” trips, any special operation that is found to be in violation of the law is subject to severe penalties imposed by the competent authorities in accordance with the law.
In August of this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues relating to the fight against illegal “one-day trips” to discuss measures to combine administrative sanctions with convictions.
The Municipal Tourism Council has indicated that more regular travel agencies will be encouraged in the future to carry out a “one-day tour” of Beijing and to increase the supply of a formal “one-day” to further crowd out the illegal “one-day” living space, and that specific programmes are currently under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Council has continued to refine the electronic travel order information system for tour missions to ensure that each team is included in the regulation of the electronic travel list platform.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economic symbol, what has U-town been through all these years?
As the permanent venue of the World Internet Congress, the town of Uttar Pradesh is receiving attention as to how to deliver the Summit dividend.
In the five years since the first World Internet Congress, changes have been visible in the town of Utun.
In 2014, there were only 12 businesses associated with the digital economy and the Internet throughout the town, and by the third quarter of this year there were more than 500 businesses.
This is a microcosm of the development of the digital economy in Utun.
The holding of the Internet Congress allowed local firms to accept the inspiration of the digital economy, the wave of digitization, the desire for business transformation and upgrading, and the investment and research and development of traditional manufacturing firms in machine-changers, smart management and so on.
The Secretary of the U Township Party, Kang Yong, said that U Town would build a new economic empowerment centre in the future.
The digital economy cannot be developed without the support of infrastructure.
This year, Uyghur launched a 5G pilot on the basis of full coverage of the 4G communications network and free WiFi.
At the same time, the city of Kiryu, where the town is located, has become a hot ground for the development of the Internet industry as the country's first county-level city to build dedicated access to international Internet data.
Since the first World Internet Congress, 565 digital economy projects have been introduced, with a total planned investment of 37.725 billion yuan, bringing the total value of the core manufacturing sector of the digital economy to 8.73 billion yuan in the first three quarters of the year, representing a 13 per cent increase in value added.
"Ou Town was a tourist symbol, followed by theatre and cultural symbols. Because of the Internet Congress, it has now become an Internet and a digital economic symbol."
In the view of the Secretary of the Qing City Council, the dividends of the World Internet Congress have accumulated over time, making it all the more necessary to set up a platform for bringing together the various elements of talent, projects, technology, etc.
Shen Yi has worked outside the country for 20 years and has returned home to start a business as a result of her association with the Internet Congress.
On 2 December last year, with his high-capacity anti-digital modification technology solution, he entered the fourth Internet Light Fair and was favoured by a number of clients.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in U-town not only because of her home country, but "In U-town, it's easier to attract people than I thought, and our applications are fast-tracked, and we have applications in U-jin's smart parking program."
The spill-over effect of the Internet Congress is reflected in a town hall road.
This road to the north and the south of the city is not only a series of tourist attractions but also an industrial road.
It was built upon and brought into being a conglomerate on the U.S. Boulevard.
Journalists have learned that, in the future, Uyghur Road will be the leading position in the development of the industrial sector in the city, leading the way in the extensive application of the fruits of smart medicine, intelligent old age, intelligent government and so on, bringing together industries and a large number of high-level talent, which account for 80 per cent of the city's GDP.
The tsunami caused by the earthquake in Indonesia has killed at least 410 people.
According to the head of the Public Information Bureau of the Indonesian police in Jakarta on the evening of 29, the current earthquake in Central Sulawesi has killed 410 people, 97 of whom have been identified.
A further 29 persons were missing and 540 injured.
Palu airport is still closed.
Active treatment, with 98% of premature births in China for 29 weeks or more, has reached the level of developed countries.
The National Children's Medical Center and the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Gangan revealed on 30 September that it had introduced advanced Canadian methods in the title “China NiCU pre-natal quality improvement project”.
The results of the project show that, after active treatment, 98 per cent of premature births have occurred in China over 29 weeks of age, reaching the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in early delivery without complications.
For almost 20 years, the Chinese Government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborn children.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has fallen to 3.71 per 1,000, significantly below the national average and at advanced levels in developed countries.
The “China NIOC Project for Pre-natal Quality Improvement of Pre-born Children in Hospital” has significantly improved the quality of survival of pre-born children through four years of tireless efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, Director of the Neonatal Care Unit (NICU) of the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Mudan, stated to journalists that, while increasing the survival rate of premature births, attention is being paid to reducing the quality of survival of premature births, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the overall outcome of neurodevelopment, and improving the overall survival and demographic quality of premature births, which is a major concern of the paediatric and neonatal communities, both at home and abroad, as well as of the project.
The “China NiCU Project for the Improvement of Premature Quality of Premature Births in Hospitals” has worked tirelessly for four years to include tens of thousands of premature births of 33 weeks of age and under, resulting in a reduction of one third in the country's mortality rate among young children of birth age and young birth weight, while the incidence of serious complications in premature births has declined significantly, significantly improving the quality of survival of premature births.
Through the establishment of the National Neonatal Quality Improvement Collaboration Network and the introduction of the concept of collaborative Quality Improvement, 25 collaborating hospitals across China have been irradiated, and a comprehensive, systematic and effective collaborative Quality Improvement methodology adapted to the national context has been established to improve pre-natal care and to improve the quality of care for newborn children.
The Paediatric Hospital, affiliated to the University, is working with the National Newborn Unit to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections, based on the project's experience, and to provide information and guidance for the regular diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in the “China Project for Prenatal Quality Improvement of Pregnancies of Pregnancies”, the Paediatric Hospital introduced the EPIQ methodology into 25 large NNICUs in 19 provinces of the country and is committed to resolving the problem of premature child infections in China's neonatal care units.
After more than a decade of continuous improvement, the survival rate of premature births in Canada has increased by about a third, and Canada is now one of the best countries in the world to expect premature births.
The EPIQ methodology has now been applied to all NIOCs across Canada and has been adopted in six countries.
According to the paediatric hospital, two years after EPIQ intervention, premature child infections fell by 35 per cent, while antibiotics were used by 20 per cent.
In the future, the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University will continue to promote and implement this approach throughout the country, with a view to reducing the incidence of all complications in premature births in general and improving the quality of care for newborns throughout the country.
At this time, it is true that there are differences and inequities in the level of care available in all regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important unit of the National Children's Medical Centre, the Paediatric Hospital will play a radiological role. The study will cover the western provinces of Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal care throughout the country.
It is understood that the Paediatric Hospital, affiliated with the University of Gangan, is working with the National Newborn Unit to develop guidelines for the treatment of neonatal infections based on the project's experience and to provide reference and guidance for the regular diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
In 2019, it was revealed that the focal point, the China Neonatal Collaboration Network, located at the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Gangan, would join 63 hospitals throughout the country in the next phase of national quality improvement, with a view to promoting the equalization of levels of neonatal care in China.
The Director of the Shanghai City Health and Planning Commission expressed alarm that Shanghai could become a central city in the centre of Asia, not only in terms of research, but also in terms of the development of the entire service system, and that the quality and results of services should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China's level of health care.
Episode: Build the “hero monument” in mind — written on the fifth anniversary of the martyr.
On 30 September, on the eve of the birth of the Republic's 69th birthday, the fifth Martyrs'Day was celebrated, and Xi's Equality Party and national leadership came to Tiananmen Square to attend a ceremony to honour the people's heroes.
At this very moment, wherever you are, please pay a warm tribute.
It's a day of rejuvenation, and it's a wake-up call.
The name of every martyr is a living life behind a long history.
They also have hot youth, true love, and family.
However, because of their conviction that “the doctrine of our faith is the truth of the universe”, they are willing to sacrifice everything they have in order to “freeze the suffering of the next generation”.
"I live one day and cry for China one day."
Through time and space, the British raised a spiritual sign and guided the way forward.
"Where to come from, where to go," "Do what kind of person," read English, and it's easy to come up with an answer.
It is important to remember the spirit and to build a “hero monument” in our hearts.
According to incomplete statistics, since the beginning of the revolutionary war, some 20 million martyrs have lost their lives to national independence, the liberation of the people and the country's prosperity.
For a variety of reasons, many of the pioneers did not even leave their names.
Countless blood pours on the ideals, lives on faith, remembers their names, and passes on their spirits to protect the roots and spirits of the nation.
This "hero monument" is not subject to any degradation or destruction.
For some time now, historical nihilism, general entertainment, etc., have flourished.
Practices that distort history, demean and challenge a just conscience, distort value judgements and provoke public outrage and alarm across society.
Strength cannot be desecrated, and heroes must not forget.
It cannot be allowed to touch the bottom line, but it must be dared to shine a sword and defend the high dignity with justice based on the rule of law.
On 1 May this year, the Heroed Martyrs Protection Act was officially implemented.
In terms of judicial practice, the verdicts in some cases have been very encouraging, both in the effective defence of the bright and bright image in accordance with the law and in the release of the positive energy of heroism and respect for the vanguard.
A people with aspirations cannot have heroes, a country with ideals cannot without vanguards.
The memory of the vanguard and the call for heroes has become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are millions of memorial facilities throughout the country and more than 100 million visits to Martyrs' Gardens each year.
The hearts and minds are the strongest cornerstones.
A “heroic monument” will stand between the heavens and the earth, deep in hearts and minds.
Reuters, 28 September – The EU took a non-confrontational position against Italy on Friday, following Italy’s surprise with its massive budget deficit plan, in defiance of the EU’s demands, but perhaps a more radical stance would have been taken if Italy had maintained too ambitious a goal.
The Italian skeptical government’s target of a budget deficit of 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) for the next three years suggests that debt has not been cut only in the face of demand for a reduction.
On Friday, the ECEC Executive Committee for Economic Affairs, Moscovisi, said, “We have no interest in the crisis between the EC and Italy,” and he responded cautiously because the EU’s recommendations and sanctions could have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will be able to convince Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy formally submits it to the EC in mid-October.
After the Government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in almost two weeks on Friday, while the rate of return on Italian bonds reached its highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remained unchanged by the October deadline, the ECEC might veto Italy's draft budget, something it had never done to any country.
At a later meeting in Riga, the capital of Latvia, on Friday, the EU EC Vice-President, said that Italy's current financial plan “does not appear to be in line with the Stability and Growth Pact”, referring to the EU financial regulations.
But he did not say how this would trigger a reaction from the EU.
Bidders may submit their applications to participate in this open tender by 26 October of this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture had identified China as one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
In May, the Russian Agricultural Supervisory Authority announced that, for the first time in the current agricultural year, Russian food exports to China exceeded 1 million tons, a record of innovation.
The Agency predicts that China may enter the top 10 Russian food-importing countries.
After Sapporo, on 30 September, after the first battle against Cuba at 3:0, the Chinese women's platoon won the Turkish team at 3:0 again on 30 September, winning two consecutive World Cups in 2018.
However, Chinese women are more vulnerable than they were during the first war.
A total of 24 teams participated in the 2018 VCs, and Chinese VCs were in Group B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
From the world ranking and overall strength of Team B, the Turkish and Italian teams are the main opponents of the Chinese team.
As soon as the game began, the Chinese team took the lead at the beginning of the game, maintaining the advantage throughout the process, placing considerable pressure on the opponent to take the first round at 25:18.
In the second round, the Turkish team, which was in a tough position, took the lead at 6:2; the Chinese team requested a pause, adjusted its formation to 7 evenly, and then stopped the net scores at 7:0; the Turkish team at the end of the bureau was at 15:19; the Chinese team was at 24:20, followed by a strong Turkish team at 2 points; and the Chinese team again requested a pause, drawing on Joting's running to win the second round at 25:23.
In the third round, the situation was very tenuous, with the two sides rising from one to the other, at a time having reached a level of 19 parity.
At a critical time, when the Turkish team made a mistake, the Chinese team took the lead at 21:19 and obtained the point at 24:21 with Ju Ting's heavy arrest and Zhang Changning's attack; then the Turkish team pursued the score to 23:24, and after the Chinese team requested a pause, Zhang Chang Ning hit the score, and the Chinese team targeted the winner at 25:23.
After Pingsai, China's female platoon leader, told the truth, the whole game was not easy.
“We are better prepared, we are better off, the Turkish team is more sophisticated, and we must reduce our mistakes and strive to win through our own initiative.”
In the face of her familiar teammates, Jo Ting, who worked for the Turkish Vakivo Bank team, was subjected to a lot of restrictions in the first round of the competition that day, and she continued her aggressive offensive after her initiative to change.
“The enemy is familiar with each other, and it is normal for them to be watched, but the Chinese team is extremely active, blocking the net and attacking in a bad way.”
The Chinese women's platoon will then hold a truce for physical and technical training on World War I; on 2 October, they will meet the third rival Canadian team.
On the 30th of September, the China-China Network Water Balance (Cui Zhiping Wang Peng) held a ceremony to focus on projects during the second half of 2018 in the Hebei High Water Zone.
On that day, six projects were concentrated, with a total investment of RMB 4.29 billion.
On that day, the Deputy Mayor, Yang Shikun, the Standing Committee of the Water and Sanitation Committee, announced the commencement of work.
According to Mr. Yao, Director of the Hebei High Council for the Management of the New District, the six projects that have been launched today, with a total investment of $4.29 billion, are industrial projects, ranging from the upgrading of traditional industries to the introduction of new industries, covering such sectors as civil-military integration, cloud factories, food, medicine, chemicals, etc., with high technological content, high industrial level and high value added.
It is believed that the construction and commissioning of these projects will give a strong impetus to the early achievement of the goal of “building hundreds of billions of industrial parks and creating national high-rises”.
The project began with the announcement of the Deputy Mayor, Yang Shikun, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Water and Sanitation Committee.
Happily Yao said that the region had successfully launched a series of major events, such as the China-China International Life Science Summit and the Great Health Industry Development Forum, the Chinese Academy of Sciences High-end Equipment Industry Summit, and the 2018-Hyeongjin “By-Synchronous” Innovation Forum, which had led to the development of three strategic and emerging industries: new materials energy, health, and high-end equipment.
The Central American stem cell project will be officially operational by the end of the year.
The mid-level pilot base of the entire Chinese science-based project began construction on the country's premier, the world's largest megawatt supercritical carbon dioxide compressor experimental platform.
The state-of-the-art super-counting centres, which are among the top 10 in the world, have been re-established in the provinces and cities.
At the end of the year, Yao Happiness indicated that the region would complete Phase 2 of the Science and Technology Valley Project, which is 240,000 square metres of digital information, new energy materials, three research and development bases and a demonstration centre.
The “upgrade” of the Chinese Academy+ innovation model will be actively developed, and a “one platform for the two chambers” will be built to facilitate the integration of scientific and technological innovations through multidisciplinary, multi-unit collaboration and multi-industry integration.
Nearly a thousand state-owned areas have reduced the price of tickets by more than half by more than 20 per cent.
[Summary] As of 28 September, 981 sites have been declared free of charge or price reduction measures (74 free of charge or 907), including Yunnan Shilin, Dalian IIIta, Yulong Snow Mountain, Guangxi Quilin River, Fujian Wumao Mountain, Hunan Zhang Ji family border, Xiangxi army Machi, Jiang Qingshan, Xinjiang Kanas, and Xinjiang Kanas.
In follow-up to the Central Economic Work Conference and the deployment of the Government's report on its work, on 28 June the National Development Reform Commission issued the Guidance for Improving the System of Prices of Tickets in State-owned Areas (hereinafter referred to as the Guidance) to Reduce Prices of Tickets in Priority State-owned Areas (hereinafter referred to as the Guidance), which calls for the improvement of the mechanisms for the formation of gate tickets in State-owned areas in terms of a rational definition of the cost composition of gate price pricing, innovative price management, and strict compliance with pricing procedures, to ensure that by the end of September the price of tickets in high State-owned areas is reduced with tangible results.
Active efforts have been made to meet deployment requirements, resulting in successive reductions in the price of tickets for key State-owned sites.
As of 28 September, 981 sites (74 free of charge and 907 at a reduced price) have been declared free of charge or price reduction measures in place or issued to the public. Of these, 159 are in 5A and 534 in 4A, for a total of 693, or 70.6 per cent.
Of the 907 landscape areas with reduced prices, 491, or 54.3 per cent, fell by more than 20 per cent and 214, or 23.6 per cent, fell by more than 30 per cent.
The provinces of Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi and Shaanxi have a higher number of price zones, of which Yunnan has more than 100, with an overall decrease of more than 30 per cent.
The Government of the eight provinces (districts, municipalities) has set a total price reduction of 5A-class sites, including Anhui, Chongqing and others.
The high level of social interest in Yunnan Ishi Lam, Dalian Santa and Yu Long Snow Mountain, as well as the Guangxi Guiling River, Fujimei Mt. Fujian, Hunanji Zhang family border, Xianxi soldiers, Jiangxi Sanshan and Xinjiang Karnas sites, have introduced price reductions.
The gradual return of the prices of tickets to priority State-owned sites to reasonable areas has contributed to the acceleration of the tourism sector's transition from a ticket economy to an industrial economy, to tourism for the general population, to tourism for the destination, and to the development of a virtuous circle of optimal tourism supply structures and steadily expanding demand for tourism consumption, as well as to the sustained and healthy development of the tourist sector and the tourism industry.
At the same time, the National Development Reform Commission has emphasized the need to strengthen price-order norms in the landscape areas, to guide them in upgrading their services and to ensure that they do not fall.
In addition, the National Development Reform Commission has carried out special inspections of recent media reports on the low and apparent decline in the prices of tickets in individual areas, requiring serious local responses to social concerns in a timely manner and the effective implementation of price reductions.
The Trade and Development Board has an orderly approach to short-, medium- and long-term optimization
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Agency has submitted short-, medium- and long-term optimization reports on “Major Investment Migrants” and “Technology Migrants” and has been continuously listening to society and optimizing the content and related work, in addition to stepping up and implementing the work in the report.
The Trade and Development Bureau will brief all sectors of society as soon as possible on relevant optimization efforts.
Of these, five were short-term measures undertaken during the year; five were medium-term measures implemented in 2019; and one was long-term.
In addition, the Trade Promotion Bureau has been instructed by the Director of the Department of Economics and Finance, Liang Witt, to undertake a comprehensive review of the internal management system.
The five short-term measures undertaken during the year include:
1. Carry out a review process. Priority is given to cases that are due to expire at the end of the seven-year period, to those referred to in the ICAC report, and to those that have been renewed. If there are indications of irregularities or violations of the law, they will be referred to the relevant judicial authorities on their own initiative for follow-up;
Field visits to projects involving “major investment migrants”. By late September, more than 20 investment projects had been visited;
3. A comprehensive review of the current system of evaluation. Six principles for the analysis of investment projects have been re-established in the evaluation of applications for “major investment migrants”; the approval mechanism will be improved in the evaluation of applications for “skilled migrants” by identifying elements conducive to the development of the country and giving priority to the recruitment of people. A list of “ten jobs in the five sectors” has been drawn up on an annual basis to give priority to the introduction of talent, in line with the HKSAR Government's policy direction, in order to better target the recruitment of talent;
4. Increased transparency of information, including the planned gradual publication of approval guidelines, rating criteria and weights, and further refinement and public approval of data, starting in the fourth quarter of this year;
5. In terms of refining the work of the confirmation mechanism, prior confirmation of the status of work in Australia has been requested; significant investments must be verified on site and financial statements submitted.
The five medium-term measures implemented in 2019 include:
1. Establishment of a mechanism to hear the views of the Commission on Human Development and the Economic Development Commission on a regular basis, including a working session with the Economic Development Commission in September to discuss the establishment of the mechanism.
2. Requires the applicant to submit annually financial statements made by an independent third party to keep the operation of the investment project under review;
3. Further standardization and electronicization of the process for the application and approval of individual cases in order to reduce human error;
4. To conduct a comprehensive review of the current staffing situation in order to complement the implementation of a number of optimization measures;
5. To intensify the study on the revision of the Temporary Residence System for Investors, Managers and Specially Qualified Technicians.
As for the long-term measures, the study of the law was intensified, and it was expected that the drafting of the legislation would be completed in the first half of 2019, with a view to finalizing as soon as possible the criteria for granting temporary residence permits, the review mechanism and the confirmation mechanism, and the investigation function of the Trade and Promotion Bureau would be expanded to allow for more precise processing and supervision of applications for temporary residence permits.
The national experts in the field-based observation and exchange of seminars and workshops in the cotton-free zone entered the test field to hear a presentation by a representative of the Chinese Engineering Institute team, Shirosan.
The Chinese Xinjiang Shaya power station on September 30th, is located in Xinjiang Shaya County, where the membrane cotton growers are “no less” than the membrane cotton next to them, and a white cotton race is “open”, full of branches.
From 27 to 28 September, a national on-site observation and discussion exchange on filmless cotton was held in Xinjiang Shaya district.
During the videoconference, journalists learned that the immeasurable cotton technology system, which is dominated by the “Chinese cotton 619” and its accompanying cultivation measures, has initially achieved the goal of demapification of cotton fields, has reduced the contamination of the ecological environment and raw cotton by the Xinjiang cotton patches, and has made significant progress in research and demonstration of the membrane cotton complex.
The Chinese Academy of Engineering, the famous cotton genetic breeder and the chief scientist of the cotton system of the National System of Modern Agro-Industrial Industries (SINTAM) have given a presentation on the development of membrane cotton to the Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Agro-Lin University School Party, Zhou National Model.
“The combination of membrane cotton technologies that we have developed can fully achieve non-dural cotton cultivation, and can completely solve the problem of membrane contamination and achieve green cotton planting.”
The Chinese Academy of Engineering has a quick introduction.
Xinjiang, the most important cotton-producing area in China, accounted for 61 per cent of the country's cotton area in 2017, according to the National Statistics Office.
Since the introduction of the membrane in China in 1982, Xinjiang has had over 50 million acres of crop cover of all types and approximately 300,000 tons of membrane use annually.
Of these, cotton membrane coverage reached 100 per cent, and cotton-field membrane accounted for about 60 per cent of the use of the membrane in Xinjiang.
Membrane cotton is measured and can produce 320 to 350 kg acre.
As the amount of Xinjiang membrane inputs increases, the residual membrane recovery rate is low, the amount of film residues in the soil is gradually increasing, and a range of problems, such as the structural destruction of the soil caused by the membranes, seriously affect sustainable agricultural development.
The membranes not only cause significant contamination of the soil but also have a significant impact on the quality of cotton fibres.
Currently, more than a third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang are mechanized.
In 2017, Xinjiang had an area of approximately 14 million acres of cotton.
During the mechanical cotton harvesting process, a large amount of membrane on the surface and on cotton strains was collected, which was mixed in the original cotton and difficult to remove during the processing of the original cotton, as well as during subsequent textile processing, which severely affected the quality of textile products.
On 28 September, a national on-site observation and discussion exchange on filmless cotton was held in Xinjiang Shaya district.
In an effort to address the problem of cotton land contamination, simplify cotton-planting techniques and improve cotton-field efficiency, Hispanic led his team over a period of eight years to implement the “Chinese cotton 619” membrane-free cotton cultivation, “building the wings” for green agricultural development in Xinjiang.
A metaphoric introduction to the development of new ideas through innovative breeding has led to the development of a very early, salt-resistant, low-temperature, high-yielding system of cotton on land, known as the “Medium 619”.
“The ‘Chinese cotton 619’ achieved a series of accompanying measures, such as mechanical support for membrane seeding, improved depth of seeding, shallow burial of drip tubes under membrane conditions, suitable screening of seed density, and sound chemical regulation, in the southern part of Xinjiang under filmless conditions.”
Demonstration bases for membrane cotton have been established in Aksu, Kurle and Alar, among others, at a production rate of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Cropping cotton without membrane achieved high yields, savings, environmental protection and combined efficiency gains.
Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinghai Agronomy) stated that through nearly six years of research and demonstration on the technique of membrane cotton cultivation, an acre production of between 320 and 350 kg could be fully achieved, possibly even higher.
“There are great prospects for the diffusion of membrane cotton cultivation techniques.”
Zhang Jinghai believes that the current technology of membrane cotton cultivation can solve the problem of soil permeable membrane contamination once and for all, but that there is still a gap between the economic benefits of membrane cultivation and those of membrane cultivation.
“Affirmation of the purchase price of cotton will be conducive to future diffusion.”
He and his team will continue to carry out in-depth studies and wide-scale extension applications of the membrane cotton industry as the next step in addressing the soil pollution caused by the membrane.
Guangdong Sea, Land and Air is actively responding to the Golden Week shipment - China New Network
On 29 September, the seventh day of official traffic in the Hong Kong section of Gao, and the first weekend following the opening, the insiders of the West Kowloon Station were hoisted.
The holiday of the Golden Week (1-7 October) will be observed every day, and journalists have learned from the relevant authorities that the various transport sectors, such as the Guangdong Railway, Aviation, Naval Transport and Roads, are actively planning to increase their capacity to deliver and put in place safeguards to ensure the safe and orderly movement of passengers within the country during the Golden Week.
According to China Railways Guangzhou Bureau Group Limited (hereinafter referred to as “Huang Iron Group”) during the Golden Week of the National Day this year, Guangqiang is expected to transport 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 155,000 compared to the previous year, an increase of 9.2 per cent.
In order to meet the travel needs of passengers, the Guangqun Group plans to drive 104 additional high-speed trains and 85 additional high-speed trains, mainly on hot-gate lines such as Kinguang, Jiakun, Guangdong and Hang High-rises.
Guangzhou Bai Yun Airport, which will be the busiest airport in the interior during the Golden Week of the National Day this year, is expected to receive more than 1.4 million passengers and to fly more than 9,200 flights.
With the increasing number of international routes, the airport is expected to see a significant increase in international passengers compared to the past, which will be a significant feature of the Golden Week holiday this year.
Singapore, Bangkok, Phuket, Jakarta, Colombo, Maldives, Manila, etc., are known to be the hottest cities for this year's national holiday, while the hot spots of Kathmandu, Kuala Lumpur, Bali, etc., have also continued to explode, with some flights “on short notice”.
Some airlines have increased their operations in particular, for example: Shenzhen Air has added one more flight per day from Guangzhou to Hanoi; Iran Mahan Air has added one flight per week from Guangzhou to Tehran; Viet Nam Air has added one flight per week from Guangzhou to Hanoi on Tuesday and four additional flights per week.
In order to ensure leave security, White Cloud Airport has increased priority job security such as “space allocation” “bag security” “on-call service” “passenger security” and is prepared for extensive delays in the disposal of flights.
According to China’s Southern Airlines, this year’s golden week’s flight to the areas of Ausimaa, North America and Japan is very hot, while flights to tourist destinations in China’s interior such as Hainan, Chengdu, Chenzhou, Xiaohua Mountains, Rim Mountain and Yellow Mountain are also relatively tight.
During the Golden Week of the South China Shipping Plan, there were 50 additional flights, including 10 on the Guangzhou to Chiang Mai route.
According to the Guangdong Maritime Agency, prior to the festival, serious security risk checks were carried out on priority vessels such as the water cruise ship, the June Strait passenger ferry, the Pearl River Express high-speed passenger ship and the ferry ferry, in order to ensure the stability of the safety of the water traffic during the extended vacation period.
During the Golden Week, traffic in Guangdong Province is expected to be at the top of the Chinese list.
The Guangdong Transport Group recently issued a guide to the holiday highway, which is expected to increase by about 12 per cent.
The Directorate-General of Market Supervision has recently issued a circular on the strengthening of market price regulation during the Mid-Autumn Year 2018, which calls for the strengthening of price regulation in the area of housing rental and real estate, the tightening of rent collusiveness, the hoarding of rental sources, the fabrication of false information to raise rents, the excessive charging of fees in the form of tied services, the publication of misleading price information, and price irregularities such as unknown codes.
The circular made it clear that early warning of price monitoring should be strengthened and market price developments closely monitored.
There is a need to pay close attention to basic necessities such as meat and meat consumption, egg cream and milk, as well as to market and price changes for special commodities consumed by the local population on holiday, and to strengthen price monitoring and early warning analysis.
Measures to address market volatility effectively and in a timely manner will be taken once the tendentious and predisposing nature of market volatility is identified.
There is a need to strengthen the monitoring and inspection of the wholesale and retail distribution of essential goods, to increase the frequency and supervision of places that are closely linked to the daily consumption of the population, such as supermarkets and agro-trade markets, and to urge operators to operate in good faith in compliance with the law.
The circular stated that there was a need to strengthen the focus area inspections and create a favourable consumer environment; to strengthen the regulation of the price of tickets in State-owned areas; to focus on violations such as non-compliance with government-mandated price levels or fluctuations; the unauthorized addition of fee lines; the increase in the price of tickets by means of irregularities such as the installation of tickets in “campus parks”; high price discounts; tied sales; non-compliance with prescribed specifications; the non-implementation of preferential measures; price additions; and the imposition of surcharges.
The circular requires enhanced regulation of the price of essential goods, particularly agricultural products.
The prices of essential agricultural products, such as vegetables and pork, have fluctuated in some regions in the recent past, as a result of seasonal variations, natural disasters and outbreaks.
Locally, the regulation of the prices of agricultural by-products markets needs to be strengthened in a manner that takes into account local realities, while the relevant sectors take on the task of stabilizing production and market supply, and organize efforts to carry out market-focused and random inspections.
Increased scrutiny of commodities such as pig meat, which is in short supply and has higher prices, and serious investigation of offences such as the hoarding of quirks, price hikes and collusive price hikes.
The circular noted the need to strengthen price regulation in the areas of housing rental and real estate.
In Mid-Autumn and the National Day, which coincides with the high rates of rental housing and sale of goods, it is important to pay close attention to the price behaviour of real estate enterprises, intermediaries and housing rental-related enterprises. It is necessary to strictly regulate rental price collusiveness, hoarding of rental sources, fabricating false information to raise rents, randomly charging fees by binding services, issuing misleading price information, price tags, etc., and to increase the scrutiny of price labels in hot-selling buildings and real estate intermediaries, and to detect consumer interests, such as the failure to comply with the requirement of a “one-point set”, the disruption of market order, the cleaning of the real estate market environment, and the creation of an open and transparent price order in the real estate market.
The circular referred to the need to ensure effective price regulation in other parts of the tourism industry, to regulate the price order in catering, accommodation, shopping, sightseeing, entertainment and parking, to guide operators in their biding and billing efforts, and to seriously investigate price violations of all kinds.
The circular stated that the inspection of transport prices, such as roads, railways, civil aviation and water transport, should be intensified and that violations such as price increases, extra-price charges and non-fixed pricing should be seriously investigated.
Implementation of a “green corridor” for the transport of fresh agricultural products and a policy of free toll-free minibuses on major holidays.
Innovative regulatory instruments and methods of work are needed to strengthen the dissemination of price laws and regulations for off-line retail businesses and e-commerce platforms, to urge operators to improve their price promotion programmes and to investigate, in accordance with the law, offences such as false original prices, misleading price indications and non-compliance with price commitments.
On 1 January, the journalist was informed that, on the fifteenth anniversary of the full passage of the Hong Kong train, three lifts had taken place and that the flow of passengers had so far been increasing; the cumulative total number of passengers travelling to and from the port had reached 1.7 million.
At the same time, Hong Kong and Australasia passenger clearances do not exceed 15 seconds.
On 1 October 2003, the State Council approved the establishment of a temporary crossing between Shanghai and Kowloon direct train, the first direct long-distance rail passenger crossing to Hong Kong in China, marking the opening of a “three-wing” overland port in Shanghai.
To date, the Hong Kong train has been in operation for 15 years.
One day after the Shanghai Railway border check, which was tasked with the border check of the port's entry and exit, it was revealed that, from the start of the operation to the present day, there had been three lifts in the port's train, which had been reduced from almost 30 hours to 19 hours one-way; that the annual average number of passengers transported in and out of the country had increased from less than 80,000 to more than 150,000; and that, over the past 15 years, the total number of passengers transported to and from the port had cumulatively broken 1.7 million.
Over the past 15 years, it has been reported that police coordination mechanisms have been established between the Shanghai Railway border crossing point and the station along the nine trains, and police officers have been assigned on-the-road supervision, providing full coverage of 1991 km of services and control.
Over the past 15 years, the Shanghai Railway Border Post has detected nearly a thousand cases of violations of the law, and has succeeded in detecting cases of illegal entry of foreigners with false permits and the use of other persons'documents as a substitute for departures.
The station has also established mechanisms such as working exchanges with the Joint Inspection Unit, conducted regular training exercises for the Integrated Counter-Terrorism Service at railway ports, and worked with the joint defence unit to construct a third-tier protection belt at the roundabout rail crossings.
Over the past 15 years, it is known that the Shanghai Railway Border Department has continued to innovate in its services and that the pace of customs clearance has increased significantly.
The border post has also set up a volunteer service group called “Tyran” to provide loving assistance to the elderly, pregnant women and travellers with babies.
On 30 June, journalists learned from the Ministry of Finance that the Ministries of Finance, the State Tax Administration, the National Development Reform Commission and the Commerce Department had issued a joint circular in recent days to further encourage foreign investors to invest in China, allocating profits to foreign investors from residential enterprises in China for the purpose of withholding the application of a pre-tax policy on domestic direct investment, and expanding from foreign investment incentives to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and areas.
This policy has been in effect since 1 January 2018.
The circular makes it clear that direct investment by offshore investors with a share of profits, including recapitalization by offshore investors with a share of profits, new construction, equity acquisition, etc., does not include additions to eligible strategic investments, conversions, acquisitions of shares in listed companies.
Expatriate investors who are provided with a policy of withholding income tax but are not actually entitled to it may apply for the recovery of the policy within three years from the date of actual payment of the relevant tax, in return for the tax paid.
Moreover, foreign investors who, after enjoying a prescribed policy of withholding income tax payments, are subject to special reorganization requirements in the event of a reorganization of an investment enterprise and are actually taxed in accordance with a special policy of restructuring, may continue to enjoy a policy of withholding income taxes.
In order to ensure that profits earned by offshore investors are actually used for direct investment, the circular provides that the profits of offshore investors for direct investment are paid in cash, that the money in question is transferred directly from the account of the profit distribution enterprise to the account of the invested enterprise or of the transferring equity, that it is not permitted to swing in other accounts within or outside the country prior to direct investment; that the profits of offshore investors for direct investment are paid in non-cash form, such as in kind, marketable securities, and that ownership of the assets in question is transferred directly from the profit distribution enterprise to the investing enterprise or the transferring of equity, and that no other enterprise or individual is allowed to hold or hold on a temporary basis prior to direct investment.
The circular also requires the tax authorities to strengthen their follow-up management in accordance with the law.
Expatriate investors who have been granted a policy of withholding advance income tax are deemed to have failed to file corporate income tax as required, except in the case of corporate liability for profit distribution, as verified by the follow-up management of the tax administration, and will be liable for delay in tax collection in accordance with the law from the date of payment of the relevant profit.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States stated on Friday that it would no longer allow the import of raw materials produced by the Chinese Chinese pharmaceutical industry and the formulations made from the company's raw materials.
A drug previously produced by the Chinese pharmaceutical industry was recalled for containing possible carcinogens.
The European Medical Authority (the European Medicines Agency) indicated that further action was under consideration with regard to the other components of the plant's production.
FDA states that major production process problems were identified during FDA's inspection of the pharmaceutical plant in the China Sea Pharmacy industry and that imports were subsequently stopped.
FDA also states that imports will be banned until the Chinese pharmaceutical industry discovers how these impurities are produced and improves its quality control system.
On September 29, the Chinese pharmaceutical industry published a statement on its website stating: “The company is taking positive and vigorous steps to correct the problems of this official inspection in Europe and the United States, and it is very surprised and sorry for the way in which the official United States and Europe handled it and for the results.
This is a concern of companies in the current complex market environment.
At present, companies are organizing teams, including professional lawyers, to communicate and file complaints in accordance with the relevant procedures and with United States and European Union officials in order to resume production as soon as possible.”
Reuters September 29, Shanghai - The CSRC announced on Friday evening that the CSRC had approved the initial application (IPO) of China People's Insurance Group Inc. on that day, in accordance with the procedure established by law.
However, the CVM's official Twitter account does not disclose the extent of this IPO fund-raising campaign.
Chinese security (1339.HK) applied to the CSRC as early as 29 September last year to issue up to 4,599 million shares of A units, which are scheduled to be placed on the market.

Ex-Foreign Aid charged with playing a fake ball, North Control responding "No Need" - New Network in Central.
Yesterday afternoon, the Beijing Holdings Football Club (hereinafter referred to as North) provided an official response to allegations by the former team of foreign aid workers, Anechbe, alleging that the team was suspected of playing a false ball. North Control issued a statement stating that there was absolutely no such thing as playing a false ball on the part of the club, which was entirely a fabrication made by Anichebe himself in the course of the arbitration, in order to cover up the fact that he was in flagrant violation of the contract, and for his own improper economic purposes.
At the same time, the North Control said that it would reserve the right to be held accountable by all means.
According to the Daily Post in the United Kingdom, Nigerian player Ani Chebe accused FIFA of being suspected of playing false football by the Beijing North control team that he had been in force last year, including Beijing Deby in the 21st round of the 2017 season.
It was the critical stage of Beijing and the rush, and the game of North control ended with a zero-to-two negative on the Beijingers and the first stage of Anitcheby.
There was an official response from the North Control Club yesterday to the Nigerian player's account.
The statement stated that, following an internal investigation prior to the club, there had been no false play in the games in which the team had participated.
Anichebe joined Beijing North in June 2017, and in December of the same year, Anichebe refused to join the team for winter training without any justification and refused to do so despite numerous reminders from the club.
The dispute between the parties has now been referred to FIFA and arbitration is ongoing.
It was also mentioned that the high-profile “false ball charge” was in fact a fabrication made by Anichebe in the course of the arbitration in order to cover up the fact that he was in flagrant violation of the contractual agreement and for his personal and unjust economic purposes.
Its sole purpose of defaming clubs and Chinese football is to obtain unjust economic benefits.
Clubs are less open to any organization or any individual who, for the sake of their economic interests and personal grievance, engages in baseless accusations, slanders, slanders and slanders against clubs.
The Northern Controls therefore indicated that they would reserve the right to hold the parties to account by all means.
The Bank for Agricultural Development of China will invest 20 billion yuan to support the Chilin Qiu food acquisition.
Since September, crop harvests have continued to peak in various parts of Jilin province.
Journalists have learned from the Jilin provincial branch of the China Agricultural Development Bank that agricultural loans are now fully available in the amount of $20 billion to ensure that sufficient funds are available for food purchases in Jilin.
This year, it is known that the food production situation in Jilin has been generally stable, with some food processing enterprises increasing their capacity and the start-up rate and increasing demand for food markets.
In order to ensure the availability of funds for food policy acquisition, agricultural issuances have actively engaged the Autumn Food Acquisitions Bank meeting through visits to various buyers such as farmers, processing enterprises, trading enterprises, etc.
At present, 5.2 billion yuan has been invested in agricultural distribution to support the acquisition of 1.58 billion pounds of autumn grain by various food buyers.
One hundred and twenty major food buyers have set up nearly 300 acquisition networks in Jilin province to ensure “full coverage” in the main food-producing districts, without leaving the acquisition funds available as “blank points”.
According to the head of the farm issuer, in accordance with the progress of the acquisition and the demand for money from the enterprise, in the event of a shortage of funds for the acquisition, the farm issue will apply for an additional $20 billion in credit funds to ensure that the funds are available in full and on time, to preserve the stability of the food market and to protect the interests of farmers.
Chinese journalists will be taken away by the police in the year of the British Conservative Party. China asks for an apology.
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, the spokesman for the Embassy in the United Kingdom answered the questions of a Chinese journalist who had been taken away by the police during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party on the first day.
He called on the Human Rights Committee of the Conservative Party to cease its interference in China's internal affairs, to cease its involvement in Hong Kong and to ask the organizers of the Conference to apologize to Chinese journalists.
A journalist asked that on 30 September, during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party, the party's Human Rights Committee held a side event on Hong Kong and invited the Hong Kong opposition to take the floor.
During the meeting, a Chinese journalist was taken away by the police.
Do you have any comments?
In response, he said that in the 21 years since Hong Kong had returned to its homeland, the practice of “one country, two systems” had achieved great success, and Hong Kong's development achievements had been universally recognized.
Hong Kong is Hong Kong, China, and Hong Kong affairs are purely internal to China.
The Human Rights Committee of the Conservative Party used the party's annual meeting to organize a side event to raise awareness of the anti-China separatist forces, and China expressed serious concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We firmly reject any interference by any organization in Hong Kong affairs in any way.
Any attempt or action to promote “the independence of Hong Kong” is futile.
It was totally unacceptable, according to the speaker, that freedom of expression had always been cited in the United Kingdom, but that Chinese journalists, when asking questions at the side meeting to express their views, had been subjected to widespread obstruction and even physical abuse.
We demand that the Human Rights Committee of the Conservative Party cease its interference in the internal affairs of China, cease its involvement in Hong Kong, and that the organizers of the Conference apologize to Chinese journalists.

For the first time, the third World Internet Congress released 15 leading scientific and technological outcomes.
The results demonstrated were dynamic, widely applied and radiation-driven, reflecting the latest and most important breakthroughs in science and technology in the area of the Internet at that time, reflecting the pace of developments and future prospects in the area of web-based information.
The results of the Fourth World Conference on the Internet were even more spectacular in light quantum computers, 5Gs, artificial intelligence capable of calculating emotions, and so forth.
The Convening Committee of the General Assembly has set up a Committee to recommend the world's leading scientific and technological achievements on the Internet, composed of 44 eminent experts from 10 countries, including China and the United States, and has gathered nearly 1,000 innovations in the field of the Internet from around the world, resulting in the evaluation of 18 representative outcomes, including the “Way for 3 GPP 5G pre-commercial system” and “Arm security architecture” and “Microsoft Ice” and “Beidou Satellite Navigation System” based on “significant applications of supercomputer systems based on the Light of the Greatness of Lake Tea”.
Currently, the Beidou satellite navigation system applications cover more than 50 countries and territories and involve more than 3 billion people.
The Great Lakes Light supercomputer completed more than 2 million operations and supported more than 100 applications.
Starting from China, Microsoft Little Ice, pioneered by Microsoft China’s research and development team, is now in China, Japan, the United States, India, Indonesia, and many other countries, acting as television anchors, radio anchors, singers, etc. China’s Internet science and technology development has often flashed the world’s scientific and technological frontier, attracting the world’s surprises, and has become a confluence of the world’s top technology and a signpostor for the world’s Internet.
New platform for technology exchange at the Internet Light Expo
As one of the key elements of the World Internet Congress, the Internet Light Expo, which drives the interactive exchange of global Internet science, technology and innovation outcomes, provides an important platform for Internet enterprises to demonstrate the latest results.
The Internet Light Expo showcases new Internet outcomes, new technologies, new applications and features on a global scale, with different thematic displays and functional panels that select globally recognized Internet enterprises and innovative enterprises according to different technology classifications, bringing together cutting-edge results and demonstrating innovative technologies that reflect the civilizational light of Internet communication, the light of the future and the light of the world.
Taking the example of the Fourth World Internet Congress “The Light of the Internet”, the Expo attracted 411 well-known firms from across the globe, both domestic and foreign, with products covering recent achievements in global Internet technology and applied innovations, such as cloud computing, physical networking, artificial intelligence, and digital economic development, highlighting the characteristics of global vision, innovation-driven and open cooperation.
More than 110 new technology launches for new products and 10 thematic interfaces for Internet project cooperation were organized during the Conference, providing a broad arena for global digital economic cooperation.
A paper-based test paper, scanned by a mobile phone or tablet computer, immediately identifies content and converts to points; half a metre of unmanned cars carry goods, which can be delivered quickly independently; smart homes can achieve voice shopping, cellular charge, take-out, music, with the owner's voice instructions alone. The “Light of the Internet” fair highlights the best Internet scientific and technological achievements and has become a signpost for global scientific and technological industry and Internet development, creating a new platform for national exchange of recent results.
Developments in Internet science and technology for the benefit of all peoples
Innovative developments driven by Internet technology are ultimately aimed at creating a better future for the peoples of the world and a more equitable, open and inclusive environment for human well-being, economic development and social well-being.
In a large Internet country such as China, which has a large user base, Internet technology has a stronger amplification effect on specific applications.
In China, for example, Beidou provides high-precision, reliable positioning, speed measurement and timing services to users, combined with a unique short-letter communication capability; the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, which has a reshaping function for traditional industries, promotes industrial progress and plays a positive role in many areas, such as finance, transport, health and safety; and communications technology between the sky and the ground effectively solves the problem of access to transport, such as aircraft and high iron, and improves users'access to the Internet.
According to the forty-second Statistical Report on the Development of the Internet in China, published by the China Internet Information Centre, China, as the largest Internet market in the world, is promoting social development progress through a digital process.
The dividends of the technological development of the Internet were by no means limited to China, and its results had provided a powerful driving force for the development of the Internet throughout the world and for the development of the economy and society.
For example, China's cross-border power suppliers and shared economies are moving abroad and increasingly supporting world economic growth; China's development of new generations of information technology, such as cloud computing, big data, physical networking, mobile Internet, has accelerated the deepening of the global division of labour and economic restructuring, and has reshaped the pattern of global economic competition.
As outlined in the Omega Initiative, launched by the Second World Internet Congress, the sharing of web-based development results, leading to the early formation of a global network market and the creation of more jobs, will provide a strong support for the sustained healthy development of the global economy, with more countries and people on the fast track of the information age.

The Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking on Friday in the United States Foreign Relations Committee, stated that China-United States relations are now once again at a crossroads, and that if both sides look at each other positively, deepen positive cooperation and manage differences properly, they can open up better prospects.
“Chinese-American relations are our common asset and need our solidarity.”
He expressed the hope that all sectors of the two countries would be well informed in order to maintain the healthy and stable development of relations between China and the United States and to work together to move forward in the right direction.
Wang Ying also stressed once again that China must move out of a path of development that is different from that of the traditional Powers.
This Chinese-characteristic path determines that China will not and will not be in the same position as the United States. It also determines that China will not become the United States, will not challenge the United States, and will not replace the United States.
In his speech entitled " Opportunities or Challenges, Partners or Counteractors ", Wang Yi said that the deep problem at hand was that some American friends believed that China would be strong and powerful and would even challenge and replace the United States as a leader in the world.
“This is clearly a major strategic miscalculation.”
He claimed, however, that this perceived suspicion was spreading, magnifying existing contradictions, creating new doubts and making it more difficult and resistant to solving specific problems between China and the United States.
Wang Yi noted that China is following a path of peaceful development.
Chinese have never had the genes for external expansion.
We believe that nations can live together in harmony and mutual understanding.
In the past, the present and the future, China would neither replicate the foreign model nor ask others to replicate its practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with former United States Secretary of State Kissinger in New York, he said that US-China cooperation would win, and confrontation would lose both.
China has always been committed to the development of long-term healthy and stable relations between China and the United States and to achieving non-conflict, non-confrontational, respectful and cooperative win-win relations.
China's new office held a press conference on Tuesday to present and interpret the White Paper on the Facts and Position of China and the United States of America on Economic and Trade Frictions.

According to external sources, several cities along the coast were severely damaged by a tsunami that hit Sulawesi, Indonesia, on 28 September, and the number of people killed has recently increased to 1,200.
It was reported that the town of Donggala (Donggala), near Pulu in the aftermath of the earthquake, was hit by two waves of tsunamis and that the authorities believed that the number of people killed would continue to rise as the “72 hours of gold” of relief passed.
On 30 September 2018, local time, in Palu, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, relief workers carried a survivor of the earthquake who had been rescued from the ruins of the restaurant.
According to officials of the relief services, the tsunami caused waves of up to six metres and the impact of the earthquake and tsunami was greater than originally estimated.
At the time of the earthquake and tsunami, hundreds of people were known to be celebrating festivals on the beaches of Palu, many of them killed by waves.
Officials said that the tsunami had hit the shore at 800 kilometres an hour and that many buildings and infrastructure had been destroyed.
He said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed and that the tsunami-induced mudslides had cut off one of the main roads in Palu.
A large bridge across coastal rivers collapsed in Sulawesi.
On 30 September, local time, President Zoko of Indonesia visited the city of Central Sulawesi Palu, where the earthquake occurred.
In a visit to the affected areas on 30 September, Indonesian President Zorko stated that he had sent troops to assist in the search and rescue and called for the patientness of the victims.
According to Zorko, rescue operations were difficult owing to the shortage of heavy machinery and personnel.
He was informed of the lack of water, food and fuel supplies in many of the affected areas, as well as the closure of a number of businesses after the earthquake and the dispatch of aircraft.
He called on the victims to be patient and to remain in their original positions pending relief.
Search and rescue personnel in the city of Palou said they heard a call for help from a fallen hotel in the city, but they were helpless because no heavy machine had moved the rubble and some needed to do so with their own hands.
According to Vice-President Kara of Indonesia, electricity and communications were cut off in some areas, resulting in poor access to information, and the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami could eventually rise to thousands.

Between January and October of this year, the Liaoning Court received 297438 enforcement cases, an increase of 13.28 per cent over the same period; 22,6558 cases, an increase of 83.18 per cent over the same period; and 31,236 million yuan, an increase of 74.94 per cent over the same period.
“Where can I take a taxi?
We want to go to Golden Purple Square to watch the flag-raising ceremony of the Fourth of July!"
On the morning of 1 October, Mr. and Mrs. Song, who took a flight from Ningxia to Shenzhen and took the first train on the high-speed railway train in Hong Kong, visited a Chinese news agency reporter at Kowloon West station in Hong Kong.
On the morning of 1 October, in celebration of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region held a ceremony to raise the flag of the People's Republic of China.
According to immigration control statistics, as of 30 September, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via Kowloon Kowloon Station in Gao Tie had exceeded 300,000.
On the occasion of the 69th anniversary of the birth of the motherland, the West Kowloon Border Post is expected to see a peak in visitor arrivals on 1 and 2 October.
At 7 a.m., the press arrived in Hong Kong in the morning, and many Mainland passengers took advantage of the Golden Week on the occasion of the National Day to take a trip to Hong Kong.
Mrs. Song, who took a short step, told the press that the holidays for the National Day were a rare and long holiday of the year, and that she was particularly pleased and excited to be able to meet her wish to raise the flag at Golden Purple Square in Hong Kong.
However, at the moment, Ningxia's flights to and from Hong Kong were not easy, so that he could travel through the Hong Kong section of High Steel. Mr. Song, after checking the schedule of the train, found that the first bus would arrive at 7.03 a.m. to connect the city's transportation to Golden Purple Square, just in time.
He lamented with the reporter: "It's so convenient, it's fast and it's on time!"
The daily 70-hour short-haul train to and from Guangzhou, Shenzhen North and Fukuda and West Kowloon has greatly facilitated the arrival of residents of the Austa Bay region in Hong Kong.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, is on his way to Hong Kong to meet his friends at the top of the Central Ribbon.
Mr. Liu said, “The Mainland and Hong Kong are off on the Fourth of July, and we're going to challenge ourselves to see if we can make the 50-km Hong Kong route!”
He explained that they would not have been able to easily try such long-distance mountain movements if they had not been open, easily accessible and with sufficient time.
Mrs. Yang, from Dong-jung, took her 10-year-old son to Hong Kong on a piano race, and proudly told journalists that his son had spent three years on the National Day in this way.
She's been on a bus in Hong Kong, but she's time-consuming, and she's worried about affecting her son's condition. She's been in Shenzhen this time, with half her customs clearances, half her hours, and the Hong Kong section of her journey is even more impressive. She says to reporters: “It's like she's on a subway, especially fast, and I haven't had time to take a picture!”
On 23 September, at 6.44 p.m., the G5711 "Harm" high train left from Shenzhen North Station for a fast journey. A few minutes later, the train entered the Hong Kong section of the Hong Kong high-speed train, the first such train to be officially operated in Hong Kong.
The high-iron Hong Kong section, which is integrated into the country's 25,000-km high-iron network and extends to 38 long-distance stations throughout the country, also welcomes passengers from the interior of different provinces in the north-south of the country.
Mr. Gao, who came to visit his family from Changsha, told the press that he had been happy to have lunch with his children at home when he had been able to travel to Shenzhenbei, to travel by subway to Hong Kong, and then to transfer transportation within the city, in exchange for trouble and time, and now to go straight to the Kowloon Centre.
He said that the “two-by-one” customs clearance process was exceedingly convenient, “in less than 10 minutes, both have passed.”
The West Kowloon station, which is close to the airport fast line and links land and air traffic, has also become the preferred location for a large number of transit passengers.
Ms. Wu from Fujian is going to spend the Golden Week with her friends from Hong Kong to the Philippines, pushing her luggage out of the gate at Kowloon West, saying to reporters: “I didn't expect to catch the plane so soon. Time is more than enough!”
According to the TTA subsidiary arrangements announced on Monday, the new US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain the ability of United States President Trump to implement a 25 per cent tariff escalation threat on imported cars, while at the same time providing for a general exemption from customs duties on passenger vehicles, pickups and car parts imported from Canada and Mexico.
If Trump imposes so-called “chapter 232” tariffs on cars for reasons of national security, Mexico and Canada will have a vehicle quota of 2.6 million tax-exempt vehicles per year exported to the United States.
Piccards produced in both countries would be fully exempt from customs duties under subsidiary arrangements.
If the Trumpuga tariff were imposed, Mexico would receive an exemption from the tax on car parts of $108 billion per year, and Canada would receive a quota of $32.4 billion.
Both quotas are well above the current levels of production in both countries and provide room for growth in exports from both countries.
According to Reuters/Mexico, 28 September - Friday, Mexico, after several days of controversy, the Government of United States President Trump and Canada are making real efforts to resolve trade policy differences, giving the hope that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will be maintained in the form of a tripartite agreement.
Despite the lack of detail, the above evident progress is sufficient to prompt the Governments of Mexico and the United States to abruptly suspend their plans to publish the text of the trade agreement between the two sides and to give Canada more time to accede to the agreement.
Mexico's President-designate, Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador, stated to journalists in Mexico that the United States Government had made new counter-proposals to the Government of Canada and that he would continue to press for the participation of all three countries in NAFTA.
The Minister of Economy of Mexico, Ildefonso Guajardo, stated that the submission of the text of the inter-American and inter-American trade agreement to Mexican and United States legislation had been delayed because of “very serious” attempts by the Governments of Canada and the United States to reach an agreement.
Guaharto says, “In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a text of a tripartite agreement or whether we have to publish it.”
Guahardo stated that his United States and Canadian counterparts had “specially requested” that the text be postponed.
The spokesperson for the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the US-Medical Trade Agreement and the consultations between the United States and Canada.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada did not respond to requests for comments on counter-proposals.
According to external sources, in a care centre on the outskirts of Pretoria, South Africa's capital, two small lions play together, and it is difficult to see any anomalies, but they are nothing else.
The University of Pretoria declared: “This is the first young lion ever born by artificial insemination - the first pair of lions in the world.”
School scientists are working on the reproductive system of female African lions.
The Director of the Mammal Institute of the University of Pretoria, Gans Winter, stated that the two young lions, one male and one female, born on 25 August, were healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally reached that breakthrough.
When Ganswint was interviewed by the media, he said: “We collect sperm from a healthy lion.”
The researchers then perform artificial insemination when the hormone content of the female is appropriate.
Ganswinter said: "Lucky, the result was successful."
He said that the researchers “had several attempts, but unexpectedly did not spend much effort”.
He said that the above-mentioned research breakthroughs could be replicated and that scientists wanted to use the technology to save large and endangered cats.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), lions are extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of wild lions that survive has fallen sharply by 43 per cent in the last 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
The African lion is classified by this organization as a vulnerable animal.
Gans Winter said, "If we don't do something for these animals, they'll be extinct."
He stated that the new technology did not have to allow lions to be raised, but simply injected sperm into a pregnant female lion, as had been done in North America and Europe for elephants.
South Korea's exports declined the most in September in the past two years, but analysts attributed the decline to fewer working days and stated that global demand for Korean commodities remained strong despite rising trade tensions in the United States and Central America.
Indeed, South Korea's average exports increased on a daily basis last month.
In addition, the earlier published opening data showed double-digit growth in exports in the first weeks of September prior to extended leave.
South Korea's exports in September fell by the largest on a year-on-year basis since July 2016, a decline greater than the 5.7 per cent projected by 11 Reuters analysts.
The opening values released on Monday showed exports of $50.6 billion in September, down from $51.2 billion in August.
South Korea’s exports to China grew by 7.8 per cent in September, expanding for the first 23 months in a row, despite fears that a growing trade dispute between the United States and China could cause other export-dependent China’s neighbours to suffer as well.
South Korean exports to the United States declined by 11.8 per cent, owing to a decline in sales of petroleum products.
The overseas sales of Korean memory chips and petroleum products grew by 28.3 and 13.5 per cent, respectively, despite market concerns that the so-called “supercycle” of chips might have peaked.
“The effects of the trade conflict will, however, be difficult to avoid, as Korean exports depend heavily on the markets of the United States and China.”
Imports declined by between 2.1 per cent and $40.8 billion, compared with the 3.1 per cent increase projected by the Reuters Survey.
The trade surplus in September began at $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
According to the Ministry of Industry, thanks to the United States and the European Union countries, the global manufacturing industry will continue to flourish, which is a favourable factor for Korean exports.
The statement states that “Increased export prices resulting from higher oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year.”
“However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with increased market volatility following the rise in interest rates in the United States, is a negative pressure on exports.”
Exports increased from an average of $2.6 billion per working day in September to $2.1 billion in August.
Korea's mid-autumn season fell from 24 to 26 September this year, leaving 19.5 working days in September, four days less than in the same period last year.
Korea's exports grew 4.7 per cent in January-September compared to the same period last year.
According to the Japanese menstruation/Market purchasing manager index, manufacturing activity in Korea rebounded in September, but was supported by domestic orders because of the decline in orders from China and Japan, which threatened to cast a shadow over export prospects.
North Korean media criticizes the US for not relaxing sanctions against the DPRK.
The DPRK Labour News published an op-ed article in its 30 September Journal criticizing the United States for seeking dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea while not relaxing sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, calling it a “compromise” approach.
The article stated that United States Secretary of State Pompeyo 14 had stated that “the key to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is the implementation of sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea”, stressing that the United States position remains unchanged in its continued implementation of United Nations sanctions resolutions.
In the Singapore-United States joint statement, the two sides committed themselves to a new relationship between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States, commensurate with the aspirations of the two peoples to peace and prosperity.
There is no doubt that it is contradictory for the United States to increase the pressure on sanctions and to call for dialogue.
The article says that if new relations between the DPRK and the United States are to be established, a peaceful regime permanently consolidated on the Korean peninsula is to be constructed and a complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is to be achieved, confidence-building should be at the forefront, starting with what can be done, with a phased solution, one by one.
The article also stated that the United States should understand that the sanctions would not work for the DPRK.
The article says that even the "North Devinsk" before the "Kasan" makes the U.S. military admire it.
The National Interest magazine quotes the American Navy: “We will meet a powerful potential opponent. Just look at the North Devinsk submarine.”
The current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, Fogo, also praised the "North Devinsk" submarine.
He said, “This submarine is impressive. Looking at the development of the Russian navy and how its resources are used, the main effort in research and development is to strengthen the submarine fleet.”
However, the National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this area.
Forgo said, “I believe that Western countries still have asymmetrical advantages.”
Previously, there had been reports that the Russian Navy would be loading the Kazan submarine in 2019.
The Kazan, Nueva Siberia, Krasnoyarsk, and Arhangarsk multi-purpose submarines are “white wax trees-M” modified with 13,800 tons of drainage, depth depth of 520 metres, personnel strength of 64 and underwater speed of 31 knots, and will carry torpedoes, torpedoes and “calibre” and “gauge” cruise missiles.
On 29 September, the General Directorate of Radio and Telecommunications issued a circular on the introduction of a special programme for radio and television advertising, which has been under way since that date until the end of the year.
The reform included advertisements for low content, style and taste, and medical feeding programmes that were broadcast without a record management.
According to the circular, the focus of this special programme is on nine areas.
These include: advertisements with directional problems; advertisements with poor content, tone and taste; advertisements with excessive time and non-standard broadcasting problems; advertisements with exaggerated false propaganda, misleading audiences, or advertising with distorted programming, such as medical, pharmaceutical, medical devices, health-care foods, cosmetics, beauty, etc.; medical feeding programmes with unrecorded broadcasting problems; advertisements with exaggerated false publicity, misleading audiences, inducements to the audience as a result of deceit, investment finance, collections, etc., with expectations of return on investment; advertisements with incentives to create undesirable behaviour or to create undesirable values that harm the physical and mental health of minors; advertisements with long-term, frequent and non-required requirements for public service announcements; poor advertising management systems, review of irregularities and responsibilities; advertising with other irregularities.
This process will cover all parts of the country, and will ensure that the requirements of regulation and regulation are fully implemented at all levels of the wide media, frequency of channels, programme columns and time slots, “no blind areas, no dead spots, no exceptions”.
The circular requires that the various types of unlawful advertising found in the supervision and inspection be dealt with by the public authorities at all levels of the radio and television broadcasting service, in strict accordance with the General Directorate's Code on the Treatment of Infringements by Radio and Television Broadcasters.
Serious violations are dealt with seriously by means of exhortation, notification of criticism, suspension of the broadcast of advertisements until the broadcast of the frequency channel and, where appropriate, public exposure to society.
In recent years, the General Directorate of Electricity and Electricity has repeatedly called for the closure of illegal advertisements.
This year, the Directorate-General of National Radio and Television issued a circular publicly calling for the closure of advertisements for serious irregularities such as “0 bubbles of fruit milk”, “Sava cocktails” and “Bonret plant prophylactic disclosure”, and exaggerating propaganda and misleading audiences.
The General Directorate of Radio and Telecommunications has developed a number of regulations and circulars to regulate advertising on radio and television.
The Circular on the Further Enhancement of the Administration of Advertising of Television Shopping Video Channels stipulates that television Shopping Shorts are not permitted to be aired from 1800 to 2400 hours per day.
Advertisements of television shopping spots are broadcast at other times without the use of moderators, “sale-style” exaggerations, tone, movement, etc., or “orthopaedics”, “plastics”, “peasu-lips”, “fat-rolling” or disguised advertising of breast-rich and dietary products, with no more than one (twice) television shopping spots per hour per day and no more than three minutes per article.
The Circular on the Further Enhancement of the Management of Broadcasting of Radio and Television Advertising stipulates that television stations must comply strictly with the General Directorate's Order No. 61 when advertising in the middle of a film and television drama: two commercial advertisements may be inserted in each episode of a non-gold hour (45 minutes) for a period not exceeding 1 minute and 30 seconds each; one commercial in each concentration of a gold hour (1900 to 2100 hours) for a period not exceeding 1 minute; the advertisement shall be advertised for a period not exceeding 1 minute.
The circular also stipulates that radio and television broadcasters must strictly examine the qualifications, certifications, etc. of health information advertisements, such as medical, pharmaceutical, medical devices and health-care foods, and firmly prohibit the broadcasting of sex-related advertisements.
In order to regulate the advertising of health information, it is not possible to advertise in a different form as a health information feature.
Health information features should focus on scientific knowledge of disease prevention, control and treatment. They should not contain advertising on medical treatment, medicines, medical devices, health-care foods, or evidence on behalf of patients and doctors, pharmacists, specialists, etc.
Mantourov said, “We have adjusted the format of the MAKS International aerospace salon for the first time. We suggest that China be the host country. China’s peers have agreed and accepted our invitation.”
Not long ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the fourth Eastern Economic Forum at the invitation of Russian President Putin.
This was his first time attending the Forum.
Disregard the American threat!
EU or Iran to enter into a crude oil procurement agreement
The United States Government had recently announced that a new round of sanctions against Iran would resume in November and had even urged other countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil.
However, the allies of the United States do not seem to listen.
According to the United States New York Times, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed during his visit on 29 September that Tehran was approaching an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil, despite the United States threat to impose sanctions on any country doing business with Iran.
The central purpose of the agreement was to attempt to create a new payment mechanism that would replace transactions in the United States dollar by bartering or denominated in local currency.
The purpose of this approach is to hope to bypass the United States and to prevent the United States from blocking financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is committed to the promotion of the agreement, some French and British officials are concerned that, if it were to materialize, it would be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States against the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement.
According to the media, Zarif's words sound more optimistic during an hour of interviews than in recent months.
Because of its ability to “severe” the traditional allies of the United States, the agreement effectively breaks down attempts by the United States to cut Iranian revenues.
“This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit from it”, Zarif argues that countries have a legitimate right to trade with Iran, as agreed in 2015.
The European Union’s foreign policy head, Federica Mogherini, also said before, “No sovereign state or organization can accept anyone else to decide who it can trade with.”
However, she also predicted that, before the next sanctions were imposed by the United States Government in November, United States leaders might resort to a range of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries with which they had business dealings in Tehran.
In May this year, the United States Government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement on the grounds that the agreement was flawed and stated that the agreement could not permanently prohibit the production of nuclear fuel by Iran.
The United States subsequently threatened to prohibit companies buying Iranian oil and other commodities from operating in the United States.
This threat led to the withdrawal of some companies from Tehran and a sharp fall in the Iranian currency.
Companies such as Airbus and the French oil giant Dadal have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have stated that the United States Government may “take the upper hand”.
If not, according to a recent Turkish media report, the sanctions imposed by the United States do not appear to have had a significant impact on Iran's oil exports.
The Iranian oil minister, Xangane, had recently revealed that no country other than South Korea had stopped purchasing Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani believe that a series of United States actions are intended to “entice” Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also concerned about a series of verbal attacks on the American side, and when asked whether the US would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing fiscal pressure, Zarif even laughed, “It is a strategy of regime change, and that is the real purpose of the US.”
The launch of the Cultural Tourism Market of the Xiamen Hurley Artillery Artillery Station.
In that year, the first broadcaster to broadcast Mandarin on Fujian front radio station, Chen Fei, came to the gun station to remember the history of the gun.
The well-known tourist attraction area, the Xiamen Huri Artillery Battery Zone, which is separate from the Golden Gate, was once the home of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for the establishment of a “front-line radio station”.
On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the opening of the Front Line Radio station, on 30th of the day, the scenery organized a “Swat Radio Memorial” event in which several historical witnesses from the Front Line were invited to speak about the historical evolution of the station and to witness the evolution of cross-Straits relations.
Testimony of the history of the frontline radio station in that year told the history of the cannons.
This is one of the activities of the second series of “Market of Cultural Tourism at the Xiamen Huri Artillery Artillery”, which was built with great vigour in the Houri Mountain View Area.
This was preceded by a successful first event to create a unique cultural tourism brand that combines cultural tourism IPs, creative market fairs and traditional folk culture experiences.
On that day, under the direction of the Xiamen City Brigade Development Committee, the second edition of the cultural tourism fair, “Ancient Arteries of the New Age”, hosted by the Xiamen Hurley Artillery Zone, was officially inaugurated. During the six-day event, the main theme of the event was the Mid-Autumn and the National Days “Celebration of Joys”, where people who came to the tour had a multidimensional experience of the South during the “Eats” and “Shows” and “Buys”.
The “Hearing the Voice of the Sea” concert has become a major feature of the Artillery Cultural Tourism Fair.
Wang Yong, Director-General of the Huri Artillery Artillery Authority, described the event of the “Running Radio Monument” in commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the launch of the front radio station of the Huri Artillery Artillery of the Liberation Army, which invited a number of old radio broadcasters from that same year to tell about the history of the gunpowder and to remind people of the past.
In addition to this series of events, the 40th Anniversary of the Reform of the Opening of the Tourism Markets concerts, the old photo screenings, and the Grand Monument of Monopoly Devices on both sides of the Straits of 2018.
Among them, the “Hearing the Voice of the Sea” concert, which was a major feature of the cultural tourism fair at the gunpoint, was the exclusive cultural branding of the scenery, which invited the Xiamen City Young People's Palace Phoenix Girls' Choir to contribute to the concert of the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening of the ancient cannons in the Ishan Sea, showing the convergence of the ancient cannons with the New Age.
A large public service exhibition of single-body artistic devices on both sides of the border was held during the National Day in the Battery Zone, focusing on creating a “eye effect” that attracts a large number of tourists, citizens to visit, photos, rings of friends, shoots of tremors, and allows Xiamen to add a “net red” factor to the city.
And "The Xiamen 40 years of you and me" -- the old photo selection, the award-winning exhibition in the scenery, through a temperature picture, digs deep into those moments of happiness and movement.
The Regulations for the Promotion of Ecocivilization in Fujian province were adopted by a vote of the thirteenth session of the Standing Committee of the Fujian People's Party on 30 September, on electricity (journalist Longmin) in the State of Fujian.
For the first time, the “Green Water Mountain is Silver Mountain” was incorporated into the legislation of Fujian Province, throughout which the regulations were made operational and enforceable.
Fujian is the first country in China to test eco-civilization.
The Head of the Office for the Rule of Law of the People's Government of Fujian Province stated that it was necessary and urgent to develop a basic regulatory framework for the construction of ecological civilization, from a holistic and holistic perspective, in order to address the problem of decentralized regulations and regulations and policy documents regulating the construction of ecological civilization, as well as to provide the legal basis for the adoption of regulations, normative documents and measures.
The Ordinance fully reflects the features of Fujian and translates mature practices in the construction of ecological civilization into statutory practices, such as the replicable and replicable “Janting experience” in the management of Fujian soil and water conservation, and provides that local people's governments at and above the county level should strengthen their unified leadership of soil and water conservation, and that priority areas for water and soil erosion prevention and management should be defined on the basis of the results of the survey on soil and water erosion; and also, in the case of river lengths in Fujian province, the regulations raise river length, lake length, to the legislative level, and provide that local people's governments at all levels should fully implement river and lake length systems and implement river basins, responsibilities and funding.
The regulation provides for the introduction of a life-long liability system for damage to the ecological environment.
Those who violate the requirements of scientific development and cause serious damage to ecological and environmental resources are held accountable for life to the principal leaders and those responsible for their leadership responsibilities.
On 1 November of this year, it was reported that the Ordinance on the Promotion of the Construction of Ecocivilization in Fujian Province will be in force.
China-Palestine agreed to complete the ongoing construction of the economic corridor in time for the accelerated construction of the port of Guadal
On Sunday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that China and Pakistan had agreed to further consolidate and expand their economic relations.
China and Pakistan issued a joint statement on Sunday to further strengthen strategic partnerships.
Both sides reaffirmed their “commitment to the construction of the Central-Palestinian economic corridor” and “reverse negative propaganda against the Chinese-Palestinian economic corridor”.
Reuters quoted the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs as stating that China and Pakistan would “strengthen practical cooperation in the field of trade and investment to enhance Pakistan's industrial capacity through joint ventures, transfer of labour-intensive industries and SME cooperation in priority areas”.
According to a press release published on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the parties agreed to complete the ongoing construction of the economic corridor between China and Palestine in a timely manner, to speed up the construction of the port of Guadar and the accompanying projects, to focus on economic and social development, job creation and livelihood improvement, and to accelerate cooperation in the fields of industry and parks and agriculture.
“The parties also agree to conclude as soon as possible the negotiations on the second phase of the agreement on trade in services between China and Palestine and to continue the negotiations on the agreement on trade in services between China and Palestine.”
In a joint statement signed last week, the parties reaffirmed their commitment to the development of the Central-Palestinian economic corridor and agreed that the economic corridor was a win-win plan for cooperation that would promote regional connectivity and bring prosperity and development to the entire region.
Both sides agreed that the port of Guadal was an important node for cross-regional connectivity and a pillar of the Central-Palestinian economic corridor.
The parties agreed to accelerate the construction of the port of Guadal and the accompanying projects.
In the joint statement, China and Palestine also expressed their opposition to negative propaganda against the economic corridor of China and Palestine.
The two sides agreed to establish a strategic dialogue between the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of China and Palestine, which would be reconfigured into diplomatic consultations at the level of Vice-Ministers for Foreign Affairs.
In addition, the two countries will further strengthen defence cooperation by maintaining the exchange of high-level visits and exchanges between the two armies and the various sectors and levels.
In order to further encourage offshore investors to invest in China, the Chinese Ministry of Finance and other ministries have jointly advised that, as of 1 January 2018, profits allocated to offshore investors from residential enterprises in China have been used to suspend the application of the policy of pre-taxation for domestic direct investment, and that projects in the foreign investment incentive category have been expanded to cover all projects and areas where foreign investment is not prohibited.
The Ministry of Finance's website contains circulars stating that foreign investors are subject to several conditions, including direct investment by offshore investors with a profit share, including equity investment by foreign investors with a profit share, new construction, equity acquisition, etc., but excluding additions, transfers, acquisitions of shares in listed companies (except eligible strategic investments).
It also includes the share of profits earned by offshore investors that represents an equity investment gain such as dividends, dividends, etc. resulting from the actual distribution of realized retained earnings by resident enterprises in China to investors.
In the event that profits from direct investment by offshore investors are paid in cash, the relevant funds are transferred directly from the account of the profit distribution enterprise to the account of the invested enterprise or equity transferer and may not run in other accounts within or outside the country before the direct investment is made; profits from direct investment by offshore investors are paid in the form of non-cash, such as in kind, marketable securities, and ownership of the related assets is transferred directly from the profit distribution enterprise to the invested enterprise or equity transferor and may not be held on behalf of other enterprises or individuals prior to the direct investment.
The circular also states that offshore investors actually recover direct investments that are covered by the withholding of income tax policy through equity transfers, buy-backs, liquidations, etc., and file with the tax authorities, within seven days of the actual collection of the corresponding amount, in accordance with the prescribed procedure, the payment of deferred taxes.
In an effort to encourage foreign investors to continue their investment operations in China, four ministries, including the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce of China, issued a joint circular at the end of 2017, whereby, as of 1 January 2017, profits distributed by foreign investors from residential enterprises in China were invested directly in investment-incentive investment projects, and where the conditions were met, a deferred tax policy was introduced, with no pending income tax.
At the Standing Meeting of the State Council of China, weekly decisions were taken to extend the scope of application of the non-admission of foreign reinvestment tax from encouraging foreign-type foreign investment projects to all non-prohibited projects and areas, and to further strengthen intellectual property protection.
Journalists have learned from the National Commission on Health and Hygiene that the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in our country has decreased compared to a few decades ago, while the incidence of overweight obesity has increased significantly.
In this regard, experts pointed out that the most important idea of maintaining healthy weight is to “repair the disease” and to promote scientific fitness and a reasonable diet.
According to the Chinese Youth Health Education Core Information and Interpretations (2018 edition), published recently by the National Health Commission, the key to maintaining healthy weight is reasonable diet and science campaigns.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight reduction are detrimental to health.
The health risks behind the little fatty cannot be ignored.
The Director-General of the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Ding Jing Jianxiang, stated that overweight obesity jeopardizes the normal growth and development of young people, adversely affects their psychological, behavioural, cognitive and intellectual well-being and can even lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood resin among children.
At the same time, overweight obesity among adolescents can easily continue into adulthood, increasing the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes among adolescents as adults.
According to Jing Jing, the nutritional and health tests conducted by Chinese residents in 2010-2012 showed that the rate of overweight among children aged 6-17 was 9.6 per cent in China and 6.4 per cent in obesity, which together stood at 16 per cent.
At the same time, overweight obesity among children and adolescents is characterized by a higher incidence of boys than girls and urban than rural areas, and the overweight obesity rate has increased significantly in recent decades.
How do adolescents cope with overweight obesity?
According to Zhang, Deputy Director of the Centre for Scientific Physics and Health Promotion of the National Directorate of Sports, the main causes of obesity among young people are excessive heat intake and inadequate physical activity.
For this simple obesity, the emphasis should be on scientific sport plus reasonable dietary control.
According to Zhang, the most important concept of maintaining healthy body weight is that of “the cure of the disease”, which is important as part of the comprehensive general education of schools, parents and students, the spread of the dangers of overweight and obesity, and the promotion of prevention among adolescents.
Adolescents should undergo regular medical examinations to monitor growth and development indicators such as body weight and early detection, scientific judgement and obesity for timely intervention.
For adolescents who are already overweight, Jingjiang recommends that, in addition to the active scientific organization of meals and sports, adolescents are in a special physiological stage and that they should avoid using hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and reduce their weight, and that they should not blindly take diet drugs.
Reuters 28 September - Friday, Facebook (FB.O) stated that hackers stole digital landing codes, giving them access to nearly 50 million user accounts, which were unprecedented and represented the most serious security gap in their history.
More than 2.2 billion monthly Facebook users stated that it had not yet been determined whether the attackers had abused any accounts or stole personal information.
The company also did not find the location of the hackers, nor was it certain that the hackers targeted specific victims.
Its preliminary analysis shows that it was a wide-ranging attack.
Executive Director Zuckerberg called the incident “really serious” at a media conference.
A spokesperson for the company stated that his account number, as well as that of the operator, Sheryl Sandberg, had also been affected.
Facebook stock prices fell by 2.6% on Friday, dragging Wall Street's main share finger.
According to U.S. parliamentarians on Friday, the attack is likely to increase external calls for data privacy legislation.
“This is yet another sad evidence of the need for Congress to act to protect the privacy and security of social media users,” said Democratic Senator Mark Warner in a statement.
Rohit Chopra, a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), said on Twitter that I would like an answer to Reuters's account of this security gap.
On September 30th, China’s fifth martyr’s anniversary was celebrated by China’s new Internet chief, Sha (Jung Binqing Tan) on September 30th.
On such a special day, members of society, such as families of war veterans, representatives of the DR and the Hunan Veterans' House, came to Changsha City to attend a mass funeral ceremony in 2018 to honour the memory of the Japanese war veterans, and to send 10 other war veterans and four war veterans to their companions.
“The veterans of the resistance are witnesses to the Chinese resistance and are genuine, vivid and visible teachings of patriotism.”
Liu Xiao, former Vice-President of the Political Consultative Council of Hunan Province, said that the courage of the veterans of the war, who had forgotten my patriotism, was a valuable spiritual asset to the present generation.
In his address, the Vice-President of the Changsha City Association and Chu Jianjun, the Main Committee of the Chang Sha City Council, noted that in recent years, the “Treat for War Veterans” project, which provides care services to war veterans in the form of living allowances, free old-age pensions and free burials, has become an excellent brand in the social services of Changsha.
In his view, the spirit of resistance can be inherited only if history is engraved in his heart.
At 11 a.m., in a solemn and heavy sound of music, participants were standing up.
The members of the Chinese troupe were dressed in tuxedos, with flowers and a fine pace, to send 10 other war veterans and 4 other war veterans to their companions in a well-structured formation.
The participants in the event paid tribute to the veterans of the war and to the many children in the crowd who, along with their parents, paid tribute to the heroes of the war.
The “Tong Man's Mankind Gardens: The theme park for the fight against war” was established in 2014 as the country's first mausoleum on the theme of fighting against war, created by the Changsha City Council of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in conjunction with Hunan Tang People's Mankind Gardens Limited.
The first phase of the mausoleum, which covers more than 2,000 square metres of land, consists of components such as the Heroes' Indeterminate Monument, the Victory Square, and the War Resisting Heroes.
“Heroes of the Fighter” provides the tombs behind the battle heroes, free of charge, and is praised as “the last barracks of the veterans of the fight”.
Each year, at the end of the anniversary, the mausoleum is marked by large rituals of public sacrifice and burial.
Since 2015, there have been seven collective funeral ceremonies for war veterans, in which 102 war veterans and their companions have fallen asleep.
On 1 October, the newly revised Protocol for Movement Control of the Three Gorges-Geco Dam Water Hub (hereinafter referred to as " Movement Control Protocol " ) was officially implemented, with the three gorge lifts formally integrated with the gate after two years of pilot flights.
On the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, the waters of the Gorge-Geco Dam were in good order.
On 30 September, at 2100 hours, the Yangtze Three Gorge Shipping Authority issued its first security plan and carried out security checks on 160 vessels, for a total of 124 vessels.
On 1 October, at 1400 hours, the Department arranged the first pass plan following the implementation of the new regulations.
Following the implementation of the new regulations, the security plan is issued once a day at 9 p.m. and at 21 p.m., and the dam plan is issued once a day at 14 p.m. and at 20 p.m., allowing ships the flexibility to arrange the dam plan.
The Movement Control Protocol adds the “classified control” principle for the movement of ships through dams, specifying the priorities of the vessels according to the anchor and the function of the lifter, and adjusting the short-line passenger ships through the locks to the same level of priority as the model and good-faith vessels.
It was also two weeks after the pilot operation of the lift, the movement of the ship was formally harmonized with that of the lock.
For the first time, the river and the tri-fon reservoir areas have also been given priority in large-scale demonstration boats and new energy-powered ships.
At the same time, the Movement Control Directive adjusts “the waters of navigational control” from the previous 180-km peri-dam water to 541.8 km from the Yunyang River Bridge to the Ishi River Head Bridge, and divides “the core waters, the peri-dam waters, the controlled waters, and the controlled waters”.
This would facilitate the selection of suitable waters for locking and reduce the backlog of ships waiting in dam areas.
The Movement Control Order also provides for good faith restrictions such as the cancellation of the declaration of a vessel in violation of the regulations and the 24-hour delay in crossing a dam, based on the current ship's dyke and locking characteristics.
As a result of water harvesting in the tri-gorges, the conditions of navigation in the reservoirs have improved, contributing to the rapid development of navigation in the Yangtze.
According to the data, the annual cargo throughput of the three gorges and the Gorge dam has increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons in 2017 and 140 million tons in 2017, respectively.
For the past two years, the Tri-Gorder has been on board 5767 ships, carrying 16.22 million passengers and carrying 1.7128 million tons of cargo.
According to Chen Dongwon, Deputy Director of the Three Gorges Navigation Authority, the Movement Control Directive has a positive effect on promoting integrity in the management of the gates, maintaining traffic order in the two dam hubs, defusing pressure from vessels in the dam area and increasing navigation capacity.
China’s weather network “Eleven” has begun to take a long vacation, and it is expected that during today’s day there will still be a storm of about six or seven in the city and that it is still in the wind and blue warning.
During the holiday period, the weather is beautiful, Beijing is clear, and autumn rains during the night of only five days are suitable for outdoor activities as a whole.
But the difference in temperature is greater than 10°C by day and night, and must be warmer in the morning or later, and beware of the cold.
The early and late temperatures in the capital were further reduced. Yesterday morning, the southern suburb was low to 7.6°C, falling down the 10°C line, reaching 20.2°C during the day, with a great difference in temperature between day and night, and the northern wind blowing, which, despite the good weather, was not warm.
This morning, the sky in Beijing was clear and colder.

With the approval of Prime Minister Li Keqiang, the State Council recently issued the Decision on the Regulation of the List of Licences for the Production of Industrial Products for Further Depression and Simplified Approval Procedures.
The Decision proposes to further depress the catalogue of industrial production licences, to eliminate 14 categories of industrial production licences, and to delegate the authority for the management of four categories of industrial production licences to the Quality Technical Supervision Department of the People's Government at the provincial level.
As a result of this reform, products subject to industrial production licensing will be reduced from last year's 38-type pressure to the current 24-category.
The Decision makes it clear that simplified approval procedures are applied to products in the catalogue.
The first is to change the pre-licensing product test from the pre-licensing product test organized by the licensing authority to a product-testing qualification report issued by a qualified inspection body submitted by the enterprise at the time of application.
Second, in addition to hazardous chemicals, there is a back-to-back inspection of licensed products by the Quality Technical Supervision Department of the Provincial People's Government (the Market Supervisory Authority). Once an enterprise has submitted an application and a product-testing qualification report with a commitment to ensure the quality of the product, it is able to obtain a production licence after a formal review and then subject to an on-site review within a specified period of time.
Third, when an enterprise produces different categories of products in its catalogue, a licence is reviewed and issued in accordance with the “one-size-fits-all” principle when applying for a new licence or applying for a change of licence.
The Decision requires that the regions and the relevant departments firmly advance the work on the depressive catalogue and the simplification of the approval process.
Increased disclosure of commitments and follow-up of on-site reviews by enterprises, enhanced credit monitoring and restraint instruments, enforcement of corporate responsibility for quality, and revocation of production licences in cases of false promises and non-compliance.
For products that are subject to the removal of industrial production licences, the actual strengthening of ex post regulation involves public health and safety, environmental protection, etc., which can be converted to mandatory certification, positive listings and social publicity, uniform certification standards, reasonable reduction and certification of testing projects, and mandatory certification costs are, in principle, institutionally borne by all levels of finance.
Support measures to encourage voluntary certification by enterprises and to promote branding and market expansion.
International standards are advanced to promote the quality of industrial products.
Full use of the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality safety of industrial products.
For products that are subject to the maintenance of industrial production licences, the standard system should be improved, industry regulatory advantages should be exercised, responsibility for “who approves and who supervises” should be strengthened, product quality safety risks should be assessed in a dynamic manner, catalogues should be reduced at the appropriate time, approval authority should be delegated or converted to certification management.
In September, China's combined PMI ring upgrades and manufacturing PMI rings fall back.
According to data released by the National Statistical Office of China on 30 September, China's combined PMI output index was 54.1 per cent in September, higher than the previous month's and annual averages of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that China's enterprises'productive activities remained generally stable.
The manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which constituted the composite PMI output index, were 53.0 per cent and 54.9 per cent, respectively, a one-litre drop in the ring.
Of this, China’s manufacturing PMI is 50.8%, and the ring is 0.5 percentage points down.
According to Zhao Qinghe, the manufacturing industry PMI was characterized in five ways this month:
The first is that the basics of manufacturing are generally stable.
Of the 21 industries surveyed, 14 are located in expansionary areas, with manufacturing PMIs, such as pharmaceuticals, specialized equipment and electrical and mechanical equipment, at higher operating levels of 53.5 per cent or more, increasing faster.
The second is the small volatility of supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0 per cent and 52.0 per cent, respectively, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, and supply and demand continued to be stable, but expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and the import index were 48.0 per cent and 48.5 per cent, respectively, lower than 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points in the previous month, and the climate was at its lowest point in the year.
The fourth is the increased cost of purchasing raw materials from enterprises.
The primary raw material acquisition price index was 59.8 per cent, an increase of 1.1 percentage points over the previous month, and the exit price index was 54.3 per cent, which was the same as the previous month, all of which was higher during the year.
The fifth is the robust operation of large enterprises and the continued improvement of small-scale enterprise operations.
The PMI for large enterprises is 52.1 per cent, which is the same as last month. The index has remained at an expansion rate of 52.0 per cent or more since this year, and the production index and the new order index ratio have both increased this month, which is the main driving force behind the expansion of the manufacturing sector; the PMI for medium-sized enterprises is 48.7 per cent, down from 1.7 percentage points in the previous month, and is located in the contraction zone; and the PMI for small-scale enterprises is 50.4 per cent, up from 0.4 percentage points in the previous month, up from two consecutive months.
In that month, China's non-manufacturing business activity index was 54.9 per cent, an increase of 0.7 percentage points over the previous month and a two-month recovery.
According to Zhao Qinghe, the overall development of non-manufacturing industries continues to be steady and positive.
The index of business activity in sectors such as road transport, securities, real estate, etc. continues to be below the critical point, with a decrease in total business volume.
On November 5th, Reuters Nagoya - The Governor of the Central Bank of Japan, Kuroda, said on Monday that the Central Bank was aware that the long-term implementation of ultra-lax monetary policy could squeeze financial institutions’ profit margins and could destabilize the country’s banking system.
However, he said that given the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Central Bank of Japan needed to maintain its large-scale stimulus plan while paying close attention to the advantages and disadvantages of its policies.
“The Central Bank of Japan fully recognizes that, under continued monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected,” said Toyoshi Kuroda in his speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He argued that the banking system could be volatile in the event of serious negative shocks if financial institutions were more proactive in taking on the risks to compensate for the shrinking profit margins caused by low interest rates over the years.
“Although these risks are not so great at present, the central bank will follow the situation closely and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures,” he said.
The minutes of the meeting of the Central Bank of Japan, which were published earlier on Monday, showed that the cost of long-term easing policies was rising during the September summit, which was discussed by the Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Japan.
According to the minutes of the meeting, one member argued that “the central bank of Japan will have more policy flexibility in the future if the economy continues to expand.”
The minutes of the meeting showed that another member argued that the Committee should discuss how long the central bank of Japan could sustain the stimulus policy, given its limits on the duration of the policy.
According to Tohiko Kuroda, the Central Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks associated with easing policies, taking into account the uncertainty surrounding Japan’s economic prospects, which could affect global demand as a result of trade frictions and growing protectionism in the US and China.
“The impact of such problems on Japan’s economy is limited for the time being,” said Toyoko Kuroda.
“How problems persist, however, the impact on the Japanese economy may become greater,” he added.
“There is a need to sustain strong monetary easing policies while considering both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner,” said Dong-il Kuroda.
Despite the increase in the ills of radical stimulus schemes, such as long-term low interest rates, which erode the profitability of financial institutions, low inflation has forced the Central Bank of Japan to maintain the scheme.
The Central Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the war dispute over global trade, the possibility of an increase in interest rates in the near future was ruled out.
Business ID for Tesla electric vehicle, Cardiff, United States, 1 June 2018.
Under a settlement agreement, the United States Tesla car and its executive director, Mask, had agreed to pay a fine of $20 million to the financial regulatory agency, and Mask would resign from his position as Chairman of the company but would remain in the CEO position.
The settlement agreement will end two months of turmoil in Tesla.
This settlement agreement for alleged securities fraud, disclosed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday, would reassure investors.
Investors feared that protracted legal disputes would only further damage the still-deficit electric car company.
The SEC sued Mask for fraud on Thursday, alleging that its tweets of 7 August were misleading to investors.
According to the tweets, he was considering privatizing Tesla at $420 per share and obtaining financing.
According to SEC, the tweets were virtually unfounded and the resulting market turmoil harmed investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts argued that the agreement could reinforce Tesla, which had been hit hard by the recent behaviour of Mask.
Steven Heim, the head of Boston Common's asset management, stated that the settlement agreement should have made Mask more supervised, without taking “destructive” measures to remove him from Tesla.
The asset management company held the stock of Panasonic, a battery manufacturer in Tesla.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla had to appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop controls over Mask's external communications.
“It is in the best interests of our markets and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, to resolve the matter quickly on agreed terms,” Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
The charges on Thursday resulted in the evaporation of a market value of approximately $7 billion for Tesla, which was $45.2 billion on Friday, down from $47.5 billion for general purpose vehicles.
In the settlement agreement, the SEC withdrew its demand to remove Mask from the post of head of the company.
Many investors claimed that the penalty would be disastrous.
“I think this is the best possible outcome for all concerned,” Ivan Finnseth of Tigress Financial Partners said, Feinseth gave Tesla a “neutral” rating and described the SEC punishment as “minus punishment” for Mask.
“He's still a CEO for Tesla.”
Neither Mask nor Tesla recognized or denied the EC's allegations in the settlement agreement, nor did they respond immediately to the request for assessment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the courts.
The Beijing Morning News (journalist Wang Ping) was informed by the Beijing Morning News journalist that one of the core buildings of the Beijing World Park Park complex - the Beijing World Park Show Square project will for the first time use a multi-colour ETFE project, with 5440 m2 of film structure in deep red, dark green, orange, blue, red, green 6 colours, and a “blossy wing” under the Lasso steel line.
According to Liu Jiabao, the project leader of the Beijing Builders Five Group, the exhibition square was built in an area of 4,500 square metres, with a total of 1,182 tons of steel installed, and the steel-structured housing was supported by an amplifier of 26 umbrellas, with the shape of a “butterflies wing” under a lashing line of Raso steel.
“From the sky, looking at the show square, the colourful floors are as if they wear flowers and dance with colours, and the colours are not faded by time and by wind and rain.”
Previously, the monocolour ETFE membrane structure had been widely applied to bird nests, water cubes, etc., but the multi-coloured ETFE membrane structure was the first in the country.
Journalists learned that since there are very few suppliers with multiple coloured structures worldwide, each inch of the structure material is “precious”.
Liu Changbao said that, in order to avoid overlaps in the position of the headlines and “fights”, the “two fork” header structure would also be innovative, ensuring that the “fight” headlines were placed in the right place through a specially designed fixed plug.
The construction of the World Park Park complex in Beijing is currently under way.
Of these, the international pavilion project has completed all the “carrying umbrellas”.
It is planned that the conditions for the display will be in place by the end of October.

Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Monday that China's opening of doors would not be closed, but would only be wider, and that the move towards a higher level of openness would not stop.
The expansion of imports is not an equity measure, but a long-term consideration for the future, and China's imports of goods and services are expected to exceed $30 trillion and $10 trillion, respectively, over the next 15 years.
Xi Jinping delivered a keynote address at the first China International Import Fair. China will further reduce tariffs, accelerate the development of new industries such as cross-border power suppliers, continuously liberalize market access, promote the opening of services, and ease foreign equity restrictions in areas such as education and health, where there is a large gap in the domestic market.
China will protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors.
He stated that China would urgently study the phased development of a free trade port policy and institutional system in Hainan and accelerate the process of exploring the construction of a China-specific free trade port; the addition of new areas in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone; and the establishment of a launching pad at the Shanghai Exchange and pilot registration system to support the development of regional integration in the Yangtze Delta, which had been elevated to a national strategy.
“China's economy is a sea, not a small pond.
When the wind is calm, and when the storm is heavy, Xi Jinping calls it, “The storm can blow up small ponds, but not the sea.
After countless storms, the sea is still there!
After 5,000 years of hard work, China is still there!
For the future, China will always be here."
He pointed out that economic globalization had suffered a great deal, that multilateralism and the free trade regime had been shaken, that instability remained numerous and that risk challenges had increased; that open cooperation was an important engine for enhancing international economic and trade cooperation, and that countries should maintain openness, expand space for mutually beneficial development and enhance macroeconomic coordination.
He stressed once again that China's opening of doors would not be closed, it would only be larger and greater, and the move towards a higher level of openness would not stop.
China will stimulate import potential, respond to rising domestic consumption trends and take more active and effective measures to promote higher incomes among the population and foster medium- and high-end consumer growth points.
China will respect international business practices and treat all types of enterprises registered in its territory equally and equally.
China will protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign-owned enterprises, firmly punish violations of the legitimate rights and interests of foreign nationals, in particular intellectual property rights, in accordance with the law, improve the quality and efficiency of the review of intellectual property rights, introduce punitive compensation systems and significantly increase the costs of violations.
Referring to China's economic outlook, Xi Jinping indicated that, in terms of key indicators such as economic growth, employment, prices, balance of payments, business profits, fiscal revenues and labour productivity, China's economic performance was within reasonable boundaries and laid an important foundation for the achievement of the year's target.
In comparison with other major economies, China's economic growth remains among the highest in the world.
“The fundamentals of healthy and stable economic development in China have not changed, the factors of production that underpin high-quality development have not changed, and the overall momentum for long-term stability has not changed.”
Xi Jinping said that there was no room for optimism about China's prospects for economic development.
According to Xi Jinping, China's macroeconomic regulatory capacity is growing and has many favourable conditions for the long-term healthy and stable development of its economy. China's economic development is currently confronted with outstanding contradictions and problems, and measures are being taken to actively address them. The results have been and are being demonstrated.
“Believes that China’s economy will be able to accelerate its transition to a high-quality development path, provided that it remains strategically determined, that it deepens its reforms and opening up in a comprehensive manner, and that the lower atmosphere resolves outstanding contradictions and problems.” Xi says.
On 3 and 4 November, the “A CLASSIC TOUR Alumni to the Classic World Tour” was held for two nights at the Haeguchi Cultural and Sports Centre, where 86,000 viewers watched the scene, where more than 6,600 security forces were organized to carry out on-site and around-the-ground policing and traffic maintenance work. Over two days, the Haiguchi police captured 20 “yellow cattle”, four people who sold false documents, seven suspects of theft, seven people who received false certificates, tickets for fake concerts, fake CDs, etc., and received over 160 requests from the audience.

The Indonesian official Antara News Agency quoted figures released by Wilem Rampangilei, head of the National Disaster Response Agency, at midnight 29 local time, and the death toll from the strong earthquake and tsunami in Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, has risen to 420.
According to the official, this is only statistics from the city of Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi, and does not include the Dungara district in the earthquake and the nearby Sigi district, where communications are still suspended and no casualties have been reported.
Search and rescue efforts have encountered great difficulties as many roads in the city of Palou have been severely damaged, heavy machinery has been difficult to access.
In order to guarantee relief, all commercial flights were suspended following the reopening of the Palu airport, which began to close on the evening of 28 September, when journalists had completed boarding passes from Jakarta to Palu, which had been cancelled.
In the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia learned through various channels to verify the situation of Chinese citizens in the affected areas.
To date, no casualties among Chinese citizens have been reported.
The President of the Central Institute of Aerodynamics in Rukovski, Russia, said: "The ultrasonic project is proceeding as planned by the International Group and under a contract with the Ministry of Industry and Trade. "
We believe that it will take two to three years for a technical demonstration and another 10 to 15 years for the production of civilian aircraft.
Tsipalo said that the problem currently faced by Russian scientists was how to reconcile the economic and security nature of aircraft.
He said that supersonic aircraft were characterized by huge noise effects.
Sepalo indicated that the Institute was working with the Moscow Aviation Academy and the Tupolev Design Office to develop a full range of civilian ultrasonic aircraft, including official and large passenger aircraft for commercial transport.
The Secretary-General of Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private enterprise symposium, instilling firm confidence in the transition of the private economy to a wider arena.
The Secretary-General of Xi Yingping stressed that “let entrepreneurs take off the burden of thinking and move on lightly” created a strong resonance among a wide range of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market dynamism comes from people, especially entrepreneurs, and from entrepreneurship.
In the 40 years of reform and opening-up, there have been millions of stories of entrepreneurial innovation, and the growth of the entrepreneurial community has constantly driven China's economy forward.
For some time now, people in society have made some negative and skeptical statements about the private economy.
Misperceptions such as the so-called “private economy abstinence” and the “new public-private partnership” have raised doubts and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
Recently, a number of private enterprises have encountered difficulties and problems in their development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some exporting firms; rapid adjustment of demand structures has put pressure on transformation and upgrading; some policies have been uncoordinated, policy effects have overlapped, or the working methods have been simple, leading to the opposite effect of some initially well-intentioned policies.
There is a combination of factors, difficulties in the private economy, difficulties in the operation of some private enterprises, and considerable anxiety on the part of entrepreneurs.
In this context, it is particularly relevant to correct the misperceptions of perceptions, to remove the burden of entrepreneurship, to allow enterprises to pursue development with one mind, and for the Government to promote development with one heart, with regard to market confidence and development expectations.
The symposium once again highlighted the important assertion that “three have not changed”: “The status and role of the non-public economy in the country's economic and social development have not changed!”
From further decentralization, the establishment of a power inventory system to the creation of a rule of law environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, the creation of a level playing field and a society-wide climate of respect for entrepreneurs, in recent years there has been unprecedented attention to entrepreneurship and institutional safeguards at the party central level.
The symposium was a clear demonstration of policy initiatives that strongly supported the six dimensions of private enterprise development and launched a series of practical actions aimed at “light-loading forwards” for private enterprises.
All this is a source of great encouragement for the entrepreneurial community and greater expectations for all sectors of society.
The fog spreads, the guidelines are set, and the key is implementation.
It is important to constantly create a better environment for the development of the private economy, to help private enterprises to solve the difficulties of development and to help to upgrade China's economic transformation; and to make entrepreneurs feel fair in competing in the market, safe in their legitimate operations, respectful in their social life, dynamic innovation and creative potential.
The Chinese economy had entered the process of moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to pursue their ambitions and providing greater space and arena for entrepreneurs to play their creative role.
We have reason to believe that, as reforms are further deepened and obstacles removed, the private economy will usher in better development prospects and opportunities, leading to a wider arena.
All 46 regulatory certificates of the Inner Mongolia import/export chain are verified online - new in-line
According to Sino-newshu and Hoat's 5 November call (journalist Lee Aiping) and Hut customs news, all 46 regulatory certificates from the local import and export chain have been verified online since that date, except for exceptional circumstances such as the need for confidentiality.
Inner Mongolia enterprises can declare relevant documents to customs in a paperless manner, avoiding problems such as past field runs, paper applications, repeated submissions, etc.
It is understood that the timing of document preparation, which refers to the preparation time for the various types of documents required for the import and export chain prior to the declaration, is a major factor affecting the overall time of customs clearance, which must be reduced if customs clearance time is to be reduced and customs clearance costs reduced.
Previously, 86 types of control documents had been required for customs clearance at the import and export levels, involving 19 departments.
This time, according to the principle of “cancan be cancelled, can be merged, can be withdrawn from check-out at ports”, the international trade “single window” platform, where customs interfaces with 16 other licensing agency systems and data interconnections have resulted in data multi-routing and less business-legged.
Customs stated that in the past, businesses had had to submit paper applications to and from the field halls of the departments concerned, and that the process was lengthy and did not allow for real-time follow-up of the audit status.
Business users now have direct access to the “Single Window” portal for online applications.
Once approved by the licensing authority, electronic certificate data are transmitted to Customs and automatically compared to customs clearance data, smart verifications are carried out at the customs clearance point. The results are sent to enterprises through a single window in a uniform manner, which enables the full-process web-based processing of regulatory document declarations, clearances, customs clearances and feedbacks.
The export of Han Xin chicken soup to China has increased 20 times in four years or has been associated with an increase in the number of young people in empty nests - the China-New Network.
The export of Chinese chicken soup to China has increased 20 times in four years.
KLA reported on 5 that last year Korean chicken soup exports to China totalled more than $100,000, a sharp increase of about 20 times over the year 2013 four years ago.
According to the analysis, this increase is related to the increase in the number of young people in empty nests in China, which has facilitated the sale of food, as well as to the increased interest of young people in feeding.
This data was published on 5th day by the Korea Agricultural and Aquatic Food Circulation Society (AT).
Last year, exports of Chinese chicken soup to China amounted to $1003.39 million, weighing 21.859 million kg, a sharp increase of 2094 per cent and 3668.8 per cent, respectively, compared to 2013.
The analysis found that the increase in sales of Chinese chicken soup in China is linked to an increase in the number of young people in empty nests, which is responsible for facilitating the sale of food, as well as an increase in young people's interest in nutritious food.
As of this year, one-person households in China have broken the 200 million mark and are expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020, and local food companies have been targeting the “single” community for a variety of convenient food items.
In addition, the analysis indicates that avian influenza is the single biggest impediment to the mainland Chinese market for chicken soup.
According to aT, the avian influenza epidemic in Korea between November 2016 and April of last year resulted in a drastic reduction in exports due to a total ban on exports of chicken soup to China.
Exports of chicken soup to China in 2016 amounted to $840,000, and exports fell sharply to $100,000 last year as a result of avian flu.
The publication of the report of the First Forum on Quality Development of Embassied Companies and the Report of Ensign's Public Company was held in Hoon Fat City.
The Permanent Committee and Permanent Vice-President of the Anhui Provincial Council, Deng, stated to Yang that the forum was designed to create an integrated communication platform for cross-border integration and integration, and that it was of great relevance to promoting healthy growth of companies listed on the Anhui market, building capital markets and building up an innovative and modern industrial system.
Ensign will further strengthen the market reserve pool of enterprises, promote the organic integration of the leading and emerging industries with capital markets, actively nurture listed resources, and play the role of “lead sheep” in leading industrial upgrading and in fostering new dynamics of economic development.
Shang stated that there was an urgent need to promote the upgrading of the Ensign economy to achieve high-quality development, and that there was a need for efficiency gains at the company level to play a leading role in the geese.
It is hoped that this forum will serve as a starting point for the creation of a co-building, sharing and sharing platform for the integration of `property research institutes' to form strategic alliances around listed companies and the `investment + investment' capital biosphere.
The provincial capital composts an absolute lead in the number of 45 listed companies over other municipalities in the province.
In terms of industry distribution, the number of companies listed in Anhui covers 13 sectors, with nearly 70 per cent concentrated in manufacturing, with a low percentage of companies listed in strategic and emerging industries and in high-technology industries.
The largest Mandarin Festival of South America was held in Lima, the capital of Peru.
The event, which was organized by local fans in Peru for a period of four days, is expected to reach 100,000 visitors.
Japan's NHK television station reported on 5 November that the festival was rich in content, including the American Mandarin Role Show, a talk show by a popular Japanese Spanish voice actor with a popular Seven Dragonball, a karaoke competition for Japanese Mandarin Theme Songs, and a Mandarin Roles Competition.
It's full of climax. It's full of fun.
During the Mandarin Roles Play competition, some children dress up as grown-up Japanese characters and re-enact the scenes of these characters, with a great performance that has received a lot of applause from the audience.
In Peru, cable television channels and others have been broadcasting Japanese cartoons since two years ago, which has made more and more of the local population like Japanese cartoons, some of which have even named their newly born babies by the name of their moving role, as can be seen from the tremendous impact of Japanese pervading culture.
Arrangements for the rehabilitation of facilities damaged by typhoons at the entrance of the Portuguese secondary school in Gomez
In recent days, there has been public concern about the rehabilitation arrangements under which some of the facilities at the entrance to the secondary secondary school in Gomez have been damaged as a result of the blow-out of the “scaffles”, and the Bureau has been following them closely.

U.S. battleships are once again approaching China's South China Sea reef.
United States officials revealed on Sunday (30 September 2018) that the United States Navy destroyer USS Decatur was on the eve of China's eleventh national holiday in the sea near the island of the South China Sea, which was declared sovereign by Beijing.
According to a 30-day CIA comprehensive outcry report, the United States destroyer USS Decatur was asked to reveal that it was within 12 nautical miles of Gaven Reef and Johnson Reef in the South Sha Islands.
The official stated that the United States would continue to do so in the future, as it had done in the past, on a routine and regular mission of free navigation.
It was also reported that United States President Trump accused Beijing of attempting to interfere in the United States Congress elections and of putting pressure on Beijing on behalf of Washington into a new phase.
This followed in May this year the entry of two United States naval vessels into the sea near the islands of the South China Sea, over which China claims sovereignty.
A comment from Washington suggested that this could provoke China at a time of tension between China and the United States.

On the occasion of the celebration of the National Day, a flag-raising ceremony was held at the mouth of the Central Viet Nam border.
“I can’t imagine such a spectacular flag-raising ceremony at the border is more shocking than watching the flag-raising in the interior.”
In the morning of 1 January, Mr. Zhang, who had travelled from Sichuan to the Yunnan River Port on the border between China and China, joined more than 500 troops, residents and tourists from China to observe the flag-raising ceremony to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The estuary is the largest port in the Yunnan sector of the Central Viet Nam border and is located in Yunnan Province, the county of the Red River State. It is situated in the same country as the old street city of Viet Nam.
As the country's “one-way” construction deepens, and as one of the most convenient routes for China to connect to South-East Asia, the flow of border crossings from and to the estuary has steadily increased.
At 7.30 a.m. on the same day, when the sun had just opened, the local population of the estuary and visitors from both the centre and the south had gathered early in the restricted area of the estuary to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 0745 hours, the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the members of the National Tribute Brigade at the border checkpoint at the estuary swollen their spirits, escorting the flag to the flag-raising table at a robust pace.
Following the commanding officer's instructions to raise the flag, raise the flag and wave out an arc, and the bright five-star red flag stretches its flag like the eagle's wings, accompanied by a slow rise in the high rhythm of the national anthem.
“The celebration of the National Day flag ceremony at every significant time of New Year’s Day, Spring Day, and National Day not only shows China’s image, but also inspires the love of the nation’s peoples.”
The soldiers and soldiers who took part in this flag-raising ceremony said so.
According to the information received, the National Tribute Brigade, which is responsible for the flag-raising ceremony at the estuary, consists of more than 40 troops from various positions at the estuary border checkpoint, from the three-person flag-raising team to the size of the Tribute, which has gone through more than 60 years and has carried out more than 70 military courtesy missions at the national level since its establishment.
The newly amended personal income tax law adjusts the criteria for determining the income tax of residents of China from one full year to 183 days.
In order to maintain policy stability, China's Ministry of Finance and the relevant head of the State Tax Administration stated on 30th that the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing preferential arrangements for persons outside China, including Hong Kong and Macao.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that the implementing regulations of the current personal income tax law provide for special benefits for the taxation of persons outside China. Individuals who do not have residence in China but who have resided for more than one year or more than five years may pay personal income tax only in respect of part of the unit or individual paid in China.
The portion paid outside China is not subject to personal income tax in China.
The Chinese Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxes, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce have also issued circulars extending the scope of application of the policy of withholding income tax from foreign investors in order to distribute profit direct investment.
The allocation of profits to foreign investors from residential enterprises in China for direct domestic investment is suspended from the application of the pre-tax policy and is extended from the foreign investment incentive category to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and areas.
During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, some positive messages were released on the Korean peninsula.
The Korean President recapitulated the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's “irreversible” determination to abandon nuclear weapons and stated that United States President Trump and North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un might meet before the end of this year.
The United States Department of State subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompeyo would visit the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in October to facilitate the implementation of the commitments made by the leader of the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Singapore, to meet.
From the beginning of this year to the present, inter-Korean efforts to break the ice have opened the way for dialogue, with meetings between the leaders of the two Koreas and the United States of America, the general trend towards de-escalation of the situation on the peninsula has continued and the principle of dialogue to resolve the problems on the peninsula has been upheld.
First, “the essence of the question of the peninsula is security” remains the same, and the key to achieving peace on the peninsula lies in the proper and balanced resolution of the legitimate security concerns of all parties, rather than a mere pressure on each other to emphasize their own claims.
Secondly, in the dialogue to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned are still divided on the steps and ways to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, and the “who is the first” game is still strong, owing to the long-standing lack of political trust between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States.
At the Council's previous open meeting on the Korean peninsula, held at United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices surrounding the issue of sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea once again highlighted these two points of “no change” in the case of the peninsula.
United States Secretary of State Pompeyo insisted that the sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would not be lifted until the Korean peninsula was completely denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, on the other hand, stressed the principle of “action in response”, noting that “the downward trend in sanctions should be the same as the step taken by North Korea on the step-by-step nuclear path”.
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement fully, fully and accurately the resolutions of the Security Council relating to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but that pressure is not an end and that the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are the requirements of the resolutions of the Council, both of which must not be sidelined or chosen.
As stated by the State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, Wang Yi, in the light of the current positive developments in inter-Korean and inter-Korean relations with the United States, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider the timely initiation of reversible provisions, thereby encouraging the DPRK and the parties concerned to take further steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process require sufficient political courage on all sides.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community for a political solution to the issue of the peninsula, it is particularly important that the parties show political courage, make political decisions, fulfil their commitments and resolve their difficulties, and continue to move forward on a step-by-step basis to advance the process of denuclearization of the peninsula in parallel with the establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula and to work together towards the establishment of a permanent peace on the peninsula.
A message was received from the People's Government of the Kikang District, Pingxi Province, on 1 day that the Yellow River Casket Area, located in the county, would remain at a relatively high level of water during the National Day and would not be open.
In order to ensure security, the scenery area was temporarily closed during the National Day.
The yellow pot mouth waterfall is the second largest waterfall in China, the largest yellow waterfall in the world.
The Yellow River has reached this point, and the walls of the two sides are stunned and the mouths of the river are bound as small as the mouths of the pots, forming the “one pot of the thousand miles of the Yellow River”.
According to journalists, the yellow river period of June to October of each year began on 12 July 2018, with the closure of the canal area in the Shanxi river, due to its high water level, for a cumulative period of almost one month.
Nie Woo Feng, the chief engineer of the Casino State Management Board, told the media that this was the longest time that the Yellow River's high water levels had lasted for nearly 20 years, “not so long ago, we closed in 2017 for four days, and almost a month this year.”
It is understood that, in order to meet the golden week of 11, the yellow canal waterfalls in Shanxi were preceded by additional staffing and vehicle maintenance, and even the hiring of temporary staff.
According to the circular issued by the Office of the General Command for Drought Control of the Yellow River on the implementation of the Yellow River during the National Day, the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Xanxi, Henan and Shandong were asked to do the Yellow River during the National Day.
Currently, the main flow of the Yellow River is large, with the flow of the upper river remaining at 2,000 to 3,000 cubic metres per second, the flow of the middle river remaining at 2,500 to 3,500 cubic metres per second, and the flow of the lower river remaining at 3,000 cubic metres per second.
Influenza vaccination services are provided at health centres and health stations, especially during the national holiday
This year, the Department of Health ordered 150,000 doses of a four-priced influenza vaccine for the period 2018-2019, giving priority at this stage to high-risk persons for free vaccination against influenza during public holidays. In particular, the health centres and health posts under the Department of Health provide vaccination services from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. during the national holiday (on 1 and 2 October).
In addition to the above-mentioned measures for the population, the health centres and health posts under the Department of Health have, since the introduction of the programme, extended the services for influenza vaccination from Monday to Friday to 8 p.m., reaching 4,158 vaccinations as at 4 p.m. on 30 September, which is more than 3,714 in the same period last year.
Free vaccinations are provided to the following Macao residents: persons under the age of 6 months to 18, persons aged 50 and over, pregnant women, all chronically ill persons, including obese persons (i.e. persons with a physical quality index BMI of 30 or more), as well as persons working in institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, all health workers, and residents of Macao who work in playgrounds.
At the same time, other persons, including the public sector, who are deemed necessary by the Department of Health, will contact the relevant agencies on their own initiative to obtain the list and arrange the vaccination at the health centre.
In order to facilitate inoculations and reduce waiting times, the Department of Health will send health-care personnel between October and December of this year to primary schools, primary schools, kindergartens and day-care centres to provide group influenza vaccinations for young children, young and middle-school students, teachers and employees, etc. In addition, the Department of Health will arrange for group vaccinations in homes for the elderly and the disabled, in larger numbers in the public sector or other institutions.
Students and young children who are unable to participate in group vaccinations may be vaccinated at the vaccination stations or health centres of the General Hospital of the Count of Insein on 3 December 2018 with the Macao identity card, the Health Board user card, the influenza vaccination card (if any), the student certificate, the employee certificate or the vocational certificate.
The Department of Health reminded the population that between September 2017 and August 2018, persons who had been vaccinated against the influenza from 2017 to 2018 had yet to be vaccinated against a new flu season since September 2018, as the influenza antigen component of the Northern Hemispheric influenza vaccine from 2018 to 2019 had been updated, targeting seasonal influenza from the winter of 2018 to 2019 and the summer of 2019 in the northern hemisphere.
The peak of the influenza in Macao usually occurs in January-March of each year, later than in temperate regions (e.g., North China and Japan). The Health Board calls on high-risk persons, such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese persons and chronic patients, who are more vulnerable to complications following the influenza infection, as well as those who are in frequent contact with high-risk persons, to be vaccinated as early as possible.
On September 30th, the NBA champions started a fierce war with the forest wolves in the main field this morning, and Rore Dune, who joined the forest wolves in the summer, helped the team with a key catch-up basket to take a victory from the playground.
First of all, the wolf is the first to win the ball, and Ross is the first to hit the field.
The Braves are responding with an empty buttoned-up by Jones.
As a result, Curi Durant was killed and Ross and Tig were immersed and engaged in confrontation.
At the end of the first period, the warriors were at 36:37 Forest Wolf.

On the evening of 29 September, the journalist was informed by the Communications Department of the Qing Baijiang District Committee in Cheng City that, on the evening of 29 September Beijing time, a central European row (Sengdu), full of goods such as car connectors, telescopes, LCD screens, had been reloaded through the Chemia Nufka port in Poland, where they had finally arrived in Nuremberg, Germany.
This was the first time that the country's Central European bane opened the Polish Chemianufka crossing line, marking the successful opening of another European transport line in Central Europe after Mara and Jopp.
The Central European class, which began on 14 September at a station in Chengdu Qingqing Shih River, exited through the Arasan crossing, entered Europe via the Polish Chemianufka crossing and eventually arrived in Nuremberg, Germany, for a total duration of about 16 days.
For the first time, the Central European class travels here to perform the line wide-track and track change operation.
The opening of the crossing effectively addressed the problems of long operations and long periods of time caused by the current congestion at the Malala crossing, raised the ban on banishment and provided new solutions to the problem of congestion at the Malala crossing, further enhanced the transport capacity and efficiency of China's western hinterland to the Euro-Mediterranean market and laid a solid foundation for the opening of the European market by the Central European banhing.
With a 7.5-class earthquake on Friday in Sulawesi, Indonesia, more than 400 people have now been confirmed dead, many of whom have been swept away by the earthquake-induced tsunami.
The authorities expect a significant increase in the total number of Sunday deaths as new data are reported in remote areas.
Dozens of people are reportedly still trapped in the ruins of a hotel and a shopping mall in Baru City.
The earthquake triggered a wave of up to six metres (20 feet) that hit the city of Baru.
To date, only the number of deaths has come from Baru, the number of deaths reported in Dungla, north of Baru, is slow, and the authorities are preparing for a worse situation.
The population of Donguela is 300,000, closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
According to Vice-President Kara of Indonesia, the total number of deaths is likely to rise to thousands.
As the waves hit the coast on Friday at dusk, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate the festival, many were washed away by the waves and everything was destroyed wherever they reached.
According to a quarterly short-view survey published by the Central Bank of Japan on Monday, 1 October in Tokyo, the confidence of large Japanese manufacturers in the September season reached its lowest level in more than a year, owing to rising raw material costs and the effects of a series of natural disasters on production, which put pressure on businesses.
The survey hardly showed that the escalating friction of global trade undermined the confidence of large manufacturers.
However, the risk of a full-scale trade war undermines business prospects and can threaten corporate capital spending.
Active capital expenditure is one of the bright spots in the Japanese economy.
The survey called into question the view of the Central Bank of Japan that a sound economic expansion would help to accelerate inflation to the 2 per cent target, although there were indications that firms were gradually passing costs on to customers.
“In the context of concerns raised by the global trade war, the confidence of manufacturers has stagnated as a result of the slowdown in exports and weak factory production,” expressed Nan Takeshi, the chief researcher at the Golden General Research Institute in Agroforestry.
“Consumption is still high. And I don’t think confidence will continue to decline as business profits improve and prices rise.”
Short-view surveys show that the large manufacturing landscape judgement index in September declined from positive 21 three months ago to positive 19 and deteriorated for the third consecutive season.
The market estimate is 22 positive median.
In September, the large non-manufacturing weather judgement index fell from a positive 24 to a positive 22 survey in June, with the first deterioration in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey is positive 22.
The survey showed that both large manufacturing and non-manufacturing climate judgement indices remained stable in December.
Investors do not care about the decline in the short-term business climate judgement index, which rises on Monday, N 225, to a 27-year high, as the yen continues to depreciate and helps improve the export profitability prospects of Japanese enterprises.
Capital expenditure is robust.
Despite the decline in corporate confidence, the latest short view highlights the robustness of business capital expenditure plans, the benefits of renewed capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to respond to labour shortages resulting from population ageing.
A survey by central banks shows that large enterprises planned to increase capital spending by 13.4 per cent in the current fiscal year until March 2019.
The previous short view survey was 13.6 per cent.
Nan Wuzhi said that capital spending on all enterprises was planned to increase by 8.5 per cent in the current fiscal year, close to the pace of Japan’s bubble economy.
“There is still room for further growth in capital spending, given the expected increase in small-scale businesses’ profits from now on, but much depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence.”
Short-view surveys showing an increased ability of enterprises to transfer costs, with a positive 7 value index for large enterprises, a high point in the decade, are encouraging signs of progress in Japan's efforts to combat deflation.
The index for measuring employment in large enterprises, which reaches negative 23, is the most compact level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
Thanks to strong corporate spending, the second quarter of the Japanese economy rebounded from the contraction of January-March this year.
However, the upgrading of trade frictions in the summer and the disruption of the supply chain by natural disasters have overshadowed the prospects of the Japanese economy, which is dependent on exports.
In United States dollars, the rate of increase in services imports and exports is 16.4 per cent.
The Ministry of Commerce website press release quoted the head of the Division of Services and Trade as stating that exports and imports of new and emerging services had exceeded $1 trillion in January-August, increasing faster than overall.
Of this total, exports and imports of new services increased by 20.9 per cent by 1,138.3 billion yuan, exceeding the overall rate of increase in services imports and exports by 10.4 percentage points, and by almost 3 percentage points the share of new services.
In the area of services exports, in January-August, services exports continued the rapid growth momentum since this year, with exports growing at a faster rate than imports at 5.7 percentage points.
Among them, the top three areas of growth were telecommunications computers and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, and insurance services, which increased by 61.1 per cent, 38.8 per cent and 26.5 per cent, respectively.
The Officer-in-Charge of the Division also noted that the share of imports of new and emerging services had also risen steadily in January-August.
Emerging services imports grew rapidly in January-August, reaching 23.6 per cent, an increase of 1.6 percentage points over the same period last year.
Of these, imports of financial services, royalties on intellectual property rights, telecommunications computers and information services have increased by more than 20 per cent, at 47.1 per cent, 23.3 per cent and 23.2 per cent, respectively.
Xijia: Macy's three rounds of the U.S.-Bassa match to help bring it down.
Last night, the 7th round of Barcelona’s main battle against Bilbao took place, with the first half of De Marcos taking the lead, the second half of Macy taking over Munir’s score, and the end of the 1:1-square on both sides, after which three rounds of Bassa were won.
This battle between Macy and Buskerz is over.
The score fell behind, and Macy came in the second half.
After three rounds of tournaments and a victory on the royal horse, Bassa is still at the top of the list with a net-win advantage, but with only one point behind the third Sevilla.
I'm proud of the country's power - China New Network.
Economic development, the strengthening of the state, the growing weight of the word “China” on the international stage.
All of this is felt even more by the Chinese diaspora abroad.
Our overseas Chinese are very happy with the success of the country's reform and opening up, so this is a proud one, and I hope that our country will grow stronger.
Every time we return home, the changes in the country are very large, and the number of artists coming out to spread Chinese culture is increasing, and I think the changes are very big.
The opening up of reforms in our country is absolutely a miracle of the world.
Our association in Canada now, compared to before, is honoured to say that we are Chinese.
We are very proud of our country's efforts over the years.
China's strength, its sense of admiration and admiration are shared by many foreign friends.
They also gave their blessing to China and to the Chinese people.
I think China is one of the most fascinating cultures and civilizations in the world, and I wish China and the United Arab Emirates much more prosperity in the future.
Bless all the Chinese because you're great.
Working in China, you helped me. I hope you're all right.
Make the world a better place, as you are doing now.
When I met the new Polish friends and told them I studied Chinese, they'd say you'd get a job, right?
Indeed, China has developed particularly well in recent years and has made me happy.
Happy birthday to the Chinese people!
The price of oil, or a “three-in-one” rise, can be fully replenished ahead of schedule on the occasion of the national holiday.
On 30 September, at 2400 hours, a new round of price-fixing windows for finished oils will be opened in conjunction with the long holiday at the National Day.
A number of agencies forecast a substantial increase in oil prices to achieve a “three-in-one” increase.
The owners of the car, who plan to travel on their own, can fill the car with fuel before the price increases.
Based on data from crowd-based estimates, it is estimated that the relative increase in domestic finished oils will be around $190 per ton, and 220 per ton.
In September, there were two increases in oil prices: 180 ton for petrol on 3 September, 170 ton for diesel, 145 ton for petrol on 17 September and 145 ton for diesel on 17 September.
Domestic oil prices have been linked to international oil prices, and international oil prices have risen since the current round of prices, and Brent crude oil has continued to be explored after it has crossed the $80 threshold.
As of 28 September, the volume of WTI crude oil futures in the United States had increased by $1.13 to $73.25 per barrel.
Brent's crude oil futures increased by USD 1.0 to USD 82.72 per barrel.
“In the light of the international situation, tensions such as the United States sanctions against Iran have increased, and oil prices have generally tended to be biased, followed by a clear refusal by the OPEC Conference to increase production, giving market confidence, and a steady upturn in oil prices.”
According to Drozen's information-based oil analyst, Xu Wen.
On the retail side, the current prices for petrol in Beijing are $7.66 and $8.15 per litre for petroleum and petrochemical gas stations and No. 95, respectively.
According to Li Ying, the public information analyst, there has been no significant change in the marketing promotion strategy for gas stations, which currently have preferential margins of 0.5-0.7 yuan per litre for major stations, such as Central petrochemicals, and 0.5-1.2 yuan per litre for private stations.
“The retail price of this round is about ‘three consecutive increases’, which rises by about US$0.14-0.16, suggesting that the owners of private cars should refuel before the long holiday comes.”
School students are subjected to corporal punishment by their teachers for making mistakes, the schools involved are disqualified from the annual Qualifications - the new Chinese network.
In response to the incident of “Personal punishment by a teacher on the fault of a primary school student in Suning City”, the official Weibo of the New District Council of Suining City announced yesterday that it had been found that the case of students who had been subjected to corporal punishment by teachers in the Suzhou primary schools of foreign languages was true and that they had been removed from their teaching posts and that the schools involved had been disqualified from the annual `satisfactory' qualification.
There has been a recent response from parents that Suning 1st grade 6 girls have been beaten at school by class math teachers for having made mistakes, causing widespread concern.
Subsequently, an investigation team was set up by the New District Social Services Department in Suining City to investigate, interrogate, gather evidence from the site and remove the teachers involved from their positions.
Yesterday, the official Weibo of the New District Council of Suining City issued an information circular stating that it had been found that the corporal punishment of students by teachers of the Suzhou elementary schools in foreign languages was true.
According to research, the year-end test of the Suzhou primary school for foreign languages was “no vote” and the annual “optimal” qualification was abolished.
The circular also stated that the administrative division of the Suzhou primary schools in foreign languages was subjected to collective recognizance and that the management and supervision of the schools were governed by the relevant regulations; that the teachers involved were transferred from their posts and taken seriously in accordance with the relevant regulations; and that they were ordered to carry out in-depth examinations of the schools in Suzhou and to carry out teacher-student construction activities and take practical measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.
At the same time, schools are required to communicate with parents on their own initiative and to take good care of follow-up work.
Opening of the 69th International Astronautical Congress in Germany -- China New Network
The 69th International Astronautical Congress was inaugurated on 1 October at the Bremen Exhibition Centre in Germany by Xinhua Society Bremen, Germany, on 1 October, with the participation of more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and businesses, expert scholars and young students from around the world.
In his opening address, the President of the International Astronautical Federation, Jean-Yve Legar, said that the cause of global space was no longer a mere minority of countries and institutions and that the number of participants had increased significantly over the previous session this year, indicating that an increasing number of institutions and individuals were joining.
He called on States to strengthen cooperation and innovation and to work together to advance the cause of space.
In attending the exchange, the Vice-Minister of Industry and Informationization of China and Director of the National Space Agency, Zhang Ke Yiu, presented China's space programme and indicated that China would expand international cooperation in the field of space and contribute to the cause of space for mankind.
The participation of representatives of relevant institutions such as the China Space Science and Technology Group and the China Space Science and Technology Group, as well as a number of private enterprises, demonstrated the latest achievements in Chinese space, including launch vehicles, satellites and space science and technology applications.
The International Astronautical Congress, which has been held annually since 1950, is the largest gathering of the world's aviation community.
The Congress, which lasted five days, was co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Centre for Applied Science and Microgravity Research of Bremen University and the International Institute of Space Law.
According to a press release issued by Reuters Beijing on 5 November - China's Foreign Trade Centre on Sunday, the Hiroshima Conference showed that China's foreign trade situation remained complex and that 80.6 per cent of businesses were expected to export better than the previous year or even more than the previous year in 2018.
However, taking into account the external environment, where the cost of domestic raw materials, labour, etc., is constantly rising, and where trade friction between China and the United States is increasing, participating enterprises at the same time consider that the export situation next year is not promising.
At the closing press conference of the 124th ordinary session, the Deputy Secretary-General of the inaugural meeting, the press spokesperson and the Deputy Director of the China Foreign Trade Centre, Xu Jun, stated that the number of foreign buyers arriving and the number of exports at the current session had fallen by the same amount.
There were 189,812 participants from 215 countries and territories, a decrease of 1.11 per cent over the same period.
Exports amount to RMB 2,064,494 million (equivalent to $29,860 million), a decrease of 1 per cent over the same period.
From the market point of view, the South Korea deal grew by 74.4 per cent, 11.4 per cent, 7.2 per cent, 2.5 per cent for Japan, 10 ASEAN countries, BRIC countries, and 30.3 per cent, 8.9 per cent, 7.3 per cent, 0.8 per cent for the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union, respectively.
In terms of industry, transport, mechanical equipment, building and decoration materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, and bathing equipment grew by 24.8 per cent, 21.1 per cent, 20.0 per cent, 15.1 per cent, and 7.6 per cent, while textile clothing and domestic appliances fell by 13.0 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively.
Xu has indicated that, as a barometer and a wind sign of China's foreign trade, the data on the participation and exports of the buyers at this meeting show that China's foreign trade development will continue to face a number of uncertainties and uncertainties in the coming year.
However, as structural reforms on the supply side are advanced and as national and local policy measures have recently been introduced, such as the “six-stable” approach, the new dynamic of China's foreign trade development is accelerating and new progress is being made in diversifying the enterprise market, which is an important basis and a strong condition for the development of foreign trade.
“With a combination of factors, China’s foreign trade exports and imports are expected to grow steadily throughout the year, with further improvements in quality and efficiency.”
The General Customs Administration of China announced a 14.5 per cent increase in exports in United States dollars in September, a 14.3 per cent increase in imports in September, a $31,690 billion trade surplus in September, and the highest export growth and trade surplus since February this year.
Despite the escalating trade friction between China and the United States, China's export performance in September was significantly higher than expected, with strong external demand, the collapse of firms'exports and the devaluation of the renminbi before the United States imposed customs duties, or the main supporting factors, showing the resilience of China's foreign trade. However, China's trade war against confidence and the impact on the industrial chain cannot be ignored, and analysts believe that the challenges of China's foreign trade may be felt in the fourth quarter or next year.
According to the Reuters survey, in September, the United States fund manager recommended an increase in cash holdings, maintaining a cautious stance as the United States and China began their latest round of reciprocal import duties and the dispute showed no signs of abating.
However, the 12 fund managers participating in the survey recommended that North America's asset allocation increase to the highest level since June 2017, while the United Kingdom, the euro area and, in particular, emerging markets, have declined.
The global equity allocation averaged 56.6 per cent and the bond ratio 35.5 per cent, largely in line with last month’s survey.
The most notable change has been the increase in the cash distribution ratio to 5.1 per cent, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager from a large funder said, “Some economic data bring confidence to the market, but the war on trade remains the biggest concern, so it is better to be prepared to enter when the market falls.”
The Fund Manager, however, continued to favour equities in September, particularly in the United States, even though United States equities were considered to be overpriced.
Today, in China’s open landmark, the world’s first major national exhibition on the theme of imports – China’s International Import Expo – officially opened the scene of expectations.
An exhibition is like a "window" that gives the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the Expo, people see a move towards a higher level of "open China"; with the "window" of the Expo, the world is welcomed as a mutually beneficial win-win with the "reform open again" China.
“For a country, openness is like a flutter of cocoon, which, while suffering for a while, will be replaced by a new life.”
The Secretary-General of Xi's summary of the road to openness points out an important reason why “China can”.
Looking back at the 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which had dared to penetrate the world market, despite its experience of vortexes and wind waves, had always faced all the risk challenges in an open posture, constantly unleashing its internal dynamism and increasing its competitiveness.
It can be said that China, with its own solid achievements, has eloquently interpreted the value and meaning of openness.
At the beginning of a new history, the organization of an exhibition on the subject of imports was a major decision taken by the party’s central focus, Comrade Xi Jinping, to promote a new round of high-level opening to the outside world. It was a major initiative by China to open its markets to the world. It was a practical move by China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization. It demonstrated the strong and clear will that “China’s opening doors will not be closed, but will only grow wider”.
And the “one hard to ask” seat for a large number of participants is the biggest positive and optimal response to China’s broader, broader and deeper development of an open economy.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
The build-up of the walls of protectionism in some countries and the return to the old path of unilateralism had increased the international community's concerns about the prospects for free trade and added to the uncertainty of the world economy, which was now warming.
In the context of such an era, this event on the eve of Huang Pu River reflects China's defence of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets and shared future Chinese confidence and China to assume its role.
Solo, solo, so far away.
China's open-mindedness and embrace of the world have not only made a powerful contribution to its own development, but have also brought tremendous “China opportunities” to countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the creation of a “one-way” together, the launching of the Asian Investment Bank, and the establishment of a Silk Road Fund... China has provided a range of international public goods, providing real export markets, opportunities for development and jobs, and giving enterprises a “fast-rider” to China’s development.
The Expo is also a major platform for public goods, global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in the Chinese market with their distinctive high-quality products and services.
In addition to national enterprises, domestic consumers are the real beneficiaries.
By setting up this platform of “optimal excellence”, it provides a multi-channel, high-quality supply for the upgrading of consumption and meets the needs of the population in terms of individualization, diversification and differentiation in consumption.
As China opens its doors, the flow of goods and the use of goods becomes larger, and the steps towards a better life will be stronger.
From a broader perspective, the significance of the Expo goes beyond economics and trade to a vision of the future that conveys the concepts of openness, inclusion, inclusion, balance and win-winness in order to forge a common understanding of today's challenges.
The world is better, China is better; China is better.
We look forward to the great and successful event that will bring to the world; we look even more forward to a higher level of “open China” and the world working together to build a bright future for the community of human destinies.
External media: A framework agreement between the United States and the United States on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The [summary] agreement includes Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States and the temporary exemption of the United States from customs duties on Canadian-produced cars.
According to external sources, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of 30 September local time that the United States and Canada had concluded a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It was revealed that the agreement included Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States and the temporary exemption of the United States from customs duties on Canadian-produced vehicles.
On 27 last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary principled agreement to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement by the 31 August deadline set by the United States to extend the duration of the negotiations until 30 September.
Previously, Canada’s Foreign Minister Freeland’s spokesperson said that Canada would only sign a favourable agreement, “focusing on substance, not on a timetable. We will continue our consultations in the hope of reaching an agreement that is in Canada’s national interest.”
More than 90 per cent of Brazilian women voters stated that the presidential candidate did not take women's needs into account.
According to the South American Diaspora, data published recently by the Brazilian National Institute of Geography (IBGE) show that more than 90 per cent of Brazilian women do not believe that the presidential candidate takes women's needs into account.
It was reported that the number of women in Brazil had now reached 107 million and that if Brazilian women were brought together to form a country, the country's population would be 13th in the world, twice the population of Spain as a whole.
In Brazil, where women account for 52 per cent of voters and men for 48 per cent of voters, the proportion of women in the Brazilian Congress is only 10 per cent, although the proportion of women among voters is very high.
Of the 193 countries in the world, the participation of Brazilian women in politics is only 154, which is higher than that of Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women have not succeeded in acquiring their rights.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori points out that this phenomenon is due to the combination of ancient patriarchal societies, racism and capitalist values.
“Political should have been a national’s claim to citizenship, identity, access to public goods, and a society made up of several social groups. But Brazilian politics is a monopoly of a certain group, and the majority of the population is not represented.”
A previous study by the Brazilian Automobile Institute (Locomotiva) also pointed out that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not feel that elected politicians could represent their rights, 90 per cent did not agree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93 per cent did not agree with the current government policy on governance.
“We need to reverse the underrepresentation of women in parliament, and Brazil’s political system continues to be affected by inequality. So far, Brazil’s political sphere has been marked by serious gender, class, and racial discrimination.”
Despite the lack of women's rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76 per cent of women believed that they could make a difference in democratic elections and 72 per cent were interested in politics.
In addition, 55 per cent of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to subject women to less prejudice.
On 1 October, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn flag-raising ceremony to mark the 69th birthday of the new China.
More than 80 representatives of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, news agencies in Kazakhstan, financial institutions, Chinese enterprises, Chinese diasporas, Confucius and students attended the event.
On 1 October, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a flag-raising ceremony to greet the 69th birthday of the new China.
Following the flag-raising ceremony, the Ambassador of China to Pakistan, Zhang Xing, stated that, on the occasion of the 69th birthday of the great motherland, it was a profound patriotic educational activity that we celebrated the flag-raising ceremony in a different country.
Although you have lived abroad for a long time, you are always a great country.
Zhang Yuan said that the Chinese people are today closer than ever to the great goal of achieving a national renaissance and to the centre of the world stage.
“Our mission, our responsibilities and our work are more honourable, arduous and onerous than ever before.”
Zhang Xiang stressed the need to keep in mind his mission, to promote the construction of a “one-way” by the Chinese-Pakistani Communist Party, to make a steady and deep journey, to draw a “one-way” by a more beautiful co-builder, and to devote all his energy to the development of the country and to the development of a friendly cooperation between China and Pakistan.
The T2 terminal at Kirin International Airport in Guangxi was inaugurated on 30 days.
According to Zhao Le Qin, the Secretary-General of the Central Chinese Communist Party Guiling City Council, the opening of the new terminal will meet the annual demand for 12 million passengers and will create a new advantage in the air traffic of Gui Lin, which will be of great importance in further improving the modern three-dimensional traffic patterns of the Guangxi River, the sea and rail links, the surface and the air ports.
Kiirin is expected to receive more than 90 million visitors this year.
The expansion of the T2 terminal and the pedagogic facilities at the two Rivers International Airport is a major public benefit project for the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Guangxi Gang Autonomous Region and a landmark project for the construction of an international tourist destination in Guilin.
The project began in December 2015 with a construction area of 100,000 square metres, with a total investment of RMB 3.258 billion, which will meet the requirements of 12 million annual passenger throughputs, 10.12 million landings and 95,000 tons of mail throughput.
On the same day, more than 200 flights took off and landed at the T2 terminal at Gjilin International Airport.
The design of the new terminal is inspired by the waters of Guilin Hills, and it looks like a mountain cinnamon, close to the "Long Ridge Trailing Field" and the tumbled roofs of the Guibei People's Land.
It was reported that the new terminal at Guilin airport was able to meet the peak flow of approximately 4,000 arrivals and exits per hour, using smart baggage sorting systems, security integration platforms, face recognition, etc., as a technical tool for “smart empty ports”, and planning commercial areas covering a wide range of business practices such as catering, department stores, tax exemptions and leisure.
As growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets is largely not encouraging, the United States is increasingly becoming a major engine of global economic growth.
On 23 September 2018, a container cargo ship docked in a port in New Jersey, United States of America.
However, as the current growth in the United States has benefited from the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts, the economy has also received close attention from the outside world.
“As the United States regains full employment, the economic downturn is inevitable.”
The only question, he said, was when it would happen, which, in his view, would probably only be left behind.
Despite Barclay's optimism about the United States economic outlook by the end of the year, the Bank acknowledged that it was more difficult to forecast further time.
“In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the potential for economic growth, the current growth stimulated by fiscal policy will not be sustainable”, the Barclay economist said in a study.
“In the absence of investment growth, the risk of the economy landing hard in 2020 will rise,” they said.
A series of business surveys will broadly show that major economies are at the stage of the economic cycle at the end of the third quarter.
The euro area and United States manufacturing surveys, which are due to be published next Monday, will receive attention and services surveys will be published on Wednesday.
But next week's data will certainly focus on the non-farm employment data for the United States, which will be published next Friday, and will provide clues as to whether the tight employment market is driving wage growth.
Its importance, not only because of its importance to the profitability of enterprises and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because of salary hikes or overall inflation increases, may be a source of concern for officials of the United States Federal Reserve (FPR/FED).
“Payroll will be of great concern, as the ring is likely to rise again significantly over the previous month.
The rise in September over the same period of the previous year may not have been over 3%, but we can well expect a breakthrough next month, as the Netherlands International Group (ING) economist wrote in a study.
European politics may become a source of market volatility at a time when vacations in China and other parts of Asia have led to a bleak data profile for the region next week.
The Italian government ignores previous financial commitments to the EU, and the rest of the EU member states will have to quickly determine whether or not to oppose Italy’s decision. Tria does not support the decision, and he hopes to abide by EU rules.
The annual meeting of the British Conservative Party in Birmingham may also be sparkling as the British retreat talks enter a critical phase.
At the same time, concerns surrounding emerging markets are unlikely to diminish as Brazil holds the hoped-for presidential elections next weekend.
[Summary] When completed, the vessel will be placed at the disposal of the East China Sea Division of the National Oceanic Administration of China, and Chen Xiao, Chief of the Observing Service of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, stated that its operationalization would be of great importance for the development of the China Offshore Ocean Observing System and the promotion of global ocean observations.
On 29 September, China's first 3000-ton large-scale buoy vessel, Sun Hung-22, was in the water of the China Warships Group.
The completion of the vessel will break the current equipment bottlenecks in China's safeguards work on large buoys, submarine placement, recycling and looting.
The “Girl 22” wheels are used mainly for regular buoy/submarine cruise maintenance, regular placement, recycling, contingency placement of buoys/submarine, recovery, recovery and repair, as well as the ability to carry out integrated marine survey missions, such as gap surveys.
The new ship is 89 metres long, 18 metres wide, 7.2 metres deep and has a continuous capacity of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Xiao, Deputy General Manager of the Warships Group, said: “The 22 ships to Yoon Hong are our first large buoy operating vessel, and the only one in the country with 10 metres of capacity to operate a large buoy, will further enhance our large buoy security capability.”
It is understood that the ship, once completed, will be placed at the disposal of the East China Sea Division of the National Oceanic Administration of China, and Chen Xiao, Chief of the Observation Service of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, stated that its operationalization would be of great importance for the development of the China Offshore Ocean Observing System and the promotion of global ocean observations.
“The vessel is simultaneously equipped with large-scale buoy-laying and maintenance operations, as well as with integrated maritime survey capabilities, and is our first integrated vessel dedicated to mid- and long-sea buoy operations and integrated ocean survey operations.
With such a buoy ship, our ocean observation and ocean survey will now have a powerful sharp instrument.”
The first day of the race was postponed until 1 October at the Tsingjia International Qingjia Tournament, originally scheduled for 30 September at the opening of the Tournament, and a pre-game meeting was held at the Qingdao Osing Centre, at which the captains of 12 water-wing double-hull fleets from six countries and territories were present.
Under the influence of the typhoon “Bullet” and the strong winds in the pool, the maximum speed of which was 24 knots, the departure signal was delayed by almost 90 minutes from 1 p.m. on 30 p.m., the wind was not reduced, and the competition was postponed until the afternoon of 1 October, when Anne Mdrand, the presiding judge of the competition, announced the cancellation of the first day of the competition.
“The strong winds from the shore continue, and the sea is too intense.”
Mdrand explains: “In this case, no one knows when the wind will strike the ship.
A race near the city, and in the current state of affairs, cancellation is the wisest option.”
There is still some disappointment on the part of all prepared crews.
"The ship is ready to stop, and we're in good shape."
Max Richardson, the Qingjia rudder, said: "But I know it's the right choice to change the game, and I want the wind to be smaller today, so we can do it."
Omika Wilkinson, who is known as the New Zealand team for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, says, “The loss of a day makes the game more interesting.
Because today's game's gonna be worth more and there's only two days left.
We're all going to have to work really hard."
Despite the sea winds, the French ABM rudder Pierre Ives Durand, who met before the race, appealed for his warmth with the race to host the Tianqing Island: five years ago the international limit sailship series had its own accidental injury, broken muscles, and thanks to the handling of the local race medical team, he was able to stand on the field today, five years later.
According to the information received, the International Expeditions Series, which was launched in 2007, is a world sail league event known as the Volvo, the American Cup and the World sailboats against the Tours.
The Aoshima Station competition will use the FlyingPhantom.
The year 2018 was the eighth year in which the race landed on Qingdao Island, the capital of the sailboats, and Qingdao Station was also the time to take office in the series.
Despite the worldwide financial market shocks, the Hong Kong Financial Authority reported on Monday that foreign exchange fund investment revenues fell significantly by 97 per cent each year in the third quarter of this year, but were better than in the previous quarter, and that foreign exchange losses were significantly reduced owing to the rise in overseas shares during the China-United States trade war.
According to the Agency's latest data, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$ 1.6 billion in July-September 2018, which is significantly lower than HK$ 61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$ 100 million in the second quarter of this year.
In the Legislative Assembly, the Managing Director of the Gold Administration, Chen Deok-hyun, stated that at the beginning of the China-United States trade war, the Hong Kong and emerging market stock indices ran counter to the United States stock index and that until late September and early October, when the United States stock market index peaked, market sentiment began to reverse, as investors became aware that the trade war was adversely affecting the United States itself.
“A change in market sentiment is a good thing, and if the trade war has only a one-sided impact, it will not help to solve the problem.”
At the same time, he pointed out that “if the US-China trade war fails, the volatility of financial markets will continue to rise.”
During the third quarter of this year, foreign exchange funds lost between HK$8 and HK$4.7 billion in equity investments compared to the previous quarter, while overseas shares earned between HK$172 and HK$12.8 billion; foreign exchange losses between HK$16.2 billion and bond gains of HK$9.7 billion, respectively, by 24 and 31 per cent per quarter, reflecting mainly the general rise in the dollar against major currencies during the season and the three-point rise in the United States rate of fruits in mid-September.
Foreign exchange funds are mainly used to support the HK$.
The Hong Kong dollar-to-dollar linked exchange rate system has been in place since 1983.
With regard to the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Deok-hyun stated that while economic and asset market uncertainty had increased and downside risks had increased, the Hong Kong financial system was robust and resilient.
“Hong Kong’s international investment position, with a net external asset value of $1.4 trillion equal to four times GDP, 2.5 times higher than Singapore’s and 0.6 times higher than Japan’s, is sufficient to cope with a downward or reversal of the economy.”
In recent years, Hong Kong dollar debundling has continued to fall and has increased its dollar spread. Chen Dejong noted that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate had risen by more than 400 basis points on 21 September, and that the market was generally perceived to be related mainly to the rise in the Hong Kong dollar debundling, followed by the United States dollar pegging around 7.80-7.84, the recent decline in the Hong Kong dollar debundling rate and the widening of the United States dollar interest spread could attract the market to the Hong Kong dollar and increase interest-saling activities in the United States dollar, thus giving the Hong Kong dollar a greater chance of triggering weaker parties' exchange assurances again than in the previous period.
However, he is of the view that, with the start of the Hong Kong Bank interest increase cycle and the normalization of Hong Kong dollar interest rates, future rates of lower Hong Kong dollar interest rates will change.
“The trend in Hong Kong dollar interest rates will be more consistent with that of the United States dollar, and more care will have to be taken to manage risks and prepare for market fluctuations.”
Due to the abundance of the HK$, the Hong Kong dollar cutbacks were further reduced by 0.9 to 2.08179 per cent on the first of three months, the difference between the 46 basis points and the US dollar was increased from 51 basis points to the five-month low and the difference between the 120 basis points and the US dollar was expanded from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate was close to 7.85 to the United States dollar for most of the time.
During this period, exchange assurances for weaker parties were triggered several times in May and August, after they were first triggered in April, as a result of arbitrage activities and the partial withdrawal of shares from Hong Kong dollars after the completion of large-scale equity campaigns.
The Hong Kong dollar was purchased by the Authority at 7.85 levels in accordance with the associated exchange rate regime and the United States dollar was sold in order to maintain stability in the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
The Authority purchased approximately HK$52.1 billion in May and August under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism.
Does the new tax law offer advantages to persons outside the country?
In response to a 30-day question from a journalist, the relevant head of the Department of Finance and Tax Administration indicated that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law would be to consider the continuation of preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong and Macao.
Journalists have asked that the newly revised Personal Income Tax Act adjusts the rate for taxpayers of our individual income tax residents from one full year to 183 days.
Are there any preferential arrangements for persons outside Hong Kong, including Hong Kong and Macao, as the next step in the implementation of the Act?
In response, the Officer-in-Charge stated that the implementing regulations of the current personal income tax law provide for special benefits for the payment of taxes to persons outside China. Individuals who do not have a residence in China but who have resided for more than one year or more than five years may pay personal income tax only in respect of a portion of the income paid by a unit or individual in China.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new Personal Income Tax Act would be to consider the continuation of preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong and Macao.
There are no “threshold” monthly centres: quality certification leads to quality improvement.
With the growth of the “two-child economy” and the prosperity of the mother-child market, the city has grown from the north up to the three-to-four-line cities, and every part of the country has grown into a variety of monstrosity centres.
The popular demand for consumption was met by the active Moon Club at the present time, with fees ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, but at the same time in an awkward position, an institution that so far had no threshold and there were gaps in supervision.
A series of national “Quality Months” 2018 has recently been launched by the General Directorate of State Market Supervision, and journalists have come to a five-star moon centre in Tianjin City to visit the certification experience of mother and child care services.
The general monthly centres provide services such as neonatal care, nutritious meals, postnatal rehabilitation and plasticization.
In this monthly centre, journalists observed that nurses check the breastfeeding of newborns on a daily basis, and professional caregivers provide intensive care services such as bathing and touching for newborns.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of the new mothers, the mothers are helped to recover their positions by providing services such as early care for the wounds of the first and later months of the month, as well as nursing programmes such as Chinese medicine and beauty treatment.
A new mother living in the house told the journalist that she had not been able to book the moonshine club until eight months earlier.
The services of the Moon House have a direct impact on the comfort and physical recovery of the mother during the period of the month. Some of the small Moon Clubs can only provide simple monthly services. There are health irregularities in disinfection, vulnerability to cross-infection and problems of a single non-scientific diet.
The head of the Moonko Centre said that they were the only one in all five-star Moon Koko centres in Tianjin City to be certified as a B-class service.
“Although some clients did not initially understand the meaning of B-level certification, it was important for the long-term development of an enterprise to benefit from rigorous standardized process management through certification.” He said.
The Deputy Director-General of the Department of Accreditation and Supervision of the General Directorate of State Market Supervision, Panreiven, said that certification of services was a new certification system based on customer perception, concern for organizational quality management and the satisfaction of service characteristics. It was an important component of the country's quality infrastructure and had a positive role in increasing the share of quality service provision and enhancing the international competitiveness of China's services.
Since 2004, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has undergone a process of continuous and progressive development, with the emergence of a number of influential services, such as financial service certification, certification of mother and child care services, certification of after-sales services, certification of e-commerce services and certification of health services.
According to the General Directorate of State Market Supervision, there are currently more than 130 service certification bodies, more than 2,000 service certification officers and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates in the country.
Panreivin stated that the development of service certification should be further guided and promoted by the gradual expansion of service certification coverage in the areas of health, education, sports, finance, electricity suppliers and the promotion of service supply side reform and quality improvement.
Reuter Hong Kong, 5 November - The Hong Kong building fell for two months after it peaked. Chen Deok-hyun, Managing Director of the Hong Kong Financial Authority, stated on Monday that it would take time to see whether the city had entered the downward cycle and, if confirmed, to consider a tightening policy of easing countercyclical measures at the appropriate time.
Chen Deok-yung added that, if the price of the building were to return, the first people to be affected would be those who would be in business at the peak of the market, but the expected price of the building, as in the case of the Asian financial storm of 1997, would fall sharply and the opportunities for citizens to cut down significantly on the sale of their property would be much lower.
In a briefing to the Legislative Council, Chen Deok-hyun led a number of senior members of the Kim Bureau, who said that if it was confirmed that the city was entering a downward cycle, the measure could be eased at the appropriate time.
“However, it is still too early to relax when only a few weeks of data are seen to see whether the city is going down the cycle.”
Since October 2009, the Authority has introduced eight rounds of countercyclical measures to boost bank risk management and earthquake resilience by significantly tightening mortgages in all categories of property, including by reducing the number of mortgages and requiring mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests.
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest-raising cycle, the price index for private residential buildings for the whole of Hong Kong fell for two months in August-September, and the monthly decline increased to 1.44 per cent in September.
But the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of the year was 10.2%.
According to the Monetary Authority, the financial situation of households measuring their resilience to financial risks remains healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of households without mortgages in Hong Kong reached 66 per cent, up from an average of 60 per cent in 2009-11; the average number of new mortgages was 47 per cent and the ratio of new mortgages to revenue was 34 per cent, a marked improvement from 64 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively, in 2009-11.
Chen Deok-yung stated, however, that high seismic resistance did not mean that the economically disadvantaged would not suffer, as property valuations would fall and those who bought buildings at the peak would bear the brunt.
Although the Authority tightens bank lending to mortgage lenders, mortgage lenders can also obtain high-value mortgage lending through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans from developers.
Chen Deok-yung indicated that at present, together with mortgage lending to developers, borrowers can pay 85-90 per cent of mortgages, and that if building prices fall by 10 per cent, negative assets (i.e. property market value drops below the level of total outstanding mortgage loans) will emerge.
However, the Vice-President of the Monetary Authority, Nguyen Guoh-hung, noted that the authorities estimated that the total amount of mortgages provided by developers was only 2 - 2.5 per cent of the total amount of bank mortgages, which remained low.
At the peak of Hong Kong's negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, representing 22 per cent of the supply population.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive seasons.
On 1 October, Xinhua Xinhua's electricity (Lu Hongxia, Mawe) retail e-commerce export firms welcomed another wave of negative tax returns on 1 October, involving value added tax (VAT) and consumer tax (CAT) exemptions.
The Ministry of Finance, the National Directorate of Taxation, the Ministry of Commerce and the General Customs Department have recently issued a joint communication stating that the VAT/CAT tax exemption policy is being implemented on a trial basis for exporting goods that are not supported by valid import certificates to electric power exporters in the integrated cross-border e-commerce pilot zone, provided that the following conditions are met.
First, e-commerce exporting enterprises are registered in the CZZ and register export dates, goods names, unit of measure, quantity, unit price, amount on the integrated services platform on the cross-border e-commerce line of the place of registration.
Second, export declarations for e-commerce are processed through the customs offices where the CSI region is located.
Third, the export goods do not belong to the Ministry of Finance and the Directorate-General of Taxes, pursuant to a decision of the State Council, to explicitly cancel the export of goods for which the tax is (exempted) from taxes.
It is clear from the circular that the General Customs Service regularly transmits electronic information on the E-Commerce Export Declaration List to the National Tax Administration.
The tax authorities of the Comprehensive Test Zones strengthen the tax-exempt management of export goods on the basis of electronic information from the Export Goods Declaration List, which is cleared by the National Tax Administration.
The circular states that specific tax exemptions are administered by the provincial tax administrations, the finance and commerce sectors.
Inter-sectoral collaboration and related policy implementation should be promoted in an integrated manner by the leadership team offices and business authorities in the integrated pilot zones to accelerate the establishment of a system for monitoring e-commerce export statistics and to facilitate the rapid development of cross-border e-commerce.
A man in Liaoning province killed his lover and dumped his body, after which he fled to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
On 5 May, the journalist was informed by the Public Security Bureau of the East Victory District of Ordos, Inner Mongolia, that the man had been successfully captured following a joint police investigation between the two regions.
On 26 June 2018, a female disappeared in the city of Saddle Hill, Liaoning province, and her family reported her disappearance to the local police.
Following a police investigation, it was found that this was not a simple case of disappearance and that there was a high risk that the missing person would be killed by a lover, and the police set up a special unit for further investigation.
On 30 October, the task force found out that the suspect Wang may have been hiding in the East Victory District of the city of Ordos and that the police immediately organized a strong police force to cooperate fully with the Liaoning police in the detection of the case.
After five days of investigation, the civilian police finally figured out the location of Wang Yi and detailed their associates.
On 4 November, the two police forces joined forces to capture the suspect, Wang, at an excavator fittings shop in Dong Shing District.
According to Wang, he had a relationship with the victim's lover, who had a large sum of money deposited under his name, and they decided to take it for themselves.
On 22 June 2018, after a disagreement between Wang and Paik over the disposition of the funds, the King proceeded to kill White in the rented house and to dump the body.
At present, the suspect Wang has been handed over to the Liaoning Hill Police.
"Green Development in Action" of the "Five Developments: A Better Emblem"
The second column of the "Five Developments, Better Emblems" — the "Green Development in Action" — was officially launched on 5th.
In order to provide a comprehensive picture of the excellent results of the construction of the "Five Developments, Better Emblems", the "Five Developments, Better Emblems" series of train trains was designed jointly by the Homogene City Orbital Corporation and the Golden Ribbon Media Technology Corporation.
Among them, the first train — the “Innovation in Action” — was officially launched on 1 October on Track 1 in Homogene City.
The theme train on the line selected the blue green modulus that symbolized mountain water, reflecting the birth engine, vitality and purity.
The campaign focused on the core ideas of the “Five Developments: A Better Emblem” and 18 representative examples of green development outcomes in the province, including the construction of green development priorities such as the Jianghua Canal Project, the Long Forest System, the Yangtze Economic Zone Conservation Development, and the Ten Million Acre Forest Growth Project.
In addition, the “Coordination of development in action”, “Open development in action” and “Shared development in action” trains will be on the line in the near future.
On October 1, the first day of the Hong Kong National Day and the last day of the Hong Kong National Day public holiday, many Mainlanders took advantage of the holidays to travel and shop, many Hong Kong residents returned to Hong Kong on that day, and there was a flow of “blast sheds” at the Shenzhen ports. Twenty-two self-help crossings were opened at the Lake Lo and Shenzhen Bay crossings to improve port clearance efficiency and facilitate efficient and expeditious clearance of passengers.
According to the data provided by the Shenzhen General Inspectorate, at 1600 hours the same day there were more than 429,000 departures and departures from the Shenzhen port, more than 168,000 vehicles (lines, racks and columns), and the ports remained busy and maintained a good order of entry and exit.
It is understood that, owing to a number of positive factors, such as the increase in the number of countries offering exit waivers to Chinese citizens, there has been a steady increase in the number of tourists taking advantage of national holidays for resort shopping in countries such as Europe and South-East Asia.
In the early morning hours of 1 January, the crossing points of Lo Lake, Shenzhen Bay, Wang Guo and Fukuda reached their peaks, with the peaks continuing from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. and the Shenzhen crossing from 6.30 a.m. to 13 p.m.
It was reported that, in response to the peak flow of incoming and outgoing passengers (cars), the Shenzhen border General Inspectorate station was deployed in accordance with the National Immigration Administration in an integrated manner, initiating the passenger (car) peak hour service model, arranging overtime police to support the first line of duty, opening advance foot-checking routes, directing passengers and vehicles to ensure that China's citizens'entry and exit customs clearance queues do not exceed 30 minutes, taking into account the efficiency of customs clearance for foreigners, and strengthening the maintenance of order in high-flow areas and ensuring the safe and orderly passage of customs.
The General Inspectorate at Shenzhen also reminds incoming and outgoing passengers of the validity of their documents and visas and notes before travelling, to make reasonable arrangements for travel, to avoid peak periods of passenger flows and to choose the right time and the right port of exit.
Passengers travelling to Hong Kong by high speed train in Hiroshima are required to carry valid entry/exit documents and a visa. These tickets are issued only by car and cannot be used as an entry/exit document. If they are unable to leave Hong Kong due to, inter alia, non-compliance with documentation procedures, they must follow the guidelines of the Border Guard and wait to be taken to a designated location by the staff of the Hong Kong Railway Company to facilitate their return to the Mainland.
Systematic haemorrhagic ailments, which were considered to be “irresistible”.
The lack of effective treatment prevents treatment because of the lack of clear mechanisms for its occurrence, the difficulties of treatment and the lack of effective treatment.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the Life Sciences Institute at Qinghua University, and Chewie Chim Tsumi, Director of the Vishni Immunization Centre at the Beijing University Hospital, jointly discovered the presence of human immunoglobin and its involvement in the regulation of immune B cells, which increases the susceptibility of systemic red frenziage to haemorrhagic hemorrhoids.
In short, both teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body was an important cause of systemic haemorrhagic disease.
According to one of the authors of the article, Sun Xiaojun of the Greater North People's Hospital, the Chestnut Nation team collected and studied nearly 2,000 cases of systematic haemorrhagic haemorrhagic ailments and found that patients with immunoglobin mutations produced a wide range of their own antibodies, and that the incidence and severity of diseases such as nephritis, arthritis, mammothitis, vascularitis, etc. had increased significantly.
The Liu Wanli team, through various research methods such as immuno-cell trace, animal trials, sequencing etc., discovered the path of immune signals activated by this immuno-molecular mutation, and the pathogenic mechanisms that promote the partition of B cells into multiple self-resistances.
Journalists learned that the two teams were strong and united, taking full advantage of their respective strengths and bringing basic research and clinical applications closer together.
The Liu Wanli team is working on the Blymphocyte immuno-immunisation study, while the Chestnut Nation team is engaged in long-term clinical research on systematic red-coupled lupus.
“The study is one of the results of years of collaboration between the two teams, and it is the first time that the academic community has institutionally recognized that immunoglobin genetic anomalies will induce systemic haemorrhagic ailments, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeting.”
It is not a matter of protection, but of the law.
The lawyer's in court with the ax?
The news was indeed exciting at first sight, and it also blew up in the legal circle.
The Fujian Quan City Central Law subsequently fined the lawyers involved $500 and recommended in writing that the Quan Quan City Bar Association conduct an investigation.
According to the Newjing newspaper, the former City Council of Quan County issued an official circular stating that the actions of the two lawyers did not involve violations of the law and were not punishable under the law.
According to multiple reports, the handling by the Quanzhou City Bar is not short-lived or confrontational, but is endorsed by the Quanzhou Middle Court.
An incident that could have triggered tensions within the legal community was finally properly resolved.
The reversal of events stems from a more complete return to the truth: the axes carried by the lawyers involved are identical to the murder weapon of the accused, of the same type, but not of the same type, and are supported by evidence only at the evidentiary level, without any intimidation or subjective intent “to endanger the safety of the court”.
There are four very important details to determine whether the lawyer's conduct was in violation of the law: first, the local court held two previous sessions, with only an axe photo showing, which, from the defence's point of view, was necessary; second, the axe was purchased only an hour before the hearing, not because the lawyer was unwilling to seek the judge's consent, but objectively failed to reach the judge; third, the axe was not used unduly or improperly; and fourth, the lawyer in question publicly acknowledged the error at the first time and apologized to the court.
Combining these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer involved “was present in court with an axe” was not involved in the offence, but merely in the defence.
After clarifying the facts, the City Council of Quan did not go to work, but took the decision without punishment, despite pressure.
This decision, in turn, is subject to the test of fact and law.
It is true that, without the court's permission, the ax to be brought to the court as a control knife can be a source of anxiety and misunderstanding.
For reasons of safety and caution, previous fines and judicial recommendations by the Quanzhou Central Court are no exception.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from making lawyers difficult, the Supreme Law issued the Rules on Security Inspection of the Judicial Police of the People's Courts in 2014, which establishes the principle that lawyers are not required to carry out physical security checks when appearing before a court.
Since the issuance of the rule, a wide range of lawyers have led by example, and few incidents have occurred that endanger the safety of the Tribunal as a result of security loopholes.
In very isolated cases such as the one in Quanzhou, it is easy to dispel misunderstandings as long as they are communicated in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
The Bar Association, as a self-regulatory organization in the legal profession, has a dual mandate of disciplinary misconduct and guarantees of legality.
In the past, IAJOs have suffered from severe illness due to their bias towards discipline and lack of security.
The decisions of the Quan State Bar, both in terms of process and outcome, are commendable and serve as an example for more members of the Bar to perform their duties properly.
From October 1st, which tax revenues will affect our money bags?
The Xinhua Society's new personal income tax law of 1 October 2010 in Shanghai (journalist Sanju) will come into effect on 1 January 2019. In order for the public at large to benefit from the tax bonus as soon as possible, from 1 October the actual salary income earned by taxpayers will be deducted at the starting point of $5,000 per month and a new tax scale will be applied.
What are the advantages and benefits that would affect the population along with the New Deal?
Good one: significant tax deductions from wages and salaries
Taxpayers who receive wages after 1 October can deduct the basic deduction of $5,000/month and apply the new tax scale. Most taxpayers have different degrees of tax deductions, especially for low- and middle-income persons.
According to the tax reduction table for the different income groups, the monthly income after the deduction of the “triple risk” amounts to $8,000, $10,000, $20,000 and $50,000. The tax adjustment amounts to $90, 290, 1590 and $9090 respectively. The corresponding rates of tax deductions are 73.9 per cent, 61.1 per cent, 49.0 per cent and 18.8 per cent, respectively, as compared with the starting point of $350 per cent.
It is worth noting that, for the purpose of holidays, the salaries that were to have been paid by law in October at the end of September are subject to the application of a new basic scale of deductions and tax rates.
To this end, the collection client software, which is widely used by the tax authorities, has provided the corresponding tax calculation functionality, but the corresponding taxes still have to be reported for payment within the statutory filing period.
Good two: the low-tax grade is significantly larger.
In addition to raising the point of origin, a new tax scale will be applied as of 1 October.
There has been no change in the current payroll, the seven tranches of the payroll and the previous ones, but there has been a marked change in the tariff range, with 3%, 10% and 20% of the three lower tariff bands significantly expanded, while 25% of the tariff range has been reduced, while 30%, 35% and 45% of the three higher taxes have remained unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax code also adjusts the tax rates derived from production operations, with the threshold of 35 per cent of the ceiling being raised from $100,000 to $500,000.
This means that both individual business owners and individual sole proprietors will benefit from tax changes.
“As far as previous tax cuts for individual taxpayers in Shanghai are concerned, the dividends of individual tax reforms will be fully felt by a wide range of taxpayers, especially among low- and middle-income people.”
The head of the personal income tax division of the Shanghai Municipal Revenue Service of the National Revenue Authority, Ramin, stated that
Three benefits: tax services are easier and better optimized
Since the promulgation of the new Personal Income Tax Act, the tax authorities of Shanghai City have carried out a series of comprehensive and wide-ranging tax campaigns.
On the one hand, “one-to-one-point” policy advice is provided to priority tax sources and priority enterprises.
The Pudong New District Revenue Authority has visited large enterprises such as Apple Trading (Shanghai) Ltd., Pay Bo (China) Network Technology Ltd., and the Red Star Keilong Family Group Ltd., which have a large number of employees, large surrogate payments, large tax payments, voluntary mentoring by the tax authorities, questions and answers; and the Xu Hing District Revenue Authority has visited the Central Intelligence and Finance Consulting Company, China Intelligence Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Corporation, among others, in the region, to collect business concerns in a timely manner, respond to business demands and resolve business difficulties.
On the other hand, a tax policy of “fullness, multidimensionality and stereotypicity” is implemented for the general public taxpayers.
The timely delivery of policy hot spots through the Shanghai official tax website, Weibo Public, Weibo etc. to ensure that policy advocacy is in place.
At the same time, on 28 September, the Shanghai Tax Micro-Intelligent Public Information Platform 12366 was launched to provide an integrated “target-to-target” tax reform promotion service through the “man-to-intellectual” tax service counselling.
On the evening of Beijing 4 p.m. on November 5th, China-News Network officially announced that former England team leader Rooney would return to England to fight for the United States team on November 15th.
In August last year, Rooney announced his withdrawal from the England National Team.
Rooney was the first shot in the history of the team and the second in history.
According to reports released by the Network, this game with the United States team was to raise money for Runy's Children's Charity Foundation, and Rooney himself was very excited: “It's nice to be fighting England again in Wimbley, thanking Sosgate and the Senior Master for inviting me to help my foundation.

With the widespread introduction of large-scale seedlings in the towns and cities of Pakistan, this year's floodgate crabs are much larger than before.
The crab farmers who have been dealing with crabs for almost 20 years have been planning to export to Thailand crab seedlings and breeding techniques for the silting lake crabs, to allow for the crossing of the watery country foods across national borders and to promote cultural exchanges with the overseas cuisine.
The town of Quinque is a cultural sign in the city of Ba.
At present, there are 1,300 hotels and restaurants with crabs, fisher lights, spring and fall water cities, crabs on the lake, five crab markets in the Jeopardy market, and food and cuisine around the lake gates, and there are more than half-assed crabs than the coloured crabs, and the car and dragons at the peak of the passenger flow are a unique landscape.

The Trilateral Trade Agreement between the United States of America and the United States of America will bring new opportunities to 500 million people.
According to external sources, a joint statement by Foreign Minister Freeland of Canada and the United States Trade Representative Letheze, published on the Canadian Government's website, stated that the United States, Canada and Mexico had entered into a tripartite trade agreement, which would be known as “USMCA” (the USMCA agreement).
Previously, CTV News television Canada quoted senior sources from the United States as saying that Canada and the United States had overcome their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post quoted two sources who reported that the agreement reached on 30 September between the United States and Canada would retain the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a tripartite trade agreement and that the three heads of State would sign a new agreement within two months.
“Today, Canada, the United States, and Mexico have agreed on a new trade agreement – the USMCA – which will provide our workers, farmers, and companies with a high standard of trade agreement that will lead to freer markets, fairer transactions, and more sustainable economic growth. The agreement will strengthen the middle class, create high-paying jobs, and create new opportunities for some 500 million people.”
According to the information received, the existing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
Following the inauguration of the President, Trump announced plans to reconsider the agreement and sign a new agreement.
The three countries started the negotiation process in 2017.
The Okinawa Supervisory Council election, which was held in advance of the death of the former Governor, Yukio Yoo, was announced in the early morning of 1 local time, with the successful election of Danny of the Yuzhmorgeologiya, who opposed the relocation plan of the United States military base in Japan.
The final results of the vote cast on 30 September showed that the city had obtained 396,632,000 votes, the highest in the history of the Okinawa District Governor's election, and that it had more than 80,000 votes more than its main contestant, Jok Jin.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a turnout of 63.24 per cent, a decrease of 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 Okinawa Prefectural Election.
According to the media on 1 January, the results of the election showed that the people of the county did not want to let the Governor's efforts to survive wasted, that he would continue to work with the Governments of Japan and the United States against the relocation of the United States military base and the closure of the Panchaun base, among other things.
The U.S. military base, located in Ieno Bay, Okinawa County, has been plagued by a long-standing illness, and the Japanese-American Government had previously agreed to relocate it to the bordery areas of the city, but the people of Okinawa strongly opposed it, hoping to move the base completely out of Okinawa.
On the other hand, with regard to the relocation plan, which was strongly opposed by the people of the counties, and the withdrawal of the land-filling permit on the coast of the border, the city stated that it had not been in opposition to and divided with the central Government at the outset, and hoped that the two sides would have a full exchange of views that would demonstrate their intention to reach a negotiated settlement.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also expressed to the media in the morning that he took this outcome seriously and that he would make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and ease the burden on the base.
At a press conference on 1 January, Japan Chief of Staff Yu Yi Wei said that there had been no change in the Government's approach to moving United States military bases as soon as possible.
At the same time, he expressed his intention to meet with the city.
On 4 this month, the city will officially assume its functions as Governor of Okinawa County.
Since the mid-2000s, Paul Thomas, a farmer from North Dakota State in the United States, has grown more soybeans in his land as Chinese demand for oil seeds has grown.
This shift peaked this year with 1,600 acres of soybeans planted in 5,000 acres, an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and a lot of farmers like him plan to turn in 2019 to the former United States agricultural areas for staple crops: maize and wheat.
For the first time in 35 years, farmers in the United States have grown more soybeans this year than maize.
Other food crops are planned because American farmers are facing difficulties in selling soybeans against the backdrop of the trade war launched by United States President Trump against China.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of United States soybean exports, but in recent months almost zero United States soybean purchases have resulted in soybean prices falling to a decade low as a result of trade wars.
Thomas intends to grow more wheat next year, hoping to earn more by reducing dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Thomas says that soybean prices “do us a painful blow”.
He stated that, without the Chinese purchases, the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per futon, while the price necessary to cover the cost was $8.50.
Farmers in the United States recorded a record high in soybean cultivation this year, and the harvest is expected to reach a record high.
At such a time of vulnerability, they were hit by a trade war.
In July, China imposed import duties on imports of soybeans from the United States in response to Trump's imposition of additional tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.
The United States Department of Agriculture will issue its first estimate of the area to be cultivated next year, which will include consideration of tariff implications.
This estimate is expected to confirm the expected reduction in soybean soybean soybean cultivation by private institutions.
According to a report by Reuters, Informa Economics projected an increase of 4 to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in maize cultivation in 2019 and a decrease of 7 to 83 million acres in soybean cultivation on 19 October.
Informa also expects a 4% increase in wheat cultivation in the United States.
The area of soybean planted prior to the imposition of retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, some 15 million acres more than 10 years ago.
The area under maize cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008, to 89.1 million acres. This year, the area under wheat cultivation is 47.8 million acres, the lowest level in 100 years.
Aaron Carlson, head of the Illinois Corn Growing Association, has a total area of 3,600 acres under his own cultivation, and this year nearly half of him is used for soybean cultivation, but it is planned to reduce it in the future.
He claims that he may have increased maize cultivation by up to 20 per cent on his farm in northern Illinois, the largest soybean State in the United States.
Soybeans produce less than maize per acre but require less fertilizer, which makes soybean cultivation generally less costly.
The transfer of farmers to final maize may raise costs, but will benefit a number of enterprises, including Andersons Inc. Fertilizers.
Executive Director Pat Bowe of Andersons stated to Reuters that he expected that the conversion of maize would be beneficial for fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the conversion of farmers to maize.
The Director-General of the Santilawa airport administration in Bangkok, Thailand, held a press conference on 29 September to apologize for the beating of a Chinese citizen at the airport and to say that Thailand welcomed Chinese tourists and that the authorities would strengthen their management, raise awareness of services and avoid similar incidents.
It was reported that, on 27 June, security guards at the airport in Toonman had physically clashed with a Chinese man who had been denied entry into the country.
Sutilava stated that the security guards involved had committed serious misconduct and had been suspended from duty by the Airports Authority, and that a Board of Inquiry had been established to investigate the matter in accordance with the procedure, and that the security guards would be dismissed if the facts were correct.
The Thai Immigration Service has now arranged for the man to return to China by air.
Sutilawa apologized for this incident, which tarnished Thailand's image, and said that the Thai side attached great importance to the matter, was willing to do its utmost to mitigate the impact of the incident on the tourists who had been beaten, and would send a letter of apology to the person concerned through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that the airport was willing to facilitate Chinese visitors to Thailand and that the Thai Immigration Service had established special access routes for Chinese tourists at the five major Thai international airports in Bangkok, namely Suvanapur, Sunman, Chiang Mai, Puji and Yoai.
The next step, he said, would be for the Airport Authority to overhaul the area of the site sign-off, to indicate the cost of the sign-off and to improve the quality of services and communication capacity of the staff.
When the Chinese Embassy in Thailand became aware of the incident, the first contact was made with the person concerned to learn what had happened.
At the same time, the Head of the Thai Immigration Service, the Airports Authority and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports made representations to the Thai side to investigate the incident thoroughly and to severely punish the perpetrators, and will continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side in order to properly deal with the matter and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the persons concerned.
Xinhua International Times Review: To defend multilateralism, China is one and the same.
The international rules and the multilateral order were being shaken at a time when unilateralism was inflaming.
To some extent, unilateralism and multilateralism have entered a critical period.
As a responsible Power, China has joined the international community in upholding multilateralism and promoting it as it continues to move forward, in keeping with the ideals of greatness and commonwealth and strong action.
In the face of new challenges in the new situation, China has made a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
As the State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi said in his address to the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should be based on a cooperative win-win approach, based on a rule-based order, based on equity and justice and guided by effective action.
At the same time, China called for a global development cooperation architecture complemented by the United Nations and North-South cooperation, and South-South cooperation, and called on all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As President Espinosa said at the 73rd session of the General Assembly, in the current circumstances, “the United Nations needs more than ever to promote multilateralism and uphold a rules-based international system”.
The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Lagarde, said that the international community should remain steadfast in upholding the multilateral trading system, upholding the rules of international trade and resolving differences through consultations.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the political power of the global economy, a number of emerging markets and groups of developing countries have emerged to play a greater role in the main international multilateral mechanisms and to provide a new dynamic for the development of counter-winding multilateralism.
Standing on this scale, China's advocacy of building a large family, rather than collating small circles, adhering to the idea of multilateralism, such as co-convening rather than winning, is an inescapable choice to meet global challenges and solve the world's problems, representing the common claim of the majority of the world's countries.
There are advanced ideas and more solid actions.
China's “one-way” initiative had become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China has launched international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the one-way street, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the 16+1 Cooperation to promote international regional cooperation, complement the existing international system and order, bring new dynamism to multilateral cooperation and contribute to the development of a more just and equitable international order.
As the guardian of the international order and the implementer of multilateralism, China's actions have become increasingly strong in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices in international hot spots, combating climate change, participation in peacekeeping operations, strong efforts to reduce poverty and reduce poverty and help other countries to implement the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Guterres, has said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the world faces a “trust deficit” and populism and polarization rises, it is at a time when the world's need for multilateral cooperation is most pressing.
At such a historic juncture, the international community needs to join hands in translating consensus into action, firmly defending multilateralism and working together to build a community of human destinies.
On 30 September, the first national standard 4K demonstration area in Guangdong, Guangzhou, was unveiled in the Jinjin Garden area of Haeju District in Guangzhou City. On that day, the 4K operation of the Guangdong electricity network was officially launched in Guangdong Province, and the ceremony of the 4K super-highlight channel in Guangdong Province, the central radio and television station, was held in parallel.
The event was co-sponsored by the Guangdong Cable Radio and Television Network Ltd. and the co-building co-management and shared social governance leadership group in the Great Pond area of the Haiju region.
Based on the deployment of the Guangdong provincial government, Guangdong Guangbo Network actively implemented the 4K Action Plan for the new digital family. In December 2017, the first national digital family demonstration area in support of IPv6 was launched, and the first national Broadband initiative in support of 4K's new digital family gateway end product, "U Point Family Server" (with AVS2 standard 4K boxes, telecommunications remote control), to accelerate the construction of 4K ultra-high video, next-generation Internet and cable wireless integration network applications, and to participate actively in the construction of 4K television network application demonstration areas in Guangdong province.
In 2018, the Guangdong Wide Power Network launched a series of wide-banded initiatives for the benefit of the people and launched the “4K Service Month” to promote the full range of “U Point Home Servers” throughout the province.
On the same day, the Guangdong Guangbo Network 4K operation was officially launched and the first 4K smart television home sharing platform based on the application of 4K was officially launched. The platform, which was developed jointly by the Guangdong Highline Co-Governance Social Governance Leadership Group Office and the Haiju Pond Region, is based on the Toguangdong Guangbo Network's 4K U-point family server, the new generation of intelligent family services based on cable television networks and the integration of government-related welfare services, aimed at providing citizens with a television sharing platform that integrates public information, education, human welfare, human welfare and entertainment services.
Chen Xiaoging, Chief Engineer of the Guangdong Public Information and Electricity Agency, stated that the event was a useful collaboration between the Centre for the Government of the Party's Committee for the Active Services of the Wireless Network and the Government's active use of “Internet+” to create a “digital government” for the benefit of the population. It was hoped that, through cooperation and outreach, the Guangdong Wide Power Network would help build a model of shared social governance in the Hai Joo district, Guangzhou and the province as a whole.
A new digital family application, with 4K TV at its core, was shown and made widely available at the ceremony.
The first edition of the "4K Smart TV Home-to-House " platform will feature four modules: "Guangzhou Street", "New Guangzhou Home", "Wise Communities" and "Wise Families" to explore the building of intelligent neighbourhoods.
According to the information received, the Guangdong Radio Network now operates five 4K live channels, and on the same day the National Day will be the exclusive broadcast of the Central Radio and Television General Channel 4K super-highlight channels throughout the province.
The report reads as follows: 30 September is the fifth national anniversary of martyrs.
At 10 a.m. on the same day, the Xi Near Equality Party and national leaders joined representatives from all walks of life in the capital to attend a ceremony to honour the people's heroes and honour their martyrs.
A quick review of the situation: this is the first anniversary since the implementation of our Heroed Martyrs Protection Act.
Five years ago, five years ago, on the eve of the National Day of Remembrance of the Martyrs, the great journey of the Chinese nation from misery to glory, we woke up: “Where we come from, where we go”.
Xi’s secretary-general pointed out in depth that “the abandonment of tradition is tantamount to the cutting off of one’s own psyche.”
"Don't forget history to open up the future."
We honour heroes and remember martyrs in order to remember history forever, to keep the spirit of life alive and to rally the strong and positive energy of national renaissance.
Let's just say that strength is the backbone of the nation.
To honour the martyrs and to honour them is to make them noble, sacred and powerful eternal memories at the bottom of our hearts.
According to incomplete statistics, some 20 million martyrs have died heroically for their national independence, their liberation and their country's prosperity and their well-being.
Every sacrifice for his country will be remembered, and the spirit of every devoted nation will be looked upon.
The establishment of national days for them and the organization of various forms of observance are intended to pay tribute to them in the name of their countries, to pay deep tribute to their great service and to learn the precious spirit of their love for their homeland, loyalty to their people, selflessness and sacrifice.
The party committees at all levels of government have improved the system of preferential treatment and have continued to raise the level of pension treatment, and the party and the State have acted effectively to honour heroes.
Each year, countless people look at the memory of the martyrs, so that we can feel the deep feelings of popular remembrance and the momentum for recovery that has been raised in the blood of the nation.
Heroes, the defense of heroes, the learning of heroes, and the love of heroes prevail in society as a whole.
Finally, it is clear that today, when China’s special socialism enters a new era, we can tell the restless elites that a powerful China is rising in the East and that the Chinese dream of the great renaissance of the Chinese nation is turning into reality in our hands.
Let's move forward with a spirit of greatness and greatness!

The fifth Disability Voice Month is coming to focus on sexuality education for young people with disabilities.
In recent years, the subject of sexual education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenge for education for young people with disabilities remains daunting.
Recently, a workshop on challenges and strategies for comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities was held in Beijing.
Sexual education for children and young people with disabilities was an important topic of the seminar.
The report on sexual-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of disabled children and young people in China, published at the conference, showed that disabled children suffer from higher rates of sexual harassment and sexual abuse than healthy children.
Social attention to disabled children and adolescents is also “sexually protected”.
The purpose of the seminar was to explore the promotion of comprehensive sexuality education for children and adolescents with disabilities in China from the standpoint of family support, school education and institutional services, and to provide support to children and adolescents with disabilities from the source so that they can enjoy their right to love on an equal footing with others.
According to the experts, the awareness of the general public in Chinese society of the disabled population has been at an insufficient level of depth.
China's comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities, especially children and adolescents, is not sufficiently advanced, owing to factors such as traditional attitudes.
In recent years, however, with the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the public good, there has been a welcome development in the practice and path of comprehensive development of sexual and reproductive health education for persons with disabilities throughout the cycle in China.
The Report shows that children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical impairments, while having some difficulties in accessing sexual knowledge and understanding intimate relationships, have generally moved towards ease and enrichment.
The Seminar on the Challenges and Practical Strategies for Comprehensive Sexual Education for People with Disabilities, sponsored by the Shanghai Humanities Foundation and supported by UNESCO's representative office in China, the International Disability Alliance in Beijing (France) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in China, aims to explore ways of implementing sexual and reproductive health education practices and practices for the full cycle of comprehensive development of persons with disabilities in the context of a broad strategy for healthy China, and to promote awareness among stakeholders in the field of special education and integration education, educators, researchers, social service organizations, parents' representatives, etc., of international policies on comprehensive sexual education and the right to health of children and young people with disabilities; to engage in a broad exchange of sexual education practices, strategies, challenges and resources for children and young people with disabilities in the country, to discuss and develop a blueprint for future comprehensive sex education for children with disabilities and young people, and to form a support network.
Wednesday, 30 September, in Beijing, the Central Bank of China published data on the short-term net outflow of foreign currency assets, showing that, as of the end of August this year, the Bank’s foreign currency had zero forward and futures contracts for 12 months in a row.
According to the central bank's previous data, at the end of August last year, the central bank held a total of $6,044 million, or the fourth consecutive month, vacant positions for forward and futures contracts in foreign currencies; the size of the empty positions in the SDR (Special Drawing Rights) was 4,276 million SDRs.
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange forward position has been zero.
The central bank released the data for the first time at the end of March 2016; the data show that at the end of February 2016, the foreign currency of the central bank had a multi-position of $2,438 million in forward and futures contracts and $28.9 billion in empty positions.
For the first time, the September data released at the end of October of the same year showed a net increase of $16,401 million to $45,301 million.
The Central Bank has previously stated that foreign currency forward and futures empty positions in this currency largely reflect its foreign exchange forward operations with commercial banks to meet the demand for hedging of corporate foreign currency liabilities, and will continue to provide long-term risk-avoidance products on a demand-driven basis, with central bank forward operations having less impact on the size of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of 20 September this year, on the K158 train, Joe, a senior student in Chengzhou, took the car to the crane wall.
One of the masters on the train bought a ticket without a seat, but took her seat: "Take a picture of it."
Two hours away, the train captain persuaded him to remain ineffective for an hour.
Eventually, a male passenger in the same car couldn't look down and pull him up.
From the standpoint of bad faith, while the result is mostly public condemnation of the hegemonics, administrative punishments by the public security services, and even the blacklists of good faith, the public still feels that it is not “free of hatred”: why not let the hegemonics be punished on the spot?
Why can't they be punished in the first place, rather than in the second place, by preventing their immoral and even unlawful behaviour?
And how can a male passenger be dragged up by a male passenger for the unreasonable conduct of the Grand Priest?
This is mainly due to the fact that only long-distance trains are equipped with police officers and that short-distance trains are not generally available; even when they are available, they tend to worry about the possible rogue reaction of the hegemonics and do not resort to coercive removal measures.
Repeated hegemonic incidents have led to the realization that hegemonics must be forcibly removed from the scene and even punished in order to act as a deterrent.
This requires that our trains take robust measures in a timely manner and that the trains without them be deployed as soon as possible in order to ensure that violations are stopped and combated in a timely manner.
On 1 October, on the first day of the national holiday, there was a sharp increase in the number of vehicles travelling to Songpan, Mau County, via the Sichuan-North Trunchuan Autonomous District.
At around 1300 hours, a call for help was made to the Niekawa traffic police saying that their family had been in a traffic accident in Songpan and that, owing to the limited medical conditions in the area, there was an urgent need to send them to Mianyang for treatment.
A single-way traffic control was imposed on the Lake Tungjiang road in Kitchen, and the traffic police were asked to release the 120 first aid vehicles.
Upon receipt of a call for help, the civilian police on duty promptly reported the situation to the brigade, and immediately after the commander was briefed, he arranged for the civilian police officers on duty at the control point to contact the caller and requested that all efforts be made to provide the escort.
“There were more than a thousand vehicles entering the control section at that time, and after contacting 120 first aid vehicles, we were expected to arrive in Kitagawa at around 1500 hours, and we immediately arranged for their deployment.”
In order to prevent the traffic of vehicles that have entered this section of the road from running in parallel with the two rows of vehicles, the traffic police placed a block of control on the vehicle at the beginning, centre and end of the road one hour in advance, and reminded all passing drivers to leave the road on the other side of the road and to miscarry for the emergency vehicle.
Subsequently, the drumming squadron of civilian police also suspended their vehicles from entering the control section and queued for the 120 emergency vehicles that were about to arrive.
At 1500 hours, an ambulance with a Kawakami U licence plate entered the territory of Kitagawa and a police car was sent by the police to escort the ambulance back into the control section.
It is understood that only one vehicle is available in some areas of the road around the lake, and that the civilian police made early temporary control of those areas and ensured the smooth passage of the 120 emergency vehicles.
Upon arrival at the 10 miles of the village, there was a road that could not be wrongly ceded, so the traffic police contacted the village councils in advance, borrowed the village lane by detour and banned social vehicles from entering the village.
“it took only 40 minutes to get a 120 emergency vehicle from the Kitagawa traffic police to the normal road to 302 provincial road.”
Mr. Wei explained that, as a rule, it took four hours for the entire passage time to pass.
“This arrangement has successfully secured valuable treatment time for the patient.”
At 1720 hours, the patients at risk were said to have arrived in Mianyang in time for treatment.
The number of confirmed deaths due to the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose rapidly to 832 and the authorities fear that this number will rise, as relief workers have difficulty in providing assistance to remote areas that are no longer connected.
Of particular concern is the fact that this area, north of Baru, has a population of 300,000, close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Two other areas have lost contact with the outside world since Friday.
“We have not yet received reports from the other three regions.”
Communications and electricity continued to be disrupted.
Nugroho indicated that the missing persons included five foreigners, three of whom were French, one Korean and one Malaysian.
The earthquake and tsunami killed 832 people.
According to Vice-President Kara of Indonesia, the death toll is likely to rise to thousands.
Earlier, Indonesian President Zorko-Vidodo had surveyed the affected areas and called on the population to endure.
Reuters 4 November - The British Daily Telegraph Sunday reported that British Secretary of State for Europe, Dominic Raab, had privately requested Britain's right to “safe” arrangements outside the Irish border after three months.
Rabb was reported to have made this request to Simon Coveney, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Ireland, at a private meeting in London last Tuesday.
It was reported that this request was “manifestly contradictory” to the statement made three days later by British Cabinet Secretary David Lidington during his visit to Dublin.
The United Kingdom Department of Trade and Social Affairs indicated that it would not comment on private meetings.
Yesterday morning, at 8.05 a.m., two suspects of theft were arrested while the 20th bus was stealing from the 20th bus station at Yongding Gate to Pearl City.
Two of the men who stole the passengers cut off their outer clothes and stole 800 dollars in cash from them, leading to the capture of civilian police who had already been standing by.
This was the first case of theft by the Beijing police during the National Day.
Yesterday, at around 5 a.m., the counter-prosecution officers of the Beijing Public Security Mobile Investigation Unit arrived at their intended positions.
According to past experience, places where human flows are concentrated, public transport hubs, public transport subway lines, including those in Tiananmen Square watching flag-raising, are the focus areas of their work.
During the flow, civilian plainclothes officers watched the passers-by calmly.
At more than 7 a.m., two suspicious men were found by investigators who were at the bus station, following a male passenger who had been on a 20-way bus from the Yongding gate.
In the car, two suspicious men, one left and one right, caught the male passenger in the middle, one of whom tried to cover the other.
They did not know, however, that their actions were already in the eyes of civilian plainclothes officers who were watching.
“Kidnapping of thieves”, the plain-clothes civilian police caught people waiting for the men to commit the theft, and while they were waiting for the men to do so, the civilian police looked at the men who were ready to steal and were caught by the investigators as soon as they had been able to steal them.
Reporters from the Beijing Morning News observed that the civilian police had seized $800 in cash from suspects of theft.
"They took the money out of the passenger's pocket."
The civilian police, pointing to a broken jacket pocket, said: “They cut the place open, stole $800 from a tourist who came to Kyoto, and when we caught them, the money was just loaded into their own pockets.”
The journalist learned that in order to capture the two men, the plainclothes civilian police had followed him for an hour and had finally caught him at the time of his crime.
Two suspects are currently under police scrutiny.
The civilian police in plain clothes told journalists who was suspicious in the crowd, a problem that was simple for the civilian police.
“The more thieves are caught, the more their eyes, the more their look, the more they look at the ordinary passengers, the more they look at people’s pockets and backpacks, the more they like to drill into the crowds, the less they run away from them.”
The civilian police also told journalists that suspects often wait for vehicles that are not purposeful and that they prefer to wander at the station to follow after they find the object of the theft.
"These are the words of experience. You've been working in plain clothes for a long time. You'll see."
In addition, the civilian police warned that “the most convenient and easy to steal is to hide.”
Take care of your belongings while travelling in the car in case of theft.
On the 30th of September 30th of the China-China-New Network (Chang Linhu), an official message from the Ministry of Communication of the City Council of Toyoyo City of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region reported that three people had died as a result of the work of the Standing Committee of the China-China Central Flag Committee and the Minister of Public Information, Han Bai Yila.

According to the information received, the suspect in the incident, Han Pei-ella, had been held in criminal custody by the public security authorities in connection with the death or injury caused by the dangerous driving of alcohol, and the Monitoring Committee of the Tungyo City Disciplinary Committee had been involved in the investigation.
The incident is currently under further investigation.
On 1 October, journalists were informed by the Ministry of Public Security Transport Administration that, on the first day of the holiday, there had been a significant increase in traffic on roads and highways around major cities. At 1700 hours on that date, with the exception of a few nodes, traffic on highways and provincial roads had been generally smooth and orderly. No road traffic accident involving more than five people had been reported nationwide, and no accident involving more than three people had been reported in 29 provinces and districts.
During that morning, the traffic of roads and highways around major cities rose significantly, with local sections and nodes such as toll stations, service areas, bridges, tunnels, cross-interconnection, etc., leading to vehicle celebratory queuing at various levels, particularly in the areas of Kyaw Jin, Long Triangle, Pearl Triangle and Sengjin; traffic fell somewhat in the afternoon and road traffic resumed gradually.
It is known that, on the first day of the holiday, the National Traffic Police launched the holiday traffic security and combat service, committing more than 190,000 police officers, police vehicles and vehicles for a total of more than 70,000, with strict patrolling and control, strict control of the traffic, timely facilitation of traffic, rapid handling of accidents, wide dissemination of tips and instructions, and intensive efforts to ensure road safety on the first day of the holiday.

The British Prime Minister, Teresa May, called on his party on Sunday to unite in support of her European retreat and directly called on critics to support it, saying that the free trade agreement they wanted was at the heart of her European retreat.
On 30 September 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May, Birmingham, travelled to attend a Conservative Party meeting.
At the beginning of this exciting annual meeting of the Conservative Party, Teresa May's plan was once again criticized by two former cabinet ministers, including former Foreign Secretary Johnson, who described the plan of Teresa May as “wrong”.
But she also received strong support from other ministers who supported the retreat: “Tresa May is one of the most polite people”, and international trade ministers Fox and Foreign Secretary Hunt pointed their anger towards the EU.
Theresa May's fragile leadership has been further pressurized this month by the rejection by the European Union of part of the so-called “Chicks” plan.
However, Teresa May took a positive view of those consultations and stated that she was prepared to consider the doubts of the European Union.
"My message to my own political party is that let's work together to find the best deal for Britain," told Teresa May.
Former British Foreign Secretary Johnson called Tereza May’s plan “wrong” and criticized her for her lack of confidence in Europe’s retreat.
He and former British Secretary of State for Europe, Davis, are pushing for a Canadian-style trade agreement with the EU.
Teresa May, for his part, said that the proposal would enable Northern Ireland to implement different tariff provisions, in the form of a division of Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom.
Six years from now, it's a major organizational restructuring, and it's clear that there's no redundancies.
On 30 June, the Quinter announced the official launch of a new round of corporate strategic upgrades, a new round of optimization of the organizational structure after a six-year interval, with six restructurings based on the original seven enterprise clusters (BG), and stated that the restructuring did not involve downsizing.
It's a new six business groups.
Two new business groups emerged six years later.
It is understood that both the advantages and characteristics of the vertical field of deep-deep farming are preserved in the original enterprise development community (CDG), the interactive entertainment industry (IEG), the technological engineering industry (TEG), and the micro-credit industry (WXG); and the focus on the integration effect, with the creation of the new cloud and intelligence industry (CSIG), the platform and content industry (PCG).
Journalists noted the disappearance of the former mobile Internet community (MIG), the former Internet media community (OMG), and in particular the high visibility of OMG.
The message indicated that the newly created platform and content community (PCG, or Platform & Content Group) would be organically split and reconfigured in the former social networking community (SNG), the former mobile Internet enterprise (MIG), and the former Internet media community (OMG), with highly related and integrated plates such as social platforms, flow platforms, digital content, core technology, etc.
And the new CSIG, or Cloud and Smart Industries Group, will integrate industrial solutions such as cloud-telling, Internet+, intelligent retailing, education, health, safety, and LBS to drive the digital upgrading of the industry.
The President and Chief Executive Officer of the Tetsu Board of Directors said that the second half of the Internet was an industrial Internet, and that the first half provided high-quality services to users through connectivity, on the basis of which we would build a new, more open connection ecology between industry and consumers.
Responding to the rumour of “retrenchment”: clear non-retrenchment.
Following the release of the organizational restructuring, it was reported that the restructuring would involve downsizing.
The tether-related side said to the new Chinese web reporter, “It is clear that this organizational restructuring will not involve layoffs. We will fine-tune the business modules as a whole and then optimize them.”
Markron's promotion of France's legacy of "bread with sticks" and the protection of French technology - China's new network.
According to Reuters, European countries have successively made their own dietary claims. France has also recently planned to apply for stick bread to be included in the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage following the Belgian beer and the Naples pancakes in Italy.
According to the information received, the plan was promoted by the President of France, Markron, with the support of the French Confederation of Bread and Cooking Industries.
They pointed out that much of the loafed bread now sold was made out of mass-produced frozen noodles, which included materials other than flour, water, yeast and salt, and that the traditional bakeries were gradually becoming small and it was hoped that their listing would protect the world's well-known French crafts.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization will hold an annual meeting in Mauritius in late November to review the directory of intangible cultural heritage.
An illegal immigration boat in the Aegean Sea in Turkey sank and killed five people.
Xinhua Society, Istanbul, 30 September, reported by the Turkish media on 30 September that an inflated boat carrying illegal immigrants had poured over the same day in the Aegean Sea of Turkey, killing at least five people.
It was reported that the inflated vessel, which was scheduled to go to an island in Greece, sank on the same day near the Enez area of Edirne province, north-west Turkey, for unknown reasons.
At present, the number of illegal immigrants on sunk inflated ships is not known.
The search-and-rescue operations are continuing, as it is estimated that water-fallers remain trapped at sea.
The Aegean Sea was the preferred route for illegal immigrants to the European continent via Turkey.
Following the control of Turkey under the March 2016 agreement with the European Union, the number of people smuggled through this route has been significantly reduced.
However, since this year, there has been a rebound in the number of stowaways on this route.

Chinese tourists were beaten at Thai airport: the batterer was dismissed, the president of the airport was dismissed.
According to the headline news network in Thailand, the video of Chinese citizens being beaten at the Asian airport in Bangkok has attracted widespread attention in recent days.
At 2 p.m. local time, at 29 p.m., the director of the Thailand airport company Sunman Airport, Suringwa, made a statement and expressed his deep regret regarding the physical assault of tourists by airport security officers.
On the other hand, according to reports, the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, Baghen, attached great importance to the matter and had ordered the dismissal of the hit airport staff, as well as the general decommissioning of the airport.
The head of the airport administration stated that, at the time, the Chinese tourist was not satisfied that he had been refused entry and was unwilling to comply with the control and stay in the restricted area of the repatriation, and that there had been a push and physical confrontation with security personnel.
The security officer is currently suspended by the Airports Authority.
The incident has had an impact on Thailand's tourist image, and there has been a profound apology on the part of the Hong Kong airport. In order to try to make up for the damage, the next step will be to convey through the Chinese Embassy a deep apology to the Chinese visitor who was attacked.
Finally, the Managing Director of the airport, Sulinwa, said that a large number of Chinese tourists were still welcome to visit Thailand, and that more assistance and facilities had now been provided to Chinese visitors to Thailand, including the opening of special courtesy corridors for Chinese passports at the time of entry, 18 of which were open at Suvanapu airport, 21 at Sunman airport and 18 at Puji airport; 8 at Chiang Mai airport; and 10 for Chinese tourists at Chiang Mai airport.
The headline news network in Thailand was informed by the new Director-General of the Thai National Immigration Service and former Deputy Director-General of the Thai Tourism Police, Major-General Surache, that the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, Baghen, attached great importance to the matter, had ordered the dismissal of the hit airport staff and the abolition of the General Inspection of the Sunman Airport.
In recent years, this newspaper (internship journalist Li Xuan) has experienced numerous incidents of incompetence of the school's plastic runway.
To this end, the Ministry of Education has issued a circular requiring the implementation of the new national logo at the surface sports site for synthetic materials in primary and secondary schools to be delivered after 1 November this year.
The mandatory national standard, " Grounds for Polysynthetic Sports in Primary and Secondary Schools ", was organized by the Ministry of Education with the participation of 26 scientific institutes and testing agencies, and was revised over two years, during which more than 100 expert meetings were organized, as well as country-wide field visits, sampling tests and the collection of numerous testing experiments on hundreds of enterprise products on the market.
In contrast to the 2005 old national markers, journalists found that the new country marker not only changed from a “national recommended standard” to a “national mandatory standard”, but also added a number of elements, including thickness requirements, physical performance, age-resistant performance, inorganic filling content requirements, requirements for high concentration of anti-sliding granules, limits on harmful substances from surface finished products, and limits on harmful substances from non-solid and solid raw materials.
In particular, the new flag limits the amount of hazardous substances that may arise from the construction of plastic runways in schools, increasing from 7 to 18, and regulates the amount of volatile organic materials in the completed runways in accordance with domestic standards.
For example, the release of hazardous substances is specified in the `Restrictions and odour requirements for present and prefabricated surface products', requiring total volatile organic compounds to be no greater than 5 mg/m3, formaldehyde to be no greater than 0.4 mg/m3, carbon dioxide to be no greater than 7 mg/m3, benzene to be no greater than 0.1 mg/m3 and odour class no higher than 3.
The new logo also provides details on sampling requirements for plastic runways in primary and secondary schools, the rules for testing, the rules for determining them, etc.
In addition, for the first time, an artificial lawn on campus was included in the compulsory testing of national tenders.
In the near future, special work will be carried out on the implementation of the new national tender, which will be transmitted to the Department of Physical Health and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education during the course of the year.
In the afternoon of September 30th, the Chinese and new Internet customers will be playing “The Civil War” in the finals of the 2018 Women's World Cup.
At the end of the day, Hu Yu Ling, a friend of the team who was the winner of Master Tinning's main battle at 4:0 p.m., took the throne of the female World Cup four years later, which was the twenty-first time that the Chinese woman took the title.
Tinning and Yu Ling are teammates and friends, and both are familiar with each other's tactics.
Both sides followed each other, whether in preparation for war or before the race.
On entering the finals, the two of them indicated that they had completed the campaign without meeting each other.
But the match between Tinning and Jo Yu Ling in the game is a sight of swords.
In the first round, the winner of the tournament, Tinning, leads by 3:1, and then Jo Yu Ling, through Tinning's error, returns to a three-square score.
Then Jo Yu Ling's mistakes in the attack began to increase, and Tinning seized the opportunity to take the lead by a score of 9:5 and to take the lead at 10:6.
Even though Chu Yu Ling pursued three points, Tinning took the first round at 11:9.
In the second round, Zhu Yuling's failures remain high, with Tinning taking the lead from 6:1 to take advantage of the dominant position in each other.
During the lag of 2:7, Hu Yu Ling achieved two points by a change of rhythm, and then pursued the score at 8:9 using the attack.
At a critical time, Tinning won two points at 11:8.
In the third round, the two began with a sharper bite of 3:3 flat.
Tinning then lost three points by mistake in the attack, but she then hit three points by sharpness, which would have been six points.
Hu Yu Ling's two-point line re-created the advantage and took the lead at 10:8.
But Dinning was extremely aggressive, with a four-point line and a third round at 12:10.
In the fourth round, Hu Yu Ling's 4:2 lead.
But since then, Tinning has demonstrated a super-intrusive state of attack, with a four-point hiatus and a four-point hiatus.
After the suspension, Yuling was able to recover some of her condition and gradually achieve a score of 8:8 p.m.
At this critical moment, Tinning is not soft enough to score two points to get to the point.
As Jo Yu Ling returns to the field, Dining sweeps the opponent to the crown at 4:0.
Last month, Tinning came to Chengdu with the crown of her 14-month-old champion in the Bulgarian public race, despite her saying that she had not set a goal for this race before the race, and in the semi-finals, which ended this morning, Tinning said that she had completed her mission.
In the end, Tinning won his teammate Joo Yu Ling and won the personal third World Cup champion, and she was satisfied with her performance: “A champion is important to every athlete.
Before the race, I didn't think of it, but I said, "One fight, and the finals are still quite satisfactory."
“I think I can handle the pressure in the whole race, and today Tinning is doing a great job, causing herself to never find the rhythm.”
Activating rural consumption depends on regularization mechanisms to clean up markets, guide demand for healthy consumption and enhance farmers'sense of access to consumption.
The data show that the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released, with retail sales of consumer goods increasing 10.5 per cent in rural areas in the first half of the year, at an increase of 1.3 percentage points higher than in urban areas.
In a poor village in one of the western districts, the village had only one convenience store, and some goods appeared familiar, “Golden Dragonfish” was marked as “Golden Dragon Oil”, “Wanty” became “Mother Milk” and “Mounty” commodities were numerous.
Over the years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed, and some rural pseudo-goods brands with similar names, similar packagings, and disinformation have been inexorable.
A consumption survey published by a municipality in the west showed that rural traders had a serious problem with over-false goods, with 66 per cent of users buying fake goods at the sub-town supermarkets, of which more than half were food products.
Why is it that Li Chi continues to fight every year when the authorities are trying to control the rural market?
Unlike urban markets, farmers are less aware of their rights, coupled with the remoteness of many rural areas and the lack of regulatory literacy, which gives fertile ground to counterfeit commodities.
A commodity has many headlines, some sectorally regulated prices, some managed production, some managed markets, cross-functionalities, annual vacations, centralized management, and the counterfeits have sprung up again, just after the old vacations and new ones.
The lack of long-standing regulatory mechanisms, the impurity of rural markets, the low cost of breaking the law and the high level of profit have led some outlaws to become “downhill” and some rural areas to become “dismantling markets”.
From subsistence to welfare, large numbers of farmers are moving towards developmental consumption.
Today, the Party’s central government and the State Council have issued a number of opinions on improving the institutional mechanisms for promoting consumption that further boost the consumer potential of the population, in which it is proposed to promote the upgrading of the rural population’s consumption ladder, with the aim of making the farmers “capable to consume” “willing to consume” and making rural consumption truly viable.
On the one hand, there is a need to deepen reforms to eliminate the many regulatory and multi-managerial problems of market regulation, to improve food safety and product quality monitoring networks, and to continuously reduce the space available in rural areas for counterfeiting and selling.
On the other hand, greater enforcement and regulation of “fine veins” must not be allowed to spread in rural areas under false pretences.
Heavy punishment of farmers should not be used as a justification for the creation of false goods, regardless of the extent to which counterfeiters are hidden. The authorities concerned should clarify their responsibilities, the low level of supervision, and any link that is problematic must be held accountable and the counterfeiters and sellers should have no place to hide.
Market access has been strictly closed, producers have been subjected to rigorous qualification, markets have been closed, products have been brought to the fore, roads have been cleared, sources and roots have been found, and legitimate distributors have been reassured and farmers have been reassured.
Activation of rural consumption, leading to healthy consumption demand.
As consumption rises, many farmers not only seek to feed well, eat well, but also to live a high quality of life, such as culture and health. Rural markets cannot be equated with “low-quality” “low-cost” paintings.
This requires promoting the extension of e-commerce to rural areas, providing access to rural and urban two-way distribution channels, facilitating the integration of off-line industrial development platforms and on-line power trading platforms, and supporting the expansion of new patterns of consumption to rural markets; promoting the organic integration of commercial and trade logistics with recreational agriculture, rural tourism and product processing in well-equipped townships; and improving the modern rural circulation network system, optimizing the integration of stock facilities resources and effectively reducing rural circulation costs.
The creation of a clear and secure market environment for the rural sector, which makes it difficult for farmers to consume more and more, enhances farmers'sense of access and well-being.
With the reduction of some MFN rates for commodities from 1 November, the total tariff level will fall to 7.5 per cent.
In accordance with the decision of the 26th Standing Meeting of the State Council, the State Council Committee on Customs and Excise issued a circular on 30 November 2018, which reduced the most-favoured-nation (MFN) rates for some commodities as of 1 November 2018.
Pursuant to the State Council's Customs and Excise Commission's Proclamation on the Reduction of Tariffs on Imports of Selected Goods, and in order to accommodate the needs of industrial upgrading, lower business costs and meet the multi-level consumption of the population, the MFN rate for some goods, including industrial goods, was reduced as of 1 November this year.
The average tax rate fell from 10.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent, with an average reduction of 26 per cent.
This tax reduction mainly covers textiles; stone, ceramic and glass products; parts of iron and steel and base metal products; mechanical and electrical equipment and parts such as metalworking machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, electrical transmission equipment, instrumentation, etc.; and resource commodities and primary processes such as non-metal mines, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, precious stones, etc.
At the same time, as the overall level of tariffs, particularly on pharmaceuticals and imports of daily consumer goods, has been reduced, the tariff lines of import duties on imported goods have been reduced accordingly.
As a follow-up to the decision-making deployment of the Party's Central and State Council, the country introduced zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported medicines on 1 May this year, reduced import tariffs on cars and spare parts and part-time consumer goods on 1 July, and implemented an information technology agreement extending the third step of tariff reduction for products.
Journalists have learned from the Customs and Excise Committee of the State Council that, since this year, the overall level of our customs duties has been reduced by an average of 23 per cent, from 9.8 per cent in the previous year to 7.5 per cent, following successive autonomous adjustments.
Appropriate tariff reductions would facilitate balanced development of foreign trade and higher levels of openness to the outside world, as well as the integration of both domestic and international resources into domestic supply-side structural reforms.
The relevant officials of the Committee stated that this year marks the fortieth anniversary of the opening up of the reform, and that the initiative to reduce the overall level of tariffs is a practical step in keeping with the spirit of the important speech of Secretary-General Xi Jinping at the Boaing Forum for Asia, as well as an important step for our country to further expand its openness and its proactive expansion of imports in accordance with its own high-quality development needs. This action and initiatives demonstrate China's commitment to pursuing a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy and, at the same time, to make China's development more beneficial to the world.
On 29 September, the launch of the regional public brand of “Girls” agricultural products was held in Nankai District, Tianjin City, Gansu province.
The Red Army Xiaomei, Black Bean, Mountain Children's Peaks, Black Hills, Pocket Tea, Paper Scissors, Pure Handicraft slippers... a piece of finely packaged agricultural produce placed on the exhibition stage, with a common brand name called the "Calling Country Man".
“Build a regional brand of the “Close Country” effectively solves the development bottlenecks of the “multiple scattered, small, and weak” roundabout agricultural products, and becomes a powerful vehicle for poverty eradication.” On 29th, the regional public branding of the “Close Country” agricultural products, hosted by Gansu Quan Quantsu, will be held in Nankai, Tianjin.
It is located at the border of the three provinces of Kaning, China, as the “advanced counties of the nation's food production”, “China's small groceries”, and has a long history and a wealth of resources.
Snacks such as lamb meat, yellow wine, pasta, tender oatmeal are often reminiscent of swimmers in other parts of the country.
As China's urbanization has increased, the urban population has grown rapidly, and a large number of young rural people have left their homes to begin urban life.
China’s agricultural brand research expert Yang Xiaojia said: “Cities are now fast and under stress, and more and more people are beginning to miss the country as a child, but, ‘The home country is the home country, the most beautiful memory is the village’, and the ‘Close Country’ brand was designed to be named after the country’s folks and the country’s sorrows.”
The surrounding subdistricts have special climatic conditions, with long daylight periods, very poor day and night temperatures and unique conditions for the cultivation of small groceries.
There are more than 20 small-scale groceries in China, the largest producer of small groceries and the highest quality in the country.
Wang Xiaoli, a local girl who attended school in Tianjin, attended the presentation as a volunteer, saying: “The natives are the closest to home, the natives smell the best, the ‘circles’ brand brings back so much of our sorrows, memories, and still more of our food there, hoping that the ‘circles’ brand will move further away and do more.”
Dr. Tam Bin, a researcher at the Scientific Research Institute of the National Food and Material Reserve, said that by testing more than 900 sets of indicators, all tests of agricultural products such as wheat, bitter and black beans in the surrounding districts were superior, many of the physico-active material content of the groceries was higher than the standard data, and that “circles” had an inherent advantage in taking over the country's high-end markets for groceries.
The District Committee Secretary, Chai Chun, said that the publication of the “Circle Country” brand would further enhance the quality, standardization, scale and innovative level of development of high-quality agricultural products in the Rim County, contribute to the overall image of the ring's agricultural products and rapidly increase visibility, competitiveness and value addition.
In July, Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.2 per cent over the previous month, a higher than expected increase, and the market’s expectation that interest rates from the Central Bank of Canada would rise next month.
If the interest rate really rises, it will be the fifth increase in the central bank's interest rate in a little more than a year.
The analyst for the Reuters interview had previously estimated an increase of 0.1 per cent.
According to Statistics Canada, on Friday, 12 of the 20 industries registered growth.
This data is noteworthy because the Central Bank anticipated earlier this month that temporary factors might drag on the third quarter of GDP data.
The Governor of the Central Bank of Canada, Poloze, promised on Thursday that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates gradually and would pay close attention to economic data.
The next announcement of interest rates by the Central Bank of Canada will take place on 24 October.
As a result of the strengthening of the Canadian economy and the close to record low unemployment rate, the Central Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at the macro level, said that the country's GDP ring growth in the third quarter of the economy was expected to be around 2 per cent per annum.
“This would be more than the 1.5% expected by the Central Bank of Canada, and would therefore be another reason to expect the Bank to raise interest rates next month,” he said in a report.
The overnight index exchange shows that the market forecast for the BCC rate of increase in October rose from 76.46 per cent to 78.27 per cent.
For the first time in 65 years, the Koreans jointly visited the Han River to the sea.
The Korean Ministry of Defence confirmed that on that day it had launched a joint mission to Hanjiang and Pinjin River into the waters of the mouth of the sea.
The initiative is an advance preparation to guarantee the free navigation of civilian vessels on both sides.
A circular from the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea to the media on the same day indicated that this was the first joint visit of the two sides to the Han River to the mouth of the sea since the Korean War Armistice Agreement of 1953.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea signed a military agreement in September this year to undertake a joint study of the Han River into waters such as the mouth of the sea, starting in November, in order to guarantee the future environmental protection of the waters and the development of tourism.
In October, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea planned a joint study of the waters at a general level.
The joint Korean-Korean water expedition was officially launched on 5 November.
The joint mission consisted of 20 Korean and Korean military personnel, experts and others.
According to the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea, neither side carried weapons during the mission and was prohibited from provoking each other's words and actions.
“As there is no military demarcation line near the estuary, the area was an unexpectedly high point, but through joint visits it will become a new zone of peace in the future.”
The total length of the joint Korean-Korean expedition was about 70 kilometres, with a total area of about 280 square kilometres.
The Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea stated that it would send six cruise ships to detect seawater depths, etc., to provide basic information for safe navigation in the waters; pending the completion of the investigation, it would provide navigational maps for the movement of civilian vessels.
In October 2007, a summit meeting was held in Pyongyang to reach an agreement on the joint use of the rivers of Han and Pingjin to the sea, but the subsequent negotiations were stalled by the tense situation on the peninsula.
In accordance with the military agreement signed by the Koreans in September, future vessels from both sides are required to inform each other in advance of the voyage in common waters.
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia on 4 November, Chinese citizens Guo Yucsing and Mao Yuseng lost contact during their tour in Mong.
It is understood that the two were members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team and that on 19 October, they contacted their relatives and friends in the country, said that they were about to explore in the mountains near Lake Kusuguor and shared their positions through micromails, and that they had since lost contact and appeared to have gone to the no-man's area.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and security of Chinese citizens in Mongolia and to consular protection and assistance.
Upon being informed of the loss of contact between the two visitors, the Embassy launched an emergency insurance plan and tried to seize the time of the gold rescue and to work at full capacity.
The Embassy maintained close communication with the families of the persons concerned, assisted them in immediately reporting the incident to the police and provided them with a translation list for their choice.
The Embassy met with the heads of the Ministry of External Relations, the Directorate-General of Police and the Directorate-General of Emergency Situations of Mongolia at the first opportunity to inform them of the situation and to request that the search and rescue be carried out as soon as possible and that close communication be maintained with the latter throughout the search and rescue process to ensure that the latest developments are kept up to date.
At the same time, the Embassy assisted the family in issuing a search notice at Monwau and widely mobilized the active participation of Chinese and Chinese companies in the search, providing effective leads and providing assistance to a number of blue-sky rescue teams who were travelling to the city to assist in the rescue.
As a result of the Embassy's vigorous efforts, the first rescue team was dispatched by Mon Fung and promised a waiver of the search and rescue costs.
The General Directorate of Police and the General Directorate of Emergency Situations instructed the police and the Emergency Department in Kusguor province to do their utmost to search and rescue.
Owing to the fact that Lake Kusukuur is located in the northern part of Mongolia at the border with Russia, is remote, very remote, sparsely populated and extremely inaccessible to transport and communications, and that Mongolia is now entering a severe winter with a temperature of about 20 degrees below zero, the local police and emergency services have overcome enormous difficulties by mobilizing almost all police forces and mobilizing local pastoralists to carry out extensive day-to-day carpet search and rescue operations around their lost positions, including by riding horses, walking and visiting herders.
At the same time, with regard to the special situation of pastoralist areas, Monfon has for many days been conducting circulars on radio.
Staff from the National Blue Sky Rescue Team have also been actively involved in the rescue, together with Monfon.
The safety and well-being of the two missing persons has always held our hearts.
So far, more than a decade has passed since the two were lost, the Embassy has received a number of leads, but no two have been found, and search and rescue operations are still under stress.
The Embassy will continue to follow the matter on a “people-centred” basis, to promote the continuation of full search and rescue efforts and to provide maximum assistance to the families of the persons concerned.
The Embassy appealed to Chinese compatriots and enterprises to contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia for the first time if they were informed of any relevant leads.
